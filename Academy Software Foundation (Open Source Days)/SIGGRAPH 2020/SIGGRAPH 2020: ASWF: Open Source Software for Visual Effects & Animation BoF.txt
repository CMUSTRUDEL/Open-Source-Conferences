                                um where does it come from um many of                                 you i'm sure have followed our progress                                 and you're aware of the                                 history for those of you who are just                                 coming to                                 be in touch with the foundation here's a                                 quick recap a quick timeline of our                                 progress                                 um the foundation came out of an                                 investigation                                 that took place at the academy sci tech                                 council for about two years                                 and an investigation that was focused                                 on the role of open source software in                                 the motion picture industry                                 and the conclusion was to create an                                 organization that would help                                 develop open source further and                                 in august                                                           the foundation was created by this group                                 of companies                                 that you see there are founding members

  project openvdb that was gifted to the                                 foundation                                 by dreamworks animation which is the                                 process by which a project                                 comes to the foundation it has to be                                 given                                 to the foundation by the company that

    and that's one of the many things that                                 the foundation                                 brought to the open source ecosystem                                 is a foundation in terms of dollars                                 and the ability to invest in the                                 ecosystem                                 we reached that milestone just

provide a neutral forum a                                 continuous integration                                 building infrastructure so that we can                                 share                                 open source build configuration so that                                 the participation in open source project                                 is clear on how to do that and we also                                 provide a more consistent licensing for                                 the industry all                                 items to facilitate the development and                                 adoption of open source software                                 open source software in our industry                                 there's a lot                                 of software in libraries we have put                                 together a landscape                                 on our website um and you can find it at                                 aswf.io this is an interactive landscape                                 where you can                                 explore all of these various open source                                 software that are used                                 in our industry and find out more about                                 them                                 so we specifically have six projects in                                 the foundations that have been                                 gifted to the foundation this is the                                 structure                                 the heart of the foundation is the                                 technical advisory council                                 this is where the engineers are the                                 people who are                                 writing the code for open source                                 projects they are the one who make all                                 the important decision                                 about what to do and how to drive the                                 development                                 the governing board and the outreach                                 committee are there to serve the tech                                 and and clear the way for them and the                                 tech                                 is building on the continuous                                 integration platform                                 that all of our project is now based on                                 and i want to uh introduce next for the                                 next segment of our presentation                                 danielle eckenberg who's the uh                                 the chair of our technical advisory                                 council                                 danielle thank you david and                                 great to have so many people here uh                                 taking an interest                                 in the progress of the foundation and                                 its projects over the last year                                 so as uh david alluded it's been a very                                 challenging time for all of us                                 and indeed for all of the                                 work that happens within our industry                                 and within our projects                                 i'm very happy to say that i think that                                 uh                                 our projects have done very well                                 throughout this period in fact uh                                 all of our participants have shown a                                 real resilience                                 um throughout this time and i'd like to                                 think that indeed                                 uh that is in part uh a sign                                 of um some of the strengths and                                 robustness of the open source process as                                 well and some                                 and those things that the foundation has                                 been able to uh really provide in terms                                 of                                 accessibility of resources and breadth                                 of participation in                                 all of our projects david next slide                                 please                                 so of course the real work of the                                 foundation is                                 in and around our projects and over                                 the lifetime of the foundation we've                                 been able to grow to these                                 six very strong and active projects                                 which represent                                 a diversity of participation the                                 diversity of backgrounds you'll see that                                 we've had projects contributed from a                                 number of                                 uh different industry                                 backgrounds and indeed projects which                                 actually serve a number of different                                 parts of our                                 you know our workflow and our problem                                 space                                 i won't speak too much about each of                                 those individual projects because                                 uh we'll be going into a lot more detail                                 throughout the rest of this session                                 and of course we have a follow-up                                 session where each of the projects will                                 themselves be able to speak                                 about their activity in recent                                 times and of course looking ahead to the                                 future                                 so a little bit more about uh the tact                                 then and what it means to be involved                                 uh within the tactic itself um                                 like all of our uh projects um                                 participation in the tac                                 and the processes of the tac are open                                 and we encourage involvement of                                 participation from both members of the                                 foundation                                 but also the broader community the tack                                 itself                                 looks to provide a space for projects to                                 communicate across each other and indeed                                 to gather participation from other                                 interested parties                                 we take on challenges like trying to                                 agree                                 on best practices on forging ahead in                                 areas which                                 affect all of our projects or perhaps                                 affect all of our industry and                                 participants but aren't yet part of a                                 project and we'll look at                                 the working group model which has been                                 something that we've been                                 really actively increasing over the last                                 year                                 as a mode for us to actually harness                                 energies                                 beyond and outside our individual                                 projects                                 one big area of course as well is to                                 work on                                 the process of making it easier for                                 developers                                 to engage with the industry and with our                                 projects that's something you'll hear a                                 lot more about from                                 our dni working group as well coming up                                 after my session                                 section so next slide please                                 so looking at how this relates in                                 specific terms                                 obviously we are very happy to be able                                 to draw on the research                                 resources and advice and guidance of our                                 governing board                                 which is chaired by rob and                                 of course also the support of the linux                                 foundation                                 who provide lots of experience from                                 other                                 open source projects and endeavors some                                 of the key processes that would really                                 sought                                 to bring consistency and                                 ease of access and reliability of access                                 are of course in uh some of the not only                                 the technical processes we'll hear about                                 the ci system for example as an example                                 as a good example of that but also                                 things like our                                 licensing and developer                                 contribution processes and i think we                                 have a slide about that in a moment just                                 to give an example of what that means                                 one of the things that we've really                                 sought to do is to                                 minimize the diversity of                                 contribution processes and licenses so                                 in most areas of course diversity is a                                 very good thing and we                                 hope to encourage it in this case we've                                 had                                 historically a little bit of a zoo of                                 slight variations on licenses and                                 contribution processes                                 and this is an area where we've worked                                 very hard with all of our                                 entities and of course the experience of                                 linux foundation to try and bring that                                 number down                                 to a minimum quantity um taking                                 both projects that have long history                                 like open vdb and ipxr                                 and also new projects um or relatively                                 new projects                                 into a much smaller set of licenses we                                 have a                                 recommended license which is essentially                                 the apache                                                            and we've moved through a couple of                                 iterations                                 of streamlining our contributor license                                 agreement processes so                                 with both a short form process and more                                 recently                                 conforming around the slight                                 uh what's the word slightly specified in                                 terms of being appropriate to our                                 projects                                 uh variant of the apache ii cla to                                 manage contribution licenses                                 so coming back to look at what our                                 working group model                                 actually looks like essentially working                                 groups are                                 well-defined                                 umbrellas for us to uh focus on a                                 particular area                                 in some cases those uh that activity                                 might be                                 long running in this in the interest of                                 our projects and the primary example of                                 that is our ci working group which                                 was set up to firstly establish but now                                 to maintain and extend the continuous                                 integration infrastructure that we                                 that we in our projects use and indeed                                 has has                                 taken on a life outside of our projects                                 too which i'm very happy to see                                 um and in other cases to try and                                 target perhaps more shorter term and                                 well-defined                                 challenges facing our projects in our                                 industry and a                                 good example of that is of course the                                 python                                                 which uh uses the um                                 space and the resources of the                                 foundation to provide a space for our uh                                 for our industry to actually collaborate                                 across vendors and across                                 studios uh to look at the specific                                 challenges of                                 transitioning from python                                               which has                                 been a big endeavor that many of us have                                 been active on                                 for the past year another good example                                 is our usd working group which                                 is uh providing a space alongside of                                 course all of pixar's efforts with usd                                 uh to continue uh to support                                 usd and its broader adoption within the                                 industry                                 so back into a little bit more detail                                 about the ci working group                                 and so for each of these i'll flash up a                                 quick slide which                                 uh lists essentially the goals of the                                 working group and                                 i've we have a number of points of                                 contact but i've highlighted the slack                                 channels within the aswf slack which i                                 encourage anyone who's interested to                                 be involved or follow along with we've                                 got great activity and                                 engagement in all of those channels now                                 and they're a very nice complement to                                 our other regular meeting processes and                                 repository based                                 collaboration mechanisms so the ci                                 working group                                 has allowed us to bring together                                 expertise from                                 our projects from uh developers um                                 associated with our                                 uh member companies and beyond and of                                 course                                 some of our key foundation members who                                 are responsible for                                 uh the software packages and some of the                                 infrastructure we might use                                 and in order to provide a modern                                 and open source                                 compatible ci infrastructure outside of                                 any of the individual facilities where                                 our projects grew up                                 i have a slide in a moment which shows                                 uh how this infrastructure has evolved                                 we've moved from a number of different                                 models starting out with                                 a jenkins-based approach to this                                 configuration which is much more uh                                 employing sort of current and modern                                 software as the service components and                                 fits very nicely                                 into the github ecosystem one example of                                 that was                                 that we migrated from azure pipelines to                                 github actions for a very unified                                 ci process support within github which                                 is where our projects                                 are all hosted and one very nice thing                                 about this process                                 is that it allows for all of these                                 pieces to be very                                 uh easily seen they're all accessible                                 and open                                 and uh reapplied either to                                 personal forks as far as part of the                                 contribution process to our projects                                 or indeed to other projects where                                 they're suitable                                 i'll draw particular attention to our                                 use of docker                                 where for the linux platform we've been                                 able to                                 take the version specifications and                                 configurations                                 which uh the vfx reference platform                                 uh defines and actually turn those into                                 concrete example recipes which can be                                 used directly by our projects and indeed                                 any other projects that uh                                 choose to draw upon those docker images                                 um and we've                                 also been able to use you know moving                                 head into the future                                 those uh docker recipes as um                                 vfx reference platform configurations                                 for the future so                                 uh it's been a nice opportunity for us                                 to take the prospective                                 uh specifications and actually run them                                 through with our projects and with other                                 parts of the community ahead of their                                 formalization                                 so moving ahead                                 so i gave a quick introduction to the                                 python                                                 this has been an effort chaired by                                 ashley wetter from dean egg and um has                                 been a very nice complement to some of                                 the other efforts across the community                                 to really understand what it means for                                 our process to take this big step ahead                                 not only in terms of the way that our                                 vendors                                 provide their dccs and other software                                 but also how we actually go about                                 changing                                 some of the lower level libraries and of                                 course all of our                                 internal studio code the

         different                                 units that would otherwise be very much                                 separated and not necessarily have                                 an obvious forum for communication                                 once again i encourage you to check in                                 to the slack channel there                                 for updates

                             interesting extensions happening there                                 which i see as great                                 examples of the strengths of the                                 foundation and its and its efforts                                 so uh one thread of activity has been to                                 actually                                 um build live uh                                 jupiter notebooks which um allow for uh                                 allow for usd examples to be run in                                 browser um with                                 live python and with even with graphical                                 outputs                                 that's using the sort of whole stack of                                 technologies there the wiki                                 and usd running live on top of the aswf                                 docker images which were developed for                                 our ci infrastructure                                 so it's a neat example those examples                                 aren't actually                                 live in the wiki yet but if you check in                                 on the slack channel you'll be able to                                 see the work in progress coming along                                 very nicely there                                 so that's a perfect hook for us to                                 move over to hear about the activities                                 of the diversity and working                                 the conclusion working group                                 hey everyone i'm rachel rose as david                                 mentioned

                                also a co-chair for the diversity and                                 inclusion working group                                 so i'm really excited to tell everyone a                                 little bit about what we've been doing                                 to get this working group started so if                                 you could go to the next slide david                                 so um back in june the aswf formed the                                 diversity inclusion working group now                                 this working group is                                 very much a collaborative effort to try                                 to advance                                 diversity inclusion within the open                                 source                                 community and in particular the open                                 source community for vfx and animation                                 this is a obviously a very important                                 topic and something that many of us feel                                 very strongly about um trying to move                                 forward um                                 so we're really excited that uh the                                 academy software foundation is really                                 getting behind this                                 and uh trying to make a huge difference                                 and now this working group                                 is is being formed as a community of                                 many different types of people it                                 includes people from                                 a broad spectrum of different parts of                                 the open source community and the vfx                                 and animation industries                                 um both you know engineers who know open                                 source software very well                                 as well as others who may not know it                                 quite as well but are very interested                                 in trying to tackle this specific                                 problem                                 um we will talk more about this later at                                 the end of the presentation but we are                                 very very interested in continuing to                                 have                                 more and more people involved in this                                 process                                 i think you know one of the main ways                                 that you can tackle diversity and                                 inclusion is by having a very diverse                                 and inclusive group to try to                                 drive forward that initiative um so                                 we're really excited to have this um                                 pulled together now                                 so far over the last three months that                                 we have been working the primary thing                                 that we have been doing is trying to put                                 together                                 a series of a set of goals that the                                 working group can be working towards                                 that will take us into the future so                                 these are supposed to be goals that we                                 can be                                 tar using for a number of years um not                                 just                                 in the immediate time frame so for uh                                 the bulk of the rest of the presentation                                 myself and then carol payne my my                                 co-chair um we'll be going over the                                 three goals that we formed as well as                                 um two initiatives under each of the                                 goals that we've decided to                                 start start with as initial initiatives                                 for those goals                                 so if we can go to the next slide david                                 okay so um                                 goal number one is really around student                                 education                                 uh we we it became very apparent                                 through our working group conversations                                 as well as                                 a survey that we sent out to our members                                 that                                 um that being able to uh                                 engage young young young young adults in                                 particular                                 in open source and be able to excite                                 them with motion picture and media                                 industries                                 would be a really great way to start                                 bringing in                                 a variety of different people into open                                 source for                                 the effects and animation that might not                                 have gotten involved before                                 so our first goal really is to encourage                                 high school and college students to                                 pursue a career in                                 or participate in open source projects                                 by educating them                                 on uses in motion picture and media                                 industries                                 to start to tackle this goal the first                                 two initiatives that we are                                 trying to drive forward actively now are                                 to first put in place a mentorship                                 program that's going to be targeted at                                 high school and college-age                                 students we'll be looking for partners                                 at university and colleges in order to                                 drive this forward and we we have a                                 couple of ideas about how to                                 to get this started but we feel like                                 this is very                                 important mentorship has shown to be a                                 great way to                                 to increase diversity and is something                                 that                                 we we hope we can especially with all                                 the resources of the academy software                                 foundation and all of the amazing                                 members we feel like we have a large                                 group of people that will be able to be                                 actively involved in helping high school                                 and college age students learn more                                 about open source vfx and animation                                 uh the second initiative that we're                                 going to try to                                 push that we are going to push forward                                 for diversity                                 um oops if we go back one more sorry                                 for the the student education is uh that                                 we'd like to                                 partner with external organizations that                                 promote coding and underrepresented                                 populations including open source um and                                 inspiring introducing open source to                                 these people and inspiring                                 through example this is something that                                 you know there are a number of                                 organizations                                 worldwide that have relationships with                                 uh underrepresented populations and if                                 we can work with those                                 organizations and bring our member                                 projects to those organizations we think                                 that we can                                 have a really great effect on diversity                                 um i'm now going to go on to                                 goal two and pass this off to carol                                 who will cover the next two goals                                 awesome thanks rachel                                 uh yeah like everybody said thanks for                                 all the involvement in the chat and                                 and hopefully we'll be able to get to as                                 many questions as we can but                                 until then um the second goal that we                                 would like to talk about                                 is one that uh so we're talking about                                 external goals and educating the                                 community at large and students and                                 people who want to learn                                 it's also really important to look                                 internally at the aswf                                 um and also by extension the vfx and                                 animation communities                                 about what it means to be inclusive and                                 to be                                 diverse and so our second goal is around                                 diversity in the academy software                                 foundation itself                                 looking at the leadership and membership                                 across the foundation                                 and defining what inclusiveness and                                 diversity looks like                                 for the aswf so we're going to be                                 working                                 with our working group members and the                                 rest of the                                 aswf leadership to define what that                                 looks like                                 and that's the first goal that bullet                                 point there                                 the second one for diversity in aswf is                                 really getting a solid connection                                 between the working groups                                 and our individual member projects and                                 so we're thinking about                                 how we could accomplish that and that                                 looks like an actual uh                                 diversity of inclusion ambassador is                                 what we're calling them                                 that is integrated into each of our                                 member projects                                 that we talked about before and and is                                 really focused on                                 working with the projects to help                                 achieve our diversity inclusion goals                                 um things like inviting and inclusive                                 language                                 um and then also looking at how easy it                                 is to get involved                                 in the projects if you're just first                                 starting out things like good first                                 issues and                                 really good documentation and um                                 the list goes list goes on and on around                                 what we can what we can do                                 with uh our diversity inclusion                                 ambassador who would also then be                                 working                                 with our working group to make sure that                                 we're staying on track and following the                                 goals                                 and being consistent across the board                                 so that's goal number two and the third                                 goal                                 is a little bit of a mix of both                                 internal                                 and external and we're calling it                                 guidance for members                                 and everybody like rachel mentioned is                                 is really feeling the importance of this                                 work and this time and and for the                                 future and for the success of our                                 organization                                 and there's tons of good resources out                                 there                                 already on uh inclusion and diversity                                 topics                                 and and so our third goal is to                                 resource those both uh in terms of blog                                 posts                                 on uh dni topics and those will be                                 written at first by                                 members of the working group and members                                 of the projects and                                 sourcing a lot of information that                                 already exists within our member base                                 but eventually extending that program to                                 to                                 other people who would like to write and                                 have you know                                 great information to share in this area                                 we already have a blog aswf that emily                                 does a great job of running and we're                                 looking to                                 just grow and expand that and make it a                                 real resource for people                                 in addition to that we're looking to                                 make a real landing page so each project                                 has a landing page and a resource                                 and things like that we're looking to                                 make a similar thing                                 for diversity inclusion resources for                                 open source software                                 building on some of the great tools that                                 the linux foundation already has                                 it is there for us to utilize and really                                 make a space                                 for people that are curious and want to                                 learn more                                 and want to take things back to their                                 own organizations own companies own                                 schools                                 all of these things and you know just                                 build on the resources that everybody                                 has                                 so those are our main three goals that                                 we've set up in our                                 in our charter and um you know we're                                 we're                                 really just getting started so we're                                 looking for everybody to get                                 involved and have an opinion and tell us                                 what they think                                 if we're going the right direction if                                 we're missing anything                                 these things are fluid and always                                 changing so                                 um the last slide that we have for you                                 today is how to get involved                                 um and there's two real ways                                 um we have our mailing list that uh                                 is through email or you know online and                                 then we have our slack channel which                                 tends to be the most active way to get a                                 hold of us                                 but through the mailing list um you can                                 sign up uh                                 to receive uh notifications about our                                 meetings which happen monthly                                 um and we'll be looking to to you know                                 change those and adapt those based on                                 our member group and we really want to                                 be                                 um global about this too                                 so these meetings right now are you know                                 in the middle of the day                                 uh us time but obviously if you want to                                 get involved we can you know there's                                 lots of different ways we can look                                 to do that and increase involvement                                 globally for around the world because                                 i say we've got a lot of people from                                 everywhere on the call today and that's                                 really really exciting                                 so yeah jump on the slack jump on the                                 mailing list talk to rachel or i will be                                 happy to answer any and all questions                                 you guys have                                 and that's it for me thanks everybody                                 thank you so much rachel and carol um                                 it's an exciting                                 initiative to be pushing forward and                                 seeing already interest in progress i                                 was watching on the chat as people are                                 getting interested in getting involved                                  this is a way i think as a organization                                  outside of any one of our individual                                  businesses that are contributing                                  we can actually be more powerful                                  together than we ever could                                  individually right there's nothing                                  proprietary about our diversity and                                  inclusion initiatives we all want to                                  share our best findings                                  and we all want more engineers who are                                  from a broader variety of backgrounds to                                  help us do this work people who are                                  passionate about movies                                  people who are passionate about                                  engineering people may not even realize                                  that it's possible to work on these                                  projects                                  and to contribute to the way movies look                                  by writing software                                  and creating pixels behind the scenes                                  but all of the movies are affected by                                  this so                                  any one of your students if you're a                                  teacher or if you are a student                                  if you have an interest in engineering                                  or technical documentation                                  or even just testing applications jump                                  in on one of these projects take a look                                  you might be able to contribute to                                  something that is used directly in one                                  of these films openexr for example                                  is used on pretty much every image made                                  in the movie business today                                  so we're excited to be here in the                                  academy software foundation accelerating                                  developments in these areas in fact                                  let's just dive into these projects to                                  see                                  um the kind of progress and the kind of                                  acceleration that has happened in this                                  last year                                  if you look at openddb the very first                                  project brought into the academy                                  over                                                                   that seems                                  amazing there is a whole bunch of                                  exciting stuff going on in openvp in                                  terms of acceleration                                  and you can see this is from a group a                                  um                                  a number of committers not just one                                  person not even just a single person                                  from a single company                                  anymore even though it started all at                                  dreamworks so it's very exciting to see                                  this kind of progress at openvdb                                  the next project is opencolorio and this                                  is a really great story because                                  opencolorio has been an important part                                  of managing color                                  in the movie business for the last                                  several years but interestingly                                  opencolorio had slowed down in its                                  development because some of the original                                  creators of the project had gone on and                                  actually changed industries                                  so when it was adopted into the academy                                  software foundation                                  it was still widely used but it wasn't                                  being as actively maintained                                  as it is today and you can see how much                                  work is going on                                  in open color io today the next project                                  openq                                  has had a long history at sony image                                  works                                  and uh just came into the foundation                                  probably just over a year ago                                  and it's actively being worked on as                                  well uh heavily from people at google                                  but also from other companies                                  as well so thank you to those of you who                                  are working hard on that project                                  and then exr that's uh uh that's the                                  image software                                  that was created at industrial light                                  magic probably                                  the most widely adopted uh package of                                  everything we're talking about here                                  today                                  uh term in terms of movies it's used on                                  every single movie uh but it also                                  had gotten a little bit uh it wasn't it                                  wasn't getting the kind of attention                                  that it deserved it certainly wasn't                                  getting the sort of innovation that it                                  needed                                  and that's because everybody has a lot                                  going on right every day but you can see                                  in this last year it's been very                                  actively maintained                                  it's built into the mac operating system                                  in addition to                                  many of the linux distributions that are                                  out there very very widely used and now                                  very actively maintained and there's                                  excitement about the future of that as                                  well                                  open timeline io pixar's first project                                  in the academy software foundation                                  um very very cool connecting software                                  between editorial                                  and um and any sort of digital workflows                                  in movie production or visual effects                                  and                                  making a lot of active progress this                                  year as well and the last project open                                  shading language                                  this is a fundamental program                                  inside of it's a program that's a                                  library that renders use it's a                                  programming language for renderers to                                  use to describe shading how every                                  surface is going to look and very very                                  actively developed as you can see                                  the lion shares those that development                                  work is being done at sony image works                                  this was just recently contributed to                                  the academy software foundation so that                                  makes a lot of sense                                  but you can see already contributions                                  from intel double negative and other                                  companies                                  as well and individuals who may not have                                  stated an affiliation                                  so even though it's only been a short                                  amount of time we're seeing some work                                  in this open source package and                                  accelerating that the academy software                                  foundation by just setting out                                  clear goals clear ways to contribute and                                  hopefully attracting additional                                  attention to these projects                                  um we're able to accelerate the                                  development of these shows                                  of these projects rather so                                  we saved a bit of time at the end here                                  for to hear from you                                  and to have some conversation with you                                  let's go ahead and start on the first                                  poll here david                                  to talk about what we are doing well                                  where where have we delivered on the                                  most value                                  in the last couple of years and uh we'll                                  also talk about where                                  we could deliver more value what we                                  could do better or what we should do                                  next                                  but first let's start with if you just                                  go to that url                                  at the top there pollyb.com aswf                                  and what are some of the things that the                                  academy software foundation has done                                  well                                  and delivered some value that you think                                  is helpful and if you're brand new                                  it's okay you don't have to participate                                  but if you have an opinion on this you                                  can                                  type in your answers and you can also                                  give up votes                                  if you see something on there that you                                  like you can tap it and it'll help                                  raise it to the top of the list                                  so i'm already seeing some things coming                                  up that people are liking                                  helping with the legalese indeed                                  so uh somebody highlighted automated                                  build system and one of the cool things                                  about                                  the uh build infrastructure that the                                  academy software foundation has built                                  is it is heavily based or it's based on                                  i think                                  is it exclusively open source libraries                                  almost exclusively as much as we can                                  open source libraries and this and the                                  infrastructure itself                                  is open source so that means you can                                  actually                                  take this continuous integration                                  infrastructure and use leverage it                                  internally if you have any interest                                  so everything if you are one you or one                                  of your engineers is working on it                                  that can be both very helpful for the                                  academy software foundation but it's                                  also can be very helpful for your own                                  business or operation                                  it's great to see all these answers                                  coming in it's really fantastic to see                                  over

able                                  to attend if we were doing this graph in                                  person but in a lot of ways i'm                                  i'm uh very thrilled with not only just                                  the number of people here but                                  what a broad range of time zones we                                  represent in

     great open source projects in our                                  industry                                  i take that to mean both a home and also                                  a                                  an environment that you can trust that                                  will be there for a long time especially                                  for some of these core                                  libraries and things that we all want to                                  be able to rely on for many years into                                  the future                                  visibility that's great just the pr                                  aspect of                                  bringing a visibility of engineers and                                  open source projects                                  into the industry is fantastic                                  democratizing software                                  the legalese absolutely supporting                                  orphan software absolutely it was a high                                  amount it was a high priority when we                                  started the foundation to take these                                  projects that were incredibly                                  fundamental                                  to our efforts in and our work that we                                  do every day and making sure it had a                                  place                                  that where work could continue to happen                                  vfx reference platform this is a                                  fantastic initiative and just to be                                  clear                                  the visual effects reference platform is                                  initiative is an initiative that we                                  support uh but it is actually home by                                  the visual effects society technology                                  committee                                  and started over five years ago in that                                  committee                                  and it is a fantastic platform if you                                  want to look it up online you can google                                  the vfx reference platform                                  and every year they advertise what                                  versions of key important libraries that                                  have a lot of dependencies                                  what versions the software providers                                  should be using so that the software has                                  a better chance of inter                                  interoperability particularly on linux                                  but this year the big announcement on                                  the vfx reference platform is that                                  they're providing recommendations for                                  linux for mac                                  and for windows as well so this is to                                  help with the problem of version itis                                  so we're a huge supporter of the vfx                                  reference platform                                  and we love that initiative and um                                  they're doing a fantastic job with it                                  for sure                                  and then down just a little further is                                  automated build systems and and                                  providing these common spaces and                                  getting                                  us talking with each other which is                                  fantastic and if you're interested in

                                          depending on whether the mood no just                                  kidding um yes every                                                 meets and that is

but the academy                                  software foundation we                                  provide software with permissive open                                  source software licenses that means                                  everyone can use it it's free to use                                  you can check out the individual                                  licenses but we try to make them as                                  simple and as clear and as permissive                                  as possible so whether you are a member                                  or not                                  you can use a software you can                                  contribute to the software you can                                  attend the tac meetings all the                                  important decisions happen you can                                  you can chime in on all that as a member                                  your company is                                  supporting this initiative which i think                                  is a great investment                                  certainly for the companies that i've                                  talked to a small amount of financial                                  donation and                                  a full-time engineer which is somebody                                  you assigned to the projects you want                                  them to work on                                  that's a modest investment compared to                                  the investments                                  all of our companies are making                                  individually to try to make some of this                                  stuff happen                                  so this has been a fantastic                                  collaborative effort we've seen in the                                  industry                                  so we'll go on to the next slide things                                  uh that we                                  can do to create more value or                                  um let me see what actually wrote on                                  there uh yeah how can we oh there you go                                  i i wrote exactly what i said                                  how can the academy software foundation                                  create more value either for you                                  or your organization what would be the                                  kind of things we can do next                                  that would create more value for you                                  it requires deep thinking yeah exactly                                  so jonathan might have taken the prize                                  for the earliest                                  start this morning from perth                                  this is great finding more standards to                                  adopt is already coming up                                  towards the top                                  so um vfx reference platform docker                                  builds                                  daniel do you just want to talk about                                  that for a minute because it came up                                  both on a place we were creating value                                  and a place we could create more value                                  if we made an automatic rpm so can                                  where can people go who are interested                                  in that topic and is it worth giving a                                  brief update on that                                  so uh we                                  let's see so the slack channel that i                                  mentioned is probably the first port of                                  call to                                  uh engage with the people who are                                  actively working on the                                  docker images and uh checking                                  into the ci working group generally                                  looking at the past                                  notes which are on the swf                                  github are a good way also just sort of                                  seeing the broader context of that work                                  that comment sort of suggests                                  that there's already a bit of                                  familiarity with the work and an                                  interest in being able to take those                                  uh docker images from um                                  the setting which they currently use                                  which which allows them to be very                                  easily sort of picked up                                  and used for uh for ci and for things                                  like the jupiter notebooks                                  and actually allow them to be used in a                                  production environment                                  there are a few additional steps there                                  of course                                  docker containers are a                                  still have some um friction or some uh                                  teething issues usually with uh hardware                                  accelerated graphics and other things                                  so there's a couple of steps there in                                  order to make them really effective as                                  you know as the platform that you build                                  your uh production workstations on and                                  so on                                  but that's certainly an area that um                                  we're interested in and                                  as we look to uh windows and mac                                  where uh docker unfortunately isn't um                                  as well supported and as capable as it                                  is on the linux platform                                  um we are uh extending to looking at                                  general package managers as                                  a way of uh supporting those platforms                                  as the vfx first from platform                                  rev sorry excuse me reference platform                                  extends onto the                                  uh to the other uh platforms we're doing                                  the same with our                                  uh ci infrastructure and for our                                  projects uh and that will naturally                                  uh include using a a broader set of                                  package management approaches                                  and i expect that that in fact might be                                  the part                                  we take to runtime                                  install uh packages for even for linux                                  as well                                  so stay tuned that's definitely uh                                  that's definitely in scope                                  not only for linux but also for our                                  other platforms                                  great so the top two topics are                                  um not surprisingly about adding more                                  projects and this is something that                                  we're very interested in continuing to                                  do um open image i o is a great example                                  usd is another great example it became                                  the                                  first and the second item on the list                                  but just to                                  as a primer for those of you who haven't                                  already attended some of these other                                  meetings the way we                                  adopt projects is um by reaching out to                                  the hosting organization in usd's case                                  it's pixar                                  ex and and seeing if they have any                                  interest in                                  in the academy software foundation                                  backing the project or adopting the                                  project and then they would be the ones                                  who would sign that over                                  so we've continued to have great                                  conversations with our friends at pixar                                  they have a project already in the                                  academy software foundation and                                  certainly                                  by being a responsible host for that                                  project and hopefully it continuing to                                  accelerate its development and adoption                                  that'll be a great sign for them to                                  consider such a large project                                  like usd um usd is in addition to being                                  a huge open source project it's also a                                  fundamental                                  tool in their own pipeline over at pixar                                  so you can imagine it's a big decision                                  whether to sign over                                  uh the management of that over to the                                  academy software foundation                                  um but if there's a specific reason i'm                                  uh i'm really interested in learning                                  more you could chat on the slack or on                                  the mailing list if there's a specific                                  thing that you think the academy                                  software foundation can do                                  to help uh you could join the working                                  group                                  that is already formed in order to                                  support usd because whether usd                                  is in the academy software in the                                  academy software foundation                                  or not we're interested in supporting it                                  supporting its successful development                                  and adoption and it's already an open                                  source package                                  with a very permissive license very                                  consistent with all our views                                  and we would love to continue to support                                  it as much as we can                                  so um yeah so that is the current status                                  on that for sure                                  and i love seeing more tutorials and                                  adoption on the use of the software this                                  is a better onboarding which is an area                                  that                                  we haven't really focused on yet and i                                  think it would be really good                                  for us to look at that in the next year                                  as we go from the state of kind of                                  getting the software in a good shape for                                  the expert users                                  to users who might be newer to these                                  packages because they're very um they                                  require a lot of expertise                                  right now for sure to integrate into                                  your own projects so that's a really                                  good idea                                  and that that would also be an excellent                                  point of engagement for                                  people who would like to contribute                                  their skills and their understanding of                                  the system so that it expands the pool                                  from                                  perhaps sort of hardcore developers to                                  other people who have built the                                  experience of use                                  and of application we'd really encourage                                  them to be involved to start to help us                                  build                                  those onboarding materials                                  and the next one we particularly love uh                                  successfully convince more companies to                                  join                                  pay up and donate time absolutely and                                  you can                                  uh engineers and companies can work on                                  academy software                                  foundation projects with or without                                  being a member but we love having them                                  as members                                  as a member they get a seat on the                                  governing board they get to help direct                                  the spending of the academy software                                  foundation                                  uh which do things like support these                                  dni initiatives                                  support the project support days like                                  this uh to actually happen                                  um and we do have a uh as david                                  highlighted about a million dollar                                  budget                                  actually just over a million dollar                                  budget um assuming all the companies                                  continue to re-up and participate which                                  they have which has been fantastic                                  we could imagine doing more with more                                  participation absolutely and if you are                                  representing a company or an                                  organization who might be interested in                                  a general membership                                  or a premier membership the premier                                  membership is                                  uh is a look is more expensive and                                  provides that greater level of support                                  and the general membership is quite cost                                  effective                                  uh to be deeply involved in the academy                                  we and you saw the slide with our                                  supporting companies who were incredibly                                  grateful for                                  um but if you have any questions about                                  membership or how you could support                                  the organization as a the the academy                                  software foundation as the organization                                  that you work with                                  you could reach out to david marin or i                                  anytime we'd be happy                                  to speak with you about that we have a                                  question in the chat                                  about is there a non-corporate                                  membership                                  so we have three categories of                                  memberships a premier                                  that gives you a seat on the board                                  general membership and                                  associate membership for the non-profits                                  and other companies that or organization                                  that can join the foundation at very                                  little or no cost                                  so that we can participate in in the                                  movement                                  but we do not have an individual                                  membership at this time                                  um beyond those three that david just                                  highlighted                                  right great and pre-compiled binaries                                  from multiple platforms daniel is it                                  correct today that most of our projects                                  only have pre-compiled binaries for the                                  linux                                  environment uh so it'd be quick to say                                  that we don't really                                  offer distributable binaries for any                                  platform um                                  that's that again falls into that                                  category of uh the
