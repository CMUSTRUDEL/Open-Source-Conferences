	Academy Software Foundation: 
Enabling Cross-Industry Collaboration for Open Source Projects

In August 2018, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and The Linux Foundation launched the Academy Software Foundation (ASWF) to provide a neutral forum for open source software developers in the motion picture and broader media industries to share resources and collaborate on technologies for image creation, visual effects, animation and sound. This presentation will explain why the Foundation was formed and how it plans to increase the quality and quantity of open source contributions by lowering the barrier to entry for developing and using open source software across the industry.

the the                               troopers the last presentation of the                               one before last the the true survivors                               of HPA thank you for being here                               and I'm very happy to be here with you                               to present the Academy Software                                Foundation to you so in the next                                   minutes I'm going to give you a brief                                overview of how this came to be why it                                exists the foundation and what we intend                                to do my name is David Moran I'm the                                executive director of the foundation the                                Academy Software Foundation is about                                open source software in the motion                                picture industry so by way of                                introduction we're going to unpack those                                two lines starting with open source                                software so we all know what open source                                software is but it's always good to look                                at at the basic definition of it so that                                we're all at the same level and a                                program whose source code is made                                available for use or modification as                                users or other developers see fit it's                                usually developed as a public                                collaboration and made freely available                                that's the kind of general definition                                that everyone knows about with open                                source those who are really doing open                                source know that it's a little bit more                                complicated than that open source                                software this is a type of computer                                software in which source code is                                released under a license so even though                                it's free there's still a license                                there's still illegal requirements                                related to the use of open source                                software where the copyright holder                                meaning there's someone that owns the                                copyright of this open source project                                grants users the right to study change                                and distribute the software that's an                                that's an important definition these                                details play an important role in how                                easy or how hard it is to work with open                                source software in any industry a quick                                trends so open source software is an                                existence since a long times as long as                                software existed there was this idea                                that software should be free                                in a certain portion of the industry but                                it really took off with the web-scale                                companies the Google Facebook Twitter                                Netflix they used open-source as a mean                                to an end and they open sourced a vast                                quantity of software the goal being to                                put their development out there so                                others can contribute so that the                                community can come in so that what                                they're doing is transparent multiple                                benefits traditional companies                                commercial software vendors that used to                                be closed source protecting software                                with licenses and and very very                                bulletproof licensing are also now doing                                open source Autodesk is one we've heard                                about them they're here today Comcast                                Intel Salesforce Samsung about every                                company that used to sell software under                                the behind the closed wall is now have                                open source projects of various size and                                startups have been contributing now to                                open source most startup out there start                                their software stack with a component                                that's open source to try to entice the                                community to grow a community of                                developers around what they do all that                                contributes to the growth of open source                                software in general this is a projection                                by the Linux Foundation that shows the                                number of libraries that are set to                                skyrocket also something that you                                probably noticed last year there was two                                big open source related acquisition the                                acquisition of github by Microsoft right                                and the acquisition of Red Hat by IBM                                the acquisition of Red Hat by IBM Red                                Hat a open source a company that has                                developed a business around open source                                software sold for                                                     and that's a sign that the open source                                ecosystem is playing an ever bigger role                                in technology in our lives out there now                                in the motion picture industry if we go                                back from this very high level vision                                and we go to                                 but we're doing in the motion picture                                 industry so this we all know that chart                                 the all-time worldwide box-office top                                    familiar names all around when you look                                 at that list from the point of view of                                 software yep what do we see we see that                                 every one of those movies has been made                                 with software every one of those movies                                 is either an animation movie entirely                                 done and rendered by artist but using                                 software or is a visual effects movie                                 that could not have existed without the                                 visual effects that were also done with                                 software the list actually goes down to                                 number                                                                   movie a normal live action movie which                                 is Mamma Mia which did seven hundred                                 million dollars which is a good number                                 but it's about the first one that is                                 really there was no visual effects in                                 the movie no no animation so software                                 plays an immense role in these movies                                 that people go see right so in this day                                 and age today with so many different                                 choices for entertainment from                                 television to videogames to the rest of                                 it we still have movies billion dollar                                 movie equipment is still in theater                                 they're made a billion dollars so people                                 you know take their put their coats on                                 get in their car go to the theater see a                                 movie take a big chunk of time they go                                 do that it's a real market it's a                                 growing market                                                        year growth of                                                      feature and of course this is just one                                 part of the revenue that these products                                 generate the box office we like to talk                                 about it but movies make money in many                                 many other ways so these are the                                 products of our time in the world of                                 film and they're all based on software                                 so two years ago two years and a half                                 ago now the Academy of Motion Picture                                 Arts and Science under the direction of                                 Rob Reider the CTO of Lucasfilm                                 Rob proposed to start an investigation                                 on the use of open source software in                                 the motion picture industry and that was                                 out of a hunch that Rob had that open                                 source software plays a very important                                 role and there's there was plenty of                                 evidence of that already with all sorts                                 of libraries that have become standard                                 to our industry but there was a sense                                 also that our open source community in                                 our open source libraries were a little                                 bit stuck they had difficulties scaling                                 there was some problems and leveraging                                 software and having the community work                                 with each other it was a bit of a                                 underground development economy if you                                 want people engineers we're doing open                                 source projects sometimes with the                                 knowledge of their company sometimes not                                 just because they thought that it was                                 important and often they were right                                 there's libraries like open Colorado                                 openexr open VDB that became fundamental                                 and used and about every visual effects                                 and animation movies that are out there                                 that we're languishing so over a period                                 of two years and about four different                                 meetings this group of people CTOs of                                 animation and visual effects movies and                                 others and in the film industry gathered                                 around the table at the academy and at                                 this is the agenda for the last meeting                                 where at the end of it it was proposed                                 to create a foundation to help open                                 source software in the motion picture                                 industry in collaboration with the Linux                                 Foundation and it was proposed that                                 candidate test project to be openexr                                 open color i/o and open VDB that was a                                 year ago February                                                        later we created the Academy Software                                 Foundation a joint partnership between                                 the Academy of Motion Picture Arts &                                 Science and the Linux Foundation the                                 founding members as you've seen here                                 we'll hear more about them came in put a                                 little bit of money and I will describe                                 how the mechanics work so that we can                                 give a shot in their arm to our                                 open-source software development                                 community do you've read this you've                                 read this into the program the the goal                                 is to provide a neutral forum for open                                 source software developer in the motion                                 picture and broader media industry to                                 share resource and collaborate on                                 technology we have a video we just                                 released for the SciTech Awards where                                 our chairman Robredo                                 chairman of the board of the Academy                                 Software Foundation talks about what we                                 intend to do creative filmmakers today                                 rely more than ever on engineers and                                 scientists using open source software to                                 help craft fantastic visionary images                                 every single part of the filmmaking                                 process is touched by software and a lot                                 about software is open source software                                 some of the greatest innovations we've                                 seen in the modern era of filmmaking                                 have actually been supported by open                                 source software the Academy of Motion                                 Picture Arts and Sciences and the Linux                                 Foundation have created the academy                                 software foundation with support from                                 industry leaders the Academy soccer                                 foundation exists to provide a great                                 home for open source projects that we as                                 an industry use every day to projects                                 the Academy Software Foundation is                                 currently working on our open BBB and                                 open color AIA open BBB is a volumetric                                 data block format it is pretty                                 ubiquitous in use anytime we have an                                 explosion its BTB anytime you have                                 clouds it's bdb anywhere where you have                                 a lot of fluid simulation fireballs gas                                 flowing across surface things that are                                 big we think there's value in having an                                 organization outside of DreamWorks take                                 responsibility for this and I think                                 we've already seen a benefit and that                                 had other studios step forward in a way                                 they had not previously with                                 contributions to the standard open Clara                                 is an open source color management                                 solution for motion picture production                                 and and everyone working on a show from                                 an artist at a workstation to a director                                 in a theater you can see the same image                                 and speak the same visual language open                                 Clara is compatible with theses and can                                 be used to implement any well-defined                                 color standard highly critical projects                                 need oversight particularly for more                                 than one studio or company and can                                 benefit greatly from not only shared                                 development resources but also the solid                                 infrastructure offered by the Linux                                 Foundation and their involvement academy                                 Software Foundation whether you are a                                 user of open source software or an                                 engineer or a company that relies on                                 open source software we want to create                                 the right ecosystem for you to get the                                 most out of the open source software                                 that you need to use find it set a SWF                                 dot IO and join the mailing list and see                                 how you can get involved so if my                                 presentation was to end up here that's                                 what you need to do go to a SWF dot IO                                 and find out more about what we're doing                                 and how you can join with a little bit                                 of time that that is left I'm going to                                 continue dig a little deeper into how                                 we're doing things our members actually                                 we have a new member Nvidia just joined                                 just after we made that video so their                                 logo is right here with us                                 we have three class of members premiere                                 members these are the companies the                                 organization that really care about this                                 this cause and they're investing a bit                                 of money and they're committing one                                 full-time engineer equivalent a year to                                 the projects of the foundation so as we                                 have                                                                    full-time engineer equivalents ready to                                 dig in and work on our projects that's                                 one of the benefits that the foundation                                 is bringing to the projects that will be                                 in it general members are there at the                                 lesser level of commitment but they're                                 still in in the map and the associate                                 members are other nonprofit organization                                 or open-source projects that want to                                 join                                 foundation you want to find out more                                 about how to join your company is not if                                 your company is not on that list of                                 companies you should consider joining                                 the Academy Software Foundation as as a                                 cause it's a foundation it's a                                 non-profit it's like when you when you                                 join a non-profit on the cause that you                                 care about if you care about open source                                 software think about joining all the                                 details on how to do that how much it                                 cost the process is all detailed on our                                 website but more than companies and                                 logos this is about the people and you                                 can also find out the people that are                                 involved each company has a                                 representative on our governing board                                 each company also has a technical                                 representative on our technical advisory                                 council which is the core of the                                 foundation the foundation is there to to                                 energize and empower the engineers is                                 for the software engineers that do open                                 source software there is a side mission                                 that we have to shine a light on the                                 work of software engineers in our                                 industry because unlike other industries                                 Silicon Valley is where the software                                 engineer is the king of the hill here                                 the artist is the king of the hill and                                 that's the way it should be the                                 filmmaker the people who do the imagery                                 and the software engineers are there to                                 their service but they're doing amazing                                 work and they've been in the shadow a                                 lot in some ways we've been losing some                                 of our engineers to Silicon Valley for a                                 number of reasons we want to make sure                                 that those who are passionate about it                                 our industry stay with us and are                                 encouraged to stay with us and we can                                 grow our software base and motion                                 picture so the people are important so                                 our mission you've seen it I'll go over                                 that quickly increase the quality and                                 quantity of open-source contribution you                                 can read it our goals quickly so we're                                 providing a neutral forum it's been                                 alluded to in the video when an                                 open-source library is at a company at a                                 studio sometimes not always but                                 sometimes other studios have a citation                                 to contribute to their competitor                                 essentially even though these libraries                                 are                                 for the benefit of all so by having a                                 neutral problem in a neutral entity like                                 the foundation we're providing that that                                 that water hole where we can all come                                 and put our our competitive hats at the                                 door and work on the software that is                                 good for everybody we're developing a                                 continuous integration and build                                 infrastructure this is very important to                                 build open source software you need a                                 build infrastructure every companies who                                 take an open source software and does                                 something with it has a bill                                 infrastructure all of those are                                 different than they're hidden in the                                 engineering department of every company                                 at the foundation we have and we are                                 taking in an open source build                                 infrastructure we're bringing it over                                 from our partner the Linux Foundation                                 who already has that running for many                                 other projects that they're doing and                                 we're going to port our projects over or                                 bring our projects over that build                                 infrastructure for everyone to see what                                 that means is that smaller studios who                                 may not have the engineering to develop                                 their own build infrastructure custom or                                 find that down thing could actually take                                 and copy the build infrastructure of the                                 académie Software Foundation and use it                                 as is or parts of it or bits of it as                                 they want it's open source we want to                                 streamline the development and so not                                 only the infrastructure but the build                                 configuration the script the recipes all                                 of that is going to be available to the                                 community we want to provide individual                                 individuals an organization a clear path                                 for participation and cold contribution                                 so it's explained on our website you                                 want to contribute all of our mailing                                 lists are open they're all there for                                 every project for everyone to see you                                 can you can see all the discussions that                                 are going on we have members of our                                 founding companies that are leading the                                 charge but all our proceedings are open                                 source and the way to join is very clear                                 and simple and we won't last but not                                 least provide a better more consistent                                 licensing through a shared licensing                                 template if you have dealt with open                                 source libraries in your companies you                                 know that the legal department has                                 something to say about that and                                 depending on your legal department                                 sometimes you have you have legal                                 professionals who are                                 very familiar with IP and software                                 sometime not they come from other places                                 of they're in their own industry and it                                 takes a while to educate them on why are                                 we doing open-source why are we sharing                                 our secrets with everyone these kind of                                 things now the Academy Software                                 Foundation provides a place where you                                 put an effort on that and if you're                                 legal folks look at our license                                 templates and approve them they do that                                 once and after that all the projects can                                 go the byte bar it so the structure of                                 the foundation is like this the board of                                 director on top is there to provide                                 money and funds and marketing to the                                 engineers the engineers are in the tack                                 the Technical Advisory Council and then                                 under the tack you have the projects                                 each one driven by a technical
