	                              hi everyone for you do you like the                               movies can I hear yes so it's great to                               be here from the motion picture business                               to talk about the Academy Software                               Foundation and we're we're the new kid                               in the in the world of the Linux                               Foundation about the different projects                               that are out there                               we just got created three weeks ago we                                announced here at SIGGRAPH in this                                convention center three weeks ago and                                we're in the process of setting this up                                what I want to do in the next ten                                minutes is to give you kind of an or an                                overview of where we came from which is                                a story that you'll be very familiar                                with I think from the other industries                                but there's a bit of a flavor that is                                specific to to us to the motion picture                                business and go a little bit quickly and                                to where we're at in setting this up and                                the specifics of how we're setting up                                the foundation so but first I want to                                talk about the movies generally so what                                you have on screen right now is the top                                                                                                   revenue the motion picture business in                                theatrical box office makes about                                   billion dollar-a-year were worldwide                                these are just for the tickets that you                                buy when you go to the movies here in                                China and anywhere on earth the movie                                motion pictures generate a lot of                                revenues in other in other ways from                                video streaming theme park toys and all                                kinds of things this is just the tip of                                a pyramid but what's interesting to note                                when you look at this list of movies is                                that they are all either visual effects                                movies or animation movies and they are                                all essentially by and large                                computer-generated and done with                                software with artists using software and                                you have to go down the list to number                                                                                                      to get to a pure live-action movie but                                the movie is mama mia it did six hundred                                and fifty million dollars but all the                                movies that                                up there before then have been done                                essentially with software computer                                graphic software and the engineers that                                work on that                                use open source they've been using open                                source as the other industries have and                                as has become a an important part of                                movie production since the beginning                                there's a list of all the libraries that                                are used for open source and these are                                some of them they probably never heard                                about them but they're very instrumental                                in the making of the movies ASIS and                                then big open Carla Rio openexr                                two years ago as Jim alluded to we                                started an investigation at the Academy                                Robredo from Lucasfilm I had this                                understanding that perhaps the Academy                                could do something to help the open                                source community and so the the                                investigation went on for two years                                there was a lot of the CTOs and the                                director of technologies that are                                involved in moviemaking in animation                                studios and VFX studios visual effects                                that got together around the same table                                started discussing about software and                                how we can improve the development of                                open source at the beginning we really                                thought that well you know open source                                is what it is it's kind of a grassroot                                motivated and there's not much we can do                                to help that but as we proceeded at some                                point when we invited Jim and Mike Dolan                                from the Linux Foundation to come and                                the first witness what we were doing and                                very quickly they said gently this as                                well maybe there are ways that we can we                                can help with this and they started                                telling us how we could fix some of                                these problems that you see on screen                                right now so the Academy Software                                Foundation was created it's a                                collaboration between the next                                Foundation and the Academy the goal is                                to provide a neutral forum for open                                source software in the motion picture                                business and also the broader media                                industries and too for that platform to                                allow for collaboration on the creation                                 of images                                 visual effects animation and sound we                                 have members this this project this                                 foundation is set up like many of the                                 other Linux Foundation projects these                                 are our founding members so you                                 recognize the names there

                         members on the software side this is a                                 slide about our lunch tree with three                                 weeks ago and also Nargis tent and you                                 see on this image Robredo doing a                                 keynote in this room actually about the                                 creativity in motion picture Rob was the                                 visual effects supervisor of the latest                                 Star War movies the solo movie and he                                 presented about the process of                                 creativity and he announced the                                 foundation as part of his keynote and we                                 had a good deal of press from our own                                 trade press within the motion picture                                 business and also from the technology                                 press out there and the mission for the                                 foundation is simple increase the cut                                 the quality quantity of open-source                                 contribution by establishing treating                                 the governor's model a legal framework                                 and the community infrastructure we want                                 to lower the barriers of entry for                                 developing and using open-source in our                                 industry there's a lot of things we're                                 doing that you you are already doing if                                 you're working within amateur                                 Linux foundation projects this is all                                 familiar to you and probably old news                                 but it's new to us thank you for                                 indulging us so our goals are to connect                                 to coordinate across projects to develop                                 a continuous integration and build                                 infrastructure that is open to all so                                 that we can streamline the development                                 of build and runtime environments                                 provide better more consistent licensing                                 template on the legal side and provide a                                 clear path for participation and code                                 contribution in our industry so                                 essentially we want to bring the                                 engineers who are working hard and in                                 the case of open source libraries and                                 initiatives often the engineers have                                 seen a problem that needed to be solved                                 was not mandated by anyone                                 they took initiatives and they they                                 wrote the code that was needed they open                                 sourced it for everyone to share that                                 process in the motion picture business                                 has been in the shadows a little bit and                                 we want to the foundation was to shine                                 the light of the work of the engineers                                 and bring them resources and structure                                 the governance so our foundation is a                                 non-profit it's under the Linux                                 Foundation so it's outside of any                                 particular studio or company's firewall                                 it's there's a governing board as you                                 would expect and there is a technical                                 project group a technical advisory                                 council that is independent from the                                 governing board to ensure that the                                 engineers in this organization continue                                 to make the decisions about the project                                 so it's sort of a division between                                 church and state at the this is the                                 graph you've seen a version of this many                                 time the governing board the Technical                                 Advisory Council and the projects and so                                 the TAC role is to establish the best                                 practice identify the resource                                 coordinate with the community propose                                 the new project and we're in that phase                                 right now the our foundation is new so                                 we have a number of                                 target projects but none of them are in                                 we are an empty vessel three weeks into                                 it so now the process is a lot about                                 bringing the projects in and the tack is                                 doing that also being formed as we speak                                 and the projects will sit on this                                 continuous integration infrastructure                                 that comes to us from the Linux                                 Foundation we've already tested some of                                 the open source libraries that you've                                 seen before on the continuous                                 integration I don't think I need to sell                                 you and the benefit of that in our                                 industry what this will do however is                                 that we'll bring an open source                                 infrastructure for our own projects at                                 the foundation but also for everyone to                                 see in in the industry and open source                                 infrastructure so right now people who                                 use open source libraries in their                                 software or in their production pipeline                                 have a version of that that is not open                                 source that has been developed                                 internally and each one of them is                                 slightly different and if you want to                                 get into using or contributing to open                                 source software you have to build one a                                 form of build infrastructure for                                 yourself and the dis all fine and good                                 but it's a significant effort many                                 smaller studios midsize and smaller                                 studio shy away from open source because                                 of those technical requirements now if                                 we have our CI infrastructure in the                                 open the hope is that it can be adopted                                 wholesale by some small studio who want                                 to get into open source and contribute                                 and that it will also help the other the                                 bigger studios that already have an                                 infrastructure to to standardize some                                 practices over time there is an aspect                                 so obviously the Linux Foundation is is                                 focused on Linux the largest studios in                                 the motion picture business are Linux                                 based for their production pipelines but                                 we also need support for Mac and Windows                                 Server so that's in the plan to to                                 include that as well as                                 GPU for the real-time software and                                 process that are gaining traction and                                 the benefits so this slide here I will                                 admit is the more for our own industry                                 where we come in and we communicate and                                 socialize what the CI infrastructure is                                 about then for you because you you are                                 aware of these benefits but it'll be                                 farms that will come with it that we                                 reference build produce outside of any                                 one organization as I said we want to                                 lower the barrier of entry and we want                                 to increase the adoption of something                                 called the VFX reference platform which                                 is a recommend date recommendation                                 platform that has been created already                                 by volunteer in our industry so we want                                 to go from recommendation to action on                                 some of the good work that has been done                                 by the volunteer in our industry so we                                 have three projects that are tested on                                 the CI infrastructure right now openexr                                 which is a library that deals with with                                 high dynamic range images that existed                                 since a long time inside production open                                 cada rio that deals with color                                 management within a production pipeline                                 and open VDP that deal with deep data a                                 deep image data for doing simulation and                                 explosion and all kind of things like                                 that and we're working on the windows                                 build the information on our                                 infrastructure is here if someone wants                                 to come and see it and this is how to                                 participate so if you're interested in                                 the motion picture industry and you're                                 an engineer and you want to check out                                 what's going on with this foundation                                 this is a good point of entry we have                                 set up the lists and they and the TAC is                                 going to be formed with its own chairman                                 very soon and they'll be a lot to do so                                 we were welcoming all help we can get in                                 order to set up the foundation in the                                 years to come                                 I see that my clock has been reset do I                                 really have more time                                 okay Batman alright so I've gone through                                 through all of it but we have we have                                 anecdotes to share in any number of ways                                 I was listening to what Van Jones was                                 saying in his keynote or his                                 presentation earlier and with great                                 power comes great responsibility                                 everyone uses these analogies and in the                                 motion picture industry although the                                 products we make are for entertainment                                 we do feel that we have a great                                 responsibility to carry our products in                                 a way that inspire and and foster                                 innovation in in the community so a                                 really important part of this effort                                 that we're doing is to now shine a light                                 on the engineers that have been working                                 very hard in the trenches to enable all                                 these great motion pictures that we've                                 seen on screen there are movies like                                 that we're on the list that I showed                                 earlier like The Fast and the Furious                                 movie for instance the last one where                                 although it looks like a live action                                 will be true and true when you know how                                 it was made                                 it's really by and large a                                 computer-generated movie and there was                                 some press that was made about in                                 particular in that movie when Paul                                 Walker passed away in the middle of                                 production and he had to be recreated                                 for the duration of the of the movie                                 itself so it was an entirely software                                 based exercise to to find the best way                                 to recreate the actors for their last                                 performance in the movies there's a lot                                 of work that's going on to simulate the                                 world in the motion picture industry and                                 to render it in a way that is photo real                                 so we can also create new worlds and                                 allow the filmmakers to bring anything                                 they want on screen no matter where it                                 is in the future in the past in places                                 that don't exist and so that story could                                 be told in these environments so that we                                 can explore through our                                 the great what if could happen if this                                 if that boat in from romantic committees                                 out to to science-fiction and more and                                 more this is a software-based and this                                 is the work of engineers so we want to                                 really bring a spotlight on the work of                                 the engineers that work in the motion                                 picture industry as Van Jones was                                 talking about writing code today is                                 perhaps the most powerful activity that                                 you can do in terms of changing the                                 world we certainly know that it's the                                 most powerful activity you can do to                                 make movies and so if you're interested                                 please don't hesitate to join us thank                                 you very much thanks David                                 thank you                                 [Applause]
