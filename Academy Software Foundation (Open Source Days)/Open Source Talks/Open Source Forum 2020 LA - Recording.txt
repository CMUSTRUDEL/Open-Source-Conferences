                  the second forum that we have we had one                                 a year ago when we were just a few                                 months old as a foundation and now we're                                 growing so the purpose of this forum                                 which we intend to be a yearly event is                                 to give an update to the community to                                 our activities that we have done during                                 the year and to have a little bit of                                 discussions about also what's coming up                                 next and what we want to do so the                                 agenda as you have seen it we're going                                 to start quickly but at the State of the                                 Union you all do that as fast as I can                                 then we'll go into the core of what is                                 the what the foundation is about which                                 is the Technical Advisory Council and                                 the projects that we have in the                                 foundation and then we'll have a moment                                 after that looking forward so who                                 mentioned this before but we have remote                                 attendees so we'll use the microphone                                 and attendees or dissertate if you have                                 questions type them in and we will read                                 them at the appropriate moment local                                 attendees there's Wi-Fi information on                                 the table it could is going to be useful                                 because we're going to start with a                                 quick quiz we'll have a number of polls                                 during

the world-class host for our projects                                 that we want to be in that's our core                                 mission and we're very much staying on                                 that as we will see for most of the rest                                 of this afternoon but then about                                 Universal scene description we stated                                 that this is an important open source                                 project in our industry that we want to                                 help and support Pixar as they're taking                                 on this this important project and they                                 open sourced it for the benefit of the                                 industry we want to point some of our or                                 our engineers who are interested to go                                 to the existing farm and participate and                                 help the Pixar engineer those of you who                                 have USD experience have started                                 implementing it already and help the                                 community to understand USD and then                                 here we're going to four more we're                                 going to talk about forming a working                                 group on universe Universal seam                                 description which is a new type of                                 activity for the foundation that that we                                 have done in in some ways so far but we                                 want to do a little bit more formalized                                 and also with regards to USD we want to                                 stay out of the way where things are                                 working well we're just coming in to                                 offer a helping hand in that important                                 project so                                                              in the motion picture industry heard Rob                                 saying in this abbreviated State of the                                 Union I'm going to go through what we                                 achieved in                                                          briefly about our goals and mission that                                 we set for ourselves in in                                      so in                                                              months before that the Academy of Motion                                 Picture Arts and Science the SCI tech                                 council led by Rob and with the                                 collaboration of many and the Ruffini                                 and others got together and decided to                                 start an investigation around open                                 source as                                 part of that investigation and I must                                 say that the Academy's continuing to                                 help us ND and the Ricardo and and                                 Kathleen from the Academy are here with                                 us and here we are in the Academy Museum                                 so the hell with the Academy has been                                 invaluable thank you to the Academy and                                 as part of this investigation we came to                                 know the Linux Foundation and they came                                 on board with us and started explaining                                 to us how open source is supported in                                 other industries and became our partners                                 and ever since and we have at this table                                 of Emily Olin and John Moore Tech and                                 many others from the Linux Foundation                                 who are helping us with the operation of                                 our foundation and we couldn't have                                 we couldn't have created it without them                                 and so out of the investigation came the                                 decision to create the Academy Software                                 Foundation and they're a very important                                 group of companies came together our                                 founding members you have the list I'm                                 not going to read them but these                                 companies where core are the core the                                 people who kind of took a leap of faith                                 with some money in and some commitment                                 of engineering resources to get the                                 foundation started and with the these                                 people where these companies were                                 infinitely

  bring a project into the foundation and                                 that was I was hard and that was the                                 first and that was a bold move and we

   from a year ago                                 as we mentioned as I mentioned before                                 openexr shortly thereafter an open queue                                 where projects that joined us openexr                                 was gifted to the foundation by                                 listening and open cue                                 a Sony Pictures

effects movie labs and our first open                                 source day which was our meeting at                                 SIGGRAPH where we regrouped a lot of                                 birds of a feather into one track in                                 September but then we had our open                                 source landscape that Daniel will talk                                 about a little more later and we had our                                 first case study of or interviews of                                 engineers behind the screens and both                                 Apple and Microsoft joined us at that                                 time and by the end of the year we reach                                 a million dollar in nearly founding                                 commitments from                                                      and this is a group we have assembled                                 here and to all of you thank you                                 infinitely for making the foundation                                 possible we created the foundation to be                                 and we also have                                                         developers now on in the wings ready to                                 work on projects for the first two years                                 the assignment of the full-time                                 engineers are to any of our project or                                 any open source projects but eventually                                 they'll move on engineering for our                                 foundation projects so this is the group                                 and and this is an amazing group of                                 pioneers that believe that software as                                 are in the motion picture industry is                                 fundamental and do we need to get                                 together for a certain type of software                                 and work together the structure of the                                 foundation is like this the Technical                                 Advisory Council is the core of the                                 foundation this is where the engineering                                 group stand led by Danielle Eichenberg                                 the governing board is there on the side                                 to help the tech clear the way and make                                 sure that they have the resource to do                                 what they want to do and under the tack                                 we have our projects that are built on a                                 continuous integration platform that's                                 the basic structure of our foundation                                 talking a little bit more about open                                 source day at SIGGRAPH all the                                 presentation that we did at SIGGRAPH are                                 recorded on our website so anyone who                                 wants to get the latest update up to                                 today on the projects can go there and                                 let's listen to do to those recording we                                 also have the behind the screen this is                                 one of them on Pilar Melina Lopez an                                 engineer at Blue Sky Studios we're going                                 to do a lot more of them we want to                                 highlight the work of the software                                 engineer in our industry you can go                                 there read the profiles and send people                                 to them as we encourage the the work of                                 engineers in the motion picture industry                                 so                                                                      going to go into quickly our goals and                                 targets so first of all we are building                                 on the strong phase and momentum that we                                 gathered since we created the foundation                                 so not what you're going to hear about                                 today about the projects and what what                                 is happening what's going on is our core                                 activity which regards to funding with                                 for                                                                 members which are which is the class of                                 member member companies that don't have                                 to do as big a commitment either on                                 money or in engineering and bring them                                 in bring more of them into the company                                 which equates to smaller studios studios                                 that are maybe less familiar with open                                 source that want to that are maybe users                                 or open source but not contributor we                                 want to focus on them and explain to                                 them the value that the foundation has                                 and and bring them in and with that we                                 intend to increase slightly our                                 operating revenue by the end of the year                                 which is very important for this                                 foundation to be well funded to help all                                 the projects in the and what we want to                                 do and with regards to project we are of                                 course continuing a really structured                                 system or process for welcoming new                                 projects any projects can be submitted                                 to the foundation by exterior entity the                                 foundation is not going to take over                                 projects or I'm going to take projects                                 that are existing they have to be                                 submitted by their owner and that                                 process is well documented in our                                 website and what Edition in addition                                 we're going to create working group for                                 exploration of new and larger projects                                 we are going to talk about that little                                 later and on the outreach side we're                                 going to focus on                                 versity and raising the profile suffered                                 in software engineers in our industry so                                 working group what does that mean so the                                 working groups we are going to be                                 defined by the Technical Advisory                                 Council there I'm going to have to in                                 the definition phase have a lead have a                                 clear goal at a process to get to the                                 goal and the finit duration in time and                                 once a working group has been defined it                                 will be reviewed by the got the                                 Governing Board will talk of practical                                 examples of that a little later this is                                 our timeline for                                                       in January at the open source farm we're                                 participating in a number of conferences                                 and and outreach activities throughout                                 the year our other big meeting will be                                 at SIGGRAPH in Washington DC and on that                                 question I have another quiz I would                                 like to the question is do you plan to                                 go to SIGGRAPH in Washington DC because                                 it's not in the usual location so if you                                 can please and take a minute to answer                                 the poll we are going to go to SIGGRAPH                                 in Washington DC the Academy Software                                 Foundation and we plan to have our                                 second open source day with that                                 question we're just trying to gauge                                 roughly how big SIGGRAPH will be this                                 year in terms of attendees and people                                 are making the decision to go or not                                 we'll stop at                                                        majority is going to SIGGRAPH that's                                 good and we have a higher number than                                 usual and that are not quite sure yet                                 number you're not going thank you very                                 much for that                                 so in terms of our higher level mission                                 if you want we've seen this many of you                                 here in the room have been doing this                                 presentation or the Academy Software                                 Foundation is there to provide a neutral                                 forum for open source software developer                                 in the motion picture in broader media                                 industry the point that's important here                                 is the neutral forum we've never had                                 something like the Academy Software                                 Foundation in the motion picture                                 industry there are a lot of                                 organization and committees and and                                 guilds and societies that put up                                 meetings and do all kind of things the                                 neutral forum for the development of                                 software this is something that is new                                 and this is something that we need to                                 learn to take advantage of as a                                 community we already have a number of                                 initiatives in progress but we can do                                 more and better and as we grow the                                 foundation moving forward the mission                                 specifically is about increasing the                                 quality and quantity of open-source                                 contribution and we've established this                                 governance model legal framework                                 community infrastructure you're the                                 barrier to entry to our products and I'm                                 not going to go to the goals these were                                 our goals from                                                         interest of time continue well briefly                                 continuous integration that allows us to                                 share open source build configuration a                                 clear path of participation and more                                 consistent licensing these are work in                                 progress because we did a lot of                                 progress on these four goals in                                         I mentioned before we're adding two                                 additional goal explore new and larger                                 projects through working groups and                                 increase focus on developer diversity                                 and inclusion how to participate you                                 probably all know this but where our                                 website is rich in information now and                                 also make sure that you're following us                                 on social media that was my quick State                                 of the Union I will now pass the                                 microphone to Danielle Eichenberg will                                 give us the update and attack hi                                 everyone and welcome again to those                                 people who are dialing in once again                                 just a reminder if you've joined late                                 please flag any questions or feedback                                 you might have by the Xoom chat so as we                                 have a nice collection of people who've                                 been very actively involved in the                                 activities of the foundation and some of                                 its structures and components in                                 projects and attack and so on as well as                                 a more a broader community here who's                                 been involved with the history of the                                 foundation and                                 active in the in the industry and                                 community generally I'll give a little                                 bit of a summary of some of the things                                 that have happened over the first year                                 but without going into too much detail                                 in particular I won't dwell on what's                                 happened in the projects themselves                                 because we'll be hearing from the                                 project chairs themselves who'll be able                                 to dive into a lot of the specifics that                                 really represent the value that the                                 foundation attempts to bring to this                                 community so as David introduced the                                 technical advisory committee plays a                                 role to try and coordinate across the                                 projects and of course in our founding                                 process a key activity there was                                 actually adopting projects now that we                                 have a significant number of effective                                 and active projects our focus starts to                                 shift of course to other activities to                                 support those projects and the projects                                 themselves provide a lot of the energy                                 to keep moving the foundation forward                                 within this of course the CI                                 infrastructure was a big focus early on                                 and that is our first successful model                                 of the working group structure that                                 David outlined earlier this is obviously                                 an area where it's of great interest to                                 all of our projects but also as a good                                 opportunity for us to bring in skills                                 and expertise from other people outside                                 of the projects which it's definitely                                 done it involves skill sets which might                                 not actually be within any one of the                                 projects themselves and it also                                 sometimes has to be able to appeal for                                 funding and resources and other things                                 from their foundations so the working                                 group structures serve that well through                                 the association with the TAC as part of                                 the process of smoothing and aiding                                 adoption and also making it possible for                                 us to engage with a broader pool of                                 developers a large focus of the first                                 year is on licensing and contribution                                 processes and I have a slide on some of                                 the details the progress that we've made                                 there another area in order to try and                                 really establish a good basis of best                                 practice in a way within that within the                                 code so we improve the quality of code                                 as one of our goals in a way that is                                 actually stable and maintainable                                 over the duration of the project so not                                 just a scrutiny that happens at the time                                 of a projects adoption was by joining                                 into the core infrastructure initiative                                 badge process and all of the projects                                 that have graduated now the three                                 projects that have graduated about five                                 have after achieving those goals                                 maintain them you'll see that those the                                 passing grade is clearly seen on their                                 website and that indicates this is                                 actually an ongoing process an indicator                                 of those quality standards being met and                                 maintained finally another area where we                                 are attempting to canalize best practice                                 and facilitate project adoption is by                                 capturing many of the projects that go                                 many of the aspects that go into                                 starting anew a SWF project and linking                                 in with some of our systems like CLA and                                 with our CI system is by setting up a                                 simple template project again that was                                 worked on in the scope of our CI working                                 group and has provided a valuable path                                 to actually realize and make visible                                 some of those processes that came out of                                 long discussions within the other groups                                 one area that as we now move forward                                 from a strictly project adoption into                                 the longer growth of the foundation is                                 developer engagement so there are a few                                 key aspects to that and I suspect                                 that'll be a topic we talk about a lot                                 in the discussions today this was                                 highlighted in the surveys that we                                 undertook with our membership as being                                 one of the areas we really should focus                                 on not only for the sake of the                                 foundation and the industry as a whole                                 but also obviously in order to serve the                                 needs of the projects that we have some                                 of which have very clear timelines and                                 roadmaps to deliver you know effective                                 value to all of the projects that                                 further depend on them but where we need                                 to be able to use the resources and                                 mechanisms of foundation to help and                                 resource those things                                 the idea of support for USD is another                                 example where we might seek to do so                                 somewhat outside of the project context                                 another aspect of this of course is                                 making sure that we broaden our                                 engagement with the development                                 community and in doing so we can really                                 try and improve the diversity inclusion                                 that at the                                 in terms of representation and also in                                 terms of the processes and how we go                                 about actually making sure that a broad                                 variety of voices is heard all of our                                 processes with the tach                                 are open so I would encourage you to                                 follow through and follow along with the                                 TAC mailing list and use that to ask any                                 questions                                 whilst we do have a core set of voting                                 members on the tach                                 the meetings are all open and we would                                 encourage anyone to join with issues we                                 have a process for an open process for                                 adding topics for discussion and so on                                 so this really is done in the spirit of                                 being able to provide this open in                                 neutral forum for collaboration in ways                                 that might not otherwise exist so a                                 little more on the subject of developer                                 engagement we've spoken quite a lot                                 about outreach about trying to reach                                 people who might not you know already be                                 part of the community as it as it stands                                 and in fact there is some good examples                                 of how we are taking some concrete steps                                 to do so                                 Larry grits who's here has been leading                                 a bit of a charge to set up the                                 foundation as an organization for the                                 google Summer of Code this year and all                                 of our projects have subscribed into                                 that process as well but another big                                 area is is what has has been coined in                                 reach which is actually making sure that                                 we are able to harness and appeal to                                 developers already within our community                                 and our gauge but actually make it                                 easier and possibly for them to                                 contribute to our projects and make it                                 clear what the value proposition is for                                 their organizations and other other                                 points of access in order to actually                                 appeal to those experienced and highly                                 skilled developers what aspect of this                                 of course is actually making our                                 projects accessible so another theme for                                 our goals for the TAC this year beyond                                 project and process accessibility for                                 project adoption is actually to make                                 sure that the projects themselves at a                                 deeper level are more accessible by                                 working on some of the web material in                                 other presentations which are a little                                 aged in the case of some of our projects                                 and also of course bringing our                                 documentation other processes up to best                                 practice I'll make another sure                                 no two about the working group as an                                 interesting piece of strategy for                                 developer engagement so where our                                 projects of course Duke and can include                                 activity from developers outside of the                                 foundation and we encourage that and                                 there's many examples of this already                                 working group provide another model                                 again for us to appeal to and engage                                 with developers and organizations                                 without that necessarily involving                                 membership that's important for the                                 community generally and it also allows a                                 statistic tart to engage with groups so                                 that they can understand what the                                 foundation might offer them in a future                                 point back into the details so those of                                 us who were present for many of the                                 early summits and other processes that                                 led to the formation of the foundation                                 will remember that there were many                                 discussions about licensing and IP                                 arrangements as bottlenecks and                                 obstacles to contributions something                                 that had occurred in many of our                                 projects and indeed the projects we have                                 adopted were slight modifications on                                 standard OSI licenses and through the                                 process of both adoption and second pass                                 streamlining we've managed to do good                                 work to actually standardize many of                                 those licenses so that they are much                                 more straightforward and recognizable                                 and pose less risk for organizations                                 that might seek to enable their                                 developers to contribute this is a slide                                 that I won't go into a lot of detail                                 about but I will make a couple of notes                                 about the path that we took for                                 establishing the CI infrastructure which                                 now all of our projects are making use                                 of when we were initially scoping this                                 work we had a goal or a mandate to make                                 sure that this infrastructure would be                                 completely reproducible repr forcible so                                 the studios could essentially spin up                                 this infrastructure inside their own                                 environments as a way of dealing with                                 some of the typical sort of network                                 security and isolation issues in our in                                 our in our environment as we progress                                 through this we realized that there was                                 a bit of a disjunction between                                 that kind of approach and what was much                                 more familiar to open source project                                 workflows and the way that many of the                                 key systems for CI and software quality                                 had moved to software as a service style                                 models so we actually made the                                 deliberate choice to switch this to a                                 workflow which made use of those                                 services in their public forms and this                                 has had good value for us in terms of                                 being able to allow for workflows on                                 individual project and developer Forks                                 to be completely compatible and to make                                 use of these public resources it's also                                 meant that we're able to leverage                                 software as a service through the open                                 source arrangements that most of those                                 services provide to do so without                                 running the infrastructure ourselves so                                 these are all important advantage that                                 we've been able to achieve we've spoken                                 a lot and we concentrated a lot on                                 adopting a number of key important and                                 in some cases a little bit troubled                                 projects in our first year of course as                                 we now expand our view to the sort of                                 health and the broader ecosystem it's                                 important to be able to actually get                                 some sort of view and map of that so                                 John and others in the Linux Foundation                                 were able to bring a very effective view                                 of this for our industry by repurposing                                 some of the technology that came from                                 one of their other projects and form the                                 SWF landscape which actually allows us                                 to see how our already adopted projects                                 for dinners Keystone's in many of the                                 areas of our industry but also to see                                 the many other open source projects that                                 exist around them and that are within                                 our mandate as the foundation to help an                                 aid and support and with that let's get                                 into the exciting details of the                                 projects                                 [Music]                                 Emily has prompted me to actually ask                                 some difficult questions I wasn't quite                                 prepared for that till later but let's                                 see let's see what you've got                                 I've got a little time so would anyone                                 like to stop now and ask questions of                                 course we'll have lots of time for a                                 broader discussion after the project                                 presentations as well                                 one thing I want to say about the                                 landscape that Daniel just presented on                                 our website it's an interactive                                 landscape that allows you to search for                                 projects in our industry so I invite you                                 to go and and visit it it's a good tool                                 to get a sense of the many projects that                                 are related to our industry and get to                                 their website and you can view the                                 landscape in different forms it's been a                                 great tool do we have any question from                                 the online group are there any                                 guidelines advice to help developers to                                 convince their studio to open-source                                 some internal projects at this stage no                                 I think that the all of the projects                                 that we have and in fact all of the                                 community of developers and others that                                 are engaged with the foundation or                                 obviously ready to have that                                 conversation with any interested                                 individuals and I would direct them to                                 do so you know through the public                                 mechanisms that the TAC and mailing                                 lists offer up or indeed through more                                 private contacting that's appropriate                                 and added in the chat a link to a                                 resource the links foundation has a                                 project called the to do group which is                                 a group of open-source program office                                 leaders across many different industries                                 big small they put together a series of                                 guides that talk about how you as an                                 organization participate in open source                                 if you're wanting to kind of measure                                 your open source developer impact and                                 then pertinent to this call a                                 conversation here how do you get started                                 in open source how do you bring a                                 project from internal to external so I'd                                 encourage if this is something you're                                 interested in your and your organization                                 take a look at a number of these guides                                 and maybe we can also tap you into some                                 of the experts behind them excellent now                                 I'm keen to leave as much time for the                                 projects as possible because they have                                 lots of good news to be able to share so                                 we may take the time now to pass over to                                 I believe open color                                 our first project everyone                                 this is Michael Dolan can you hear me                                 okay yes again alright great so I                                 couldn't be there but I'll be                                 introducing y'all to open color and kind                                 of giving some updates on what we've                                 been up to this past year and then Doug                                 Walker will talk a little bit about open                                 Cole area version two and you know our                                 progress in that this year and where                                 we're headed this coming year so we                                 could go to the next slide so just the                                 general overview of what opened Colorado                                 is a lot of you are probably familiar                                 with it but it's an Academy Award                                 winning color management library                                 targeting motion picture production it's                                 it's used widely and a lot of the                                 effects and animation studios and both                                 commercial and proprietary software the                                 goal you know has been to have a                                 consistent user experience across all of                                 our digital content creation                                 applications that we use you know so                                 that whether you're at Maya or in                                 Houdini or nuke or katana or wherever                                 that you're artists are seeing the same                                 you know color appearance and even                                 though underlying data is represented                                 whatever makes sense for your production                                 needs and then the system is highly                                 configurable and its intended to be very                                 performant so that involves Harbor                                 acceleration we can process color on CPU                                 and GPU etc so open Colorado was started                                 at Sony Pictures Imageworks and it was                                 open sourced in                                                     sixth project as part of their open                                 source initiative and I was very widely                                 adopted following that and then in                                      after some you know quiet times on the                                 project                                 Autodesk made a proposal about kind of                                 like bringing the project back to life                                 and adding a lot of valuable                                 functionality given you know a lot had                                 changed in the industry over the you                                 know previous number of years and so                                 they proposed open Calero version two                                 and had committed full-time engineers to                                 work on it until it's completed and so                                 that's been going on and in                                         became the second project                                 join the Software Foundation and it's                                 been a you know a good a good move and                                 the project's very doing very well if we                                 could go to the next slide so right                                 around now marks our one-year                                 anniversary and the Academy Software                                 Foundation and throughout this this past                                 year and the meet this meeting last year                                 we had just kind of gotten in and with                                 this past year we went through                                 incubation and we have officially                                 graduated to adopted project status as                                 you know we had to take care of quite a                                 few details to make that happen but made                                 the project much more better or much                                 better as a result you know just dealing                                 with governance and licensing and lots                                 of just details to make sure we're you                                 know adhering to the best practices for                                 open source projects so RT SC or                                 technical steering committee we meet                                 Mondays at                                                              open to the public welcome anyone who                                 has interest in learning more or being a                                 part of what Oakland Calero is doing                                 currently our committee has members from                                 Imageworks autodesk double- epic games                                 foundry Framestore ILM and lettuce so we                                 have a good mix of membership and we                                 also have regular participation from                                 Netflix and Linux Foundation and

in our community we                                 this past year one thing we did on our                                 TSC was we added a new leadership role                                 because our project is so you know                                 tightly knitted with aces and they're                                 both these color management projects                                 they're both widely used in our industry                                 we added an aces tech rep role to our                                 leadership of our TSC                                 that's Sean Cooper at Dean egg and just                                 to kind of help keep the projects and                                 stuff in talking with each other so                                 that's been a positive move part of this                                 incubations past year was a lot of                                 infrastructure initiatives as Daniel was                                 talking about our you know working with                                 a lot of a CI and so we overhauled our                                 CI systems this past year and you know                                 in Azure and Sona cloud and and we did                                 that very tightly with the other                                 projects as a part of the foundation and                                 within the CI working group and so                                 it was a very collaborative process that                                 I think all the projects really                                 benefited from you know having each team                                 kind of take part and you know lead the                                 way on different initiatives we're                                 currently I'm kind of setting up the                                 first GPU CI usage within the foundation                                 and jf panas that's kind of leading the                                 way with that he did a lot of he's been                                 doing a lot of research and contributing                                 that to the project which is greatly                                 appreciated we also you know in for open                                 collar area we don't yet have Python                                   support and so we're currently working                                 on developing new PI bi and                                          bindings to add Python                                                 is definitely needed this year to keep                                 with the FX reference platform okay go                                 to the next slide so this slide is going                                 to give you a bit of a glimpse into the                                 activity of our project over the last                                 year this top graphic is our github                                 activity over the past decade and on the                                 bottom is the last three years of our                                 slack community so you'll see at the top                                 that our activity over the past year in                                 github has has been consistent and                                 strong and it's really grown and we had                                                                                                       you know which is great and                                          closed in                                                          contributors so pretty wide                                 representation contributing you know                                 code as well we have                                                    if you look on our graph here you can                                 see there's about                                                      time that's people who are contributing                                 to the conversation and checking                                 regularly so pretty good representation                                 and and one actually positive thing is                                 here was we rebooted our mail list which                                 used to be at Google Groups                                 and it was moved to list a SWF diet oh                                 when we became part of the foundation                                 which required all of our subscribers to                                 essentially Reece absque ribe no one was                                 carried over and so we have                                     subscribers doe CEO dev at                                               so showing that you know there's pretty                                 good you know the representation there                                 as well and people that are contributing                                 to the conversation and with that I'm                                 going to hand it over to Doug Walker to                                 talk about Oakland Colorado version                                   thanks Michael so greetings from                                 Montreal I'm                                  Walker I worked for Autodesk I'm the                                  technology lead for color science here                                  and I'm serving as the chief architect                                  role on the OCIO TSC so as Michael said                                  we are in midst of a big project called                                  OCIO v                                                                list of features that we validated with                                  the community back in                                                   the dark bars are kind of where we were                                  at SIGGRAPH last year and the light bars                                  are where we are now so as Michael                                  mentioned Autodesk has three full-time                                  engineers working on this we are merging                                  code into the master branch on github on                                  a weekly basis I'm not going to try to                                  go through all the this whole list but I                                  just wanted to pick up on something                                  Michael said earlier which is that we                                  have we're very interested in in working                                  closely with aces and we have a number                                  of features on the b                                                 intended to integrate more closely with                                  aces and in fact we're just wrapping up                                  support for the new commonlook format                                  specification that is part of the new                                  aces                                                                 working that are working on OClO are                                  also very involved very involved in aces                                  and the way I like to think of it is                                  aces is the what and OCIO is the how so                                  in other words aces provides standards                                  for what color transforms to apply and                                  OCIO provides a great way for how to                                  apply those in an efficient and flexible                                  way next slide please                                  so looking forward to the year ahead                                  this will be a big year for OCIO roadmap                                  is to be feature complete with v                                      SIGGRAPH and then the second half of the                                  year will be helping people integrate                                  Ozio v                                                                  testing                                  and our goal is to be in the VFX                                  reference platform so that applications                                  can start shipping in calendar year

                                                      all right hello everyone i'm brian                                  seprieono from Google I'm the                                  chairperson of the steering committee of                                  open queue and I'm just going to take                                  you through a a little bit about what                                  we've been doing with open queue and                                  what our what our plans are for the next                                  upcoming year                                  I won't go into too much detail here but                                  for folks who don't know what open queue                                  is it is a job management and scheduling                                  platform it's is mostly designed for the                                  media space rendering particular but                                  really any any kind of paralyzed double                                  work you want to do can be put onto the                                  system whether that's you know rendering                                  pausing running backups and really any                                  kind of work you want to distribute it's                                  a centralized system with no kind of                                  centralized job management piece and                                  database and some software that runs on                                  each of your worker nodes and                                  workstations and some client side pieces                                  for for interacting with the system                                  Python API job description system and a                                  bunch of GUI tools as well so it started                                  it's it's been around at some form for a                                  long time started around                                                 named q                                                                   of kind of built up for a while over the                                  years and then around around mid in                                       Sony and Google started working together                                  to open-source it so there was that was                                  a big projects kind of untangling it for                                  a bunch of other SPI of the structure                                  and prepping it for the open source                                  release and we wrap that up around                                  January                                                                about a year old we've just recently had                                  our one year anniversary a few months                                  after that then we joined the a SWF I                                  think we were the maybe the fourth                                  project to join and a little bit                                  different than the other projects which                                  are kind of lower-level dependencies                                  this is more of a multi component system                                  so there's been a lot of kind of                                  interesting work that we've done sit                                  again as the first net space in the                                  software foundation but a lot of the                                  tools that we're using are all the same                                  ones that the you know the rest                                  the foundation is using a build system                                  release system all that and so we've                                  been able to kind of share a lot of that                                  stuff as well even though we're quite                                  different so some of the stuff we've                                  done in the past year well like I said                                  it's been it's about our one-year                                  anniversary so that the open source                                  release was the biggest one of course                                  that came along with a lot of some                                  initial packaging to help help folks get                                  it up and running docker support was a                                  big one for a lot of the pieces and then                                  since then we've kind of moved along to                                  a lot of the more popular feature                                  requests so one of the first things we                                  put into place was a kind of arbitrary                                  limit system this is for like managing                                  fixed amounts of licenses and then                                  making sure you you know you're able to                                  to utilize your license pool properly                                  we've done we have full Python                                            now it was a big project about about                                      of our code is is Python other                                         Java so it was a big big push to get                                  that all in place before the end of the                                  year and keep up with the reference                                  platform but that's all about now and it                                  was also a prerequisite to doing Windows                                  support within the platform so far it's                                  been all all Linux based but as of                                  actually just this week we announced our                                  the alpha of our our Windows program so                                  we're able to run they run jobs on on                                  Windows and launch them from those                                  workstations now there's some                                  limitations there it's still you know                                  it's an it's an alpha for a reason                                  you know some especially around                                  packaging of the windows components                                  logging stuff like that but we're really                                  excited to get that out because it's                                  been a very very popular feature request                                  ever since we launched and then the                                  other thing that we've done is a you                                  know in the past year we've set up the                                  whole the whole project project                                  governance structure and I'll go into                                  that some more and then on the next                                  slide I've linked here and sure we'll                                  show the slides out later but I've                                  linked here release notes on our website                                  that have lots of other smaller future                                  feature requests we've done stuff like                                  that                                  so yeah that'd be the project governance                                  structure so we set up the steering                                  committee like all the other foundation                                  projects we have open meetings every                                  other week mailing lists which are also                                  linked here you know user a developer                                  lists and there's a lot of good                                  conversation that goes on there doing                                  monthly releases of the whole system for                                  folks who aren't you know pulling from                                  our from the master branch on github and                                  then a few of the stats here that I've                                  listed you can see kind of show what of                                  what contributions looked like in the                                  last year and this has really been the                                  kind of most encouraging thing I've seen                                  about the the project is that you know                                  though the as you can see from PRS                                  merged the kind of piece that of which                                  were merging code and closing issues                                  hasn't really picked up the the pool of                                  contribute that has grown quite a lot we                                  have a really good kind of base of folks                                  who are contributing regularly to it now                                  whether that's code or Doc's or just you                                  know could you read it to discussions                                  and meetings the contributors here are                                  specifically like folks who have merged                                  code so those numbers are all really                                  encouraging and and going in the right                                  direction and kind of the one of the                                  biggest challenges as new open source                                  projects I think it's to gonna get                                  beyond that initial pool of initial                                  committers and and involve more folks so                                  that's all good a few things that we're                                  gonna work on over the next year better                                  support for cross platform jobs with                                  directory mapping whole user management                                  system with with fine-grained                                  permissions more packaging with for all                                  the different platforms and make it                                  easier to use and install and run the                                  program lots of new documentation that's                                  been working with some tech riders so it                                  helped us on that so that's all going in                                  a good direction and we're gonna                                  continue with that and we want to keep                                  growing the contributor pool as well so                                  and then one of the other things that                                  the CII badge that was mentioned in the                                  earlier was that and that's something                                  that we haven't been able to focus on                                  too much as a kind of new project                                  or at least a newly-released project                                  we've been focusing a lot more on the                                  kind of initial feature requests that                                  we've gotten so that's going to get the                                  CI badge we get more attention over the                                  next year make sure that we get up to                                  pace with the rest of the projects I                                  think we're about                                                         and there's much more on our on our                                  public github page if you want to see                                  what we're working on lots of stuff here                                  if you're interested in getting involved                                  main website the docs code different                                  mailing lists and you know all of our                                  TSC meetings are open as well if you uh                                  if you ever want to join those those are                                  posted on our on our public calendar and                                  yeah I think that's about it any                                  question for open Q Brian you've any                                  data on how many studios currently                                  adopted oh oh thank you yeah that's                                  something that we've that we need to do                                  more work on is collecting that sort of                                  data we don't really have anything like                                  that right now we may have we can we can                                  get us kind of a sense of it from the                                  the contributions we're seeing but it's                                  not a perfect metric so it's something                                  we should do more work on in the next                                  year or so anybody here to studio                                  experimenting with open cue using it at                                  all it works more than experimenting so                                  need a little bit networks as well cool                                  yeah I mean we did we did just so you                                  guys know we did have to convert q                                        open Q so that was part of our process                                  too so we had to go through converting                                  it putting it on a Postgres database                                  that sort of thing so it's yes that that                                  process has obviously been started and                                  established it's working well                                  didn't check yeah yeah Luka was just                                  saying the the way that we submit jobs                                  has not changed so it's it's done the                                  same way it's just there's obviously                                  adaptations that Google and other people                                  have made including the Postgres piece                                  that we had to move to um on that note I                                  think there this is a point of general                                  interest for many of our projects                                  perhaps open q in particular is to                                  understand you know how widely use the                                  component is it's very easy to tell when                                  something becomes a component in a                                  commercial software stack for example                                  but much how when it's a you know                                  top-level application itself and that's                                  something that has been raised as                                  something that in one way or another                                  some projects would like the foundation                                  to be able to help with it provider sort                                  of an appropriate mechanism for studios                                  and others to report their interest in                                  use and support of a project so that                                  that data is visible hey thank you Brian                                  and now for open queue for openexr Gary                                  Phillips that's right you're waiting on                                  me I doubt there's anybody here that                                  doesn't know what openexr is but just in                                  case it's the high dynamic range image                                  format that's standard in the industry                                  and outside the industry anywhere high                                  precision as is needed in an image                                  format openexr as an old project it was                                  originally developed in the early                                        at ILM contributions from Wetty and                                  dreamworks along the way more recent                                  history last may project joined the                                  Software Foundation we formed the stair                                  technical steering committee rallied an                                  effort to deal with a bit of sort of                                  deferred maintenance                                  and technical debt made a                                              just before SIGGRAPH last year finished                                  off the CII badge and officially adopted                                  in November it's worth pausing to ask                                  how what what's expected of a project                                  like this and openexr is not the kind of                                  project that we really expect a                                  tremendous amount of development and you                                  know energy put into mostly it's just                                  maintain it you know reliability                                  stability and information about the                                  project so that's kind of our operating                                  assumptions for the goals of the project                                  there's openexr is I guess probably the                                  only foundation project that's widely                                  used enough to have security                                  vulnerabilities filed against it so                                  we've dealt with some in the past and                                  have some more that we're working on now                                  along with some other bug fixes and                                  should have a release out imminently if                                  not next week then soon there's another                                  little batch of miscellaneous                                  maintenance and small features and some                                  improvements to threading that we hope                                  to do sometime in the spring and we're                                  tentatively targeting another release                                  around SIGGRAPH in which we would                                  deliver something that we've talked                                  about of splitting the eye math library                                  out from openexr and distributing it as                                  its own project looking forward a little                                  bit you know the things that kind of                                  aren't on our immediate platform you                                  know radar but we know are of concern to                                  the industry around performance                                  basically you know streaming performance                                  one of the things we see as our                                  responsibility in particular would be to                                  provide a regression suite to measure                                  performance we have nothing like that                                  now so you know as we're fixing bugs we                                  don't really know if it's as affecting                                  performance or not another we've had                                  several questions around the the format                                  of the the definition of the file format                                  people that might be interested in doing                                  an alternative implementation of it                                  not that that's something we're going to                                  deal with but it's just an issue that's                                  that's come up another thing that seems                                  within our purview is to maintain a                                  library of reference images just as                                  educational purposes as well as                                  benchmarks for the industry                                  there isn't an opening sorry images repo                                  nobody's paid much attention to it in a                                  long time and I'm honestly not actually                                  very familiar with what's there but                                  revisiting that and and in that spirit                                  updating the the website is one of the                                  things that we're intending to invest                                  time in you look at the period of time                                  when we joined the software foundation                                  to SIGGRAPH and then SIGGRAPH to hear                                  you know kind of roughly similar pace of                                  development or you know quantity of                                  development except the time period is                                  twice as much so kind of from that                                  initial burst our activity is probably                                  half now what it used to be and that                                  kind of highlights one of what I'd put                                  out there is sort of one of the                                  challenges that I think our project                                  faces you know like any kind of fragile                                  ecosystem everything's fine until a                                  storm comes along somebody goes on                                  vacation and it feels like our level of                                  responsiveness that we can muster                                  suffers you know none of us involved                                  with this do this as a core part of our                                  day jobs where all this it's a side gig                                  for everybody and we're just doing it                                  because we enjoy it                                  I wish that our pace of development was                                  was faster and that we had a broader                                  maintainer base Cristina Templar leads                                  is on our steering committee she's there                                  because I knew that she would be good                                  and I just called her up and talked her                                  into it and I think that's something we                                  should just all resolve to do a better                                  job of                                  she's not an imaging expert but I'm not                                  either and she's helped us out with our                                  CI infrastructure and it's been it's                                  been fantastic so check out more at the                                  the repo in the website there's not a                                  lot of activity on the the developer                                  alias we meet regularly on Thursdays and                                  write questions for Carrie you asked a                                  question as part of your presentation                                  what is expected of openexr moving                                  forward                                  it does does anyone have an answer was                                  to venture an answer to that question is                                  openexr just fine as it is or does                                  anyone have ideas or suggestions for the                                  group for the team moving forward you                                  have a quick question which again and                                  for this more for the room is that once                                  you have pieces and then you have open                                  choreo and then you have an archiving                                  format is there a working group which is                                  how the throughout of the three work                                  together because again it's great to                                  have the individual components but then                                  what's the combination of the three                                  things together in capture and archiving                                  and and and work in DC cease to be a                                  question I will defer to Larry on that                                  question once you have what you mean                                  sort of like you have the Monopoly game                                  like you've gotten OCIO you have open XR                                  and ASIS in this in this within this                                  purview that that's great cuz now                                  they're secure but then what would you                                  do as a working group if you could steer                                  all three at the same time for capture                                  work in DCs and archiving I'm really on                                  the spot now                                  I'm just saying it was more of the                                  question of like what would you do                                  because I think with openexr                                  it might be nothing but then the                                  question of this group of why this group                                  forms would be like what would you do                                  once you get a few of these things                                  together because explaining Asus to                                  somebody and then we splitting them OCIO                                  and then how it relates thee has always                                  been challenging certainly ya know I you                                  know I don't off the top of my head I                                  don't have a good answer like I think                                  that is what we figure out in the future                                  but I I think all of them being under                                  this umbrella at least leads to obvious                                  coordination that would have been more                                  awkward before well we don't we like we                                  don't have a plan for what to do next on                                  that particular topic I also think                                  there's an opportunity here within the                                  same way of like a us D working group                                  you could imagine doing kind of a case                                  study of if somebody you know some                                  studio was willing to talk about on this                                  feature this is what we did with these                                  technologies Academy Software Foundation                                  technologies and if there was some sort                                  of template for them writing a bunch of                                  notes about like the USD working group                                  thing of like what would be some                                  examples of things you could do but for                                  color stuff that's a you know if you can                                  get somebody be willing to be                                  interviewed or be willing to sort of                                  talk about it not saying this is best                                  practice but saying this is what a                                  studio did with it and we're happy with                                  it or we're not happy with that anyway                                  and I think I think that part of that                                  will be overhauled and more clear as the                                  OCIO v                                                                released because it's really it's a                                  major reworking and I think it will                                  cause people to rethink sort of what                                  capabilities they're taking advantage of                                  and how to build it into apps so we'll                                  yeah I think it's part of it is just                                  pending like how that ends up getting                                  getting it but I think there's there's a                                  value in kind of documenting the state                                  of things versus this next one's gonna                                  be so much better you know you could at                                  least talk about like we here's why                                  we're ending up doing that is because we                                  did this on this one project we use this                                  thing it were you know we had these this                                  metadata in the openexr tags and that                                  worked out super well we could just pull                                  it out in JSON and we were done                                  or things of like we try to do it this                                  way and that didn't scale I think this                                  has to be really driven primarily from                                  on the studio side as a as a way that we                                  think about how this had this media and                                  metadata moves through the production                                  space Netflix is super interested in                                  this stuff we care a lot about it we're                                  actively engaged in the production                                  community around driving towards                                  initiatives which align towards                                  standardization around how color should                                  work because it's a broad topic                                  internationally as much as it is within                                  the local community about what best                                  practices can be in place to guarantee                                  the the quality of the images that are                                  coming out of the production space so I                                  think our the group in are actually                                  Michael is a part of CGI which is                                  outwardly facing around how we've                                  focused technology and drive it on the                                  Prussian safe space

  interested a lot in not just the OCIO                                  v                                                                         aces as a sort of a marker point where                                  we can get a little bit more                                  prescriptive about how we think about                                  color and I think some coordination                                  that's already existed across the                                  universal group and others who in that                                  community you are interested in in                                  aligning the studio side around how this                                  stuff should work will drive a lot of                                  that conversation about how a working                                  group would potentially sort of steer                                  this package of of technology in a way                                  that is most beneficial for them for the                                  industry this is JC speaking a                                  vice-chair of the Academy Asus project                                  sitting on the outside until you let us                                  into the inner circle here I had this                                  arrest you know about the compression of                                  EXR Peas zip or pick span will                                  compression or is compression discussed                                  in this inner group or do you leave it                                  to outside vendors the compression of                                  EXR                                  we have compressions the the compression                                  capabilities within the library now are                                  implemented by dreamworks some years ago                                  and i guess we consider our mission to                                  maintain what's there and let me use                                  this as a specific example if someone                                  wanted to propose a new compression                                  mechanism i think we would seriously                                  consider it but you know as i've                                  characterized the group we're not a                                  bunch of people that kind of are                                  necessarily looking for things to do                                  ourselves it's more i guess we regard                                  ourselves more as caretakers of the                                  format to make sure that if somebody                                  wants to undertake an initiative we                                  should see that it's done properly but                                  it's not really a topic of discussion                                  within the group that we should should                                  actively pursue something like that                                  alright so there's something here to                                  continue around openexr and dis                                  synergies grace to your question between                                  projects I was just gonna say that a big                                  part of that part of the component of                                  that is overlap between the groups you                                  know Valeri is on the steering committee                                  as is right bogart and from aces so at                                  the very least people are talking                                  synergies between the group this is                                  something we will follow up on and now                                  like to move on to open timeline IO Josh                                  miner hey everybody I'm Josh miner and                                  just lost power so I'm gonna try to see                                  I can't see my slides but I'll carry on                                  so I wanted to just talk a little bit                                  about open timeline IO and one just sort                                  of introduce the project since what is                                  relatively new if we can go to the next                                  slide okay so if in case you don't know                                  what open timeline IO is                                  it's an interchange format for dealing                                  with editorial timelines so the types of                                  things you would see in a video or audio                                  editing things or clips and tracks and                                  transitions that's one thing if you can                                  go to the next slide we supply an API                                  for working with those things both in                                  Python and in C++ we have a file format                                  for holding all that information about                                  all those tracks and clips and                                  everything and then we also have                                  adapters for converting to and from a                                  wide variety of other formats so that                                  lets open timeline ao interoperate with                                  things that already exist and files that                                  already exist if we can go to the next                                  slide and all those things are in                                  service of building a flexible                                  production pipeline and so at Pixar we                                  use that in our pipeline to interoperate                                  between avid media composer and the rest                                  of our toolset so some of that same                                  house tools some of that's third-party                                  tools and that's been a really really                                  great project for us that we have a                                  tremendous amount of flexibility that we                                  didn't have before and we chose to open                                  source the project so that other studios                                  other people could benefit from that but                                  also so that we can get even more                                  flexibility and support from other                                  applications and other formats but that                                  we don't already use and so we thought                                  that that would be a really beneficial                                  thing for for the industry you can go to                                  the next slide so you know we looked at                                  open sourcing and originally as a thing                                  just to kind of reach out to the for the                                  health side world and I think that was                                  largely successful and then we looked                                  into joining the Academy Software                                  Foundation and really our goals there                                  were around from getting awareness of                                  the project in the industry and getting                                  participation from from other folks                                  especially from the sort of other                                  software vendors so we can reached out                                  to                                  and an apple on a dough heating and the                                  folks would make the sort of brand-name                                  video editing software and gotten some                                  response but not really a whole lot of                                  engagement and definitely since our                                  project joined the Academy Software                                  Foundation and since we formed our                                  technical steering committee we've had                                  regular discussions and contributions                                  from Netflix and from Autodesk                                  DreamWorks storm studios and a few                                  others and that's been a really really                                  great because we I think successfully                                  shifted to what I would consider a                                  community driven roadmap rather than a                                  Pixar driven one so we've achieved most                                  of the goals of the things that we need                                  it to to Pixar there's obviously loads                                  of things we want to add and grow it but                                  our core goal of the project is working                                  really well for us and that means that                                  we can be more flexible and open to                                  contributions from other folks so                                  Autodesk has proposed some changes                                  actually Netflix and storm studio are                                  collaborating on a improvement to the                                  library so that's been really really                                  good and we've also had more fruitful                                  conversations with avid and other folks                                  so I think that's been it's been really                                  good we are going through a relatively                                  small license changed and and Linux                                  Foundation and a SWF have really helped                                  us to sort of navigate that um that can                                  be a sort of a tricky subject and some                                  of us are not really used to sitting in                                  rooms with lawyers and time talking                                  about legal things but that's actually                                  been a really good process so we're                                  working on that you can go to the next                                  slide so recently we have done a bunch                                  of work to the project to put the sort                                  of core pieces of it to C++ and this is                                  in the hope that it can be easier to                                  integrate with applications especially                                  their party video editing applications                                  or other just DC C's in general we've                                  also improved our AF support and have it                                  has given us some key sort of technical                                  advice and helpful thought which has                                  been really really helpful things that                                  we never would have been able to figure                                  out otherwise                                  and also Autodesk has been helping was                                  in Harvey supported doing code reviews                                  and giving advice and things like that                                  which was which was really football I                                  mentioned a minute ago Netflix and storm                                  studio are working on adding image                                  sequence support so not just like video                                  movie files but sequences of images and                                  all those things are about to be                                  released any minute now                                  any day now and then in the future we                                  have plans to improve our timing effects                                  image effects these kinds of things to                                  support all the other attributes that                                  you might see in a video editing                                  timeline as well as we're hoping to get                                  more actually Native integrations with                                  software rather than converting to and                                  from file formats but actually have                                  plugins and integrations with software                                  the next slide please                                  so if you want to find out more our                                  website documentation our discussion                                  group is not super chatty but we are                                  about maybe                                                               channel has about                                                     those are great ways to reach us and                                  talk to us and I think we're                                  specifically hoping to get engagement                                  from people who really want to add in                                  support you know we don't see support                                  and you know you can flame and Maya and                                  Reno and all the a sort of name-brand                                  applications but you might want to get a                                  timeline of clips in and out of                                  especially where there's some features                                  around those that but not really like a                                  rich support for lots of metadata coming                                  in and out so hope in time I could                                  really helps to enrich that staple                                  directions                                  and yeah so I think that's a sort of                                  main points I wanted to hit if you have                                  questions I'm happy to answer them                                  questions for Joshua and open Cameron I                                  hope                                  anything online now nobody on the line                                  there are a few questions for past                                  projects on the line I figured we'll get                                  to those after open BTB if th everyone                                  up together there that sounds great                                  Thank You Josh for a get a great update                                  appreciate it and now moving on to open                                  V DB alright so for the ocean you that                                  don't know remember when we DB is                                  essentially three different things                                  it's compact in-memory representations                                  for volumes things like think fire smoke                                  water it's also a light weight sensation                                  auto call on the disk and it's a large                                  full set of supporting tools for this                                  data structure so one of the claims to                                  fame for over MIDI BFS of cause it's                                  commercial adoption there are a few new                                  ones that came in this year in barium                                  and blender we have a steering committee                                  with four members I think that the big                                  change this year is unfortunately Peter                                  cooker who normally will represent                                  DreamWorks had to take leave it's only                                  if he's coming back and then I I left                                  what as useful and joined Nvidia we meet                                  at a regular cadence one one time a week                                  every Thursday you're more than welcome                                  to join we've had almost                                              since we started late                                                   minutes are online they can help people                                  case you're interested I'd say I've                                  characterized most of the activities                                  that we had in                                                   bureaucracy we spend a lot of time                                  documenting processes report a ton of                                  time into a new build system see make                                  and then we simplified licenses                                  talk a lot about security and in between                                  all of that we have time for three                                  releases two major releases so I make it                                  release is typically when we change the                                  ABI of the grid not the tools and then                                  we've had new external collaborations                                  we're working with a by first team from                                  Autodesk we're talking about potentially                                  adopting their multi-resolution grip                                  very using which is very exciting and                                  then of course this is even before I                                  joined Nvidia we're talking to Nvidia so                                  Nvidia of course is interested in in                                  trying to take some of these ideas from                                  technologies to the GPU and I'm involved                                  in this as well at this point so and I                                  think the highlight last year obviously                                  was that we were the first project to                                  graduate this is a list of projects that                                  we hope to accomplish in                                               that the biggest the biggest                                  contribution is from Dean X it's this                                  scripting language just-in-time                                  compilation language called ax but there                                  are also a number of other things that                                  you can see on this list there faster                                  level set tools the sharpening                                  improvements to the point support                                  there's also the idea so currently today                                  VB supports what's called delayed                                  loading so lazy loading data is only                                  loaded as you touch it the problem is in                                  the context of rendering if your                                  renderer touches everything the                                  high-water mark is essentially the whole                                  thing so I've been working on the idea                                  of evicting pages again so you can                                  actually up front specify the maximum                                  memory footprint let's see there's also                                  yes it said before are we really                                  exploring the GPU as acceleration                                  platform and then one of the things that                                  I'm mostly excited about is actually a                                  contribution from from Autodesk if that                                  will work out would be super cool yeah                                  in case you want to get involved here                                  are some links I also had a few a list                                  of what I called challenges so as I said                                  we spend a lot of time maintaining the                                  see make and in particular window                                  support is very painful for us                                  both because the CI doesn't really                                  support Windows but also because we                                  don't have a lot of expertise on the TSC                                  so if any of you are interested in this                                  please please reach out yeah                                  all right questions for open V DB and/or                                  all the projects we have two in the game                                  over here well actually no we have an                                  open V DB questions let me hit that                                  first before Ken runs away the question                                  is how has it been getting projects to                                  adopt newer versions of open V DB and                                  its ABI changes I'm not sure I                                  understand that question                                  how is it different from I think how                                  does it how has it been going like                                  what's been the uptake of getting you                                  know new adoption on newer versions of                                  open V DB and the various API changes                                  that have happened like you're seeing                                  people moving over to the new versions                                  or it's traditionally it's it's quite                                  slow it looks like most of the                                  commercial packages are about a year                                  behind but yeah other than that has been                                  pretty smooth not a big change there I                                  think that's the only it's the only one                                  we have for open DVD II I'm gonna roll                                  back here a little bit there's a                                  question I believe from open queue for                                  open queue has the open cube project                                  looked at working with online farm                                  vendors for spreading the project you                                  repeat that I'm sorry yes are you tom                                  has the open queue project looked at                                  working with online farm vendors for                                  spreading the project I'm sure I                                  understand I like online farm Benner's                                  is think of it like just like cloud                                  render farm kind of things                                  yeah no we haven't done any of that yet                                  but we are kind of like we are looking                                  at ways that we could kind of merge                                  merge opq with other cloud environments                                  and then you know not only make it you                                  know we have good good representation                                  from all the major cloud providers on                                  the TSC so we're definitely trying to                                  make it as cloud friendly as possible                                  and it is hybrid friendly as possible so                                  yeah it's something that will probably                                  look at more in the future                                  and we have one this is a USD related                                  question it's I don't have first-hand                                  experience but understand that                                  interoperability of USD between                                  facilities is difficult                                  well the pics are working group address                                  and wrap issues I would say hold that                                  question for the working group question                                  that we're going to address here on                                  specifically you as the we have will                                  have time in the discussion time for our                                  USD and there's one more around gaps in                                  the landscape for open source software                                  it was about the whole overview are                                  there in your opinion major graphs and                                  the current landscape of open source                                  software for the motion picture industry                                  is it a goal of the a SWF to somehow                                  think about it I don't know if this is                                  getting into your next section as well I                                  can speak somewhat to that obviously                                  that's something that changes and                                  evolves over time and this audience is                                  in a very good position to actually help                                  us define or identify those areas in                                  general you know we can think about                                  those gaps in a number of different ways                                  in some cases it's because you know a                                  new technology space has opened up and                                  they're simply you know no projects it                                  has started to move in to it in other                                  cases it's because you know a particular                                  set of technologies is close to becoming                                  a commodity you know we may all have                                  proprietary solutions and that's not                                  something we see value in maintaining                                  and similarly the same can apply to                                  something that you know for which there                                  are commercial solutions which for                                  whatever reason don't necessarily make                                  sense in a commercial space                                  so it's it is definitely part of our                                  mandate to be a space for those                                  conversations to occur and I think                                  membership has been very active in                                  actually identifying some of those                                  opportunities                                  we did have some specific suggestions                                  from our last round of member surveys                                  and I think we'll talk about those in                                  the in the next section that catches us                                  up in the chat okay                                  so last chance for questions about the                                  projects I think we got a great yes I                                  just kinda have a general question I'm I                                  first of all I think it's remarkable                                  where the foundation is after one year                                  and so just hats off to everybody who's                                  helped lead this and all the committee's                                  I mean it's it's it's quite amazing very                                  impressive thank you to everyone the                                  members it's almost almost can't imagine                                  it now not existing it's only been                                  around for a year so it's very cool my                                  question was about and this was touched                                  on a little bit by some of the project                                  updates was wondering about like how we                                  feel like is there we're getting the                                  amount of engineering support and an                                  investment that we were kind of hoping                                  for with the projects that we have thus                                  far in other words you mentioned that                                  we've got                                                              money and I don't know how much of that                                  translates into actual engineering to                                  support the different projects how much                                  we're getting also the kind of the the                                  FTE equivalent contribution from the                                  different members I just kind of Kerry's                                  like what the general feeling is like                                  are we getting the kind of engineering                                  support and boost from the foundation                                  for these projects that we were                                  expecting I know it's it's kind of early                                  still in the process but canaries good                                  question any answers from the group                                  speaking speaking from Oban BTB I would                                  say absolutely alright just having any                                  attention and open the XRS the benefit                                  of this right so I I have a comment                                  because I want to echo what what Steve                                  said I think it's pretty amazing what's                                  been accomplished in the foundation so                                  far                                  a lot of it has been a transition to                                  some commonality and stewardship and a                                  bunch of other things I really believe                                  that when we transition to when the FTE                                  equivalents are applied to the projects                                  in the foundation as opposed to just any                                  open source project that I think that                                  that is for me a major part of what I                                  think their discussion should have                                  because I think that will change the                                  nature of stuff I think people who are                                  contributing at the higher level of                                  putting the dollars forward will be able                                  to see value back for what it is that                                  they're doing and there's more of a                                  direct correlation so I think that the                                  focus on the FTE and seeing return from                                  that is really going to be centered                                  around when we can make that transition                                  and that's I was going to bring up a                                  little later as I think that that's                                  something that the foundation needs to                                  be talking about maybe not solving here                                  but as part of the governing or the tax                                  or the other activities that has to                                  occur before people start losing                                  momentum over some of that I I just want                                  to add that I agree that it will be                                  great like right now I think we don't                                  have any metric on whether the members                                  are putting the FTEs in at all I mean we                                  can see that a lot of them are but like                                  there's no it's not recorded anywhere                                  but I'm less concerned about what you                                  just mentioned about the in project                                  project because as far as I know like I                                  haven't come across anyone who said we                                  are doing our FTE but in a non-work                                  project like I don't know any instance                                  of someone claiming that they're putting                                  their FTE outside so I like I don't know                                  if that'll be a major transition or not                                  on the USD or Alembic or stuff like that                                  are they counting that's where do they                                  claim that that's their FTE we've never                                  lost the question to be honest I mean I                                  think that except in the case of the                                  server                                  that we ran recently and a couple of                                  people did actually suggest projects                                  that were sort of out of a cool set but                                  at the same time is I think everyone has                                  noted we haven't I think the discussions                                  around this particularly at the time                                  when we didn't have a significant number                                  of projects obviously didn't create a                                  tight exclusion on what it was that                                  activity it was never time to do it                                  before now and it may not be now but                                  part of both the value question for                                  people who take the risk of putting                                  their project that's near and dear to                                  their heart into the foundation and                                  people who are putting up the funding to                                  be able to correlate some of that a                                  little bit together I think is going to                                  be a critical part of the next phase of                                  evolution of this group not detracting                                  from everything that has been done it's                                  just it's phenomenal I mean like Steve                                  says it's hard to imagine that this                                  hasn't always been here and maybe                                  there's a little bit of lead time for                                  that transition because again it's you                                  know people are putting the resources on                                  things they care about but if there is a                                  transition to hey it's a full-time                                  engineer and that engineer will be there                                  job will be to work here just I guess                                  would just be like hey that's a goal for                                  a year and then people will need warning                                  for it that's it that's why I'm saying                                  it needs to it there needs to be a clear                                  path to this however and whenever you do                                  it in the case of only openexr it's kind                                  of an example of getting the band back                                  together again                                  just calling up the people and talking                                  to Minda going on tour I think what we                                  what we haven't been successful at I                                  don't have much of a mechanism of doing                                  is identifying a chunk of work that                                  needs to be done that we don't have the                                  capacity of doing and going out and                                  seeking somebody to do it exactly I                                  think that's one my bigger question goes                                  to is like what what is our capacity to                                  as we as we look forward like what is                                  our capacity to adopt new projects do we                                  actually have enough resources for the                                  projects that we currently have I know                                  we want to we want to do more but I also                                  want to ensure that like the projects                                  that we have are six                                  and thrive before I don't know we get                                  too far ahead of ourselves                                  yeah to Chris's point I we never thought                                  of one ft is a single person committed                                  to this because the expertise of the                                  virus projects lies at different                                  individuals it's more that you know                                  there's two months of this guy in three                                  months of that girl and what-have-you                                  right and so it's a it's can become                                  nuanced when you start and think of it                                  that way I have a team of                                              know there's a few weeks of this person                                  and seven weeks at that person had                                  frosting is the best way to do it I get                                  it provides the most value to the to the                                  virus endeavors and then then the other                                  thing to mention is just that aside the                                  FTE commitment from from the premiere                                  members there's there's a large budget                                  there's funds that are being committed                                  by by premiere and general members alike                                  and those don't all go to just funding                                  these meetings and chairs and tables and                                  stuff like that yeah but they also can                                  go start to go to and I think that's one                                  of the things that we'll be focusing on                                  in terms of developer engagement this                                  year they can also go to funding some of                                  those things that are here's this                                  project in order to get this project                                  over into Academy Software Foundation                                  this is the kind of help the support                                  that they need that they look for in                                  order to do that and that's a reason to                                  pull them in that's I think that's                                  exactly what we're here to do so I have                                  a couple of comments to make one is that                                  I was struck by the fact that I think in                                  the survey results openexr figured as                                  the project that was apparently most you                                  know the most common target of people's                                  self-reported you know FTE contributions                                  but at the same time it was also a                                  project where Kerry called out the fact                                  that you know he feels in some ways the                                  lack of that engagement and perhaps that                                  speaks to the difference between a more                                  diffused that have no where they were                                  involved but we're not necessarily                                  actually commutable as a resource that                                  we were discussing in that in that                                  conversation the other just sort of                                  follows that through I think it is very                                  important that we work out                                  ourselves how we're going to try and you                                  know make these transitions or make best                                  use of the commitments that we have but                                  I suspect that this is something that                                  arises in all of the communities and                                  foundations that the Linux Foundation is                                  has dealt with so I'm very interested to                                  sort of hear what experiences we may be                                  able to learn from that's where I come                                  up with an answer right yeah I mean this                                  is this is a common thing you know                                  projects can only really move as fast as                                  the contributors and committers allow                                  them to I think there's certainly a                                  number of different aspects of things                                  that I think that the first set is just                                  setting a level set one of the things we                                  started doing with all of these projects                                  earlier this year                                  is putting one of our new tools called                                  dev analytics on each of the projects                                  because we wanted to answer the first                                  question of what does the diversity look                                  like in each project from a contributor                                  standpoint because what we see is a                                  healthy sustainable project is if any                                  one of the major organizations                                  contributing can walk away and the                                  project can continue on so if all is so                                  if we look at an open VDB and                                  three-quarters of the contributors are                                  from Dreamworks that's not very                                  sustainable but if one third are then                                  that is sustainable and especially if                                  that's a growing amount over time so                                  we're combining this with also looking                                  at you know sort of different                                  methodologies such as just sort of like                                  what's the economic value to recreate                                  some of this I've done some early                                  analysis is that that I want to                                  hopefully share with attack some but I                                  think it all hones back into that same                                  sort of thing of you know I think                                  there's one question here of how can we                                  assess what's sort of the FTE or                                  whatever the contribution for                                  organizations looks like and then on the                                  second of how can we grow that time or                                  and assess whether are we meeting the                                  demands that the project needs for                                  growth or we behind the curve so more to                                  come there but I think we're starting at                                  the analysis point and I would say we                                  did ask in our members survey about                                  where the FTEs were going it was a                                  fairly even split across the five                                  projects and for people who were                                  contributing to other projects like USD                                  they were still also putting resources                                  into our project so it wasn't like I                                  don't think we have any one member who's                                  putting their FTEs towards completely                                  towards a project outside the foundation                                  so you know the big ones hobbies are                                  coming up being USD                                  I think there's small also some evidence                                  of people not contributing to a specific                                  project but - that's the ICD                                  infrastructure like we heard jf called                                  out earlier today and certainly we've                                  done that our fair share of that on the                                  Animal Logic side contributions mean a                                  lot of different things to projects one                                  is writing code                                  another is writing documentation another                                  is helping coordinate efforts and                                  infrastructure there's all sorts of                                  expertise is to make this successful so                                  also there's things yeah exactly exactly                                  and it's a hard question that every                                  project out there tries to wrap their                                  head around and that's something that                                  we're looking to spend more time and get                                  the right data points so we can assess                                  that for these projects going forward                                  yeah and it was a super useful coal I                                  forget a couple months ago about use                                  cases and deployment scenarios and                                  examples that all of this projects that                                  are relied on and again that you know                                  you gotta remember that these are                                  contributions and it takes time to put                                  them together correctly and have                                  examples that are relevant to people                                  like it's it's no easy I think it's                                  harder than dogs to be honest good                                  examples I have true examples it's easy                                  but have examples are useful to people                                  it's actually very hard yeah there's                                  also those of us at companies that have                                  large legal departments and want to make                                  sure that work that you've already done                                  that you want to contribute you need to                                  you know run it through a lot of things                                  so just saying this is why we've spent a                                  lot of time with the projects and                                  licensing over the past year I think you                                  saw little dabbles of that in some of                                  the slides and I applaud the TSE                                  chairpersons who attempted to talk to                                  vex I know it's not a native thing but                                  you know I think as this foundation was                                  founded that was one of the big goals                                  having a common contribution framework                                  especially having people on common                                  licenses and especially OSI compliant                                  ones so you're not having to go to your                                  lawyers and explain to them why is this                                  weird license coming up that you've                                  never heard of                                  that you're trying to contribute to yeah                                  a lot of work has been done that doesn't                                  necessarily mean that it has been shared                                  yet exactly where there can be exactly                                  we're not finished we're just starting                                  that's this it's a great line of                                  discussion it's the core of what we do                                  so we want that content that discussion                                  to continue here or after the fact in                                  terms of our looking forward discussion                                  here these are proposed topics in the                                  last                                                              discussions that we that I'd like to                                  bring up and we'll also have at the end                                  a general ready we miss questions in                                  terms of topics so moving on on the                                  first one with regards to survey we                                  mentioned that we surveyed ourselves in                                  a number of ways and there is a proposal                                  for a survey from Nick Cannon that I                                  would like him to talk about here give                                  us a brief description from the ves VFX                                  reference platform point of view yeah                                  thank you David yeah and then this is                                  really an early idea so it's but it's                                  driven primarily by two things one is we                                  hope to make some more changes to the                                  VEX reference platform this year with a                                  focus on broadening support from Linux                                  to other major operating systems as well                                  and we're also seeing you know vendors                                  and software providers making decisions                                  based on incomplete market data and you                                  know Linux is still a very important                                  platform for this industry and we need                                  to make sure that we're advocating for                                  that and people understand the size the                                  importance of that market as well as the                                  growing Mac and Windows base as well in                                  some o studios so the ideal would be to                                  go out and do a more of a studio survey                                  and try and collect some comprehensive                                  information without making the survey so                                  long that everyone                                  turned off doing it to try and encourage                                  people to participate we would anonymize                                  or actually act with we don't use                                  released we'd guarantee confidentiality                                  and just report our aggregate data and                                  the kind of things we're thinking of of                                  collecting a operating system versions                                  what do you want currently what do you                                  plan to move to over the next year or                                  two window manager specifically on linux                                  is is a thing what we're starting to see                                  is that the we haven't been getting                                  premium drivers or Linux because vendors                                  are confused by all the windows managers                                  in use and so they think it's it's it's                                  not worth effort try and do premium                                  drivers on that platform and we think we                                  can be can be consuella them otherwise                                  so a number of hosts of different OSS                                  and memory size and render farm size                                  splitting cloud and on prime                                  the we have a whole list and probably                                  can't do it can't do everything but                                  we've been but but the idea is you know                                  it's is they do we think it's an                                  interesting thing worth doing certainly                                  from a VFX reference platform via state                                  committee we think would be valuable                                  data to share openly with across the                                  industry of course studios and i meant                                  some providers and we do this in                                  conjunction with having software                                  foundation to give it some increased                                  credibility and reach and and as well                                  and maybe if successful is something we                                  could do every year or to try and get a                                  picture of how the market is evolving                                  and how the infrastructure and platform                                  is evolving over time so that from a                                  again from having software pack                                  foundation perspective for all the                                  projects they know what they're trying                                  to target and run a better understanding                                  of what where the studios are going so                                  they can target their the software more                                  appropriately those are some of the                                  ideas like who grabbed me offers I can                                  or my specifics about some specific                                  examples of why we think is good                                  beneficial so as a general statement the                                  Academy Software Foundation will would                                  very much would be glad to team up with                                  the VES reference platform the FX                                  reference platform to to do a survey                                  like that and if we if we think                                  collectively that it's a good thing to                                  do and that would be a question for the                                  group and in terms of what Nick                                  mentioned also contribution of are there                                  this may be the opportunity to as a                                  studio a number of important questions                                  if there are other data point that you                                  think would be useful would be Glade                                  we'll be glad to engage with with your                                  group Nick to to make a joint survey                                  okay thank you                                  yeah I'd encourage you also to include                                  the products under the committee here to                                  see what version they're actually                                  running yeah that's a good idea actual                                  software versions what are they using my                                  plan sees right I would say this yeah                                  this is an excellent opportunity to try                                  and meet that other question that we                                  heard about which was studio uptake of                                  some of our open source components to                                  potentially right we anticipate making                                  this something that we could attempt to                                  repeat over time it sounds like this                                  would actually be you know no III think                                  of all the value and this is seeing                                  trends over time so I think if we can                                  get it right and have some consistency                                  year-on-year then yeah useful okay so                                  we'll take that on diversity and                                  inclusion we talked a lot about that                                  topic and we know that we have to to                                  transform moving forward our our                                  demographic that's called it that way at                                  the foundation here and in the group                                  around the table I have a this is a poll                                  here in a general question some of you                                  have experienced or than others and how                                  to improve diversity in your                                  organization so this is a poll if you                                  take your phones and log again you will                                  see these four pre pre written                                  suggestions in terms of how we can                                  improve diversity on this poll you can                                  vote for the each one of the item that                                  is there move it up move it down and you                                  can also type new ones so if once you're                                  there if you can write these four points                                  and and if you have further ideas about                                  diversity please feel free to                                  to add them and as we're doing that if                                  you also have some success stories that                                  you would like to share with us in any                                  any program or any actions that you took                                  that brought diversity to your                                  organization that would be the time to                                  share with the group                                  no one has suggestions I'm going to put                                  someone on the spot I'll speak up and                                  say I think one of the challenges we've                                  had so far in terms of identifying                                  people I mean I see the mentorship                                  program is getting really high up there                                  are and I love that idea the problem is                                  is that we don't have anybody right now                                  to be the mentors so I mean we haven't                                  even identified them in terms of you                                  know gender especially we haven't                                  identified that many women within the                                  foundation and I think one of the                                  promises I think there are a lot more                                  women and other diverse you know people                                  working on the projects but because we                                  only have one person interfacing on the                                  tack a lot of times we don't even know                                  who those people are so even having our                                  own members just say hey these are the                                  people on my team internally who are                                  working on the project that could be                                  potentially good to highlight on the                                  website or be involved in things I think                                  would be good or you know any even                                  outside of our members as well I think                                  sometimes people are just so buried                                  within their organizations it's hard to                                  find them I do think if you want to do                                  mentorship I mean this is we've had this                                  conversation before about you know in my                                  particular case reaching inside my                                  company to get people to come up this                                  and there's a big time commitment to be                                  involved with this but there are I mean                                  I can think of five you know people of                                  different genders than me that I could                                  reach out to immediately inside the                                  organization saying would you you know                                  you're a software developer would you be                                  willing to mentor someone in this and                                  maybe you know I probably get one or two                                  who would do that so I'm not necessarily                                  the mentor I'm not to say the right                                  person that you want to be the mentor if                                  we're especially if we're trying to do                                  it in this way but for people who want                                  to see themselves in something                                  imagine most of us could ask other                                  people in their organization that that                                  either are unable or unwilling to do the                                  commitment to be on the tack or to be on                                  whatever but they might be willing to be                                  a mentor or just a contributor to the                                  projects yes I mean we I've met you yeah                                  absolutely one of our Studios has just                                  to keep using gender as the example but                                  it's not the only one has a bunch of                                  talented women developers but like those                                  aren't necessarily the people who have                                  had their fingers in the open-source                                  projects but they could be recruited to                                  do so if it was important you know I was                                  just speaking specifically to the                                  mentorship thing yeah we don't have to                                  be the mentors we can go find mentors in                                  our company when this is just to repeat                                  a note that's come up in previous                                  discussions but you know one potential                                  limitation of course to mentorship would                                  appear to be the fact that at least in                                  some parts of the structure there are                                  you know there's a representative aspect                                  to the positions so for example on the                                  governing board and the voting positions                                  and attack what's represented is a very                                  practical way of you know opening that                                  up somewhat is to have essentially you                                  know job share for those positions from                                  companies or other roles where you know                                  the mentor and mentee would basically                                  take turns or might sit together in that                                  context but sort of only have a single                                  representative voice for the purposes of                                  voting and other things I think there                                  are some strategies like that that we                                  can share and encourage which would be                                  very effective to dealing with the                                  wording the set of opportunities I guess                                  for access and also make it easier for                                  people who haven't played those roles in                                  other organizations as many of us really                                  have to make this their first time in                                  you know in such a position and there's                                  a note of Chris and Chris was missing                                  okay fine                                  but Chris was talking about this of                                  where as the as the new Autodesk                                  representative that the person that they                                  had being the representative initially                                  was you know more of an open-source                                  advocate and now you have someone who is                                  you know senior director of the product                                  stuff I can easily imagine this as well                                  for us of where you know there's a usual                                  suspect usual suspects aspect to the                                  people that are sitting around this                                  but over time it might become easier to                                  hand that off to people inside your                                  organization who are not like you but                                  that have a lot to contribute to this                                  thing and that could be the sort of                                  handing off and Daniel and I talked                                  about the notion of like could you                                  timeshare a position on the tack or                                  something so that's a way towards that                                  well the other thing too is that                                  technically I think you could join the                                  tack                                  they just don't wouldn't have voting                                  rights so you could have more than one                                  person I mean right but they don't want                                  to go too often it's a commitment it you                                  know every two weeks is like that but if                                  you said to them every two months or                                  every three months that's a different                                  yeah so I'd like to add a little bit to                                  the discussion here so a lot of this has                                  to do with building a new pipeline or                                  building the pipeline that's more                                  diverse more inclusive go looking places                                  we don't ordinarily look because in                                  Emily Ella and I were talking about this                                  earlier in that in in our open source                                  world in our industry you know most of                                  the people already know about our open                                  source software so and are involved you                                  know to a certain degree so where else                                  can we go                                  so I'm actually the one to put up on the                                  board there you know partner with other                                  diversity and inclusion initiatives and                                  it just so happens the Academy has a                                  diversity and inclusion program actually                                  have a number of them the the one I've                                  got in mind is the academy gold talent                                  development program and some of the                                  companies involved in the software                                  foundation or even in not members but                                  around the table here participate in                                  that and that's an internship program                                  directed towards college-age students                                  and there's a follow on mentorship                                  program with that and I'm a little sad                                  to report that SciTech has kind of tiny                                  tiny representation you know within the                                  program it's a lot of production type                                  jobs so I think there's a real                                  opportunity to get visible there and                                  help build that pipeline and maybe even                                  find some people that really don't know                                  about all of this so just just a thought                                  and I know there are other programs                                  within the studios and one of the                                  companies that participate here and we                                  could potentially leverage all that and                                  change change the face of                                  I like all the faces in the room but we                                  need some more diverse ones right I                                  didn't introduce myself before because I                                  was eating a sandwich I'm Danielle I'm                                  at Marvel Studios and we're actually a                                  member of the Academy gold program and                                  this year when we put in for an intern                                  we asked for a computer science major                                  and because we realized that we had more                                  computer science needs then production                                  needs so that's what we did it's a good                                  idea fantastic thanks for following the                                  the pitch here you know we've had one                                  success story that are really with                                  Christina                                  there was another former colleague that                                  I reached out to a while ago tried to                                  talk into getting involved with the                                  project and I think I didn't do a good                                  enough job of kind of selling her on                                  what's in it for her you know what I                                  participate because it's fun and you                                  know a lot of the hours that I put in                                  are not actually covered by the company                                  it's just um do it because we we enjoy                                  it and I mean just I hate to use the                                  word networking but it's networking it's                                  the people you get to know and I think                                  that's a really valuable thing I think                                  if that's a carrot that we can hang out                                  there for people just as an opportunity                                  to you know rub shoulders get to know                                  other people um but I think we need to                                  be a little clearer about that                                  proposition of what's in it for them you                                  know the openexr steering committee you                                  know in almost a year                                  we've we've never voted on anything you                                  know the actual sort of voting aspect of                                  the steering committee is just not                                  something that we ever we just figure                                  out what to do and do it kind of                                  implicitly I feel like that offering                                  somebody a you know not just you know                                  here fix some bugs and check them in you                                  know and will thank you for it go a                                  little bit further and say you know                                  we'll give you this title I think that's                                  the that's something that we                                  can easily do with little downside to                                  the project yeah I mean if I would                                  actually parallel in some of the other                                  communities that I work with its that's                                  exactly how things start you know                                  community has a need there's usually                                  somebody new coming to the community                                  doesn't know all the ins and outs of                                  that project but somebody within there                                  is willing to work with them to help                                  them get to that point and then they're                                  building that knowledge up they're able                                  to sort of you know rise within the                                  project naturally and then they're able                                  to give that back you know kind of repay                                  that back and sort of the next round                                  around so well I will always say on                                  diversity on one front you had to have a                                  very conscious look at it by the other                                  half of it sometimes it can just be very                                  pragmatically right in front of you of                                  things to take advantage of and I think                                  I think Christine is a really great                                  story of somebody who just popped in                                  there and I think it's a really central                                  figure to the project right now that's                                  great so thank you Andy we will look                                  into the Academy Gold Talent                                  initiative that's what it's called an                                  under development program look into that                                  and circulate it and thank you for                                  everyone for filling up the survey that                                  gives us more data points and that's                                  something that we will focus on as we                                  move forward                                  moving on to the next topic engaging                                  with the developer community developers                                  so we have our group we have our family                                  and but there's a lot more a lot many                                  more developers out there they probably                                  know about the Academy Software                                  Foundation most of them by now but many                                  of them are very busy in their daily                                  life and many of them not involved with                                  open source software is are there new                                  ways that we can engage with the                                  software engineers in our industry hey                                  then that's a good that's a good start I                                  assume that means using some of our                                  dollars to to hire some of them                                  if I want to add some color to your                                  comment don't hesitate                                  I have a I'm going to write it by me to                                  say it first a crazy idea should we                                  think about having in that word of some                                  type so someone wrote it                                  I'll get my vote for the best software                                  development the best open-source                                  software development of the year as part                                  of this I take our words sure we can                                  investigate that naive as it may sound I                                  think there might be some bug in having                                  a small space for the foundation this                                  high-tech ceremony and just you know                                  mention it                                  I don't know that yeah if the real you                                  yeah yeah so last year at the site tech                                  Awards we did have a kind of a PSA type                                  of promo real and it was also part of                                  the discussion with Emily earlier as and                                  we have more time to plan for that                                  because the awards have been moved to                                  June yeah here so our outreach committee                                  you know can give some fun to what                                  what's the message and considering the                                  audience and what you want to accomplish                                  so so we know we've got that the idea of                                  you know some kind of compatible award                                  that that's a whole nother topic we do                                  have some people that are on the site                                  tech awards main committee steering                                  committee as well here that might                                  consider that they'd be better suited to                                  do that than I would I'm gonna make a                                  provocative statement and say that the                                  people that are involved in judging and                                  attending and winning the SciTech awards                                  overlaps very strongly with the people                                  already involved in a SWF so I don't                                  yeah                                  I don't know how much that's good for                                  engaging in people who aren't already                                  aware of or part of the process I throw                                  that out strongly agree with that                                  sentiment Larry unless there was some                                  other way that the awards were broadcast                                  or something to a broader audience                                  okay at that point if there was                                  something like that then we could                                  communicate this to the brother                                  engineering community and you know this                                  I think I would currently are not about                                  certain categories of things in the past                                  but if there was something that was                                  about software engineering this year you                                  have a project submitted you can win in                                  a word and it can be something different                                  than the plaque or the but we could take                                  something like that and then broadcast                                  it to the larger group of folks perhaps                                  there's a question from the zoom that                                  says could the foundation helped push                                  trusted partner Network to open up for                                  directly contributing to the projects                                  for Studios behind strict security                                  restrictions I believe it would help at                                  least smaller studios without a large                                  development apartment contribute I I'm                                  not sure indiscernible City mutation                                  right if you know access doing direct                                  access to the internet to download open                                  source libraries and compile them and                                  within your production environment ebn                                  doesn't doesn't stop downloads or stop                                  shops loads it's the other direction                                  that's programmatic and and I think it's                                  the nature the point so it's if you if                                  the developers want to contribute and                                  that's an upload from their own network                                  yeah okay how can you contribute                                  directly from the network if part of                                  your FTE job is to do this coding yeah I                                  shouldn't comment any further not a                                  nation                                  so I don't want my developers to upload                                  I want to sign off the upload and to see                                  those out there for that reason yeah is                                  some ongoing discussion off mic here                                  which I won't repeat for the room but                                  thank you I will say that was part of                                  the point that I tried to capture with                                  promote modern software development                                  processes and environments I think                                  actually getting to the point clear                                  organizations need to and want to have                                  controls about contribution but ideally                                  those things are as we always say there                                  should be the domain of policy rather                                  than just you know frustration and                                  friction and that there are definitely                                  things that we can do as we have done                                  with some of the choices we made for CI                                  for example excuse me which make it much                                  simpler for people to engage and one of                                  the consequences I think of the security                                  environment we have worked in is that                                  you know many of the technologies we use                                  are a little bit isolated and different                                  from what you know developers are                                  working with elsewhere or you know                                  people are learning in school and                                  there's definitely an opportunity for us                                  to try and actually make sure that you                                  know developing on our projects and you                                  know is a comfortable and modern                                  experience and similarly and this speaks                                  to the sort of download side of the                                  question as well                                  that the security policies that are in                                  place in studios are not detrimental to                                  work clothes that developers typically                                  use and that means you know sensible and                                  realistic access to you know source code                                  and data repositories and other things                                  you know where that makes sense and                                  under whatever a specific restriction                                  studios want to impose but you know I                                  guess the question I have for the room                                  as well is you know is that something                                  that the SWF can meaningfully take as                                  its mandate to try and add the cake for                                  you know effective saw our development                                  environments and workflows who within                                  our industry actually I took one point                                  from what you said                                  should we talk to educational                                  institution to show the maybe the                                  advanced students how to do software                                  development at this scale because you're                                  I've never seen it taught but people                                  don't live in university they're                                          should have a sense that this is how                                  larger organizations operate and I don't                                  know that they do and instead they at                                  least it should be similar ability for                                  somebody to follow a course or something                                  on this that's that's being mounting my                                  habit or vice versa but yes but I do                                  agree and not just cuz we work at the                                  same company that that's a good idea to                                  use the foundation to be able to say                                  reach out to the TPN or CDC si because a                                  lot of like Larry was saying there's a                                  lot of overlap between a lot of these                                  people on these committees and                                  establishing some clear workflows that                                  are essentially automatic like that                                  would be passing a TPN audit would be                                  valuable I think to not just the large                                  players who have already figured it out                                  for themselves but to the smaller                                  players alright well noted thank you                                     minutes left in our meeting I would like                                  to ask if you have new member companies                                  new companies that could become members                                  of the foundation and there's the poll                                  if there are companies that are not here                                  that you think we should be looking into                                  we'll make it short that's a good one                                  it's a software vendor studios and to                                  the point of our goal to go for general                                  members and smaller studios smaller                                  studios that you know that are starting                                  to use open source or thinking about                                  contributing don't know necessarily how                                  this is good                                  [Music]                                  many new names there I'll give you ten                                  more seconds                                  before we move on to the next topic all                                  right three two one                                  [Music]                                  moving on working group so we have to                                  talk about this one as it's been the                                  topic at multiple level today                                  so working groups we want to start doing                                  working groups we have a basic process                                  for managing them along the lines of                                  those bullets that we described before                                  and we've spoken about USD and so first                                  I'd like to provide the opportunity for                                  everyone to list topics that you think                                  we should do u.s. group and working                                  group on so R as was mentioned one                                  person read R as write res as one of the                                  options please or I'll do it                                  so only vote for the res that has a vote                                  already and as we continue that and we                                  we stated our intent to help USD I'd                                  like to invite Steve who is at Pixar and                                  in charge of USD to maybe tell us Steve                                  if you want how do you think at this                                  point the foundation can best help you                                  as you're developing USD moving forward                                  full disclosure I haven't really thought                                  that much about it I just kind of start                                  talking to rob in the last few days                                  actually about the idea we we definitely                                  could use more help so we're we're very                                  overwhelmed both emotionally positively                                  by the the adoption and excitement                                  around USD we're also overwhelmed from                                  an engineering standpoint we we do spend                                  a lot of time engineers just maintaining                                  the forums and responding to questions                                  they're very invested and dedicated and                                  they feel like they're the ones that                                  have to answer so and I realized that                                  we're still building other Studios are                                  still building and vendors of building                                  expertise about USD but be great to have                                  helped with that so that our engineers                                  could get kind of offload some of even                                  just the forum discussion would be a                                  would be a huge a huge help as well as                                  of course helping us deal with with                                  closing issues etc I haven't thought                                  about exactly how we would do this but                                  we I mean like I said we would we would                                  certainly welcome additional help and if                                  it if it made sense we could maybe do                                  something at we could host a thing at                                  Pixar or somewhere else where we could                                  also kind of bring in people who could                                  potentially help us more maybe to give a                                  additional training or discussion with                                  the original developers to learn more                                  about USD I mean open to any ideas                                  around that okay that's great and and                                  and so are we in the idea of doing a                                  session that's                                  the formation of this working group and                                  what is it that it could do to start                                  with a meeting at Pixar or with a number                                  of people from your team and and people                                  in the foundation who have expertise                                  people like John and others at the                                  foundation that have operated working                                  groups in all kinds of different Emily                                  also in all kind of different groups in                                  larger industry like the automotive                                  industry and another software industry                                  we can then listen more closely about                                  what what is needed what we can do from                                  our position and put that in writing                                  into the goals of that particular                                  working group John Emily you have                                  experience in these other industries are                                  there something you want to mention                                  about that and two in terms of models                                  that we could take to get it started                                  excuse me yes I think it would be good                                  to probably maybe Steve have maybe a                                  little bit of a conversation on some of                                  the background just sort of                                  understanding some of the the people at                                  play here to dig into it but it's                                  certainly something we've done both in                                  topical areas we've also done it                                  vertically so there's a lot of different                                  ways that it can modeled the nice thing                                  is if this flows within sort of the                                  natural technical community structure so                                  it's something that flows within to the                                  TAC so you're kind of getting all the                                  right connection points there so yeah I                                  mean there's I guess the short answer is                                  yes but these also things each one's a                                  little bit different so it's probably                                  good just to understand all the details                                  and we certainly want to customize given                                  that it's our first one we have that                                  opportunity to really adapt it to to the                                  need of this of the specific project                                  that we want to support I also wonder                                  David if it might be interesting to                                  spend a bit of time before we kick it                                  off or kick off an on site just                                  understanding what the goal of that                                  group is that was one thing I loved in                                  their description the working group had                                  a goal and the word USD is not a goal                                  right so what is the goal of that group                                  is the goal to                                  help scale and support the USD project                                  is the goal to put some things around                                  the project so it's easier for studios                                  to invest in and cut into go to their                                  pipeline or is the goal something else                                  right because I think if we're clear on                                  what we're trying to do it may suggest a                                  way of getting there so I was thinking                                  about that when they said that what Jen                                  again I the same response of where it's                                  like oh you know it's time boxed and                                  it's trying to solve a problem and so                                  one of the things I was writing down was                                  some notes on that is we should that                                  group should not try and address the                                  things that are still very much in play                                  of like you know programmable materials                                  and coding them in their animation                                  curves rigging like those are a lot of                                  things that people would like to do with                                  USD but they're not on the you know or                                  some of them are being worked on but                                  there's a whole bunch of things like                                  backlot assets like how do you will                                  organize a given asset in a really                                  nicely well-structured USD way like what                                  kind of layers should you have you know                                  should you be using subdivision surfaces                                  should you have variants on the preview                                  meats or like there's things of where                                  like the pieces are all out there                                  different Studios probably have                                  different opinions on that but if we                                  could be showing some reasonable best                                  practice so some studio that was                                  considering it would be like oh that's a                                  yeah we could do that you know and                                  that's not exactly the way the big dogs                                  that you know it Pixar Disney or or                                  Animal Logic or whatever are doing it                                  but it's it's a reasonable way to do it                                  that could be really helpful I think and                                  just to be clear like I love the                                  suggestion we're the start from rob of                                  you know jumping and helping in the                                  forums like I'm definitely not against                                  helping in which we're trying to do a                                  little bit of that from an auditors side                                  as well but I just think would be                                  interesting to just make sure we                                  understand what people would love to get                                  out of that before we assume a direction                                  and jump in okay so one area I'm curious                                  about and I think Gordon's question is                                  is is very cute with us stay there                                  obviously sort of many many facets and                                  if you look at the forums much discussed                                  there are definitely different themes or                                  threads of discussion there summer loves                                  the you know how do I do this variety                                  and that's you know fairly obvious that                                  as the knowledge in the community Rises                                  then particularly if you know encouraged                                  and empowered and other individuals                                  outside it because I can definitely                                  contribute usefully there but what also                                  happens a lot is that you know there are                                  much more difficult questions of how do                                  I do this where the answer is not a                                  technical one but a you know a matter of                                  sort of philosophy or best practice or                                  you know schema design to put things                                  into a particular USD kind of context                                  and in that space I guess there's an                                  obvious question well what we think                                  about you know a working group or some                                  other structure you know offering some                                  kind of environment for decisions of                                  those choices I mean you could easily                                  kind of probably put it show up every                                  one spine but I sort of calling this ER                                  you know the architecture Review Board                                  kind of analogy but I think as USD grows                                  something of that nature is necessary                                  and that can be separate from projected                                  option it can be quite separate from                                  project an option and it might make                                  sense and I think I've kind of heard a                                  few people say this is to think about                                  the working groups maybe you also within                                  the dimension I think somebody mentioned                                  I think maybe was Gordon you is like a                                  time bound activity so there's a clear                                  goal upfront this is what we're trying                                  to achieve out of it this is you know                                  the deliverable that we're expecting to                                  come out of it and this is sort of the                                  general timeline the we know that we're                                  expecting get it done in it also kind of                                  helps Center the group because I think                                  that's always one of the anti-patterns                                  with working groups is it just becomes a                                  group that just keeps on going on going                                  on and you really wanted to make sure                                  it's delivering value back to the                                  project its delivering value back to the                                  community so the beauty is this model                                  you can spin up as many as one so if                                  maybe if you need six around USD to have                                  all the main key points that's something                                  to contentiously be done in just at this                                  other time bound i think is critical                                  just as an interesting data point i've                                  done a fair bit of research recently                                  around innovation models in software                                  development in our company and the magic                                  number a lot of people settled on is                                  three months like if you go past three                                  months and say okay you guys have this                                  goal in a year                                  two years the or just no time at all                                  it'll just meander whereas okay it's a                                  big problem let's break it down what are                                  we trying to get done in three months or                                  one month like pick a time pick a goal                                  it'll never be the whole problem where                                  are we starting and then I think it'd be                                  great to maybe as part of defining                                  element maturing our working group model                                  to have some way for that to kind of                                  connect back both across the tech and                                  the governing board so that we can kind                                  of get that that high level steering                                  happening as well that's good short                                  timeframe this is great feedback and we                                  we will form the working group shortly                                  and we will reach out to Pixar and                                  define what these parameters should be                                  to help us D a key project in our                                  industry I think we all know that and we                                  all know why but it's worth stating                                  again because here we have high-level                                  system and data structure for movie                                  motion picture projects that if it was                                  adopted widely would make it much easier                                  to exchange data movie data between                                  different projects and there's a great                                  value to that as constant content is                                  exploding and the demands on production                                  are becoming ever more stringent to                                  deliver faster and better and there is a                                  lot of opportunity for interaction                                  between the movie projects and all sorts                                  of other media USD is coming at a time                                  where it is needed and here in our                                  neutral platform this is a place where                                  we can help when there is a project like                                  this that happens that's our intent so                                  we'll see how we go about it                                  and there's the there's the slide so                                  Universal scene description how can we                                  have Pixar with us D there are some item                                  here include you as these sessions at                                  open source that is one simple action                                  item that                                  we should probably do for cigarettes and                                  highlight the work of you is the early                                  adopters so many of you and give away to                                  a form use our megaphone use our website                                  use our outreach budget to start putting                                  forward the good example of you as the                                  use in a similar way that we're                                  highlighting the work of software                                  engineers we can highlight success                                  stories alongside with Pixar sample data                                  sets it certainly would be useful I can                                  share a little bit of our experience at                                  Epic Games implementing USD which is                                  known that we are working on that and                                  sample data set and also users of USD                                  where are they how to find them is a                                  question that engineers have had and of                                  course we can all go to Pixar perhaps                                  that's part of one of the one of the                                  issues that at Pixar you have a lot of                                  demand coming from everywhere and if we                                  can help in some way alleviate that the                                  mentor you can focus on engineering USD                                  is something that would be good                                  that's you all right and more seconds on                                  that one                                  thank you this will be very helpful as                                  we tackle our working group no one's put                                  up just antics are more money synthetics                                  are more money yes um oh okay                                  just a suggestion all right you fix our                                  money you can write that they think                                  you've got people's main give you the                                  information afterwards all right so                                  before we're too much overtime here's                                  the last one                                  so this was our second form we covered a                                  lot of ground we covered some high-level                                  thinking we updated everyone on our                                  projects and the great core work that is                                  done in the TAC we discuss different                                  topics is there anything here that we                                  did not touch wrong that we should have                                  it's the last question of the day after                                  that we're done with the meeting it                                  would be nice for state-ranked oops                                  all right                                  so I have a question the first line mean                                  that the foundation should like hold the                                  one island kind of thing like have Daman                                  island and on the foundation service is                                  that some stuff that so people who are                                  trying to understand whether they're a                                  vendor or they're an artist like what                                  what qualifies like what you know it's                                  like she should have                                                     should have you should use you Tim's or                                  you should have that isn't in examples                                  of things of where you know use                                  subdivision surfaces organize it this                                  way these sorts of naming conventions if                                  you're not in the industry have                                  someplace you could look at that you'd                                  be like oh those are the kinds of things                                  that people would expect yeah that was a                                  some of the school send and done his                                  point on software development by writing                                  the asset structure same thing like the                                  guys in the they're teaching the schools                                  don't know this stuff right then                                  we can certainly explain to them what                                  they need to distribute yeah you could                                  imagine that being something that                                  studios would be like oh sure well even                                  if it's just new stuff that they're                                  gonna put their people on to make you                                  know like this is what we would consider                                  to be what what we would expect I mean a                                  few years ago Larry showed up I want to                                  say it was secret New Orleans and said                                  we should make a shared asset and then                                  you know eventually Disney shared the                                  Des Moines Ireland but another idea that                                  was vented at at the time was to host                                  students in the studios and drive them                                  to building an asset that was meant to                                  be shared from day one but it was                                  financed you know in collaboration with                                  education institutions yes that the                                  kitchen scene in USD U is made by a                                  bunch of students at the Carroll summer                                  yeah that kind of pattern right we                                  discussed the same idea for simulation                                  never happen                                  [Music]                                  that is the last question that I have                                  and it concludes if there is nothing                                  else it concludes our meeting for the                                  second forum of the Academy Software                                  Foundation we hope to see you at                                  SIGGRAPH for our open source day that's                                  our next big event and in a year be back

updates                                  and let it be known the work that's been                                  done here in the foundation if you have                                  comment and suggestions how to improve                                  the format also don't hesitate to let us                                  know and thank you very much both you
