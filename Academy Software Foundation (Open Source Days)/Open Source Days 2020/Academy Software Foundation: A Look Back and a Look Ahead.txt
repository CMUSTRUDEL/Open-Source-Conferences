                          open source day we had just been a year                                old and now we're two years old                                we put together a timeline here to                                in one snapshot give you and anyone in                                the audience who would be new to the                                foundation                                a bit of the background of where we came                                from                                um in a nutshell it all started in the                                scitec council                                and an investigation that lasted                                nearly two years on the topic of open                                source software in our industry and what                                could be done about it                                and at the end of it that investigation                                concluded we should create a foundation                                and the companies that are listed there                                under the uh the august                                                                                                               we're very grateful for these companies                                 to to go in take the risk                                 it was more than a theoretical                                 commitment there were also                                 some funding into that they had the                                 courage of their conviction                                 they came together and they created the                                 foundation um                                 the first project openvdb came shortly                                 thereafter                                 proposed by dreamworks with new members                                 that joined us                                 and then we had open color i o open exr                                 open q in quick succession with new                                 members coming in                                 and we had our first open source day a                                 year ago                                 with open timeline coming up as a new                                 project                                 and a new group of members joining in                                 september                                 we had apple and microsoft training and                                 about that time shortly thereafter                                 we reached a million dollar in funding                                 yearly funding for                                 our foundation which is an important                                 milestone because                                 in our industry there are many um                                 many organizations that are doing a lot                                 of good good work on a voluntary basis                                 but they don't always have the budget                                 here when we created the foundation um                                 having the capability                                 to the budget to to take to follow up on                                 what we wanted to do is very important                                 and we hit that milestone just before                                 corbin                                    hit us all uh in our in our lives both                                 personally and                                 and in our businesses and so we happened                                 to be                                 not prepared nobody was prepared for                                 covet                                                                    to enter into that                                 that moment in time and we continued our                                 work                                 as it turns out the open source model is                                 a remote collaboration model already                                 and so it was quite                                 natural for us to continue working                                 pretty much the way we had                                 uh there was a lot of disruptions in                                 people's lives and and                                 we we slowed down a little bit but we                                 were able to pick the pace quite                                 fast and then we had a number of new                                 members that joined us                                 um and culminating with today the                                 announcement that we did this morning                                 with unity technology conductor                                 technologies                                 and simpty joining us so in a nutshell                                 that's our history um and these                                 are the companies that are making the                                 foundation that are contributing                                 uh in um in engineering time                                 and also in funds to make the foundation

      the last six months or the last year in                                 fact have brought to all of our lives                                 the processes and projects of the                                 academy software foundation                                 have provided real resilience to uh the                                 activities that                                 we're involved in and all of our                                 projects have been able to continue                                 forward                                 uh with great progress and success                                 i'm going to highlight a little bit of                                 the activities that happen in and around                                 the tack and specifically things that                                 have happened                                 um that we've been able to initiate                                 within the last                                 year and particularly six months and                                 following uh the presentation i give rob                                 will be providing some                                 interesting details and the path forward                                 so we'll go back                                 we'll go through our projects a couple                                 of times in the next                                 sessions                                 yeah so um one initiative that we                                 really took on um following uh                                 following through in the last six months                                 was to take the model that we've been                                 successfully using                                 to develop technology outside of the                                 scope of any of our individual projects                                 you saw on the slide earlier that our                                 structure for the technical advisory                                 council                                 is one which brings together all of our                                 uh                                 projects and allows us to solve problems                                 and decide on                                 policies and direction that uh can                                 benefit all of those projects                                 so take it in the extra step of spinning                                 up                                 a number of working groups which allow                                 us to take on other problem areas which                                 are outside of the scope of any of                                 our current projects you'll see there                                 that we have four                                 working groups currently active and                                 emily introduced the diversity inclusion                                 working group which has been doing                                 very good work uh in that domain in the                                 more technical areas or the more                                 strictly technical areas of course we've                                 had the ci working group                                 from the very beginning of the                                 activities of the academy software                                 foundation                                 and that's the model that we've used for                                 these other working groups as well                                 we've had we have a very active working                                 group looking into open                                 sorry universal scene description um and                                 how we can add and support                                 that project uh which obviously is an                                 independent project                                 that is managed by pixar and                                 a working group established to help                                 our members and the broader industry and                                 particularly also of course the vendors                                 that are associated in our software                                 stack                                 on the transition from python                                      python                                                                  occupied many of us over the last year                                 so to dive into our projects now of                                 course we have                                 six very strong and active projects                                 differing in age and in their profiles                                 over the last year we've been able to                                 successfully                                 involve the academy software foundation                                 in the google summer of code project in                                 fact we've had three students active                                 over this period um for openexr                                 open timelineo and openq and that's been                                 a very valuable uh collaboration each of                                 the students has done very good work                                 and something we hope to continue in the                                 future an indeed a model that we're                                 looking for                                 looking at ourselves as far as good ways                                 of establishing communities                                 and supporting and extending those                                 communities around our projects                                 so to speak a little bit of each of the                                 projects in turn                                 and i'll note that all of our projects                                 do have                                 uh birds for feather sessions within the                                 open source days program                                 so please uh treat this as a quick                                 introduction as a hook                                 to go in and find more detail and                                 connect with those projects directly                                 so openvdb was our first uh project                                 accepted and adopted in the foundation                                 and i would really like to just leave                                 another underlining or underscore                                 for the very exciting announcement                                 they'll be making tomorrow so please do                                 join that session                                 it'll be worth your while                                 open colorio is another excellent                                 poster for uh the broadening of                                 support and processes that the academy                                 software foundation has been able to                                 assist and provide for a                                 well-established project                                 so um actually being able to bring                                 together the resources                                 and the different uh studios and                                 companies                                 to allow open color i o version two a                                 huge effort                                 uh to come together on a schedule that                                 was established                                 essentially last year for release now                                 that's a wonderful effort                                 congratulations to all all involved                                 openq is one of our more recently                                 joined or incubated projects and                                 sits a little bit apart from many of our                                 other projects in terms of being                                 a whole system that works with                                 distributed components unlike                                 a software library once again its                                 involvement in the foundation has really                                 been                                 vital to extend the use cases of this                                 software to allow                                 other studios and technology providers                                 to incorporate it in their                                 stack as a solution that can work for                                 a broader range of companies and                                 the participation in that project as you                                 can see from the contributors mentioned                                 there                                 brings together those different groups                                 with different backgrounds in a way that                                 certainly isn't possible for any                                 in-house or proprietary technology                                 which is of course the history of many                                 of our projects                                 openexr is of course                                 in some ways the grandfather of open                                 source projects                                 within our industry please note the                                 exciting new logo there                                 which is which perhaps um                                 what's the word i'm looking for the old                                 logo                                 was old and it provided a visual cue as                                 to the sort of uh the date of origin of                                 the project                                 new logo of course alives that a little                                 bit but is a                                 a very nice representation of the                                 functionality of                                 the project and is a good thing to move                                 forward                                 particularly as opdxr itself takes on a                                 more                                 modern face so one of the key                                 contributions                                 that google summer of code project has                                 made has been able to support some of                                 the                                 modernization in uh efforts on that                                 project                                 um specifically recognizing that                                 different that as a large project that                                 provides different services                                 uh that some modularization of its                                 libraries uh was                                 uh desirable and secondly                                 modernization of the code and software                                 that's used inside of the project                                 so all of those things are going into                                 opdxr now                                 and will culminate uh with opet xr                                  coming later this summer                                 it's been a very it has a very broad                                 range of contributions once again                                 across a wide variety of both industry                                 and studio                                 developers                                 open timeline oh is one of our uh newer                                 projects                                 um this has been contributed by pixar of                                 course                                 and sits as a a very good solution to                                 a problem that has been um challenging                                 again many of our inter-operation                                 processes across applications                                 um and within studios and their uh                                 different creative processes                                 so this is of course in order to be able                                 to exchange                                 um and encode editorial timeline                                 information                                 um as another uh interchange project                                 it's very well suited to the open source                                 model and once again um situating the                                 project inside of the academy software                                 and                                 foundation has been a key factor in                                 allowing                                 and encouraging contributions both from                                 a diversity of studios                                 but also software vendors                                 and                                 there we go sorry just have a little                                 click glitch                                 there um and of course open chatting                                 language                                 uh joined us quite recently um but as a                                 very mature project                                 which was already a very active open                                 source project                                 uh has continued to make good progress                                 in its new home                                 um the process of actually uh                                 coming into the foundation from uh from                                 certain pictures image works                                 has of course um given us the process                                 and governance and uh resilience to                                 really allow for contributions from a                                 wide variety of players who've                                 previously                                 been consumers of the project but not so                                 much active contributors so                                 that's been the real shift of gear with                                 the project adoption                                 and with that uh i will pass over to rob

specific                                 slides talking about                                 the number of commits the number of                                 releases and the contributors but i did                                 want you to see                                 um how active each of these projects has                                 been just                                 in the last year some of these projects                                 like open colorio                                 were not getting this kind of level of                                 contribution before they joined                                 the the academy software foundation um                                 in fact nowhere near there was a lot of                                 enthusiasm for it there was a lot of use                                 across the industry because it solves a                                 really important problem                                 but there wasn't the system in place to                                 allow contributions from a wide variety                                 of contributors and autodesk who has                                 invested a lot in the new version of                                 opencolorio                                 it wasn't even clear how they could get                                 their code                                 into the shipping version of open                                 colorio or if they needed to branch it                                 or need to                                 just provide a whole other solution to                                 the industry and i'm so pleased to see                                 the community coming together and                                 contributing as you can see in a huge                                 way                                 to that project open queue as well and                                 when we're talking about this number of                                 lines changed in a year this is a lot of                                 effort that is going into these packages                                 as you can see                                 uh not just from a single contributor                                 here uh there are a lot of lines coming                                 from one but in terms of                                 level of commit there's a lot of people                                 contributing which is fantastic                                 opening xr a project that of course near                                 and dear to my heart the one that                                 inspired me to get into open source                                 watching how open exr had succeeded in                                 the industry                                 but a project that hadn't had a lot of                                 love in the last few years it was                                 getting some security patches but that                                 was about it                                 as you can see a lot more work in the                                 last year                                             just in the last                                                         i o                                 again we're seeing contributors uh                                 very actively participating in this                                 project uh and not just                                 from pixar or unknown studios so we're                                 seeing this from multiple studios which                                 is what we want to see                                 open shading language has been long                                 developed very actively                                 um you can see larry gritz continues to                                 be the uh                                 the top contributor to that package                                 that's not a surprise it's only been in                                 the academy software foundation for a                                 couple of months but it is fantastic to                                 see                                 more people able to contribute and have                                 a path to contributing to this                                 in a new way so                                 we want to focus now on                                 how we can bring the most value to you                                 as people who are either already                                 contributing                                 already part of the academy software                                 foundation or maybe you're here today                                 kind of checking out what it is that                                 we're doing where's the catch                                 um there isn't there isn't a catch                                 whether you are whether you are a member                                 company in the academy software                                 foundation and you're supporting it with                                 engineering and you're supporting it                                 with money                                 or you're not all the software is free                                 for you it's free for you to participate                                 in                                 it's free for you to contribute to it's                                 free for you to use                                 according to licensing but all the                                 licenses are very permissive                                 so it's all free but the reason so many                                 of those companies                                 that we are very very grateful to for                                 contributing engineering resources and                                 money to making the academy software                                 foundation                                 successful the reason that all of us                                 have chosen to be a part of this is                                 because it's                                 so much more efficient for us to solve                                 some of these problems together                                 than if we had to solve them one at a                                 time and you can see the level of                                 collaboration                                 the level of efficiency that we're                                 achieving in the academy software                                 foundation today and this is just after                                 two years so                                 we still have more growth potential                                 ahead of us                                 it's actually very very exciting so now                                 we want to talk with you there's a                                     of us here                                 uh and as daniel and emily pointed out                                 please feel free to open                                 uh answer any ask any questions in the q                                 a box down at the bottom of your screen                                 but um i'm curious where has the academy                                 software foundation                                 delivered the most value to you effect                                 effectively where have we been                                 successful so                                 far and then the next question is going                                 to be where can we deliver more value                                 what would                                 what would create more value for you but                                 just go to that                                 uh url at the top on your phone or on                                 your device pull                                 ev.com a s aswf                                 and you can pop in a response and it                                 should show up on the screen                                 and then um when if you go to that                                 website and you see somebody's input                                 you can also upvote other people's                                 suggestions so you can kind of                                 second someone's thoughts so i'm going                                 to just hop in there make sure it's all                                 working                                 i see one that's a good sign                                 and we can start talking about these                                 actually as they come up                                 and daniel's here so                                 and we are starting to see the responses                                 pour in which is great                                 this is really helpful because um it's                                 hard for us sometimes                                 to see the the forest for the trees and                                 there's been a lot that gone in                                 to putting the foundation together                                 but as we discussed before briefly                                 um we're at a time unexpectedly                                 with copic                                                          again at a lot of things and how we do                                 things and it's a great time to have the                                 feedback of the community                                 so thank you for uh everyone who's                                 typing frantically                                 at the moment that that information is                                 very helpful to us to the board                                 to the tech                                 daniel do you want to um jump in and                                 chat at all about the build system and                                 what the current state of the ci system                                 is just because it                                 came up towards the top here while other                                 comments are coming in                                 that's a good hook indeed yes so um                                 firstly i'll                                 refer everyone to a short session that's                                 happening                                 a little later in the day i think in an                                 hour and a half where we'll be going                                 into                                 the ci system and the ci working group                                 in a little bit more depth                                 but essentially uh we have                                 um been able to with the resources                                 of the attack and projects and also the                                 participation of some very active                                 other members been able to                                 take what all of the projects have been                                 doing                                 in different ways usually inside of the                                 studios that originated the projects                                 and moved that out into shared open                                 modern build                                 ci and support including testing                                 that's obviously a very good thing in                                 terms of the                                 modernity and capabilities of those                                 systems so i think in almost all cases                                 we've extended                                 the range of support                                 that the project ci systems offer                                 in terms of platform support and in                                 terms of                                 its ability to perform static analysis                                 and other kinds of                                 uh processes not just a simple build and                                 test                                 and of course making the testing process                                 crucially making the testing                                 process of ci visible to all                                 contributors rather than just those

with all of our                                 working groups and the tac itself                                 and indeed all of our projects we                                 encourage open participation                                 your interest and your expertise is very                                 welcome                                 great thank you very much for                                 highlighting these things i think the                                 top                                 one on this list that people are                                 describing as you know where the academy                                 software foundation has provided value                                 in terms of keeping projects alive and                                 contributable i                                 agree with that that was certainly a                                 major goal as we looked at the state of                                 open source                                 just over two years ago as we were                                 diving into this and seeing how we could                                 help                                 um the fact that came up top is uh does                                 mean we are addressing a real problem                                 which is really good                                 um and some of these other things are um                                 are very very helpful i think it's                                 interesting                                 we see legal licensing framework for                                 contribution about                                 well half as popular as the top one and                                 i think that's                                 uh possibly something for us to think                                 about in the future                                 uh we're certainly very focused on that                                 problem we've also taken a fairly                                 light-handed approach                                 there is some good unifor uh uniformity                                 a better uniformity across the projects                                 but not complete uniformity across the                                 projects today                                 and that's an interesting one to look at                                 and but it is nice to see it up there                                 as well so yeah i really appreciate all                                 of your thoughts here and we will                                 be taking this back to our attack and                                 the rest of teams as we look at this                                 as we consider our plans for the future                                 but it is great to see these areas that                                 are moving forward well so now                                 uh where are the things how can we bring                                 more value how can the academy software                                 foundation create more value                                 for you um and one of the just to keep                                 in mind as you're filling this one out                                 as you're coming up with ideas                                 um as we've continued to increase our                                 membership our member companies that                                 provides us engineering resources                                 it also provides funding so we can use                                 that funding for various things                                 um you'll hear a little bit more about                                 that in the dni program                                 how we anticipate being able to fund                                 that we have                                 uh lots of uh ideas about how we can                                 move forward but part of it is                                 most of it is going to be driven by the                                 community where you direct us                                 uh to focus our efforts where we can                                 bring the most value for sure                                 so i'll give this a minute i'll fill out                                 a couple myself                                 i love seeing attracting diverse                                 engineering talent to the motion picture                                 industry                                 i think we do sit in a very unique                                 position to be able to do that                                 i think the accessibility of this our                                 ability to                                 find talent that we as an industry have                                 not been able to find or not have                                 traditionally been very good                                 at finding i think as an industry we're                                 missing some of the top talent                                 out there and our ability to stand in                                 that gap and attract their                                 that kind of diverse engineering talent                                 would be a huge                                 uh thing that we can play and i think we                                 can play that role as a software                                 foundation as the academy software                                 foundation i think                                 we can play that role in a way that                                 really complements                                 some of the initiatives that many of our                                 member companies are also doing                                 internally                                 when i look at the investment disney                                 makes in the academy software foundation                                 it's actually quite efficient it's a                                 very                                 nominal contribution for a lot of value                                 and i think that especially if we can                                 add a lot of                                 value in this area i think that would be                                 a really good story                                 i'd like to see the mansion providing                                 more adoption guidance for smaller                                 studios                                 yeah in fact at um                                 prior to cohen we were looking at our                                 second year and                                 we had in our plan to to focus on the                                 smaller studio and                                 we will come back to that at some point                                 but i'd be very interested to hear about                                 the smallers from the smaller studios um                                 here                                 in suggestions of what we can do or in                                 the qa session                                 afterward about your                                 your perception of the foundation and                                 how we can help you the the studios that                                 are                                 um doing a lot of work in our industry                                 the smaller studios very innovative um                                 also very busy and so your your efforts                                 and your money is                                 is a great value in your time                                 so how um how can the foundation help                                 you what do we need to do                                 how do we need to evolve to serve                                 from our point of view the whole                                 community and                                 that includes the smaller studios                                 i might uh this is a                                 maybe a good challenge for us in terms                                 of using some of the other mechanisms                                 that we have for questions and answers                                 but um i would                                 might encourage uh people who have                                 highlighted the official binary builds                                 um                                 point there to uh add some more aspects                                 to that in the q                                 a section or in the chat um curious                                 there whether those                                 uh requests are coming largely for                                 uh mac and windows platforms or for uh                                 for linux as well and secondly whether                                 that                                 uh is uh an interest in essentially                                 um components and packages along the                                 lines of                                 uh sort of individual elements or                                 looking for                                 sort of larger integrated environments                                 for you know the whole set of sort of                                 tools the vfx reference platform in                                 binary form essentially                                 yeah and feel free if the q and a format                                 which is nice one for asking questions                                 but if that doesn't work feel free to                                 chat us in the chat you can chat just to                                 the panelists or you can chat to                                 everybody                                 in in the room you know it's a good size                                  group but it's still less than                                                                                                               feel free to just use that chat                                  if that is a helpful way to communicate                                  back on that                                  we've had a lot of discussion about data                                  set provision providing data sets                                  and we think that this could be a very                                  useful mechanism be                                  just like in the rest of the open source                                  code                                  licensing if we had a common licensing                                  scheme that people could know they could                                  donate data to                                  and it could be housed by the academy                                  software foundation                                  uh whether that's for machine learning                                  or whether that's for um                                  render testing or other sort of data set                                  test data sets                                  that um sometimes are quite significant                                  uh we've seen some examples where uh                                  walt disney animation has open source                                  some very large data sets that have                                  gotten a lot of use in the industry                                  especially in research                                  so that is something we've talked about                                  but we have not yet started that project                                  um so that is an interesting thing to                                  see i i like seeing that high on this                                  list it's definitely something that                                  i think we could bring some real value                                  to                                  and i'll chime in too because i'm seeing                                  you know a lot about the increasing                                  learning learning materials and                                  accessible resources and                                  we'll talk about that some of the dni                                  session but that is a big goal for us                                  um as well because you know that is a                                  way to help attract diverse talent                                  um and i will say that a lot of the                                  projects are already working on this but                                  that is an                                  area where we could definitely use help                                  and it's an                                  easy way to start trying to get involved                                  with the foundation you don't                                  necessarily have to be very technical to                                  do that                                  um so you know if that's something you                                  might be interested in helping                                  out with you know please feel free to                                  reach out to me to any of the projects                                  on slack                                  you know all of our communities are very                                  welcoming and would                                  welcome help in that                                  and i'll go ahead and answer satish's                                  question i hope i said your name                                  properly or at least                                  close um the question is are there any                                  plans for some                                  shared usd data sets production quality                                  data sets for usd                                  um so we we've discussed it we've talked                                  about how we would implement that and                                  there are some good examples                                  inside of the linux foundation where                                  that has been done successfully                                  on other in other uh in other domains                                  so we have a mechanism that we could use                                  for that but we haven't actually gotten                                  that first                                  project off the ground we discussed a                                  human                                  data set but that's a pretty changeable                                  data set meaning                                  the kind of data people are looking for                                  in that space changes pretty rapidly                                  because all the research is happening                                  quickly                                  but and we had talked about a couple of                                  heavy render sets that could be useful                                  as well                                  for researchers so if you have interest                                  in that project don't hesitate to reach                                  out                                  to any of us um because that could be                                  the difference between that a specific                                  project getting off the ground in that                                  area or not but this is this would be a                                  good time for us to look at that for                                  sure                                  oh and nick just highlighted in the chat                                  nick cannon                                  uh who is a cto over at walt disney                                  animation he said the usd version of the                                  moana island scene is coming soon                                  so that is a that is a fun uh thing to                                  know                                  then we have a question from graham                                  benjamin um definitely need a good                                  open source assets for testing that                                  everything is set up                                  maybe some assets could come from the                                  smithsonian institute                                  yeah i'm interested in how fran is                                  imagining that i could                                  totally see that there's a lot of                                  amazing data the smithsonian institute                                  has                                  made available and has licensed very                                  freely so we                                  could certainly imagine some                                  applications for that i guess we have to                                  figure out what part we would be                                  bringing to that specifically                                  uh whether we'd be digitizing some                                  things that are viewed from multiple                                  angles and creating                                                    or whether or not um whether you're just                                  looking for like some nice clean assets                                  that you can test                                  pipelines with it'd be interesting to                                  talk to you more about that perhaps                                  chime in in the chat if you wanted to                                  follow up on that one friend                                  let me just this is fantastic i really                                  appreciate this input                                  i love to see that we're looking that                                  in this group right now the top thing on                                  everybody's mind is attracting diverse                                  talent to the motion picture industry                                  and i i                                  i feel that pressure as well and i think                                  we're in a very very good spot to help                                  enable that that is a great segue                                  to the one o'clock session that starts                                  in just just under                                             because that is that team has some                                  fantastic ideas there's a ton of                                  enthusiasm                                  and there's a lot of support from                                  everybody in the academy software                                  foundation to help enable                                  that in everything we do um so i'm                                  excited to see that                                  and then the fact that the fx reference                                  platform is top on the list is great too                                  uh getting all those projects aligned is                                  a big job but we can definitely help                                  with that                                  and uh there's a lot of enthusiasm for                                  that as well                                  well that as well outlawed that on the                                  vfx reference platform um engagement                                  that's something of course that                                  is already uh happening in various ways                                  we have some sort of shared membership                                  and liaison                                  in that group across the two um sets of                                  activity                                  and the b uh one of the um                                  goals and indeed the outcomes of the uh                                  ci system                                  um that we have developed is of course                                  to provide                                  uh concrete workable uh recipes for the                                  specifications the vfx                                  vfx reference platform actually um                                  encodes uh as a result we've                                  moved from not only capturing the sort                                  of currently                                  and historically established vfs                                  reference platform editions                                  uh but we've also been able to uh use                                  the                                  uh the ci and its underlying docker uh                                  build system                                  um to validate um the uh                                  reference platform proposals and that's                                  that activity has actually happened in                                  the latest iteration of the                                  reference platform and indeed sort of                                  allowed us to uh                                  troubleshoot some of the combinations                                  and other elements of the platform                                  um i'll hook put a hook in again of                                  course for both the                                  uh ci working group session later in the                                  day                                  and of course the vfs reference platform                                  is also having a session within the open                                  source days program                                  great so um we will get to a couple more                                  questions in a minute                                  continue to throw those in there if you                                  would like on the questions area                                  just in terms of how you can get                                  involved if you're not involved already                                  you can jump in and contribute to an                                  existing project anytime                                  um so that's there's a list of what six                                  or seven bullets there have different                                  ways you can jump in right away                                  um and there's room for various for                                  people with various level of technical                                  proficiency as well                                  it does not just require you to be a                                  hard code coder                                  to be able to contribute so there's lots                                  of roles uh to be able to contribute to                                  an existing project                                  um the tac as we've highlighted as you                                  can see in our charts it's probably the                                  most                                  it's probably the the it's the beating                                  heart of the academy software foundation                                  and you can see some specific needs we                                  have on the technical advisory committee                                  but that is really                                  um the group that daniel runs is really                                  where all the action happens                                  the rest of us are here to support that                                  and to amplify everything they're doing                                  and then most recently the new working                                  groups the ci                                  working group the diversity inclusion                                  working group python and usd working                                  groups                                  these are all areas where you can dive                                  in and contribute in many different ways                                  um i just want to explicitly mention                                  everyone is welcome                                  in the diversity and inclusion group                                  even if you are not                                  part of a minority community or you                                  don't identify                                  with a minority community of course you                                  are welcome to be part of the dni uh                                  working group uh we need everybody we'd                                  love everybody to be involved in that                                  and                                  it's not just that working group's job                                  to help solve that within the academy                                  software foundation we think of it as                                  all of our jobs but this                                  working group is making some fantastic                                  recommendations and setting us up                                  and giving some really good ideas for                                  how we can proceed                                  and i'll leave this up as we're diving                                  into our last questions                                  lots of different ways to get in touch                                  with us of course there's the website                                  where you can find links to all of this                                  but these are the various things so you                                  can pick your favorite method to be in                                  touch with people on the academy                                  software foundation                                  so we'll take a couple questions if                                  there are some and then we'll give                                  everybody a couple minutes to get ready                                  for the next session as well                                  um i think this one's maybe more of a                                  comment than a question but from                                  uh naren and i apologize i'm butchering                                  the name but                                  related to the data sets for machine                                  learning if studios                                  are not willing or hesitant to                                  contribute the data at least the trained                                  models probably can be open sourced                                  that's a very good point yes                                  i think that's a really good point and i                                  think you know it's interesting if                                  the if we're looking to host trained                                  models                                  that could be something we could look up                                  as well um and we could expedite that if                                  that was easier to get done so i'm open                                  to that for sure                                  i'm sure the attack would be open to                                  looking that i mean                                  and then steven mckenzie asked is there                                  a place that can be gone to to                                  understand which projects                                  academy software foundation projects are                                  looking for which kinds of                                  development help so that developers can                                  better evaluate                                  you know how they can help in the most                                  constructive way                                  and jean francois pointed out we do have                                  a good                                  first issues uh most of our projects are                                  encouraged to                                  tag those yeah so if you're already                                  familiar                                  with github and you go through the                                  github issues list you hopefully will                                  find some good first issues tags                                  in there that you might be able to jump                                  right into um that                                  that said feel free to jump on any of                                  the slack channels                                  or in any of the mailing lists and you                                  if                                  if you were to highlight a couple of                                  things that you're good at                                  um i'm sure there would be several                                  responses from people that said oh                                  here's a place you could contribute                                  right away                                  or if you did that on the open exr                                  mailing list and there wasn't anything                                  directly for you                                  the people that hang out on that mailing                                  list also know uh something about some                                  of our other projects                                  and they might be able to say oh your                                  gpu skills are going to be really                                  relevant                                  coming soon over an openvdb or whatever                                  the                                  or whatever might get announced tomorrow                                  morning so um                                  definitely feel free to chime in with                                  any specific questions uh                                  if you have interest or expertise um and                                  then of course if you can't reach                                  anybody there just                                  jump into attack meeting or jump on the                                  tech mailing list and say hey i'd love                                  i'd love to help i've got a few hours                                  and i could do this                                  uh there's all plenty of work to do we'd                                  love that kind of uh request                                  seconded yeah and i'd say the talk                                  meetings are open to everybody you do                                  not have to be a tech                                  member to join but that's a great way to                                  find out what all the projects are                                  working on and kind of                                  um maybe what's on the roadmap because                                  each project will give an update as long                                  as well as each working group                                  so i think that's a very good first step                                  and there's also a                                  tac channel on our slack                                  then anonymous is apple actually still                                  an                                  academy software foundation member uh                                  because they're not on the member page                                  and i can answer this one that yes they                                  are still a premier member uh there are                                  some logo                                  guidelines from apple that prohibit us                                  from putting their logo on our website                                  but yes they are and they are actively                                  involved                                  in many of our projects and on our                                  attack                                  that's great                                  well since we have the one o'clock                                  meeting since we've gotten through

o'clock                                  if you're able to take part in that we                                  would welcome you for sure                                  and a special thanks to dan
