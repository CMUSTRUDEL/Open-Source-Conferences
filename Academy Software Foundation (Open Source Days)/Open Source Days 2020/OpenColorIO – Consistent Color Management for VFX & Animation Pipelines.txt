just to give you a brief introduction                                to opencolorio if you're not familiar                                opencolorio also known as ocio is an                                open source                                library for visual effects color                                management that provides four main                                capabilities                                so first there's a config file for                                documenting                                a color pipeline that is used either for                                a specific show                                or even across an entire facility uh                                it also oci also provides a loose set of                                user interface conventions sorry                                interface conventions for                                accessing color management from within                                digital content creation applications                                that's the                                user facing side also                                the ability to read many of the lookup                                table or lut                                file formats that are used across the                                industry                                which you know makes ocl very flexible                                and able to fit into a lot of existing                                pipelines and then lastly pixel                                conversion engines for both cpu and gpu                                ocio was introduced about                                             by sony pictures imageworks and has                                become an industry standard for                                implementing color management and visual                                effects and animation                                it's already integrated into dozens of                                apps many of which you probably                                use are familiar with and it's being                                added to new applications regularly                                hundreds of films have used ocio pretty                                much every major motion picture with                                visual effects                                over the last uh quite a few years has                                used ocio for                                um for most shots so it's uh very                                commonly used                                so just as a general update kind of                                talking about where we've been at for                                the last year                                since open source day last year at                                siggraph                                so following last year's event                                we the academy software foundation tac                                and governing board                                voted to graduate ocio to an adopted                                project in the aswf                                so we were the second adopted project in                                the foundation                                since then we've had                                                  contributors and                                                 so very healthy amount of contributions                                and activity                                there's a lot going on on the project                                 it's a great time to get involved if                                 you're interested in participating

        so we've also spun up two project                                 working groups this past year                                 one to look at revamping the ocio                                 documentation and website                                 in preparation for the v                                                 being led by carol payne of netflix

helpful we've had                                 some new members to our technical                                 steering committee this past year                                 may chew of sony pictures image works is                                 is now joined and                                 carol payne is joined to represent                                 netflix and mark titchener from foundry                                 so we're continuing to um you know                                 expand and                                 and to try to you know lead the project                                 well                                 we've had some updates to building ci                                 over the last year last year at open                                 source day we talked a lot about                                 our ci and build efforts which had been                                 a part of our incubation                                 phase of our time in the academy                                 software foundation                                 this past year the entire foundation                                 decided to move ci infrastructure                                 from azure pipelines over to github                                 actions to be more tightly integrated                                 with our repositories which has been a                                 i'm a good it's been a great move and                                 it's been                                 added a lot of nice capability for just                                 managing our projects                                 we've also expanded our ci jobs somewhat                                 we're now regularly testing on both vfx                                 reference platform                                                                                                     provided by the aswf docker project                                 if you're not familiar with that it's a                                 they're docker images that provide                                 various                                 vfx reference platform um content years                                 and it's great for both ci and for uh                                 just you know building projects on your                                 own too so be sure to check that out                                 we're also doing a nightly ci now so we                                 do a                                 latest upstream dependency build so                                 basically we have a number of upstream                                 dependencies                                 that we pull from other repositories and                                 this allows us to pull the latest tag                                 for each of those                                 just to see how changes coming                                 downstream                                 will affect us in the future so we can                                 maintain stability with new releases                                 and we also run static analysis builds                                 with sonar cloud each evening                                 and that includes test coverage analysis                                 and and other things to help us keep the                                 code                                 quality high we've also been working                                 with the ca                                 aswfci working group uh this past year                                 as we implement gpu ci which is really                                 important for ocio since we                                 the gpu rendering is is widely used                                 so we're running this on gpu instances                                 on aws and we're currently in progress                                 setting this up but we're hoping to have                                 it up and running within the next month                                 or two                                 so last year we completely rewrote the                                 python bindings for ocio                                 with pi bind                                                             python                                   and                                                                    pi bind is numpy                                 array interoperability so any of the api                                 for ocio                                 that can operate on                                 pixel arrays or or numbers can can be                                 passed numpy arrays directly                                 and can also return them we've also                                 worked on some revisions to                                 pi open colorio to be more pythonic one                                 of those is                                 implementing a lot of python iterators                                 where previously                                 it was more of like a c style iteration                                 where you're iterating based on a count                                 of some object                                 so it's just a little more easier to                                 pick up for python developers                                 we've also expanded the previous case of                                 having constructors for each class for                                 each class that allows you to define                                 the attributes in the constructor and so                                 all of our classes                                 support that across the library wherever                                 it's possible so just ease config                                 authoring                                 and now the context class and some of                                 the other metadata interfaces throughout                                 the library                                 can behave like python dictionaries uh                                 just to be again more familiar for                                 python developers                                 we're still working on our test suite                                 which may chew                                 has been leading that development and                                 we'll                                 plan to be done with that before the v                                  release                                 so i mentioned before that we're we have                                 a new aces config working group                                 the asus config in the past has been                                 very widely used and it's been an                                 awesome                                 tool for studios that either don't have                                 a color scientist or                                 you know want to have a really good                                 starting point for an asus pipeline                                 so we're we're looking at that and we                                 really want to                                 create a new asus config that takes                                 advantage of the open color i o                                 v                                                                       talk a lot about                                 but there's some there's some really key                                 benefits to that and                                 so we've actually started a new                                 repository which is called open color i                                 o                                 config config aces i think                                 where that project will be started up                                 which is under the academy software                                 foundation github                                 organization there's not much there yet                                 but we're working on it and                                 the key thing is that this project is                                 going to be done in two phases                                 so phase one will be to create an asus                                 reference config this is a                                 config that encompasses just the aces                                 transforms and not necessarily trying to                                 account for all the typical color                                 transforms that you would need across a                                 studio                                 and the goal here is to have a oci o                                 aces reference implementation so that we                                 could use that to                                 apply for the aces logo program to be                                 you know officially supported                                 and one of our main goals is to be lut                                 free open colorio v                                                      built-in transforms providing the                                 underlying aces algorithms                                 for higher precision and performance and                                 so our goal is to make this config be                                 mostly standalone                                 and also to generate a lot of the config                                 structure with a library that                                 thomas mentioned called created that                                 essentially walks the aces repository                                 collects all the transforms and then can                                 build the config structure from that and                                 this will allow us                                 to use uh continuous integration and and                                 other tools to make sure that we're                                 always staying up to date with the asus                                 repository                                 and you know catching differences phase                                 two of this work would then be to create                                 a superset of that asus config                                 which adds in a lot of the functional                                 and useful color spaces                                 and transforms that are needed to just                                 run a you know a studio                                 color pipeline and so we want to utilize                                 oclv                                                                  this config also                                 but these two configs will be available                                 either to use directly or just as a                                 reference or starting point for                                 your studios config and we hope that it                                 can be really helpful at                                 all and also provide a really great                                 example of how to utilize the new                                 functionality                                 if you're interested in being involved                                 in that we uh the working group meetings                                 are hosted every other tuesday currently                                 and in the ocio dev                                 calendar you can see those meetings and                                 i would love to have your input                                 so also we rebranded ocio recently with                                 a new logo                                 and branding kit by mario rakiki from                                 dnag he                                 graciously designed an awesome new logo                                 and um                                 and lots of new visuals for us to help                                 just you know continue to have branding                                 consistency and                                 we're really thankful for his                                 contribution there                                 and with that i'm going to hand it over                                 to doug walker to talk about                                 open color i o v                                                 yeah i i love the new branding kit that                                 mario put together                                 and uh i can't wait to incorporate more                                 of that                                 into our website and things over the                                 coming weeks it looks                                 really amazing so i'm doug walker i'm                                 technology lead for color science at                                 autodesk                                 and i'm also serving as the chief                                 architect on the                                 technical steering committee for                                 opencolorio                                 so um it's been an interesting                                 three years just to kind of                                 recap some of the history for the open                                 color via                                 open clario v                                                        at siggraph three years ago with a                                 proposal that we made                                 that was well received and                                 based on that we were able to spin up a                                 v                                                uh consisting of members from                                 most of the major companies in vfx and                                 entertainment                                 and autodesk was able to                                 [Music]                                 support uh patrick uh bernard lefeve and                                 myself                                 to work full-time on this project                                 so there were a number of you know it's                                 been                                                the first um open clear i o release                                 and a lot has changed in that time                                 these four trends in particular                                 influence the                                 v                                                                        importance of gpus uh including for                                 rendering final frames                                 um also the the                                 the fact that aces has had a tremendous                                 influence on vfx workflows and the way                                 color is handled also                                 color management has become more complex                                 as                                 the industry wrestles with lots of                                 different proprietary color spaces                                 and the arrival of hdr television and so                                 forth                                 and finally that openclario is is also                                 being used in                                 industries adjacent to visual effects                                 we had a couple of high-level design                                 goals for the project first is that                                 existing config files should continue to                                 work                                 and second that it should be simple to                                 update                                 existing apps to the new api                                 and we feel that we've met both of those                                 goals                                 so i'm going to give you a quick                                 overview                                 of new features                                 we don't have time to cover them all but                                 you could go to our website                                 to see a a a                                 more complete list of of the new                                 features and also we wrote a                                 uh an extensive paper for digit pro that                                 goes into                                 some of the background behind the new                                 features so we encourage you to check                                 that out as well                                 so aces a lot of                                 a lot of the new features are related to                                 aces and a lot of the people that uh                                 work on openclario are also involved in                                 aces project                                 the way i think of it is uh aces is sort                                 of the                                 the what of you know what what should                                 the color transforms be what is the                                 color science                                 um you know what is the color pipeline                                 that should be used and                                 oco ocio is sort of like the how it's                                 okay we have this uh set of color                                 transforms we want to apply                                 how should we apply them in vfx software                                 and                                 so a number of our new features are asus                                 related                                 um many of the people in vfx who                                 encounter aces or use aces do so through                                 the excellent                                 uh ocio config for aces                                 which was created by hp dweeker and uh                                 updated for aces                                                       manson cal                                 and that is uh that has been uh hugely                                 successful                                 there are some edge cases um where we've                                 identified                                 problems uh and those are related to the                                 limitations inherent in                                                for ocio v                                                            implement the asus config                                 without relying on                                                  allows the transforms to                                 remain faithful over you know a huge                                 exposure                                 range another aces related feature                                 is the academy common lut format                                 so this is uh something that was a big                                 part of the recent aces                                             it's similar to opencl in that it allows                                 you to construct a pipeline of                                 basic sort of operators or building                                 blocks that are things like                                                                                                    it's very well documented there's a                                 thorough set of unit tests in                                 opencolorio                                 and there's actually a a                                 commonly format implementation working                                 group that meets every                                 uh every other tuesday as part of the                                 aces virtual working groups                                 and we encourage you to get involved                                 with that if you're interested in clf                                 but we have full read and write support                                 now                                 in opencolorio which uh which is great                                 and which i think will                                 will help adoption                                 a number of the other new features are                                 around improving the user experience                                 so you know the the asus config for                                 example has over                                                         that can lead to                                 some pretty overwhelming menus and so                                 we've                                 we've added new features to be able to                                 group color spaces by category to use                                 hierarchical menus                                 to hide color spaces if you want to keep                                 them in the config but not have them in                                 the menus                                 we've also added some new uh rules so                                 there's a file rule system that                                 brings more power to how you assign                                 a good default color spaces based on the                                 file                                 path or extension                                 there's viewing rules which help                                 applications                                 decide which views are most appropriate                                 for giving color space                                 and finally we've got a lot of                                 application best practice code to kind                                 of illustrate how the new features                                 uh work and to provide examples for                                 application developers                                 one of the the big color science related                                 features is                                 display color spaces so in oco v                                  there was basically one color space that                                 did the entire transformation from scene                                 linear reference space to the display                                 space                                 in ocean ob                                                              down                                 into a combination of a view transform                                 to a display reference space and then a                                 display color space                                 and this makes it                                 it brings ocio in line with a lot of                                 other                                 color science initiatives such as aces                                 such as                                 the hdr television standards                                 and it also facilitates other benefits                                 like the ability to convert from one                                 color                                 one display color space to another                                 without having to invert                                 a view transform                                 related to displays uh so                                 as you know a lot of the sort of de                                 facto standard for                                 monitor profiles in color management is                                 based on icc                                 profiles so on mac and on windows you                                 can ask the operating system for a                                 profile that describes the monitor                                 as more and more monitors are why gamut                                 monitors the assumption that everything                                 is srgb                                 becomes kind of less and less relevant                                 and so now there is                                 essentially a bridge uh between icc and                                 open clario                                 so for config authors that want to they                                 can                                 they can provide a way to link to an icc                                 profile and for applications that want                                 to they can use                                 ocio to emulate what would be seen in                                 an icc based application                                 so with that i'm going to turn it over                                 to my colleague patrick codull                                 to talk about the new gpu renderer                                 thanks doug now i will uh                                 my a few slides to present you some very                                 important feature for oco v                                  uh more related to a software part                                 but which are also critical improvements                                 so for ocio provides a flexible                                 processing model that consists of a                                 pipeline of                                 magical mathematical operators                                 in oco v                                                           evaluated the chain of operators                                 precisely                                 but the gpu rendering engine converted                                 the                                 operator pipeline into an approximate                                 one                                 for technical details mainly it was                                 the gpu pipeline was replacing all the                                 lut                                 by one single                                                      corresponding approximations in ocu v                                  the gpu rendering                                 renderer has been completely replaced                                 with one that                                 implements all the operators                                 and is able to process pixel as the cpu                                 does                                 the image saw the result of testing done                                 at sony picture                                 image works the lower on the                                 the result on the lower right shows an                                 amplified difference                                 image between the cpu result and the                                 oclu v                                  gpu result which indicates significant                                 errors                                 the result on the upper right shows the                                 same comparison                                 using the oco v                                               with the black image indicating a                                 precise match to the cpu                                 what is now important to to mention                                 the gpu public api changed a lot                                 since ociu now needs to upload                                 any number of texture                                 in your color transformation you can                                 have any number of flats                                 and all these slots are now converted to                                                                                      however it's allow much more                                 customizations                                 and helper class provides an easy opengl                                 integration                                 these two aspects are really important                                 to                                 any gpu integration in any kind of apps                                 because there are always specific needs                                 or limitations                                 so you need to be able to fully                                 customize                                 the information you received but at the                                 same time                                 some integration are using                                 directly opengl so we provide upper                                 class to have a very seamless                                 integration for that kind of                                 applications                                 and one example is the known ocio                                 display                                 command line tools which is using this                                 helper class                                 processing improvement so many of our                                 processing improvements are also being                                 made                                 due to a number of optimizations such as                                 additional                                 use of ssc vector and toxins in success                                 cpu pixel conversions are now up to                                    times faster                                 just to highlight that the sse                                 integration was already done in oco v                                  but we really enhanced the support for                                 all existing ups and new apps                                 so now all apps have an ssc support                                 and if your processor does not support                                 ssc then it's                                 automatically automatically disabled                                 auto support integer pixel buffers in                                 addition to floating point                                 in many cases source image file formats                                 are integer based                                 and the new capability brings                                 performance improvements                                 for example applications no longer needs                                 to pre-convert buffer to floating points                                 this is a huge improvement                                 improved transform pipeline optimization                                 also                                 contributes to the performance                                 improvement for example ocio is now able                                 to generate an equivalent forward lot                                 for an inverse slot including three                                 deletes                                 the various optimizations are also now                                 controllable                                 by the public api or via an environment                                 variable                                 this later point is extremely important                                 if you want to debug                                 something you can completely disable                                 optimizations                                 a new cache system has been introduced                                 for ocio processor instances                                 in fact the pull request will be in in a                                 few days but it's really close                                 this should facilitate improved                                 performance in applications                                 that need to play back a timeline of                                 clip that each                                 require different color processing                                 due to context variables                                 special attention not yet                                 a special attention was given to                                 preventing contacts variable from                                 invalidating the cache unless they                                 directly affect the result                                 yes command line tools thank you                                 michael ocio has always had a very                                 useful collection of command line tools                                 and they too provide                                 interesting new capabilities i will not                                 list all command line tools but just                                 highlight some of them                                 ocio checklist also allows sending a

       check the all the performance                                 improvement we did                                 next slide thank you many improvements                                 have been made to improve the robustness                                 of opencolorio                                 so michaela mentioned some of them but                                 just recap                                 for everyone first of all we have                                 increased the number of unit tests                                 by more than tenfold with more than one                                 thousand                                 total tests and we continue to add some                                 this is really important to guarantee                                 the quality                                 of the library in addition                                 we are now we have now                                 gpu unit tests in addition to the cpu                                 and python ones                                 this allows the gpu results to be                                 compared against the cpu results                                 this also is completely new with v                                     develop a gpu                                 framework for dedicated to unit test so                                 we can                                 for any ops we can compare cpu and gpu                                 and we also have a python framework to                                 test a python api                                 furthermore a suffix sophisticated                                 continuous integration system is now in                                 place valid                                 uh to validate all pull requesting on                                 github so                                 michael explained hello to this new                                 aspect but just to highlight that                                 this system tests                                                configurations                                                                                                   configurations                                 as well as support static analysis and                                 checking for

                       open source development                                 it's just just                                 a second it just to um highlight                                 what improved robustness mean it means                                 that                                 you can rely on on branches                                 on the github repo to be uh correct                                 because we have way to enforce                                 the quality of any merge code or                                 changes unit tests and so on so this is                                 really a major improvement for everyone                                 so now i will let you uh let doug                                 present you a                                 cov                                    thank you patrick so it's um                                 it's been a busy three years for us we                                 were                                 at uh open source day last siggraph uh                                 saying that we uh showing road maps                                 showing that we would be feature                                 complete at this sig graph                                 and i'm very happy to report that we are                                 in fact feature complete                                 and so opencolorio v                                                  test                                 here's the timeline so                                 we're showing three years of feature                                 development from                                                        feature complete which means                                 the feature development work is now done                                 there's a couple of                                 pull requests that are still landing um                                 last week and next week but

                       carol payne and                                 i work for netflix as an imaging                                 specialist on our creative technologies                                 team um and we all recognize the amazing                                 amounts of                                 work that have gone into open color iob                                                                                             it's really been incredible to see                                 everything that's happened                                 um and with that comes                                 you know a lot of changes and we                                 realized                                 that in order for                                 our users of all kinds to be able to                                 make the most use                                 of the new features the iov                                  that we needed a documentation update                                 and we needed to be able to uh you know                                 put into writing all of the amazing work                                 that's been done                                 so that users could easily pick it up                                 and get going without a lot of headache                                 and have all that information at their                                 fingertips                                 so we did a couple things the first of                                 which                                 is a new landing page uh you know                                 a little bit of a modern update with                                 some nice new colors                                 hopefully to make the information quick                                 and clearly available                                 for what's where and when                                 [Music]                                 we started thinking about how to                                 approach                                 the new documentation and came up                                 with a system that we feel that ocio                                 users really                                 fall into three main categories                                 obviously there's some overlap and                                 things like that                                 go back one side sorry michael i'm going                                 to talk a little bit                                 um but we really feel like they fall                                 into a couple main categories um                                 artists that are using it from a surface                                 level application side                                 um studios that are integrating it into                                 their pipelines so pipeline tds and                                 config authors                                 and then developers who are integrating                                 it into software applications that we've                                 talked a lot about uh like maya and                                 flame and                                 all of the other amazing applications                                 that support opencolorio                                 so that's where we started and we                                 realized we needed a pretty                                 uh pretty big revamp of                                 our entire documentation set so to that                                 end                                 we have moved to uh read the docs                                 um and we want to go to the next slide                                 thanks michael                                 um yeah so our our base level                                 documentation is now read the docs via                                 rst and syncs                                 um our api docs are built from the c                                 plus plus headers                                 um and using doxygen and breathe and                                 also generating that rst                                 for sphynx um and so it all lives um                                 under one place now and the you know                                 the main part a lot of the main parts of                                 the documentation are handwritten                                 by us and then the api docs are                                 auto-generated                                 so that's sort of the general philosophy                                 that                                 we took approaching this project is                                 pretty similar to a lot of                                 other documentation projects out there                                 nothing                                 too crazy or out in the wild but it has                                  taken                                  an amount of work to to move the                                  infrastructure and get it up and going                                  um we'd love for everybody to get                                  involved                                  and check it out and so                                  it's still definitely a work in progress                                  so as you navigate the new dantation                                  um please you know take note of what you                                  find                                  there's still a couple

                         about our new documentation or about a                                  cio b                                   in general if things aren't clear if uh                                  you know we're missing something                                  um any feedback we will welcome at this                                  point in time to really make                                  the one the upgrade experience to v                                   smooth but also taking a real look at                                  just overall how to                                  get a new user onboarded to using ocio                                  in whatever capacity is needed whether                                  you're an artist                                  config author or a software developer                                  and i think that that is all i have to                                  say about that                                  thanks for being here guys um we have a                                  couple questions so we're going to move                                  directly into the q a section                                  of the talk so please continue to put                                  your uh questions in the q a box and                                  we'll kind of                                  go down the line and uh and uh                                  answer them with you know the questions                                  with the most upvotes                                  and sort of in the order that they were                                  received so we're going to start                                  with a question from from rod bogart um                                  can the                                                                gpu                                  i'll take that one yeah uh thanks for                                  the question rod                                  the um the way that works is the                                                                                                  an equivalent forward                                                   cpu                                  and then that's uploaded to the gpu                                  and the gpu does a forward                                                                                                        works quite well but we're uh we're                                  interested in getting people's feedback                                  from                                  that um another thing that we should                                  mention related to                                                      gpu now allows both tetrahedral                                  and trilinear interpolation so                                  that's that's another sort of                                  improvement from                                  from v                                                       interpolation was not supported on the                                  gpu great                                  awesome uh the next one uh from steven                                  shapiro                                  uh is which major softwares the dcc                                  vendors have already                                  been testing ocio v                                   well certainly at autodesk a number of                                  our product teams have been                                  testing it um so                                  um not sure if there's any other people                                  here who can speak to                                  uh to other dcc vendors i i know some of                                  the studios have also been looking at it                                  for some of their internal tools                                  and we've gotten some feedback that uh                                  you know foundries began                                  investigating testing on their end as                                  well um                                  through the tsc and so it's it's                                  starting to pick up but yeah there's                                  been                                  you know some ongoing studio testing                                  probably for                                  a year uh interestingly and related to                                  the                                                                     in production a bit is                                  you can actually build oclv                                   use it to invert a                                                        that out to a lut file and then use that                                  in ocl v                                                      used a decent amount in production and                                  has been pretty                                  effective way to kind of see how that                                  performs                                  and silhouettes uh paul just mentioned                                  in the chat that silhouette uh from                                  boris fx has been looking at                                  the new version as well yeah that's                                  great                                  uh now that we're you know feature                                  complete                                  to wrap up that question now is the time                                  that we would really like to get in                                  touch with                                  all the major applications and new                                  applications that are interested                                  in integrating ocio and work with you                                  over the next few months to                                  make sure that everything is working as                                  intended we anticipate catching some                                  bugs                                  and fixes and we need everybody's help                                  to do that                                  so the more that you can get in there                                  and start to test things                                  the better and let's see                                  next from nick shaw when are there                                  likely to be pre-built binaries or a                                  simple installer                                  so non-developers can install oci ob                                      test it                                  so as we uh you know get closer to                                  to a v                                                                  will be to try to                                  target you know a lot of package                                  managers and from from various platforms                                  as well as hopefully                                  also um python package and index for the                                  bindings to                                  to ease that uh there's there's an                                  initiative in the ci working group right                                  now                                  well one of the goals is to look at                                  utilizing ci build artifacts                                  uh to be able to distribute some of                                  those uh you know as                                  sort of a continuous deployment                                  setup and so i think that will                                  definitely be a goal                                  um also mention that from the                                  perspective of building the library                                  we've introduced a new cmake variable or                                  argument that's ocio build ext packages                                  if you set this to all and run a build                                  all the external dependencies                                  can be pulled from upstream repos for                                  you automatically to ease building                                  it still requires building but it's just                                  it's there for                                  people that don't necessarily want to                                  have to chase down all the dependencies                                  great uh the next question is uh                                  is the new studio config expected to be                                  lut free                                  as well as the reference config                                  i think that's a goal but uh it remains                                  to be seen whether that'll be possible                                  they're                                  you know there it's possible certainly                                  that there will be some                                  transforms that uh aren't supported yet                                  in built-in transforms but that's                                  it's also something it's an interesting                                  case for                                  finding new cases for new built-in                                  transforms that the main ocl library                                  could support                                  same uh thanks rick for the other                                  question um are the gpu and cpu paths                                  bitwise identical                                  well when you're doing floating point                                  calculations it's hard to get                                  bitwise matches so they're not going to                                  be bitwise                                  matches even if you did on two different                                  gpus they wouldn't be bitwise matches so                                  so that's not really feasible but                                  they're extremely extremely close                                  and the um there are now unit tests in                                  place that actually compare the cpu and                                  gpu                                  results and make sure they're within a                                  certain threshold                                  okay are there                                  any plans from from gene first law                                  uh are there plans to target other gp                                  gfx apis as well as opengl                                  so cuda vulcan metal                                  we've had some interest of people to                                  contribute                                  additional bindings along that line and                                  if people                                  if people have interest we would love to                                  work with you and get your contributions                                  in that area                                  it looks like dennis wrote in there that                                  they'll they're looking at contributing                                  opencl support so already have a little                                  bit of an answer there                                  and just called sorry just to answer                                  also that we try to build the api                                  uh easy to integrate uh                                  cuda vulcan and metal we put extra                                  attention to                                  to easier work so uh you have an example                                  with opengl but we really decoupled                                  the uh collect of information from the                                  opengl implementation                                  let's see um if a dcc tool already                                  implements the opencolorio library                                  will it be very difficult to update to                                  the newer version                                  one of our goals was to make that as                                  simple as possible                                  so we hope the answer is no it's                                  certainly we're interested for your                                  feedback on that                                  the only area of the api that really                                  changed dramatically was the gpu api                                  and as patrick said that was kind of                                  unavoidable given that the                                  um you know we need to now allow                                  updating                                  you know uploading more than one texture                                  onto the gpu and so forth but                                  we think it should be straightforward                                  and for the gpu integration you now have                                  examples so i should help                                  even if it's completely different you                                  have command line tools we have a static                                  we have helper classes so it should give                                  you                                  hints how to do it or to reduce them as                                  is there's kind of two                                  two aspects to upgrading so the first                                  aspect is just                                  getting the app up and running um                                  basically with none of the new features                                  just just taking advantage of the                                  improved processing precision and so                                  forth                                  that and that we think should be                                  straightforward but there still is work                                  involved to implement the new features                                  and                                  and we want to emphasize the importance                                  of that because a lot of the                                  benefits like the user user experience                                  improvements and so forth                                  do rely on applications uh revisiting                                  their ocio code and                                  and implementing support for those new                                  features                                  so i leave a question from satish goda                                  about support for web browser-based                                  workflows                                  yeah that uh that's a good question it                                  came up also during                                  the digipro presentation and we                                  we haven't really looked at that um but                                  it                                  i agree it would be very interesting and                                  and if you're                                  if someone has a use case for that it'd                                  be great to get you involved in the                                  project                                  um i will point out that the support for                                  icc                                  profiles is um                                  is is perhaps the best way to                                  [Music]                                  do you know emulate what the brow                                  some of the browsers are doing in terms                                  of their color management                                  we're tying into that                                  noticing that we also have a question in                                  the chat from rick sayer                                  uh sort of following up on the lut                                  inversion                                  and rick is asking uh                                  whether he said it would be great to                                  allow a special ground                                  truth mode which skips the                                  quote make a forward lut to represent                                  the inverse                                  unquote applying the full inversion                                  operation per pixel                                  and that is possible uh                                  so it's uh it's it's only available on                                  the cpu because the                                  nature of the calculation would be very                                  in other words searching through                                  the forward left to find the inverse                                  very difficult to do                                  in a shader language but it is available                                  for cpu evaluations and there is                                  uh an optimization setting that allows                                  you to switch between                                  the exact evaluation or the fast                                  evaluation                                  and rick was also asking                                  is it is it possible to control the size                                  of the intermediate lut                                  that is currently a fixed size but that                                  would be a simple pull request for                                  someone to                                  to allow that to be configurable                                  awesome a question from from alex                                  freestone                                  uh this is one i think we also got at                                  uh at digipro but uh what can we see in                                  the future for version three                                  of ocio forward thinkers                                  good question yeah i mean at digipro i                                  was saying that we                                  you know we've been so immersed in                                  getting v                                                               hard to                                  think about anything else so i would say                                  uh                                  and ask us uh next time i don't know if                                  other people have suggestions                                  uh what they would like to see for v                                   but                                  we're in this i would say yeah if you                                  have suggestions                                  please please get involved but uh                                  yeah we've still got um you know the the                                  road to                                  being done and released with with ociv                                   is still                                  still ahead of us and so it's it's uh                                  you know it's really working on getting                                  uh solid and wrapped up and very stable                                  is the future for now                                  and uh zach lewis wants to know if the                                  dw in                                  hue correct dw                                                          uh that may be that was uh that was one                                  of the aces algorithms that                                  is now implemented in ocio as well                                  thank you zach for                                  for your investigation of the source                                  code we appreciate it                                  yeah that's great uh                                  zach also wants to know about ctf                                  ctf is an interesting new feature so                                  we were talking in the presentation                                  about the common luck format                                  which is part of the                                  aces                                                                      the                                  the common left format that has a lot of                                  nice operators like logarithms and                                  things that make it possible to build                                  luts for scene linear color spaces but                                  it does not support all of the ocio                                  features so                                  there's an extension to clf which is                                  called ctf                                  that looks very similar it's an xml                                  file format that's very similar to clf                                  but it allows                                  all openclario features to be serialized                                  into this xml and so that's                                  uh that's quite useful for a number of                                  workflows where you may need to                                  serialize a given                                  ocio processor and send that to someone                                  uh patrick mentioned that there's an                                  ocio wright command line tool that                                  allows you to                                  do this basically so you give it like                                  the sort the config the source and                                  destination color space and it will                                  write out an xml file                                  that gives you the exact uh                                  implementation of that processor                                  an interesting project an interesting                                  side effect
