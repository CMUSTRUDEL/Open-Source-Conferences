Foundry tools are a key component of many production pipelines, and our adoption of open source projects is a big part of that. In this talk, we’ll cover what open source tools are most significant to Foundry and why, including OpenEXR, OpenColorIO, OpenTimelineIO and USD. We’ll also cover which open source projects are of emerging interest, and how Foundry manages the dynamic between commercial software development and nurturing of critical open source components, including updates to the VFX Reference Platform.

	                              hi everyone um thank you very much for                               attending the session today um we're                               here to talk about foundry's engagement                               with open source                               and what we're really hoping comes out                               of this presentation                               is a a different perspective or at least                               a deeper perspective about how a                               uh major vfx tool vendor like                                uh foundry actually works with open                                source                                uh both in terms of delivering it to                                customers and internally and also how we                                contribute things to the open source                                community                                um i'm uh my name is matt i'm the                                director of product for new technology                                at                                foundry and i'm joined today by my                                colleague rob hi i'm rob fanner                                i'm engineering manager for our platform                                group where i look after                                core and shade technology engineering                                teams                                great so um let's uh let's kick it off                                with                                uh a a kind of a controversial statement                                um you know if you've got the your                                preconceived notion that you know                                commercial companies are mainly all                                about shipping                                proprietary tech that's you know the                                myth we're                                we're busting today really foundry                                uh has a very uh very intimate and                                strategic relationship with open source                                at several levels so that's kind of what                                we're going to talk about                                um today in detail um but                                first more importantly is why does open                                source                                matter to foundry and that's really a                                question for us                                that we uh answer at two levels                                um the most important level uh for us                                obviously is                                uh is for customers if open source                                matters to our customers                                and therefore it matters to us greatly                                but more specifically                                uh what customers really want is                                maximum pipeline ability um studios                                uh you know pipeline developers people                                who                                build tools in the heat of production                                really need to be able to work with                                software                                and tools that have the the greatest                                ability to fit into a pipeline                                with lots of other pieces um you know                                foundry's tools are just                                you know one citizen among many that                                make up a production pipeline                                and keeping the uh you know keeping a                                really                                strong focus on the overall pipeline is                                important to us                                and it's also about compatibility with                                file formats tools and libraries                                uh when you know vendors introduce                                formats or tools or                                things that have to uh you know that                                aren't at versions that are compatible                                with the other                                tools or file formats that folks are                                using it causes                                uh it causes a lot of pain and we do our                                best to                                keep things as compatible as possible                                and related to that is it's all about                                keeping a low barrier of adoption                                familiarity                                when our customers pick up uh pick up                                our tools                                and need to kind of change their mental                                model or                                uh you know have big sort of uh semantic                                hurdles to get over                                it just you know it causes a lot of drag                                and reduces their ability to                                focus on the aspect of you know                                delivering                                creative content so we try to avoid that                                as much as possible                                but we also have selfish reasons for                                working with oss                                and one of them is we don't we don't                                want to reinvent wheels um there's also                                really great                                 uh wheels up there in the open source                                 world and already made                                 and uh we want to focus on being able to                                 uh to augment those or build around them                                 or just fit them in and build the rest                                 of the car and not worry about the                                 wheels                                 we also want reduced maintenance and                                 onboarding overhead                                 you know the onboarding overhead is                                 actually really important when we                                 look at talent or people with certain                                 skills that we want to bring in to help                                 develop our products uh folks who have                                 worked with                                 uh major open source projects or open                                 source of any kind                                 really bring a super valuable skill set                                 to the table and they bring                                 uh you know a certain readiness in terms                                 of their skill set that we can                                 we can take advantage of to get them up                                 and running really quickly so that's                                 super important to us                                 we're also looking at a desire to have                                 efficient and industry standard                                 infrastructure                                 uh robert will talk about this in more                                 detail as well but you know we use open                                 source to make                                 our own um to make our own software                                 development processes tick                                 and that's really important in order for                                 us to remain efficient                                 and uh agile and respond to changing                                 changing market needs so                                 um what look what you know what does our                                 overall shape of our engagement look                                 like uh we kind of see it at three                                 levels                                 uh one level is you can think of foundry                                 as                                 uh you know an entity that sort of ships                                 open source                                 uh uh libraries and systems                                 uh with you know our tool set kind of uh                                 encompassing those                                 so we heavily integrate open source and                                 open standards into our products and                                 uh you know we'll go into that in more                                 detail it's really about                                 uh like i said before maximizing                                 pipeline interop                                 also our products are really heavy on                                 having open and flexible apis                                 and very often those apis uh relate to                                 or depend on underlying open source                                 systems so                                 that's a really important aspect for us                                 to pass that uh                                 that simplicity and interoperability on                                 to                                 uh to people who are using our tools and                                 integrating them in the pipeline                                 uh we use open source our internal tools                                 and processes rely on open source                                 um and interestingly we'll talk about                                 this a little bit later we also have a                                 long experience                                 uh working in the cloud space and a lot                                 of experience using open source tools                                 uh related to cloud services so that's                                 an experience that we've had                                 as a company that we hope to build to                                 bring to bear in the future as well                                 and finally we are contributors to the                                 open source community we have a long                                 history of contributing to open source                                 projects                                 uh and we have a github uh many github                                 repository or several github                                 repositories                                 with tools and projects that folks can                                 make use of and you know i think on the                                 contribution side that's where we're                                 really looking to the future and looking                                 to                                 really increase our investment so we'll                                 be talking about that a little bit more                                 as well                                 so i'll pass it on to robert talk a                                 little bit about how we ship and use                                 open source                                 so robert why don't you tell us a little                                 bit about what                                 goes into foundry products right so                                 next slide matt we use a lot of open                                 source software uh this line here                                 is just one of one or three of our                                 desktop applications and a subset of the                                 open source using them                                 both in the production and and that's                                 finely shipped                                 um when we look at the software as a                                 service of clouds sort of neck of the                                 woods                                 there's a lot more of these libraries                                 and the font gets really small                                 um so enough about that matt will                                 continue that later                                 matt next slide so as matt said                                 um for us the pipeline ability fitting                                 into the larger ecosystem                                 what our customers use is extremely                                 important so from that perspective                                 robust apis makes this possible so if we                                 haven't got features for it then                                 customers can roll their own                                 integrate what they need and move on um                                 compatibility                                 is very important for us as well so the                                 vfx reference platform has been great in                                 terms of that so version night has be                                 gone                                 we can pick common software version                                 focus or software and make sure that                                 it's easier to integrate across                                 pipelines                                 open formats are very important for our                                 customers and so it's important for us                                 so alembic open xr                                 open colorio these are supported almost                                 universally across our portfolio                                 we're also looking at usd it's currently                                 sported for importing into katana maori                                 and nuke                                 and there's much more to come in that                                 space it's also worth just touching on                                 open plug-in systems in the value that                                 they bring                                 things like open fx have been extremely                                 valuable for writing                                 c-based plug-in plugins for compositing                                 systems                                 um but also things like the more modern                                 usd hydro and we're really looking                                 forward to seeing how hydro                                 can democratize things help customers                                 bring their real-time rendering                                 technology into our viewports                                 uh next slide mod um                                 so internally in our tooling we also use                                 a lot of open source software there is                                 proprietary technology we are across                                 platform                                 so there's more going on here but                                 there's a lot of open source so high                                 quality things like gcc                                 clang lldb gdp loads of analyzers and                                 linters uh most of our bulk stack conan                                 cmx                                 cons is all open source software                                 on the continuous integration front and                                 agile stuff build infrastructure source                                 code managing                                 again lots of open source use linux is                                 almost everywhere                                 get jenkins python engine x and apache                                 for servers                                 prometheus and grafana for monitoring                                 and reporting things all of that                                 is heavy use matt next slide                                 over to you i don't know anything about                                 cloud                                 yeah and i'll talk a little bit uh                                 briefly about                                 uh an aspect of foundry that probably                                 isn't the first thing that comes to most                                 people's mind                                 but we uh we have uh over the last                                 several years                                 built up an extensive experience of                                 building cloud infrastructure                                 uh we had a product uh called ethera                                 that we discontinued last year                                 brethren was really the tail end of a                                 multi-year                                 multi-year research and development                                 effort of cloudifying visual effects                                 workflows                                 that started with collaboration with uh                                 with certain studios and evolved into an                                 internal r d project and                                 kind of resulted in a commercial offered                                 for a period of time                                 what's really cool about this uh                                 knowledge we've built up with cloud                                 infrastructure is that we                                 are positioned to put out new projects                                 which we have in the works                                 but also it gave us a lot of contact                                 point with a lot of open source software                                 systems                                 uh in the cloud space so some of the                                 some of those that were in play were                                 around kubernetes and containers you                                 know we really think that uh container                                 technology is something that's uh you                                 know a big uh you know a big trend that                                 has                                 uh a lot of headroom uh especially the                                 visual effects industry for                                 for people to leverage uh we worked with                                 golang                                 uh and you know working with uh angular                                 for front end go line for back-end                                 systems                                 and all of the interconnect and that you                                 need to                                 build deploy and manage microservices so                                 calico                                 istio uh all of the data plane stuff                                 from                                 cockroach elastic for you know log and                                 log searching                                 and also open source systems to connect                                 artists to remote virtual workstations                                 so we work with turbo vnc and no vnc                                 um one of the interesting aspects with                                 this cloud technology is um                                 you know late last year if you're you                                 know following some of the                                 uh going ons in the classes there's a                                 bit of a you know                                 like they're calling it the license wars                                 in terms of some                                 open source systems making their open                                 source licenses more restrictive in the                                 face of                                 large cloud players coming in and                                 offering them as managed services                                 so that's kind of an interesting trend                                 that uh you know we're                                 you know we've sort of got an eye on but                                 i will say that                                 those systems being as open as possible                                 was a huge accelerant to us                                 and really helped us to build and deploy                                 our                                 cloud systems quite quite rapidly                                 um so robert uh why don't you tell us a                                 little bit about uh                                 some of the the challenges and benefits                                 that we've had                                 oh okay i wasn't realizing yeah this                                 would be in the deck                                 anyway so yeah i mean there's no such                                 thing as a free lunch                                 um open source software is free but uh                                 there are                                 niggles licensing mismatches when you                                 sort of want to use something but you                                 can't because the license doesn't match                                 something else in your stack                                 um that's something to be aware of the                                 aswf shift towards using apache                                       apache                                        clas has been very helpful in terms of                                 clearing legals                                 and will continue to be helped from that                                 regard i think um                                 there's sometimes less developer support                                 available in some of these libraries if                                 it's broke you've got to fix it yourself                                 abandonware                                 is an issue with some libraries so we're                                 very fortunate to have the aswf there to                                 curate                                 and be a guardian for vfx libraries                                 variable quality                                 not all software is created equal but                                 thankfully there's plenty of like                                 best-in-class open source software                                 and that's the ones we focus on so                                 you know it's probably true that                                 commercial software shares similar                                 challenges right not all great                                 and can be abandoned things like that                                 occur but all in all                                 open source software is very compelling                                 proposition for foundry                                 yeah and if you guys are following along                                 the deck that we made available this was                                 a slide we removed so you guys get a                                 free bonus slack today                                 right um okay so our contributions to                                 open source i mean primarily we consume                                 and we integrate and we ship open                                 formats things like that                                 but we've also contributed to some open                                 source bits so way back in                                      we created openfx um we did some                                 performance patches for alembic                                 in                                            i think even as back early probably                                     we started looking at windows                                            we could use it as katana viewport                                 and then finally shipped with the                                     version and contributed some of those                                 patches back to pixel                                 integration uh used the plugins                                 originally authored by pixar for katana                                 and mari we adopted and upgraded those                                 and i'll take a stewardship for them our                                 research team recently                                 made a machine learning server live it's                                 also open source and                                 we're really looking forward to seeing                                 what artists and customers can create                                 using                                 machine learning technology inside of                                 nuke um we're currently busy working on                                 a shotgun plugin in conjunction with                                 autodesk                                 it's not quite out yet could hopefully                                 shipping soon and then i guess par for                                 the course is the odd patch to things                                 like cute mesa                                 zinc open xr usd next slide                                 right so um i just wanted to touch on a                                 subset of the things that we'll be                                 working with in terms of open source in                                 the coming months                                 this isn't everything just a few                                 interesting ones to highlight                                 um so as mentioned definitely looking                                 forward to more usd integration                                 deeper integration building on top of                                 what we already have                                 also looking at doing hydro and most of                                 our viewports there's a risk i'm used to                                 used to rapidly evolving and improving                                 um but they they are you know the                                 library facilitates us using one version                                 customers using another inside of our                                 application so we'll leverage                                 techniques like that we're also going to                                 look                                 more at material interchange formats and                                 some of our applications                                 customers have been able for years to                                 use our apis to take materials safe from                                 mari into katana into their renderers                                 so it is a solved problem but having                                 those common interchange formats                                 uh is valuable is important so we will                                 be looking at material x and usd shade                                 for that for example                                 um open color io is coming out with                                 version two                                 uh some point soon um obviously that                                 goes in conjunction with aces upgrades                                 so um very i know a lot of customers                                 looking forward to that so                                 we will be integrating as well um and                                 then i just want to touch on our                                 internal sort of development efficiency                                 aspects                                 we have been using conan for c plus                                 package management i know the tools like                                 raz and bc packaged are used by others                                 raised in the linux predominant                                 vfx industry um uk                                                     all conan based for third-party                                 libraries um katana was probably                                    uh third-party libraries was clean and                                 managed um it only                                 works currently inside of our ecosystem                                 and some tech debt that we need to                                 to remove before we be able to share                                 that more widely but we're hoping to                                 you know if things go well have                                 something towards the end of the year                                 and then we're also working with mesa                                 zing technology crafted by the                                 collaborate team                                 that'll help us to legacy opengl support                                 um                                 while we move forwards with vulkan and                                 metal on platforms like                                 osx thanks a lot                                 great um and you know there hasn't been                                 very                                 much visuals in this talk uh because we                                 are talking about                                 libraries and uh interoperability um but                                 this uh this is an image of                                 nuke studio with the um the color                                 management                                 uh system in the lower left um                                 that uh shows the open colorio                                 integration                                 um i was actually uh told by                                 uh one of the new product managers that                                 uh thanks to                                 the way uh the really great way the open                                 color i o                                 uh spec is evolving the getting you know                                 version two stuff                                 in uh is is an increment is uh                                 you know much easier so we're                                 anticipating uh                                 that being a really easy transition so                                 uh we're actually quite pleased with the                                 way the the library is kind of organized                                 and evolving and                                 we're hoping that actually uh reflects                                 into our release timeline for                                 open color io                                                katana which is just a really great                                 lighting tool                                 your great uh usd support uh and we're                                 looking uh much more at uh                                 increasing our investment uh in usd                                 across                                 our entire product line uh nukemari                                 uh and uh and katana as well um                                 but uh yeah the usd support in katana is                                 really                                 uh you know kind of top-notch right now                                 so we're kind of forms the basis of                                 our existing uh our existing footprint                                 with                                 usd um so some takeaways so                                 uh i hope uh this gives everyone a                                 deeper                                 and more interesting perspective on how                                 a player like                                 foundry actually makes use of open                                 source in a                                 tangible uh tangible way we ship                                 we use we contribute to several open                                 source projects                                 uh we package open source into our tools                                 uh to empower creatives sometimes we                                 expose those                                 you know through epis or directly to our                                 libraries but really the focus is on                                 using                                 uh open source to add value to our users                                 and but we also use it to make our own                                 internal processes stick so to add value                                 to                                 ourselves and that's really important as                                 well uh like robert said you know big                                 investments in build systems and                                 packages package management systems is                                 really critical to us                                 uh and we're also really focused on                                 putting code into the hands of the open                                 source community some new projects and                                 uh enhancements as well and i think this                                 is an area where                                 uh we'll be increasing uh over time                                 and we also have big bets on multiple                                 open source projects                                 i really feel one of the great things                                 about                                 uh the academy software foundation uh                                 you know nurturing                                 uh so many projects is now you know                                 there's a really great outlay                                 of mature and uh you know                                 uh compatible like uh well adopted                                 open source projects out there uh thanks                                 to the                                 uh thanks to the efforts of the academy                                 and this really allows vendors like us                                 to uh build uh you know                                 more predictable longer term uh                                 strategies and release plans                                 around open source so i really think                                 this is uh                                 you know this is a big a big trend that                                 we're going to be banking on                                 quite a bit in the future is looking at                                 open source as the basis for more and                                 more things going forward                                 so um with that uh we                                 have uh we've allowed a bunch of time                                 for questions                                 uh i'll turn off the screen sharing in a                                 moment um                                 but uh if you note uh you can visit our                                 github uh our github link down in the uh                                 the lower right uh we have several                                 projects there including                                 the plugins robert mentioned with the                                 machine learning server and                                 several others so check it out if you uh                                 get a chance                                 that um yeah should we turn over to                                 questions rob                                 yeah so there's a couple in the q a bar                                 there uh the one on the top of the list                                 is from john frassois are you                                 considering open timeline                                 integration i                                 from recent conversations with the nuke                                 studio and flix teams i think the answer                                 is yes both are curious                                 with respect to open timeline into io                                 integration                                 um i don't think there are formal                                 roadmap plans for it yet but                                 definitely the sort of senior architect                                 engineers on both teams are                                 interested and are starting to look at                                 the technology                                 um second one                                 i hope that answers the question and                                 then one from d kincaid any plans to                                 contribute back the ocio nuke plug-ins                                 the ones in the oci repo                                 are very old yes i should have an answer                                 to this but i don't                                 i'll have to get back to to decon that                                 after a chat with christy                                 um i'm guessing yes but                                 don't know um                                 right then there's one from melissa                                 farcher                                 our furniture about vfx reference                                 platform can we expect python                                         supported by foundry softwares in their                                 next versions                                 um                                 it depends some of the next up versions                                 won't                                 yet be python                                                            still be python                                           but work on python                                                     all of those applications so                                 um there's alpha stuff on mari                                 internally uh nukes shipped alphas                                 already                                 um and uh i think katana is also                                 progressing                                 um right um                                 oh rory woodford said yes for the maori                                 on python                                 in the next version yesterday yeah                                 next question does usd have any concept                                 of common                                                        and is there any plans to more fully                                 integrate nuke with usg for elements in                                 a scene                                 um                                 he don't know i know there's more work                                 going on in the on the                                 yes from peter crossley great bro                                 supported by our team                                 well done uh                                 right um next one is from                                 on simo uh the usd side as well and                                 there's also the uh you know                                 interoperable usd with the                                 with                                                                    we're looking quite                                 uh quite a bit at uh how to expand that                                 in the future                                 next question from simo or simo                                 is exporting particles as usd point                                 clouds from nuke already supported or on                                 the road map                                 pete any chance you could feel that one                                 give you a chance to answer there yeah                                 okay                                 next one from dimitro korolov i hear the                                 foundry plan to include more machine                                 learning tools                                 inside of future new commercial version                                 we'll find we continue to support the ml                                 server after that                                 um this is a question for dan ring i                                 don't think we're                                 looking to to stop using the the ml                                 server                                 but there is certainly work on on                                 internal machine learning stuff as well                                 yeah we have uh several efforts uh using                                 machine learning                                 uh at a research level uh so there's                                 some some experiments going on there                                 from the um fairly wild to                                 maybe more more practical i will say you                                 know                                 machine learning and trying to find out                                 how to build tools for that that are                                 practical for artists is                                 uh you know remains uh remains a                                 challenge where we're                                 doing a lot of investment in research                                 the machine learning server that we                                 deployed                                 uh is definitely something that we put                                 out in order for people to build on top                                 of                                 basically the idea is you can you can                                 build a                                 ml model and use the machine learning                                 server                                 to allow a nuke node to uh to access                                 that                                 that model and uh and uh                                 yeah do do whatever interesting stuff                                 you can cook up with                                 one from marco are there any internal                                 tools you are using at foundry that                                 you're looking to open sourcing yourself                                 i guess the yes they are                                 most of them are sort of alpha pre-alpha                                 quality                                 um so i can't probably won't mention                                 much here                                 but i guess watch the space uh something                                 i did mention is i work on the conan                                 and ken's trips and support for building                                 lots of vfx based libraries                                 using conan that might be interesting or                                 might not depending on your on your own                                 internal tooling                                 cool um great questions um                                 fantastic and it's it's nice to hear all                                 the curiosity about                                 uh what we're doing around uh                                 some of these projects uh in the future                                 on                                 vfx reference platform and uh some of                                 those other                                 tools that were mentioned so that's                                 really good um                                 quite welcome so i don't see any more                                 questions coming in um so wow maybe we                                 can                                 wrap uh three minutes early it's pretty                                 tight
