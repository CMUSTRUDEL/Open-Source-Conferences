Open Source is well poised to be an excellent entry point for people of all backgrounds into many industries, especially media and entertainment. In this talk, we will outline the overall mission and goals for the ASWF Diversity & Inclusion Working Group, emphasizing opportunities for involvement.  The session will conclude with a panel discussion on the current state of diversity and inclusion in Open Source and where we hope to see it in the future.

   um on diversity and inclusion so let's                                go ahead and get started and talk about                                the diversity inclusion working group                                for the aswf                                so the aswf formed this group as a                                collaborative effort to advance                                open source software development in the                                motion picture and media industries                                this is really a cross-industry effort                                and includes                                everyone who is interested in open                                source software                                um and improving the diversity and                                inclusion across open source software                                as well as within the vfx and animation                                industries um it includes anyone who is                                interested in joining the working group                                it does not have to be someone who is                                necessarily a programmer though that is                                obviously um                                also a great thing but it can it can be                                anyone who is interested in kind of                                furthering this cause                                for diversity and inclusion so far                                 we have done a number of things to move                                 this working group forward                                 we have a regular meeting set up every                                 month it's on the second                                 wednesday of the month at one o'clock                                 in pacific standard time in addition                                 we've now already held three meetings                                 with about                                          diverse people being included in each of                                 those meetings                                 they've actually been really fantastic                                 everyone has been very involved and had                                 a lot of really great things to add to                                 the discussion                                 um after our very first meeting we                                 surveyed our membership                                 to determine what people were interested                                 in                                 seeing out of this working group and                                 then based on that survey we drafted a                                 series of goals and deliverables                                 that we have now submitted to the tac                                 for approval for                                 the official working group now i want to                                 just go through a few of the survey                                 results so you have a better                                 understanding of where everyone was                                 coming from when this group got formed                                 we had about                                                            responses came from a wide variety of                                 uh locations so there were people that                                 were coming from all kinds of different                                 companies which i've included a small                                 selection on this                                 on the screen and as you can see this is                                 a wide                                 range of different companies that are                                 working within the open source                                 vfx and animation communities                                 one of the questions that we asked right                                 away was um how familiar folks are                                 with open source software um and again                                 you can see that this working group                                 very much is a spans a wide variety of                                 different people some people that are                                 extraordinarily familiar with uh                                 working with openstar software and other                                 folks who                                 are just getting into it and we really                                 want to encourage                                 that level of diversity as well                                 so what age group do you think is the                                 most important to target for increasing                                 diversity and inclusion in open source                                 communities                                 what we found with this question was                                 that overwhelmingly                                 people were definitely leaning towards                                 college                                 university and high school students                                 being the ones who were                                 the the key target if we could uh really                                 start to talk to college university and                                 high school students                                 about this topic that we should be able                                 to make some improvements in diversity                                 and inclusion within open source                                 software                                 another thing we were really interested                                 in was the types of programs that a                                 working group like this                                 should really be trying to target                                 and so we asked an open ended question                                 with some                                 suggested topics um the question was                                 what kind of programs do you think will                                 have the biggest impact on diversity                                 driving diversity and inclusion                                 um by by and far the number one answers                                 were                                 mentorship and partnerships so you'll                                 find when we start talking about our                                 goals                                 and deliverables these are some of the                                 the key points                                 that we have brought into a lot of                                 of the things that we're hoping to do as                                 a member as as the working group                                 so let me go ahead and hand this over to                                 carol who will be talking through the                                 goals and deliverables that we have                                 drafted up                                 yeah thanks rachel um so yeah so based                                 on the results of the survey                                 feedback from the group and uh both mine                                 and rachel's sort of and emily olin's                                 ideas in the area also                                 um we went together and formed three                                 different goals                                 for the group and then some deliverables                                 that we feel we can reasonably achieve                                 in a                                 you know year-ish we're not putting a                                 strict time frame on it yet but                                 goals and deliverables that we can                                 achieve within the working group so we                                 can measure our progress                                 um the first of those uh is                                 around student education and really um                                 what that means is these are broad goals                                 and then the deliverables are how we're                                 going to accomplish it so this school is                                 encouraging high school and college                                 students to pursue                                 a career in or participate in open                                 source projects                                 just by education um and tying it back                                 to                                 our film and visual effects and motion                                 picture industries and how                                 what an impact open source has on those                                 applications                                 the second one is around diversity in                                 the foundation itself working with the                                 different groups                                 in the foundation as well as the                                 leadership                                 of aswf to talk about what diversity and                                 inclusion means for                                 the foundation and its projects                                 um and then the third one is around                                 resources and guidance                                 for the foundation members whether that                                 be on an individual basis or you know a                                 company member basis                                 providing those resources and ground                                 truths for                                 our members to educate our colleagues                                 and the industry at large                                 on diversity and inclusion topics                                 specifically related to open source                                 but the premises are relatively general                                 so really being a resource for                                 our members and our community in that                                 area                                 so based on those three goals we came up                                 with some associated deliverables                                 that we think really tie it back are                                 things that we're                                 already splitting into subgroups in our                                 meetings                                 to start driving around these different                                 deliverables and what they're going to                                 look like                                 on the student education front the first                                 one is a mentorship program                                 as rachel noted targeting high school                                 and or                                 college students i'm looking at how to                                 tie those back into                                 partnering with aswf projects and using                                 linux                                 resources at the linux foundation                                 already has available                                 and then also promote partnering with                                 external organizations                                 to promote coding and software                                 development                                 and we think that open source is a                                 really awesome                                 opportunity to really get in get your                                 foot in the door and get familiar with                                 uh up to date and and you know and                                 recognize software development practices                                 across the industry                                 and so we're looking for examples of one                                 to two universities and                                 or and or organizations with which to                                 work so                                 if you have suggestions if you're                                 listening this call and you you think                                 you know a great fit of an organization                                 or university                                 um no limits on on location                                 over you know a global industry a global                                 organization                                 and so we're really looking to everyone                                 to                                 help us help us spread our reach in this                                 area                                 and the second deliverables                                 are around the diversity in aswf and i                                 sort of kind of alluded to this                                 when i was describing the goal but you                                 know working with attack and the board                                 to establish some real uh concrete goals                                 for the aswf leadership                                 and membership and then something that                                 we're already starting to work on and                                 get volunteers for                                 is a an inclusion ambassador                                 and per aswf project so                                 that we're linking back each aswff                                 product                                 project to the diversity inclusion                                 working group                                 so we have open communication and lines                                 and that ambassador can work to ensure                                 openness and inclusion in each of our                                 projects and and                                 keep that feedback and communication                                 going                                 and thirdly um around the guidance for                                 members                                 uh we're also looking at we came up with                                 in our last meeting                                 some great ideas to start a series of                                 blog posts                                 on inclusion topics starting with                                 things written by the members of our                                 working group but we're certainly always                                 looking for                                 new topics and new information and all                                 these things                                 that are so pertinent to all of our                                 areas of work                                 and secondarily a landing page for those                                 resources and educational material                                 that we're starting to gather all of                                 these are                                 in their very uh                                 initial and infant stage and and so any                                 feedback that                                 that you have or anybody has around                                 these goals and these deliverables                                 um we're really interested in hearing                                 everybody's feedback                                 um in this area and the next slide i                                 think is                                 along those lines where to give that                                 feedback um if you have it obviously you                                 can use                                 the chat right now or the q a um but                                 in a more permanent way if you'd like to                                 get involved we've got                                 our mailing lists that you can jump on                                 and then                                 our diversity channel in the aswf slack                                 that we're all uh pretty attentive at                                 trying to answer questions and and stay                                 on track and then obviously come to our                                 meetings                                 um like rachel mentioned um those are                                 the highlights that i wanted to give                                 rachel anything i missed                                 no um i mean i just want to you know                                 emphasize that we really are interested                                 in having an                                 excellent um diverse group uh worldwide                                 that can participate in these                                 conversations and help us                                 drive uh towards these overall goals so                                 certainly join the mailing list join us                                 on slack join us for the meetings                                 um the more the merrier i think that we                                 can we can make a big difference                                 if we all work together                                 i agree so i think that ends                                 our uh we we slammed through that nice                                 rachel that's great                                 um i think that ends our uh slide                                 presentation                                 portion of this event um and then we                                 were when we were talking about                                 um you know having a session at open                                 source days as a very new group                                 within the aswf both rachel and i felt                                 that it was                                 is really important to have it have an                                 honest discussion                                 about where we think we stand and where                                 we want to go                                 and so we thought doing a panel um with                                 a couple                                 esteemed colleagues that i'm going to                                 introduce would be                                 an awesome way just to you know start to                                 talk about                                 the work we're doing all three of these                                 panelists are                                 members of the diversity inclusion                                 working group already                                 as well as had long careers already

                              you to the panel                                 and kick it off with a fun question for                                 all three of you                                 and that i like to ask because                                 of the range of answers we get in this                                 question but when i say                                 diversity and inclusion what does that                                 mean to you                                 individually um anybody would like to                                 start                                 can you bridget sure                                 so um what diversity and inclusion means                                 to me                                 diversity to me describes what makes                                 each of us unique                                 so we all came from different                                 backgrounds we grew up in different                                 areas i was military kids so i moved                                 around a lot and got to experience                                 different cultures                                 and um having those different                                 experiences and those different                                 backgrounds                                 molded our our beliefs and our worth                                 ethics                                 and things like that so                                 that's the diversity side of it and the                                 inclusion side                                 means that we want to try to be                                 representative of people who have those                                 different backgrounds and have those                                 different beliefs so that when we're                                 working together on projects and                                 initiative we each have a                                 unique point of view that can tackle how                                 to handle those                                 those projects and initiatives in in                                 different ways that we would have never                                 thought about if we                                 um if we're working with the same kinds                                 of people that grew up in this                                 in similar ways as us um then we might                                 be able to handle                                 projects in a new way yeah                                 awesome thanks victoria                                 um i guess put very simply diversity is                                 the who and uh inclusion is the how                                 and diversity is is different um                                 it's visible and non-visible across                                 so many different things you know race                                 age                                 political views gender gender identity                                 sexual orientation                                 it's it's such a broad broad area                                 and inclusion is really how we include                                 that difference                                 um i guess it's a behavior you know you                                 can have                                 a really diverse team or company                                 but if it's not inclusive um then then                                 it doesn't work                                 um so um yeah that's that's                                 my thoughts on dni that's awesome                                 last but not least larry yeah i think                                 you know a lot of a lot of my thinking                                 around this sort of                                 stems from just recognizing that                                 you know as an industry you know we                                 are it's a creative industry and it's                                 one that is consumed by                                 everyone of all backgrounds and all                                 around the world                                 and so it's it's just glaringly obvious                                 when you look                                 at you know who is who's at the front                                 end you know making these things versus                                 who is consuming them                                 um these things are are not the same                                 there's obviously                                 you know vastly underrepresented groups                                 and that that makes no sense like i've                                 never seen anything                                 in my life that makes me think that you                                 know the talent and                                 interest in these things should be                                 anything other than more or less                                 randomly sprinkled through the                                 population um and so to me that means                                 um we're missing um the some of the                                 talent that we need                                 to to do the best things and just from a                                 totally so                                 selfish you know point of view like i'm                                 a consumer of movies i want to see the                                 best                                 most creative you know films and i use                                 software and i want it to be                                 you know top and i work on these things                                 and i want my co-workers to be                                 you know the most interesting creative                                 you know                                 um talented people i can find and so                                 any time that any of those things don't                                 you know are sort of suspiciously                                 non-representative                                 uh of the whole population i i always                                 view that as                                 like some you know like some group of                                 extremely talented                                 people that i want to work with and                                 consume the                                 products of their work are somehow being                                 excluded                                 in a way that just makes us all you know                                 a little bit poorer                                 for not having them be part of the                                 creative process                                 yeah absolutely agree um yeah and then                                 anytime                                 panelists please you know jump in with                                 thoughts and things like that but                                 going off of some of the things you just                                 said larry                                 we talk about a lot you know we we say                                 with                                 open source software that it's open to                                 all and it's really                                 you know anybody can participate anybody                                 can contribute but if we actually dive                                 down into                                 reality um we we come across the same                                 unseen systemic barriers to entry for                                 people of underrepresented backgrounds                                 as in any other                                 organization um i wanted to talk with                                 you                                 larry specifically but everybody else                                 about how we make space                                 for for these groups um we've talked you                                 know                                 a lot about this throughout but love to                                 hear your opinion                                 you want me to start with that one sure                                 yeah okay yeah sure                                 but yeah i mean the the reason that i                                 think                                 open source has a particularly big                                 contribution                                 to make is that a lot of the                                 like it should on paper it should be                                 ideally you know posed to not have these                                 limitations                                 and be extra inclusive um and much more                                 you know meritocratic um you know like                                 lots of the things that lead to                                 the sort of implicit biases that might                                 make                                 someone's resume not get seen or you                                 know                                 people come away from an interview with                                 a sort of fuzzy they're not quite like                                 me do i really want to hire them like                                 a lot of that gets swept away because                                 much of the open source                                 development process uh it's remote                                 you're not you know                                 seeing people um there's usually sort of                                 song you know objective                                 you know aspect of it like the code                                 works or it doesn't it makes the project                                 better or it doesn't                                 um so on paper it's all you know                                 um the theory is it should be like                                 the most even you know playing field                                 that we should see                                 in anything that we do but in in                                 practice                                 if you actually look at the people who                                 are the most active participants like                                 you look at the                                 the technical steering committees of our                                 own projects as much as we're all                                 committed to this                                 and they're they're very uniform looking                                 right so                                 you know we have to get our own you know                                 house in order there                                 too um and it's very tricky                                 um you know i i think that that part of                                 it                                 is is just sort of you know correlation                                 like                                 um sort of diversity aside if you look                                 at the people                                 who are like in the leadership circles                                 of these projects                                 they're also the same people who are                                 kind of high up in those organizations                                 they're also the same people that you                                 see                                 um you know on the on the digipro you                                 know program                                 committee there are also the you know                                 the same people that you see                                 um you know in the scitec awards process                                 um you're like we keep we keep running                                 into the same people                                 including people on these calls and so i                                 think there's                                 there's this heavy networking effect                                 where once you're kind of in                                 with this crowd um those are the same                                 people that you see at                                 all of these coming influential groups                                 and so i think if you can crack any                                 one of them to pull the people in who                                 are not                                 already part of that you know that in                                 crowd i think that                                 not only is a direct contribution but it                                 also                                 gets them feet in with all of these                                 other sort of important industry                                 activities                                 and professional development                                 opportunities um                                 and so i like the phrase you said about                                 making space um you know i think all of                                 these groups                                 if you asked everybody they would they                                 would all say that not only                                 would they allow but they crave you know                                 more                                 diversity and inclusion but putting that                                 into practice is a lot more difficult                                 and i think it                                 it takes people doing things like saying                                 yeah sure you know i'm an obvious                                 uh i'm an obvious uh choice to be on                                 this panel or whatever but                                 but actually i want to pull in you know                                 this this developer                                 you know over here who hasn't done that                                 but i know they're capable of doing it                                 um maybe they wouldn't even think to                                 volunteer themselves                                 but you you know you you have to you                                 know take yourself                                 out a little bit and push some other                                 people in who you know are ready for                                 that                                 step and and help to sort of push that                                 process                                 along and and be inclusive in a sort of                                 more active way                                 absolutely yeah i agree with that of                                 like you                                 it has to be um                                 actionable it has to be it has to be                                 purposeful it can't be                                 you know anything that i've learned of                                 you know inclusion and diversity efforts                                 over the years                                 is it cannot be passive it's not just                                 going to                                 happen um you know overnight or                                 or by accident of things like that you                                 know if we want to                                 specifically in leadership roles                                 increase the                                 that visibility and that diversity it                                 has to it has to be                                 you know you have to decide to do it and                                 actively                                 do it um victoria then i've made it out                                 to be                                 too right like it's it's the the the                                 step of going from having that sentiment                                 to                                 putting it into process is actually                                 really difficult because                                 you know it's a pipeline problem right i                                 mean oftentimes                                 the the willingness to sort of make that                                 room and pull people in                                 executing on that depends on having                                 those next people                                 you know that line of people who is                                 ready to to move in and take up                                 you know those those positions and those                                 opportunities and that's why                                 you know i think a lot of the craving                                 that was revealed from the surveys                                 is you almost have to get people early                                 in their careers                                 and before they started their careers to                                 sort of get on those                                 paths and think yeah i could i could do                                 that                                 um and and and so then when those                                 opportunities                                 you know come up that we can make room                                 there are people there to fill those                                 slots and quite often that's the tricky                                 part                                 i think when we talk about sort of                                 making space                                 i think it's definitely a group effort                                 you know um                                 you know i train hiring managers on                                 diversity inclusion and unconscious bias                                 um and you know the the need to be                                 really aware                                 of your biases because we all have them                                 you know it feels                                 probably very uncomfortable to admit it                                 but it's just it's a fact human beings                                 are wired that way um and it's very easy                                 for me to sort of                                 you know talk through hiring managers                                 and let them know that you know                                 we like to hire people who are like                                 ourselves again that's that's a fact it                                 feels really comfortable to do that                                 but also i think it's really important                                 just for anyone whether you know                                 whether you make decisions about who's                                 hiding into a team or you make decisions                                 about who's promoted                                 it's everything you know it's about you                                 know you're part of a team and you                                 choose who you want to collaborate with                                 right and again you're still probably                                 making those decisions well                                 i choose to collaborate with this                                 particular individual because                                 they're like me right they they're like                                 me they look like me                                 they um think the same as me and it                                 feels really comfortable                                 so what i'm saying is to try and get                                 yourself out of that comfort zone and                                 work with people that typically maybe                                 you wouldn't                                 always choose to collaborate with and                                 and i think everyone has to be aware of                                 their their biases whether you're                                 someone in a company making decisions or                                 whether                                 you are just part of the team if                                 everyone's aware of it                                 then you can start thinking about making                                 steps to kind of you know                                 counteract it i don't think there's a                                 cure for for unconscious bias                                 but i think people should be aware of it                                 and and                                 the moment you start thinking about it                                 in every situation                                 you know whether you're you know it                                 doesn't have to be in an interview you                                 could just be in a meeting                                 with team members you know how you                                 include other people you know that one                                 person that isn't speaking in a meeting                                 why don't you encourage them to say well                                 you know what's your thoughts and                                 make sure that everyone has a voice but                                 i think it's really important for us to                                 all encourage each other                                 in those situations that's great                                 yeah along those those lines of                                 we hit on a couple things but i'm                                 wondering bridget if you can if you can                                 single out anything or many things that                                 you think would have helped you earlier                                 in your career along these lines                                 yeah one of the biggest things that i                                 that i would have loved                                 in in college is to have more hands-on                                 experience with with practicing software                                 practices and in real life                                 things like doing feature development                                 and then testing your code and learning                                 how to deploy it                                 and push things and we do a lot of those                                 things in                                 in school as like isolated                                 isolated classes like we were working on                                 a class project you typically just                                 put it in the zip file and upload it to                                 the to the class website                                 or you learn about testing or you learn                                 about um                                 back-end like database systems but we                                 never really                                 put it all together and i think one of                                 the the things that i would love to see                                 from um from the academy software                                 foundation and the open source community                                 is reaching out to                                 um universities and and building some                                 kind of independent study or a class                                 that                                 encourages people to learn about these                                 workflows um                                 and even like working with other people                                 remotely um                                 that's kind of taking everybody by storm                                 right now because of covid                                 um but like larry said working in an                                 open source                                 um project allows you to                                 to learn how to do that like learning                                 how to work with people                                 that are remote from you and how do you                                 how do you talk to people how do you                                 reach out to                                 how do you schedule meetings and ask for                                 help                                 um so i think that would that would be a                                 really great thing that i would like to                                 see                                 um come out of this which is one of one                                 of our deliverables that                                 that you presented yeah that's great i                                 i agree on the you know the remote                                 aspect of it is fascinating because                                 theoretically                                 you know open source should like larry                                 was talking about remove a lot of those                                 barriers if you don't have to be in a                                 specific physical location and you don't                                 have to                                 you know have a subset of experience and                                 resume to get involved and it's how do                                 we                                 how do we tap into that um and and make                                 it accessible and make it                                 a part of that and i see you know those                                 those mentorship opportunities is a huge                                 way to do that and so                                 you know if it and it you know you start                                 small and you                                 you build it from there until we have                                 something that                                 you know we can we can pile it out to a                                 bunch of different universities and                                 um make a big impact but                                 a lot of those yeah and there's                                 yeah and we don't have to move on from                                 this specifically if you guys have more                                 thoughts but                                 um i was also thinking in terms of we                                 were talking about                                 um the impact of you know key                                 development moments and                                 good mentors um for ourselves and                                 and sort of spotting those behaviors and                                 encouraging them                                 um and i'm wondering if anybody wants to                                 jump in and talk about that or have us                                 an example of                                 some great mentorship and how that                                 affected you                                 no                                 [Laughter]                                 well um i know one of the things for me                                 i've been involved with um mentoring                                 others                                 for the past couple years ilm has                                 like allowed me to do that which i think                                 is is also a really great                                 point that other companies should also                                 try to do is making space for people to                                 to do these things like um one of the                                 the efforts                                 that i was able to to do a lot is to                                 talk to                                 students um just exposing them to                                 to the film industry and i think um if                                 more                                 students had exposure to just knowing                                 what's out there then it would                                 open a lot more doors for them to even                                 say or think that um                                 it's possible to to get into roles that                                 are that are related in film                                 i think when it comes to um mentorship i                                 think                                 you know what i think is really                                 important is to encourage                                 our diverse developers and                                 leads and you know encourage them                                 to be a bit more visible you know so                                 and so people have you know especially                                 you know                                 grads and and sort of junior developers                                 so they have                                 um you know more sort of diverse role                                 models                                 um and hopefully eventually mentors um                                 but                                 but you know that's not really simple                                 you know it's it's about kind of just                                 encouraging those members to maybe kind                                 of you know be in the spotlight                                 a little bit more i think that's really                                 important                                 yeah i agree i i'm kind of curious to                                 hear                                 from other panelists since we're on a                                 topic of sort of                                 mentorship like um you know what would                                 you                                 advise you know either from the for                                 people looking to be mentored or people                                 who want                                 to be helpful mentors or companies who                                 want to set up that like what have you                                 seen in your places of work or other                                 experience that you have                                 that make for for good or bad                                 habits in those directions and what                                 advice would you give people                                 um you know who sort of they want to                                 contribute in that way but they're not                                 quite sure how to start                                 for me regular meetings for sure                                 are like the baseline it's easy i know                                 when i first                                 like wanted to be a mentor in college                                 and um wanted to help                                 other like students that were younger                                 than me um                                 what when you first do it you're like                                 okay we'll set up a meeting every                                 month or so and then sometimes like the                                 person the mentee would forget about the                                 meeting or they wouldn't                                 like they wouldn't show up for whatever                                 reason um                                 so i think getting on a cadence and                                 making sure that that                                 baseline regular meetings are happening                                 is the first                                  um is the first step and it's really                                  important to make sure that                                  that doesn't fall off but then once you                                  have                                  established those meetings then learning                                  what that student wants to                                  wants to get out of their career what                                  they want to learn                                  would help guide you and and steer you                                  steer help steer them into whatever                                  career path that they want if they're                                  interested in film then                                  you could talk about more of your career                                  pathways um                                  if they're not then maybe something                                  that's tangentially related to how you                                  got to where you were                                  i feel like is also really helpful and                                  um just watching other panels for me                                  personally i                                  love when people talk about their                                  personal um                                  journey and i like when they give                                  concrete examples even if it means that                                  i don't want to be in that exact                                  position that they're                                  at but at least learning how they got to                                  what what how they got to that position                                  like what classes did you take                                  like what role were you in when you                                  first graduated and like learning that                                  specific journey is still super helpful                                  because it kind of                                  helps you understand how that person                                  thought about those career decisions                                  um so yeah                                  yeah i agree i agree with that a lot and                                  i'll be the first to say that                                  i i don't think i would be in the career                                  that i'm in                                  without good examples of mentorship                                  um and uh you know a lot of the the                                  behaviors                                  that i see and then i try and emulate is                                  you know that mentorship is                                  uh whether formal or informal you know                                  both types work um a two-way street                                  um and it it has to be you know the the                                  mentee                                  seeking being active and seeking                                  information but also the mentor                                  being open and available and offering to                                  give that information so                                  a lot of the time uh for for me what                                  that looks like is if you know you get a                                  question and a space                                  from someone that you know might be a                                  potential mentee just                                  opening that door and asking are you                                  interested in learning more                                  with this you know would you like more                                  information on this topic or if you have                                  any other questions                                  i'm here and i'm available and you know                                  setting that open door and making that a                                  priority                                  um often for me i found is                                  is all it takes a lot of the time to                                  make that space that we've been talking                                  about                                  um yeah along those                                  you know along those same lines um                                  you know we're looking victoria around                                  like open source is an entry point to                                  the industry do you feel like                                  that's something that you know companies                                  like dnag and other companies could take                                  advantage of from                                  from a from a recruitment perspective                                  too as a true entry point to the                                  industry                                  yeah to help with that yeah hugely                                  because                                  i mean open source is is                                  sort of the perfect network networking                                  um opportunities so                                  it's quite interesting you know we um                                  we're very active in going to university                                  job fairs                                  and you know what we tend to do is you                                  know it isn't necessarily just talking                                  about the negative what we're doing is                                  we're introducing the industry and we're                                  introducing the industry to                                  comp sci students and saying look have                                  you ever considered using your coding                                  skills                                  on movies um and for the most part                                  many of them haven't and you know i                                  think we stick out                                  like a sore thumb amongst you know in a                                  job fair you know people kind of come to                                  us with this big screen with all these                                  movies and                                  and they they head to us because i think                                  we're just we're                                  always the odd one out um and it's                                  always really appealing to them i think                                  one of the                                  common questions that students ask is                                  well

myself to the industry and start                                  learning                                  things you know there isn't necessarily                                  a module that i'm doing                                  um you know in my course that is about                                  you know computer graphics but                                  you know what can i do on the side while                                  i'm studying and our advice is usually                                  you know                                  download some                                                       there's kind of some really good                                  free um you know student stuff that you                                  can download

   but actually what we should be doing is                                  saying and                                  there are these amazing open source                                  projects

                             is to you know expose your work                                  to the people who are in the industry                                  there is no better way                                  for you to get known by getting involved                                  in projects it's it's the very best                                  otherwise you know you can just apply                                  for a job when you graduate you can                                  apply for an internship                                  but if you've been working with one of                                  the developers at d neg then they're                                  going to be saying to me                                  by the way there's this you know great

it's it's it's the perfect way um                                  for for that step you know into the                                  industry we first                                  step into into a job                                  and for the employers it's it's also                                  such a                                  a risk mitigation strategy to recruit                                  from these places like you know how                                  how many times you know have you been in                                  an interview and                                  you're looking at someone and you've got                                  like an hour to try to kind of guess                                  like what would they be like as a                                  developer and your staff do they really                                  know what                                  they're doing what do they like to work                                  with you know what's their communication                                  style                                  are they having a good day today or a                                  bad day today in the one narrow slice of                                  time i have with them                                  but if they were someone who'd been                                  participating on a project that                                  matters you know to your company like                                  you've probably had a chance to observe                                  them over a long period of time and know                                  for reals like what are they capable of                                  you know what are they what do they know                                  what does their code look like you know                                  what's their communication                                  style like you know with the senior                                  developers and the angry users                                  um like all of that stuff that you guess                                  at you know in an                                  old-fashioned interview it's just all                                  out there and known                                  if you're recruiting from participants                                  in open source projects that you care                                  about                                  yeah working on those group project                                  settings i think is a really good                                  learning experience as well                                  because when um just going back to                                  talking about                                  working on class projects like you                                  either have                                  the experience of being on a really good                                  team and everybody's doing their work                                  and you actually learn something out of                                  it to like                                  people who like there's only one person                                  that ends up doing all the work and you                                  don't really know what's going on and                                  then                                  also being in a situation where you                                  don't have a team like i've been in this                                  situation where people like i don't want                                  to work with you                                  and they just it's like this low-key                                  competitive environment in in                                  in college already and so if you have                                  the opportunity to work with people who                                  do really they want to teach you and you                                  want to learn                                  it's this mutual beneficial experience                                  that you get out of that that only                                  benefits                                  both of you long term um both for the                                  person                                  mentoring you and and the company that                                  they work for and you                                  actually learning something that um                                  that's useful                                  yeah and i think it's you know we've                                  talked a lot about                                  we're the academy software academy                                  software foundation but                                  i also want to take a second to make                                  sure to point out that                                  you know i'm not a software developer                                  true and true                                  by trade i dabble and i write and sure i                                  can code                                  but most of my i want to make sure and                                  highlight too that                                  within the aswf because of its                                  connections to you know creativity                                  the film and vfx industry that there's                                  you know there's so many opportunities                                  to get involved because the reality is                                  these these open source projects are                                  used so heavily                                  by you know by every every major film                                  these days every small film these days                                  even if you whether you know it or not                                  and so there's opportunities to get                                  involved um and get familiar with the                                  softwares that are                                  being used and you know we need feed the                                  the teams need feedback                                  they need people to test they need                                  people to just uh you know                                  say whether their documentation makes                                  sense um and there's gaps                                  because there's a huge amount of things                                  that happen as                                  people that are developing these                                  projects are so close to them                                  that it takes someone um new coming in                                  and looking at it and and                                  from a fresh perspective and saying                                  things that                                  aren't aren't immediately obvious to                                  people that are so close to these                                  projects and it's it's                                  it's a huge thing and an opportunity um                                  that we're frankly missing in a lot of                                  these projects right now                                  um and so whether you're you know                                  software developers                                  is a key component um but not the only                                  one and that's the cool                                  already you know diverse nature of our                                  industry                                  in a lot of ways that i think is just                                  amazing i was going to say i think you                                  know when when we                                  when we talk about you know our industry                                  and our on our companies and the                                  different roles that are available and                                  the different um career routes it's it's                                  so broad you know it's everything from                                  being really super creative to being                                  really really technical and then of                                  course everything in between                                  um and i think that that's what students                                  are really interested in hearing about                                  you know saying well actually you know i                                  may not be the best coder but i love                                  doing this or                                  you know i'd love to lead projects and                                  and be the one that's you know                                  scheduling everything and                                  and you know and that's really important                                  you know for us to find you know                                  the future project managers and leads so                                  it's                                  there are so many different                                  opportunities that we can talk about                                  yeah it's really great um                                  along those lines i want to give each of                                  you some time to you know just talk                                  about what you really think that the                                  aswf can                                  our working group can contribute and                                  open source software if there's anything                                  that we've                                  you know sort of missed that you're                                  truly passionate about                                  um what do you think we can do now                                  what do you think a long term looks like                                  i think working on the the goals that                                  we've set                                  um is going to be what determines the                                  success of                                  the software foundation i think um we do                                  have those                                  i feel really passionate about reaching                                  out to universities and                                  the mentorship aspect of that and so um                                  proving that that is a worthwhile thing                                  to do                                  is going to be the first                                  hurdle i guess to get over                                  i would say just being visible just                                  being visible everywhere but not in                                  not just in the very obvious places you                                  know as larry said earlier you know                                  we're used to attending you know the                                  digi pros and the c graphs and                                  and you see the same you know group of                                  people there roughly every year                                  and that's great but we have to be                                  visible                                  um in in you know groups or events that                                  we're just not used to attending                                  um and really broaden our networks and i                                  think that's the really the key                                  thing is is exposure um but                                  just with a much broader outreach                                  yeah i definitely agree with that as                                  being being in places where you wouldn't                                  normally think to be                                  that's cool yeah so thank you guys for                                  this discussion and we want to continue                                  it um but we want to start to take some                                  questions                                  uh from the q a um and so rachel's gonna                                  help us facilitate that she's been                                  watching it but                                  jump in and answer on any of these                                  questions that we have from the audience                                  as well                                  yeah so we have a bunch of um great                                  questions in the q a we also have a                                  really good discussion going on in the                                  chat window so                                  so i'll just try to come up with uh what                                  what might be the next next thing for us                                  to talk about                                  um to start with one of the questions uh                                  there was some conversation in a q a                                  about how                                  one one company was working on a series                                  of dni working sessions                                  over the next couple of months and he                                  asked if                                  we could pick only a couple of ideas to                                  implement at a company                                  to promote dni what would be your                                  choices                                  for best starting points                                  i would say for me it would be what                                  victoria was saying is like                                  try to find a conference that you                                  wouldn't normally                                  attend for me personally i always point                                  to                                  when i went to the national society of                                  black engineers                                  and dreamworks was there dreamworks                                  animation and that's how i got                                  to talk to an hr representative and a                                  couple of engineers that were that were                                  there representing                                  um dreamworks in the film industry other                                  and otherwise i probably would have                                  never                                  been able to to have any kind of access                                  to it at all so even having the                                  opportunity to talk to someone and                                  have them look at my resume was was                                  fantastic to me so                                  things like that like find a different                                  conference that's not siggraph or                                  digipro that you wouldn't normally go to                                  um would be a starting point                                  awesome i would say sorry                                  um i was i was going to say that the big                                  one for me if you could only pick two                                  things                                  talk about unconscious bias i bang on                                  about it but it's it's so important i                                  think it's really interesting and i                                  think that                                  um day-to-day people just don't think                                  about it and so if                                  you really create that awareness um                                  across your your teams and then yeah                                  then people can                                  start thinking about it more day-to-day                                  in meetings                                  even in code reviews it's there's                                  there's just examples for absolutely                                  everything where                                  where you know unconscious biases is                                  active                                  i think you know if you look at across a                                  lot of our                                  organizations these companies um you                                  know if you                                  look at um you know the sort of hiring                                  of engineers you know the the junior                                  level hires that we make um                                  no it's not perfect but it's not half                                  bad either we do we do okay there a lot                                  of the time                                  um and then if you look at the leads                                  that's a much narrower and less diverse                                  looking group                                  and if you look at like the really                                  senior people                                  that's even narrower than that so you                                  know i i think                                  if you were just gonna do one or two                                  things sort of bang                                  for the buck wise i think that maybe                                  um a really high value would be trying                                  to put                                  some of these you know sort of                                  mentorship or                                  buddy system kind of things in place                                  so that you can cultivate you know your                                  recruiting and your junior staff                                  into staying um get                                  making sure that they are you know                                  shuffled onto the worthwhile                                  projects you know and and and rising up                                  in the organization                                  and then also then turning into the                                  mentors for that next generation too                                  like                                  like i like a lot of the you know                                  university and even below recruiting                                  uh initiatives but those are longer term                                  um but we                                  we're all starting out with a lot of raw                                  material to work with                                  in our companies already um but i think                                  making an extra effort to make sure that                                  they are cultivating their careers and                                  getting the choice                                  assignments um that will will help their                                  professional development                                  is is really i mean i think in terms of                                  like                                  results for effort is probably very high                                  up there                                  is my suspicion so you know a related                                  question                                  to what you were just talking about                                  larry not exactly the same but somewhat                                  similar um there was a question in the q                                  a from cheryl                                  uh where mentioning that we had talked                                  about how there's a focus on                                  college age students for the working                                  group                                  and um and that this seemed like the                                  right group to focus on                                  but she also wondered whether there                                  might be some focus on career changers                                  as well                                  ways to kind of promote um folks moving                                  from one                                  area of an industry into another uh to                                  to get into into this type of open                                  source                                  related and software development related                                  work                                  uh do you guys have any thoughts or                                  ideas about that                                  yeah i think i think                                  trying to think sort of from one                                  industry to another is                                  that's that's definitely one thing but i                                  would say just promotions                                  all together um you know one thing that                                  i've been talking to                                  to managers about at d-neg is again                                  reassessing the process for promotions                                  and i think that's really really                                  important i think                                  that there has to be um a very robust                                  process in place for when you choose who                                  you promote into leadership roles i                                  think people need to                                  rethink sometimes what a lead or a good                                  manager                                  are you know it i think people always                                  assume that you know the one that has                                  the loudest voice                                  and always speaks up in meetings is of                                  course going to make the best leader                                  that's not true at all you know i think                                  it's about approaching people in the                                  team                                  um whether they are interested in in                                  being a leader or manager one day and                                  giving them the right training the right                                  right exposure to that um and                                  um and just really opening up that                                  everyone has an opportunity                                  to apply for that role um                                  and and be considered and be given the                                  right                                  leadership training and to to enable                                  them to achieve those goals                                  any other thoughts on that one                                  i read i i'm sure any of the rest of you                                  who have had um the unconscious bias                                  kind of training and other things                                  you've probably heard the same thing i'm                                  gonna mess these numbers up because i'm                                  i'm just trying to recall it from memory                                  but um you know                                  there's a sort of um you know                                  stereotypical behavior                                  out there where you know if you have a                                  list of requirements for                                  to apply for a job or to get a promotion                                  that you want                                  you know that so the stereotype goes uh                                  and i think there's truth to this                                  you know the typical man will apply for                                  that promotion                                  if they think they have about half of                                  the qualifications that it calls for and                                  say                                  i'll get in and then i'll show them i                                  can do the rest of the stuff i know i                                  can do it                                  and like but if you ask you know a                                  typical woman who                                  is equally you know qualified like very                                  frequently                                  she perhaps won't even apply for the                                  position                                  until she has every one of the check                                  boxes                                  like completely nails right and so i                                  think you have to sort of and this                                  happens at every                                  level right it happens in the apply that                                  come into the company                                  it happens in the okay i'm there like                                  should i                                  you know be agitating to be on this                                  project that i think is going to be                                  really important                                  it happens at the like how do i become a                                  lead level like at all of these                                  you know choices so i think you know                                  sort of changing the the culture so that                                  it isn't                                  always the you know the person who um                                  you know                                  like you said is the loudest or maybe                                  would would                                  like you need to you need to pull in the                                  people who are qualified                                  but maybe they wouldn't take that leap                                  and make sure that they're also                                  they're being considered they're getting                                  put in those positions um because like                                  that's                                  you know that's a big portion of the                                  talent that's that's there for the                                  taking                                  that makes perfect sense it actually                                  reminds me of something i'd mentioned to                                  carol a little while ago where                                  even internally talking about career                                  changes i've had a lot of people in my                                                                                   asked me to teach them to program                                  artists who asked me to teach them to                                  program but they were all                                  what you might consider the typical the                                  not not diverse individual                                  um and where i think many of the the                                  more                                  folks who might fall in one of those                                  diversity categories would also be                                  interested in it but might not reach out                                  to do it                                  um so i feel like that that is a really                                  great point                                  um let's there's one other great                                  question in here that i want to                                  definitely get to                                  uh which is that most people are                                  already super stressed with their                                  workload deadlines low budget etc                                  do you think it had it is an issue                                  of free time for people of diverse                                  backgrounds to be able to get involved                                  does anyone have any thoughts on that                                  i could it's it's a you know                                  it's a it's a thing i think a lot about                                  and i think that there's two angles to                                  it                                  um and it goes back to something i said                                  earlier um                                  is that this this work is purposeful                                  on this work is is a choice but it also                                  needs to come from the top down and so                                  you know if you're if you're doing this                                  work in relation to your company                                  specifically                                  um that it has to be a company-led                                  initiative and your company should be                                  making time for you to participate                                  in these efforts and it should be tied                                  in this day and age                                  to if you're a manager or in a                                  leadership role it should be tied to                                  to your job performance to a large                                  extent because we've all seen                                  the relation to how companies and                                  organizations and people perform better                                  when they're in                                  representative uh situations where                                  where it's inclusive and diverse and you                                  have other people that                                  that look like you and or or act like                                  you are similar to you and you're not                                  the odd person out um and                                  it pro it promotes better working                                  environments and more productive                                  people in general and there's been many                                  many studies that have shown that                                  um so i think if i were in that                                  situation and feeling                                  like i didn't have you know the the                                  bandwidth                                  um or the time in my company                                  specifically it's a little different in                                  open source software                                  where sometimes it's not company                                  sponsored um                                  but in general with my company if i was                                  feeling that way                                  it would be a conversation that i would                                  start with my manager                                  um and then really start to you know                                  take that on and                                  and have that conversation as a starting                                  point of i feel this is important                                  and i'd like to contribute in it but i                                  don't have time um i don't feel i have                                  time                                  can we can we make time i should also                                  say that you know this is why we have                                  committees i'm part of                                  various dni committees and we all have                                  something that's come up and you know                                  someone's you know                                  doing crunch time at the end of a                                  project and they just cannot spare a                                  single minute but that's fine                                  because the people that do have some                                  time will take on you know                                  doing a panel or doing an event and then                                  they'll come in the next time when                                  i'm really busy i'm like okay i need to                                  step out of this one                                  and then it's kind of over to you and                                  that's how the committee works                                  so you know we you don't need to commit                                                                         you can kind of dip in and out and there                                  might just be one project that you lead                                  or you                                  are really passionate about one area um                                  and then you know                                  when when things are insane for you then                                  that's fine you know you just                                  concentrate on that so there's ways                                  there's ways to work around that                                  so we are getting very close to time um                                  so we probably should wrap this up i                                  feel like i could talk about this for                                  another                                  hour though um there's been a lot of                                  really great conversation in this in                                  this panel and i want to thank the
