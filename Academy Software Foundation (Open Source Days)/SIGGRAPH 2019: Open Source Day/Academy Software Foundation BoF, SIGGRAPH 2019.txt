                               consistent licensing to her chair                                licensing intently these were our goals                                when we started and the Academy Software                                Foundation was the decision to create it                                who has taken on February                                            going to go back in a little bit of                                quick history at that time at                                          a vote was taken by the invest                                datian committee that was looking at                                what the Academy can do could do should                                do in the for the open source community                                and from from that time it took us a                                little while                                August                                                               year ago we created the foundation here                                at SIGGRAPH in Vancouver at that time                                with our founding members so our                                founding members many of you are here                                had gone with us through the                                investigation process and I decided to                                commit to make this happen this this                                initial group was was very important to                                get everything started and then we went                                over the last year into a quick series                                of announcement                                 Sonne joined along with Warner Brothers                                 shortly

                            with I'm going to go into just a little                                 bit of detail but mainly try and draw a                                 focus on to the projects which are                                 indeed the lifeblood of you know of the                                 foundation and the motivation for all of                                 the work we actually do so with that in                                 mind let's look at the projects we've                                 managed to support and bring into the                                 foundation in our first year very                                 pleased to have reached five projects                                 which represented a broad spread not                                 only of the established projects which                                 was so much the focus of the processes                                 to form the Academy Software Foundation                                 but also to support some new projects                                 and encourage them to build adoption and                                 find ways of collaboration to actually                                 establish themselves within our                                 community it all started with open V DB                                 they were very early to submit their                                 projects and they were the first project                                 that we accepted for incubation so thank                                 you for DreamWorks for your hard work                                 there and all of the work you've done at                                 every step not only dreamworks of course                                 but the group that has formed around                                 open BTB they were the first to                                 establish themselves through the                                 governance processes that that we formed                                 in collaboration with the Linux                                 Foundation and indeed they are the first                                 project to graduate so                                 excellent news that we managed to in                                 that first year bring a project all the                                 way from incubation through to a fully                                 active asws project so congratulations                                 tool and there be db                                                  really represents many of the things                                 that we've managed to do as a community                                 as well so they have done excellent work                                 in modernizing and somewhat                                 standardizing their make system around                                 CMake they have managed to incorporate                                 the CI system that we've been                                 collaborating on together also it took a                                 path through circle CI which we're                                 exploring for a while until we settled                                 on as your CI which I'll go into some                                 details in a little while and we're also                                 seeing a good opening of potential                                 collaborations for a wider group of                                 people then we're associated with the                                 project prior to its a SWF adoption at                                 the bottom and I'll show this for each                                 of our projects this is your the                                 standard github contributions graph and                                 you can see in each case the time scale                                 varies but you can see that in every                                 case for all of our projects there's                                 been a very clear and demonstrable                                 increase in project activity associated                                 with with the Software Foundation and                                 those projects coming on board that's an                                 exciting thing of course we don't expect                                 that spike to continue always but it's                                 wonderful to see that these key goals                                 just enabling activity and engagement                                 are very clear even with these high                                 level metrics next up up so make one                                 more point so open BTB are having a buff                                 right after this meeting so an excellent                                 project to follow on and stay in the                                 room I'll be highlighting each of the                                 boss for our projects obviously there                                 are other projects which are not a SWF                                 projects which we're also supporting and                                 hosting in this space and that's another                                 theme that will we can touch one in the                                 discussions is how the role that the                                 foundation has to support projects not                                 only through direct adoption but also                                 through providing services and support                                 to the benefit of those projects                                 separately                                 next up we have open Q's off this is                                 quite a different project from many of                                 the others it uses a different                                 technology stack as a render queue                                 manager with distributed components                                 running from Python Java database and so                                 on they've done great work to set up and                                 establish a governance and technical                                 steering committee with a wide group                                 membership and they've also been very                                 active in bringing this quite different                                 shaped project into the SWF CI system                                 you can see as well that there's again                                 much shorter timeline but an excellent                                 build of activity as the process of                                 adoption through                                                        in the morning of course openexr this is                                 a project that needs absolutely no                                 introduction                                 and you can see indeed from the length                                 of that time scale how long this project                                 has been a part of and indeed the the                                 leading light for open source within our                                 industry and community as such an old                                 and established codebase of course                                 there's a lot of potential work to do to                                 bring new sets of developers up to speed                                 and understand the history of that                                 project and there's been an absolutely                                 amazing display of energy and                                 integration to do things like modernize                                 the code base consider things that                                 otherwise were often discussed but                                 didn't really quite have the shape or                                 the environment to collaborate on like                                 moving from make to see make that's a                                 project that's currently in progress                                 within openexr another example is                                 looking at actually changing the                                 structure of the project where to                                 recognize the fact that ireland base i                                 math and opx are all actually serve                                 quite important roles and maybe                                 separating that functionality and                                 targeting those specific components for                                 more broader use is something that we                                 have a really opportunity to do as a                                 community again an excellent example of                                 wide contributions for a broad base of                                 contributors                                 open cholerae Oh another long live                                 project that's been very become very                                 well-established in our industry the                                 timeline again shows a clear uptick from                                 a fairly quiet period of many years and                                 that project is extremely well advanced                                 in the process of moving towards                                 adoption they have governance and their                                 technical steering committee very well                                 established there's a very ambitious set                                 of features and functionality for the                                 version to release which is primarily                                 spearheaded by new contributions from                                 Autodesk and as with our other projects                                 that moved very well along in                                 collaboration with our other projects to                                 establish the parameters for the ASW FCI                                 a degree of shared and modernized see                                 make and I think we can look forward to                                 graduation for this project very soon                                 they're in a very good place and of                                 course our most recent project of which                                 I don't have much detail yet but I                                 encourage all of us to attend the both                                 in the early afternoon is open time I                                 know from Pixar so again this is a                                 brand-new project for the foundation we                                 accepted the project for incubation only                                 a week ago and it'll be a great                                 opportunity for us at all engage with                                 the project here while we have the                                 chance to do so face to face so I've                                 lived with the projects because they                                 really are the most important part of                                 what the foundation does but I'll step                                 back a little bit just to explain how                                 the technical advisory council functions                                 in relationship to those projects and                                 indeed how the foundation itself also                                 functions so each of our projects is                                 largely autonomous and they have their                                 own technical steering committee and                                 governance processes that dictate how                                 that project is managed and evolved and                                 how contributions that other processes                                 work the technical advisory council has                                 representation from each of those                                 projects as well as the membership the                                 premier members of the foundation and                                 other experts within the industry so for                                 example we have                                 representative of the EVs technology                                 committee as an excellent pod of                                 correspondents with that community and                                 the VFX reference platform for example                                 as well as this sort of high-level                                 coordination role the TAC is an                                 environment for us to work on                                 essentially a common infrastructure that                                 is that serves all of those projects and                                 the prime example of that has been our                                 CI platform which I will talk to in a                                 moment that's obviously been one of the                                 headline goals for the foundation and                                 we've worked with great dedication                                 activity I think over the last year with                                 members of attack and also the broader                                 community to really try and solve a few                                 of the problems that have been a to                                 larger scale perhaps for any individual                                 project to to solve on their own there's                                 a lot of detail in the slide and perhaps                                 this is something we can go into in                                 another context but I'll give you a                                 broad overview because I know this has                                 been a point of interest in and focus so                                 after some exploration with different                                 structures and strategies and trying to                                 understand how we can generate systems                                 which can not only work well in the sort                                 of open-source context but can provide                                 examples and reference that could be                                 used in studio and other environments                                 we've settled on an approach which has a                                 mixture of these elements and should be                                 very familiar to general open-source                                 developers and highly compatible with                                 the kinds of for PR work clothes they're                                 typically used in that context as well                                 as being able to to provide components                                 and reference examples for people to use                                 those in in other contexts like studio                                 environments so github of course is the                                 primary interface for for code npr's we                                 have used as your pipelines as our CI                                 engine and that is partly or is in large                                 part because of its availability of all                                 of our target platform so we can serve                                 not only Linux but Windows and Mac                                 builds in that platform and we can also                                 actually easily use external resources                                 such as GPU enabled machines or builders                                 which have specific license availability                                 for components which can't be run in a                                 more public environment easily from that                                 environment that's the dotted lines to                                 the side there                                 we're using Sona cloud as a                                 software-as-a-service analysis tool and                                 that feeds into some of the CII badge                                 the core infrastructure initiative badge                                 requirements that we've adopted to                                 ensure that we have best practice for                                 software development in our projects and                                 for security a vulnerability                                 identification and so on and we have a                                 variety of tools for us to actually                                 encapsulate and make efficient                                 configurations across our projects we've                                 explored a variety of techniques there                                 and we have the ability to use Nexus for                                 essentially more control than                                 fine-grained artifact storage but our                                 primary means at this stage for projects                                 is the use of docker to generate                                 essentially base images and                                 configurations which can be used for                                 reproducible builds with the FX                                 reference platform compliance it's a lot                                 of fast words for all of our project                                 build so we're now being able to get                                 consistent builds across the somewhat                                 challenging I think as we're all aware                                 configurations that the VFX Restaurants                                 platform dictates for the Linux                                 platforms and we're spreading that to                                 the other platforms as appropriate at                                 the moment with that I will hand over to                                 Rob to set our gaze for the future                                 so I just want to pause for a second and                                 just recognize it this is less than                                    months of work we actually have a CI                                 infrastructure running we have five                                 projects in the facility in the                                 foundation and a number of others that                                 we're going to talk about today                                 so I'm just really pleased at the                                 progress that all of you have invested                                 and have made in the Academy software                                 foundation this first year it's actually                                 pretty remarkable we set some pretty                                 ambitious goals if you remember our goal                                 originally was to try to adopt three                                 projects in a couple months in David                                 Marin said let's make it six because                                 three looked too easy to do that several                                 months in and and here we already have                                 one project in full active status we                                 have several others that are in                                 incubation and moving forward very                                 quickly so if you are part if you've                                 been a part of making some of that                                 happen could you just raise your hand                                 because I know that I feel a ton of                                 active developers and community members                                 here yes so let's give everybody a round                                 of applause who's made this happen                                 so we want to do more of that and this                                 is the interactive part I want to                                 especially thank for everybody for being                                 here at                                                                  happen so what's happening next where                                 are we setting our sights we did a count                                 according to everybody's agreements that                                 they've already made this number will                                 continue to rise we have                                              engineer equivalents FTEs dedicated to                                 the Academy software foundation's goals                                 and in the first couple years because                                 you know on the day that everybody was                                 signing their agreements and getting                                 started up we actually had zero projects                                 in the Academy Software Foundation so we                                 made this very general we said work on                                 anything that's open-source that                                 benefits the motion picture industry                                 right but at the end of this year the                                 the language changes right and you have                                 to work these engineers will be working                                 on Academy Software Foundation projects                                 so that's                                                                what today is five projects what                                 tomorrow will be more projects and and                                 more but that's the minimum requirement                                 so if you were at an organization who is                                 on that slide and you have a dedicated                                 engineer requirement there this is not                                 something we're gonna spend a lot of                                 time auditing but this is something                                 we're gonna do spend a lot of time                                 celebrating all this engineering work                                 that you are all contributing to these                                 projects                                 if you have your FTE or your full-time                                 engineer equivalent working on something                                 that is not one of these Academy                                 Software Foundation projects but another                                 open-source project in the industry this                                 is the year to think about transitioning                                 them over finding the project that you                                 want to be involved with and then next                                 year at this time we'll be highlighting                                 some of that involvement in some of                                 those actual commits and changes that                                 we're making as not just to meet that                                 requirement meet or exceed their                                 requirement but also just to make a                                 bunch of progress on these projects and                                 of course as we have more members this                                 number will continue to rise and this is                                 again a minimum requirement as you saw                                 from that commit those commit charts                                 we're having a ton of activity on our                                 projects already another goal going                                 forward we are incredibly grateful to                                 our premier members who have gotten us                                 to the budget that David was                                 highlighting the engineering resources                                 and the commitments on the TAC and                                 everywhere else now we want to diversify                                 our membership and include more general                                 members these are probably going to be                                 generally smaller companies that                                 wouldn't be able to spare the commitment                                 either the engineering commitment or the                                 money commitment to be premier members                                 but they want to be involved in this and                                 we want them to be involved as well so                                 as you have ideas of companies who are                                 into or leverage open source software                                 and want to become general members it's                                 the general member fee is based on the                                 size of the company but it's quite                                 manageable most companies can do that if                                 they're interested and they basically                                 have a lottery for how they get                                 represented in the TAC and on the                                 governing board and there's it's a great                                 way for people to be involved so we want                                 to really encourage general members to                                 get involved this year if you have an                                 idea for a company that we should reach                                 out to please find me or David Morin                                 David Marin after this and suggest them                                 and we'll we'll talk to them and see if                                 they would be interested in supporting                                 us as a general member we've mentioned a                                 couple times that open BBB is our first                                 project graduating to active status                                 you're probably pretty familiar with us                                 by now but when we adopt a                                 into the Academy Software Foundation it                                 first starts in incubation status and                                 there's certain requirements that have                                 to be met in order to graduate to active                                 status so one of our goals in this                                 coming year is to see more of those                                 projects that you might think of as                                 active things like openexr to actually                                 become an active academy Software                                 Foundation project that doesn't mean                                 just that it's being used a lot in the                                 industry of course all of them are and                                 that is one of the requirements is some                                 usage but it's also security                                 requirements and a couple other things                                 have to be ticked off or well on their                                 way to being ticked off to graduate to                                 active status so that's something you                                 will see in this coming year                                 next year we should be announcing or                                 you'll see announcements throughout the                                 year but next year at this meeting I                                 expect we'll have any more projects                                 several more projects in active status                                 and a bunch more we have a governing                                 board meeting tomorrow we're gonna be                                 talking about looking forward into the                                 next year but I didn't want to miss this                                 opportunity with all of you gathered in                                 the room people who have are

probably                                 about a hundred and twenty hundred and                                 thirty people in the room we have a                                 high-tech way of doing this so if you                                 have a mobile device or anything you can                                 get on the internet with go there and go                                 to poll Evie comm / Academy Software                                 Foundation a SWF and you can start                                 participating it well it if this works                                 it will live update on the screen so                                 when we started the Academy Software                                 Foundation                                 thank you I'm betting that was David                                 Marin the first one submitting his when                                 we started the foundation we spent a lot                                 of time talking about these three areas                                 and these aren't the only three areas                                 that we can work on as a foundation but                                 I was kind of curious to revisit this                                 about a year later and see what the                                 relative priority is in your minds                                 between these three areas so feel free                                 to vote on you in this case you just                                 rank the three areas and then submit it                                 and I think you can even edit your                                 submission if you did it wrong the first                                 time I'll give everybody a minute or two                                 to rank their priorities and this is                                 binding this actually takes those no I'm                                 just kidding it's not binding it's just                                 it's just good information for us to be                                 basing our planning on going forward                                 David can you see how many people have                                 submitted                                 I think you probably already know this                                 but just in case you don't the                                 continuous integration environment and                                 that whole infrastructure that the                                 Academy Software Foundation is building                                 for our projects it's all being done in                                 the public and it's all downloadable in                                 case you want to run that in your own                                 studio or a business so the whole idea                                 is the efforts that we all put in there                                 into the CI environment is able to be                                 leveraged by everybody                                 whether it's Academy Software Foundation                                 project or not we've done such a good                                 job on the shared legal framework it's                                 now the third priority which is good it                                 was one of the first priorities early on                                 it's great or it's possible we have more                                 engineers and fewer lawyers in the room                                 one way or the other                                 that's where we're at right now great so                                 this one's interesting this is existing                                 open source projects out in the world                                 that you like and use by the way this                                 one you get to put in your own what's                                 gonna happen is five people are gonna                                 put the same thing in so once you see it                                 up there try not putting it on again                                 well there you go                                 so just pick one of the Reza's too to                                 vote on so once somebody is submitted it                                 you can refresh your browser and you can                                 see the things that people have                                 submitted you can upload them of course                                 we're gonna get five US DS and five                                 Reza's and the whole list                                 it's an IQ test of a hundred twenty                                 person IQ test at the same time it's                                 really just going to be USD and res                                 that is funny                                 I should have just pre-populated it with                                 a few that I thought were gonna happen                                 so a couple things about the Academy                                 Software Foundation and how we approach                                 this first we don't do any hostile                                 takeovers on projects there we go okay                                 open image is on there too so we don't                                 do hostile takeovers on projects                                 especially healthy projects if there was                                 a project that was dead in the water                                 that we all depended on we could see                                 what operation we could use but we                                 actually haven't encountered that we we                                 have really good actors in our industry                                 right now and that we don't see that                                 happening so the way this happens is we                                 have dialogue with the current owners                                 and we figure out what the right thing                                 to do is and the owners are the ones the                                 project the people who currently manage                                 the projects are the ones who would                                 submit them for consideration for the                                 Academy Software Foundation then that's                                 considered by the TAC and then ratified                                 by the governing board so that's how new                                 projects get submitted to the Academy                                 Software Foundation the other thing is                                 while being about while software being                                 accepted into the Academy Software                                 Foundation should provide everyone a lot                                 of comfort that it's gonna have a                                 long-term future because we have this                                 big industry consortium who's come                                 together and it's in basically an                                 implicit endorsement right that the                                 software is important to our industry                                 and we want to see it continue um I                                 wouldn't have it be a metric by which                                 you consider whether you want to adopt                                 software or not many of us are in the                                 business everyday of figuring out which                                 commercial or open source packages we                                 want to use and leverage heavily and                                 rely on in our industry                                 and I would argue that any open-source                                 project is going to be a lower-risk                                 project for you than any commercial                                 project right because you have a lot                                 more control over its destiny if the                                 original creator and maintainer were to                                 take it off the rails you could always                                 branch it yourself if it's a suitably                                 permissive license so open source in                                 general is good for the industry so we                                 are not in a place as the academy                                 software foundation of wanting to be the                                 gatekeeper of all the open source                                 software that's in our industry we want                                 to encourage a thriving open-source                                 community some of those projects Oh                                 maintained by the Academy Software                                 Foundation some of those projects                                 maintained by other folks                                 if USD for example never came into the                                 Academy Software Foundation and we                                 heavily leveraged it in our industry and                                 Pixar continued to do a fantastic job                                 developing it that's a success story for                                 all of us and we would want to support                                 that so but it is great to see the                                 interest in these projects up on the                                 board here everybody get a chance to                                 vote I'm bettin bettin you did great                                 thank you for that list we will keep                                 this - so this slide is similar to the                                 last one but instead of existing                                 projects that you know and love that you                                 would like to see adopted by the Academy                                 Software Foundation this is new areas of                                 development this is something like let's                                 say there was no open color i/o out                                 there and you had the idea of an open                                 source color management system you can                                 submit that here perhaps the Academy                                 Software Foundation this year should                                 consider starting a project from scratch                                 we haven't decided that we're doing that                                 but it's we could host something like                                 that and it takes some of those                                 engineering efforts that we can focus on                                 our problems in our industry and our                                 challenges and turn them towards new                                 projects so feel free to submit your                                 idea here and then I think you've                                 noticed you can upvote or downvote the                                 various ideas that people have submitted                                 oh could you imagine us doing naming                                 standards                                 we've considered as we've talked a                                 little bit about what we might do with a                                 newer project or a project bell from                                 scratch we've talked about maybe the                                 first one that we consider not being too                                 ambitious in scope but anything you                                 think of here is really welcome                                 is there compositor with nine positive                                 votes and a compositor with negative one                                 just because we wanted to hide it let me                                 get rid of these guys hello                                 so we've got it up above                                 I don't know going back to the top I'll                                 give that leave that up for one more

                   to stand in the back as well where the                                 food is with someone who submitted                                 metadata want to describe what section                                 of metadata they were talking about I                                 don't mean it's like saying stuff what's                                 that to me to meta that's right                                 no one wants to describe what the minute                                 ten people agree with you so you are you                                 are the second most popular topic maybe                                 because it means ten different things to                                 ten different people cool great thank                                 you guys it's great okay so this little                                 poll is designed to talk about areas                                 that we might be able to focus on that                                 are not explicitly about these projects                                 so things we might consider doing as the                                 Academy Software Foundation because of                                 our position in the industry and because                                 of the group we brought together that                                 aren't explicitly just about that list                                 of projects that we were talking about                                 so things like the CI infrastructure                                 could be one thing shared across many                                 projects there's been people who've                                 talked about a home for certain kinds of                                 datasets or those kind of things to                                 consider other things that we might want                                 to look at going forward that we could                                 perhaps take on as a foundation                                 oops sorry about that let me go back                                 oh boy                                 I'd love to in addition to the                                 leveraging the BFX reference and                                 platform in our CI infrastructure what                                 would be another step for us on the                                 visual effects reference platform in                                 some of your minds do you want to dare                                 shout out oh there's a mic for you go                                 ahead go ahead                                 okay I was just going to suggest the                                 office thing is Windows and Mac because                                 we don't really have that covered                                 yeah add Windows and Mac to the existing                                 visual effects reference platform for                                 those many of you probably know the                                 visual effects reference platform is                                 actually a effort by the visual effects                                 society a ves tech committee that they                                 updated annually they have a meeting                                 Wednesday of this week to go over it the                                 new reference platform for Linux                                 actually has the shift over to the new                                 version of Python version Python three                                 we're entering the modern era so it's a                                 big change if you want to weigh in on                                 that I don't think there's gonna be much                                 pulling back on it we delayed it one                                 more year last year I think it's gonna                                 happen but feel free to show up in that                                 meeting tomorrow you can does anybody                                 know the time for that meeting or                                 location sorry                                 and where is it do you know Nick so for                                                                                                      part of that so that is a ves tech                                 committee effort but in close cut and                                 we've been collaborating with them and                                 following and continuing to try to                                 promote that together                                 but adding Mac and Windows to that would                                 be welcome                                 what would across studio Universal                                 identification system be this crestview                                 of goo ins is it for us video sorry                                 it'll be very hard what is it metadata                                 yes perfect we'll get right on it                                 naming cowboy naming standards did not                                 get a lot of up votes I'm okay with that                                 convinced developers not to use GPL                                 convinced good companies to use GPL well                                 we have almost the same number of votes                                 [Laughter]

and of course we're still looking for                                 more members as David says the next                                 member gets to be the one who pushes                                 over a million dollars so that's going                                 to be super exciting for the person to                                 come the group to come in after Apple                                 which we're very excited about them                                 joining as well so unless there's                                 anything else what I think we've got                                 just a few minutes before our next                                 prison presentation did you want to say                                 anything to wrap us up here David great                                 why don't we do a couple minutes of Q&A                                 with this group any Daniel do you mind                                 coming up to so we can feel the                                 questions together and any questions                                 about this opening session and then in a                                 couple of minutes we'll turn it over so                                 our next presenter can set up and we can                                 get started on the birds of the feathers                                 on good morning as you're thinking about                                 your question I also want to recognize                                 that John muriatic is in the room here                                 from the Linux Foundation in the back                                 many of you who have interacted with the                                 foundation are interacting with John                                 both John and                                 they are helping us from the Linux                                 Foundation along with a lot of other                                 people from the Linux Foundation to                                 operate the Academy Software Foundation                                 we got a lot of benefits from their                                 experience we continue to have it every                                 day emily is doing a fantastic job with                                 all of our events and PR and John is                                 helping us with a lot of our internal                                 process and benefiting from the                                 experience of many other projects that                                 the Linux Foundation has with us so it's                                 been a really great can't emphasize                                 enough how the Linux Foundation helped                                 us to get up to speed the reason we're                                 here today that much achieved in that                                 one short year is thanks to them yeah I                                 thought the beers of a feather last                                 night was a good example how many of you                                 got over to the beers of the feather a                                 handful a good handful so that's been a                                 grassroots event that's mostly been led                                 by Larry grits over the last five or six                                 years since we started doing a lot more                                 open source on our industry and last                                 night you may have noticed the Academy                                 Software Foundation ran that event for                                 us first year that Larry had more fun                                 than being nervous figuring out how to                                 collect everyone's credit cards and make                                 sure that the event got paid for was all                                 managed by the academies Norfolk                                 foundation hopefully that what last                                 night is like is a good analogy for what                                 it's like to have stuff in the Academy                                 Software Foundation it was like a little                                 better organized it was a little better                                 funded we had beer for longer and and                                 the engineers people like Larry got to                                 relax and enjoy the environment a little                                 bit more rather than running around                                 correct collecting credit cards but                                 basically it was the same event                                 hopefully it felt like the same event                                 that we've had for the last five or six                                 years so hopefully that's what a good                                 analogy for what is like if a project                                 joins or if you're getting more involved                                 in the Academy Software Foundation just                                 you know just the same as it was just a                                 little more beer it's a good sign of the                                 commitment to from so many of the                                 audience that they went from beer late                                 one night to breakfast early the next                                 day                                 exactly something that's been very                                 enjoyable to say actually is how much                                 enthusiasm and goodwill there has been                                 over the first year with blender mm-hmm                                 so far the softwares of middleware type                                 software x here from blender I also work                                 with blender are there any plans to                                 start supporting or looking at user                                 front facing software in user GUI stuff                                 as opposed to middleware any official                                 roadmap or is it just something that's                                 eventually will be gotten to or where                                 the thoughts on that please yeah from my                                  perspective there is no nothing                                  prohibiting us from doing user facing                                  software with gooeys that the user act                                  the users are actually diving into so I                                  think our biggest need that we felt as a                                  community was that some of our                                  middleware software was showing some age                                  and some of it wasn't getting the kind                                  of healthy maintenance that it needed                                  the continued to be widely adopted so I                                  think that's one of the reasons we're                                  seeing a lot of these first packages                                  being middleware like that I guess you                                  could say open queue is a user facing                                  application it has gooeys it you know                                  gets direct user interaction but it is                                  like a layer removed from something that                                  you're going to use to make the final                                  pixels on the screen but definitely                                  nothing prohibiting us from diving into                                  broader applications that are going to                                  be gooeys and and DCC apps and those                                  kind of things very happy to have the                                  blender foundation as a member and and                                  Tom is here and the blender foundation                                  is already an organization that has a                                  lot of support and and it's doing a lot                                  of activity Tom if you want to tell us                                  about what you're doing it at SIGGRAPH a                                  little bit here to communicate to our to                                  our group so I missed a little bit the                                  question but you get know if you want to                                  just tell us what you're doing and what

the old man out because                                  we are not the movie industry and we are                                  not really in the movie industry but I                                  already said I don't really want to have                                  planned in Hollywood but about Hollywood                                  and branded meaning everybody in the                                  world should be able to make fantastic                                  content and awesome games and a                                     graphics because we all share that                                  things were making movies making games                                  making things with                                                    kaboodle classics and that's our passion                                  and I think we share that and I'm                                  incredibly happy that the Academy                                  Software Foundation takes care of all                                  the very important open source libraries                                  and all of them are in blender and we                                  benefit to
