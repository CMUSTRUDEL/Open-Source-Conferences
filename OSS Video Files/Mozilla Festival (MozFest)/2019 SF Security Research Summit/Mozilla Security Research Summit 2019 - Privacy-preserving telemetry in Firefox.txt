	Henry Corrigan-Gibbs - Privacy-preserving telemetry in Firefox

Talk from the 2019 SF Security Research Summit (https://events.mozilla.org/moz2019securityresearchsummit). This event is part of the Security Engineering University Relationship Framework (SURF) initiative, which aims to increase collaboration between Mozilla and the academic community. We would like to leverage academic talent to help explore security and privacy research problems, and to strengthen Mozilla's ties to the academic community. Mozilla security engineers aim to actively participate in the research community through thesis supervision, collaborations, placements and Mozilla-hosted security summits.
