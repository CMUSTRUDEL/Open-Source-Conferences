all right hello hello everybody my name

00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:06,060
is Benton case I'm a first year PhD

00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:07,259
student at Stanford and the following

00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:10,950
measurement study is joint work with

00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:12,719
Alan and Zahir so the following figure

00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:14,219
I'm sure is familiar to most you at

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,609
Mozilla and probably most of you in this

00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:19,320
room the adoption rates of HTTPS have

00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:22,769
dramatically improved over the past few

00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,510
years we've seen the percentage of sites

00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:29,580
that are loaded over HTTPS and Firefox

00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:31,859
about double so obviously a key factor

00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:34,860
driving this this figure is that more

00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:36,989
servers now support HTTPS and a key

00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:39,450
barrier to upgrading your site from just

00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:43,110
HTTP to HTTPS is that you need to obtain

00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:46,079
a certificate from a trusted CA so a

00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:48,960
natural question here is if the rate of

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,370
HTTPS adoption is increasing where are

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,020
these new websites getting their

00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,460
certificates so in this measurement

00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,309
study we did we started out with just

00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:59,340
this question so in this next figure I'd

00:00:56,309 --> 00:01:00,960
just like to say I just like to show in

00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:03,619
the past few years over the Alexa top

00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,519
million sites that support HTTPS which

00:01:03,619 --> 00:01:08,189
CAS are they obtaining their

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,710
certificates from so if you ignore

00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:13,260
everything but this this red CA at the

00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:14,670
top you'll notice that the numbers are

00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:16,560
about the same at least for the Alexa

00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:19,290
top million stain and about 400,000

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,240
sites the question then is what is this

00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:24,299
new CA in the red that has this massive

00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,259
growth and this is let's encrypt which I

00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:29,430
had assumed many of you are familiar

00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:30,450
with but this is a CA that they're their

00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,890
founding principles are that

00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:35,130
certificates should be free of cost to

00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:38,400
users and easy to configure and the CA

00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:40,259
itself is highly automated so you can

00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,750
see here just in the past few years

00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:44,340
we've already reached that let's encrypt

00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:46,579
it's supporting about 35% of websites

00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:48,869
that use HTTPS in the Alexa top million

00:01:46,579 --> 00:01:51,390
but if you zoom out beyond just these

00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:53,310
top sites the number grows even larger

00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:56,009
it's it's phenomenal we found that about

00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:57,960
58% of all domains that are live and use

00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:01,229
HTTPS are now serving let's encrypt

00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:03,450
certificates this 58% this is like 120

00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:04,530
million or so domains and this is back

00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:06,060
in January when we brand these

00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:09,239
measurements so this number is really

00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:11,340
increased from then so a natural

00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:13,170
question then is ok so which half of the

00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,470
Internet what is this 58% of domains

00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:15,270
that are

00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:18,120
using let's encrypt are we talking small

00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:19,410
and obscure websites or is this evenly

00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,620
distributed how does this compare to the

00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:23,910
average other CA so in this next CDF

00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:26,550
that I'd like to show you we answer that

00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:30,180
question so in our active measurement

00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:31,980
study we found that as far as autonomous

00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:34,440
system distribution and effective TLD

00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:37,380
distribution let's encrypt about matches

00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:38,880
other CAS with the the dotted lines in

00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:41,520
these figures you can see the

00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:42,630
distribution of don't fully qualified

00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,270
domain names that are using let's

00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:47,459
encrypt certificates across autonomous

00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:49,830
systems and you can see the green and

00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:52,380
red dotted lines are about similar

00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:53,820
between let's encrypt and other CAS the

00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:57,570
same is also true for the solid lines

00:02:53,820 --> 00:03:00,959
for effective TLDs so for comm dotnet

00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:02,760
org different country codes the adoption

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:06,120
rates are about equal between let's

00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:07,800
encrypt and and all other CAS so this

00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,620
chart shows that for all intensive

00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,850
purposes let's encrypt acts as any other

00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,650
CA at this point they're not segmented

00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:15,390
to just one part the market

00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:17,340
I just want to zoom in a bit

00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:20,730
specifically on the largest autonomous

00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:23,550
systems we found when we looked at the

00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:24,750
distribution of IP addresses that are

00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:27,180
serving let's encrypt certificates

00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:31,290
across the largest autonomous systems we

00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:32,820
see two distinct styles of autonomous

00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:34,769
system that seem to be serving let's

00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:36,959
encrypt certificates you can see in the

00:03:34,769 --> 00:03:38,820
orange blue and purple groups on the on

00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,230
the far left we have automatic

00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:42,660
provisioning services like wicks and

00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:44,070
Squarespace where you have essentially

00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:46,410
like WYSIWYG editors for deploying

00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:48,330
websites it's fantastic to see that

00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:52,110
these services are using let's encrypt

00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:54,120
to deploy services over HTTPS for users

00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:55,320
who maybe just want to get a website up

00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,350
quickly it might not be technically

00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:00,750
savvy on the other side we see with

00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:02,340
these longer tails services like Google

00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:04,200
and Amazon where maybe users are more

00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:06,209
likely to configure their sites on their

00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,880
own and they're still using let's

00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:11,700
encrypt in large numbers so back to that

00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:13,019
first question of where are these new

00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,910
sites coming from that are using let's

00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:18,060
encrypt we then looked at the dynamics

00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:18,940
of where these customers are coming from

00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,560
or that coming for

00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:21,760
like are their certificates of the

00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,500
reason on let's encrypt this is the

00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,600
first certificate they've ever used did

00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:28,720
they come from another CA where these

00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:31,330
customers moving from so over five time

00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,190
periods in the past few years we

00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:35,650
actually charted out where these

00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:37,180
customers are moving from it's great to

00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,590
see that there are a large number oh I

00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:40,000
should say this is over about a hundred

00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:42,190
fifty thousand sites that have been in

00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,200
the Alexa top million over the last four

00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:47,020
years we can see that most have moved

00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:49,000
from Komodo and not using TLS at all

00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:50,740
again again a great driving factor in

00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,470
seeing that there is further adoption

00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:56,650
and let's encrypt the full paper is to

00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:59,610
be announced again on veteran case I'm

00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:59,610
happy to take any questions now

00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,980
