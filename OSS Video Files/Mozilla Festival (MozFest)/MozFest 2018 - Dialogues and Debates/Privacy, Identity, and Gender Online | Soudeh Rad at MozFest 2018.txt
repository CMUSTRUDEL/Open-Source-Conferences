00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:31,439
I'm super excited and really happy to be

00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:34,320
here thank you very much for having me

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:37,820
also in this Sunday evening not that the

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:40,140
weather is that nice but it's London

00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:43,230
thank you for the introduction I would

00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:50,940
maybe introduce myself better or a bit

00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:54,030
more yeah let's say I'm an Iranian queer

00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:56,730
feminist bisexual woman of color

00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:58,800
immigrant living in France that makes a

00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:02,489
lot of things but that's not all of what

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:05,280
I am as a matter of fact all of us do

00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:08,130
hold an intersection and intersections

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,119
of identities of different identities

00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:13,680
and each identity happens to be a box

00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,630
last night I arrived at the hotel like

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:19,380
around a I am I'm sorry

00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:21,560
1 a.m. and I actually confirm a

00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:24,240
conference with a lot of unicorns

00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,740
lgbtqia+ people and no one asks you

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,240
about gender there and we have the

00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:32,220
pronounce and you have to respect the

00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:34,229
pronouns really really fully and the

00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:36,150
hotel reception didn't even ask me what

00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:38,009
my gender was and what my pronoun was

00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:40,650
and of course they didn't ask me if I

00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:43,229
was a feminist if I was bisexual if I

00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:44,970
was a person of color they just assumed

00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:46,950
that I was a woman and they called me

00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:48,840
mrs. rod apparently I don't know how

00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:53,280
they felt like they had to call me mrs.

00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:55,950
rod well gender is the easiest box to

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,799
put us in right like I look at you and

00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:01,860
then I assume they're okay for Mandor if

00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,509
they have some hair here and like five

00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:07,740
women in the fact if they have longer

00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:09,239
hair where does it come from I don't

00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,709
want to really go deep in that but that

00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:13,740
comes really from our heteronormative

00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:16,080
society the culture which is

00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:18,570
all around the globe anywhere in this

00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,450
world I have been traveling no one asked

00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:23,100
me what when what my gender was unless I

00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:25,650
go in conferences where there is this

00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:27,390
assumption and people can ask you what

00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:30,060
your fir'aun's are and that is not my

00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:34,080
preferred pronoun that is my pronoun

00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:37,290
that I use these gender assumptions come

00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,120
not only in pronouns but they come also

00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:41,730
with a list of discriminations and

00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,430
privileges please if you're a cisgender

00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:46,170
man straight man white man I don't want

00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:49,260
to make you feel guilty

00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:52,380
I just want you to please acknowledge

00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:55,860
your privileges and then use them to

00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:58,140
create a better world so what happens on

00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:00,090
internet of course an Internet I have I

00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:02,010
should have a choice to say if I'm a

00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:04,050
miss and mrs. or I just don't want to be

00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:06,000
called I'm so that I didn't identify as

00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:08,220
a human being and who cares what my

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,050
gender is when I'm taking a train seat

00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:13,140
or something that was what we were

00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:15,390
talking for like two years in in France

00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:17,910
to stop people asking us if you're

00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:19,560
Mademoiselle or madam seriously what

00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:23,040
does it have to do with essence F the

00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:24,780
Train guy or woman if I'm married or not

00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:28,440
if I'm available to be married or not

00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:31,620
and that comes a lot in the feminist

00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:36,120
movement battles etc etc but how does

00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:38,460
that being reflected on the Internet so

00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:41,490
basically internet came in I'm 30 years

00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:44,400
old soon and I remember time we didn't

00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:46,440
have internet I was maybe under 13 years

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,060
old the first time I knew there was such

00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:51,150
thing as Internet that I could have

00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:53,070
access to I was around 14 15 years old

00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:54,540
and I was privileged to live in a

00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:57,990
country where I could have access to

00:03:54,540 --> 00:04:00,900
Internet well I should say that on

00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:04,170
internet it's not any better basically

00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:06,780
what happens not only that space is

00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:09,120
reflecting and mirroring the sexist

00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:12,390
societies we are living in but also

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:16,530
sometimes it's even worse the first time

00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:20,370
I was alert about my privacy on internet

00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:22,770
was about 15 years ago when my

00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:26,610
ex-husband who happened to be an abusive

00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:28,710
man emailed me and that email address

00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:30,419
did not contain my family name it's a

00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:33,659
soother undermined something something

00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:37,199
something at yahoo.com I'm sorry and

00:04:33,659 --> 00:04:39,150
then I was like oh he can still find me

00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:41,580
and I had changed my life my whole life

00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:44,009
I had moved out of that country we used

00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:46,860
to live in was there did should be some

00:04:44,009 --> 00:04:48,810
ways I could protect myself so the first

00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:52,349
thing I did that wouldn't surprise you I

00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:54,840
hide I tried to hide myself I had a tool

00:04:52,349 --> 00:04:57,240
another like email address I started to

00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,639
blog under other names that's a silencer

00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:02,250
but the person I am I couldn't take it

00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:04,650
anymore so I started to speak out and

00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:06,870
tell who I am tell everyone who I am and

00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:09,180
that not to be afraid to say yeah I was

00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:11,460
a victim a survivor someone who has

00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:14,430
experienced abusive relationships and

00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:16,349
domestic violence well and after 15

00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:18,840
years I see that that person who happens

00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:23,610
again to be a Cisco engineer is hiding

00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:26,430
himself who cares then I knew that many

00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:29,550
people like me who are identified as

00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:31,710
women which society is giving them this

00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:33,659
identity of being the woman as a social

00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:36,089
group are suffering from the same thing

00:05:33,659 --> 00:05:38,550
we cannot really understand what you

00:05:36,089 --> 00:05:40,620
geeky people are telling us encryption

00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:42,000
what is it oh that's too much maybe I

00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:46,550
should just go take care of my children

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:51,029
before I go to the next level just

00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:53,279
imagine one day on Facebook you feel

00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:55,500
good it's a Sunday evening and you

00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:58,219
actually feel like you're a hero because

00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:01,620
you have survived an experience of rape

00:05:58,219 --> 00:06:04,589
your scouring your Facebook and there is

00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:08,000
a suggestion of friend would you like to

00:06:04,589 --> 00:06:13,650
be a friend with the rapist well no and

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:15,810
that can crush you or just imagine

00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:17,310
you're not a straight adolescent and

00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:20,099
you're just trying to understand this

00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:22,500
word of sexuality I mean straight people

00:06:20,099 --> 00:06:25,469
do not have to test their sexuality to

00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:27,870
see how straight they are but this has

00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:30,120
been told to us that gay people bisexual

00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:32,279
people lesbian people have to test their

00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,319
sexuality and the best place to test the

00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:37,259
sexuality to make sure they really are

00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:39,540
part of this minority which is not

00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:43,260
minority is to go on dating apps

00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:45,330
well if your family is still LGBT phobic

00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:49,010
if they see your application on your

00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:51,840
iPhone what happens next

00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:53,640
not in London not in England but in some

00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:58,380
countries like Iran like Lebanon like

00:06:53,640 --> 00:07:00,240
Egypt etc etc or just imagine a sex

00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:05,480
worker who just wants to change their

00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:09,440
job well no chance absolutely no chance

00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:12,570
and what they do basically is that I do

00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,550
translations what they do is I come here

00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:17,100
and I speak about those people who are

00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:19,860
working with and then when I go there in

00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:21,570
the feminist or queer groups then I will

00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:24,270
start to talk about digital security

00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:27,690
which I call digital hygiene so that we

00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:30,330
can understand each other's languages so

00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:32,880
privacy is not only about if you want to

00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:35,460
make sure everything's perfect you're

00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,260
just gonna close your door and then 100

00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:39,720
knots it's also but understanding why

00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:41,610
you need privacy I don't understand also

00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:44,880
that you have a body and you have a life

00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:47,760
and you also have a right to privacy it

00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:49,470
was only um some years ago I think three

00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:52,470
or four years ago that I realize in my

00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:55,530
among my Iranian friends but friends

00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:57,480
also my contacts on Facebook or telegram

00:07:55,530 --> 00:08:00,210
or Instagram there are lots and lots of

00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:02,480
women whose profile pictures are is

00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:05,970
actually not their faces but flowers

00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:08,790
teddy bears themselves with their

00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:10,680
children etc etc now was just like no

00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:13,320
women you have to put your face out

00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:15,000
there while we're struggling in places

00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:17,850
like France about not covering women's

00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,510
faces this is exactly happening and the

00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:23,490
internet well the question was there and

00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:25,440
then I started to talk to some of them

00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:27,810
one one-to-one and one of them happened

00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:30,570
to be one of my very best friends and

00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:34,169
she said though you're getting it wrong

00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:36,599
I'm protecting my privacy because if I

00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:41,040
show my face people are gonna assume I

00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:44,040
am there to flirt with so this is the

00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:47,040
culture we are living in the Internet

00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:50,760
and if you want to change it we need to

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:53,440
change it all together and when I say

00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:55,120
all together it is all together

00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,830
how many times have you seen a woman

00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:00,340
being trolled on the Internet

00:08:56,830 --> 00:09:02,140
how many times have someone just changed

00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:04,810
that identities on Facebook changed

00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:07,050
their name and you didn't know why have

00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:10,420
you asked them what has happened

00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:15,070
how many exhausted people of this social

00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:17,710
media have they met so next time please

00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:20,980
if you're a man and if you see a man

00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:23,770
trolling a woman do not say I'm not like

00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:28,870
them instead of that instead of that

00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:29,880
please be an ally for what you believe

00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:34,480
in

00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:36,490
please do speak up please stop them it's

00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,620
okay if you're not like them because you

00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:43,710
shouldn't be but that person is also a

00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:43,710
rape sorry a victim of this rape culture

00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:58,270
so I don't want to keep it very long but

00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:00,670
um when it comes to these places when we

00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:02,980
create hashtags like ten hashtags a day

00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:05,380
and we just keep updating the hashtags

00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:08,110
on hashtags I would also call you and

00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:09,970
invite you to think twice even more

00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:13,840
about the hashtags we are creating and

00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:17,170
using an internet I remind you a revenge

00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:21,370
porn which is not a revenge and it's not

00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:23,380
porn still it does exist it usually

00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:27,520
happens when a woman says no to a man

00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:29,680
and then there is a heartbroken there is

00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:32,620
a revenge coming and it comes with porn

00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:36,880
if you want to change the rape culture

00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:40,540
in the internet we need to promote and

00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:44,380
act with consent to get to a constant

00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:49,360
culture and this is I invite all of us

00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:52,600
to be really taken care of i watch all

00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:56,050
of us to think inclusive because

00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:58,420
thinking exclusive is actually very very

00:10:56,050 --> 00:11:01,030
much difficult I mean more difficult

00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:02,860
than just excluding some people and say

00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:04,780
okay this product is only for these

00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:07,350
people this product is only for that

00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:07,350
people

00:11:07,529 --> 00:11:12,939
this is a question I actually was women

00:11:11,769 --> 00:11:14,860
yeah I was

00:11:12,939 --> 00:11:19,660
the product owner of ham down which is

00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:22,120
the only Iranian previa tracker so far

00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:25,120
it's been developed like 14 months ago

00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:27,670
and so far we have more than 260,000

00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:31,240
users inside the country and that was

00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:33,430
developed only for Android users for me

00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:35,889
my understanding was okay I'm going to

00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:38,610
use the pure tracker as it marketing

00:11:35,889 --> 00:11:41,319
product so I can raise awareness about

00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:43,389
women's rights equality domestic

00:11:41,319 --> 00:11:46,120
violence etc etc me being the queer

00:11:43,389 --> 00:11:49,600
feminist and then ever since I'm

00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:53,230
struggling to find funds to develop the

00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:55,180
iPhone users version why because there

00:11:53,230 --> 00:12:00,040
is no understanding of this is not

00:11:55,180 --> 00:12:02,319
technology this is about human rights so

00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:04,899
if you're developing some codes if

00:12:02,319 --> 00:12:07,509
you're a coder please think of the users

00:12:04,899 --> 00:12:09,759
please think who's gonna use it on the

00:12:07,509 --> 00:12:11,259
other side if you're just asking people

00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:13,209
for their gender because you want to

00:12:11,259 --> 00:12:14,529
have a beautiful infographic of the

00:12:13,209 --> 00:12:16,990
gender of people who are using it

00:12:14,529 --> 00:12:20,410
remember there's no only two genders and

00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:23,319
there is not 100 genders either there's

00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:25,059
more than that so please ask yourself if

00:12:23,319 --> 00:12:26,980
you need to know the gender of the

00:12:25,059 --> 00:12:29,079
people and what that data is gonna give

00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:33,149
you back is it because you want to put

00:12:29,079 --> 00:12:36,850
it in a pink or blue or what is exactly

00:12:33,149 --> 00:12:39,970
the aim of using that indicator also

00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:43,389
please do remember that having invited

00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:46,029
women people of color etc etc in your

00:12:43,389 --> 00:12:50,139
events or having them as coders it's not

00:12:46,029 --> 00:12:52,959
enough those people like me need to be

00:12:50,139 --> 00:12:55,509
heard need to be listened to and need to

00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:57,730
be part of the project itself they need

00:12:55,509 --> 00:13:01,600
to be decision makers they just do not

00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:03,220
need to be there to be there I think I

00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,839
should stop here so you can ask me more

00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:07,780
questions and thank you very much I

00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:10,950
really didn't want it to be a lecture

00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:10,950
[Applause]

00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:17,240
I think you see the you're familiar with

00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:19,910
the drill by now there's someone with a

00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:21,500
mic sorry I probably shouldn't stand

00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:25,779
next to speaker there's someone with a

00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:25,779
mic and there's a hand over there

00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:39,540
oh hello yeah I'm thinking about the

00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,860
situation you're walking alone a street

00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:43,139
in the night and there's a group of

00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:45,540
people coming towards you it's five

00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:48,300
women or the other the other way it's

00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:51,149
five men isn't this a situation where

00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:56,990
you feel different about the gender you

00:13:51,149 --> 00:14:00,779
could feel different well that's exactly

00:13:56,990 --> 00:14:04,279
one of the examples of rape culture it's

00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:09,329
not the only about rape is where men

00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:12,209
expect women to be there as products for

00:14:09,329 --> 00:14:15,300
them and then sexism is basically

00:14:12,209 --> 00:14:18,329
normalized this is the very question

00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:21,240
people usually ask yeah I was walking at

00:14:18,329 --> 00:14:22,980
this time in this street and someone

00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:25,500
harassed me what were you wearing

00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:27,120
what were you doing that time why were

00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,709
you there you should know this you

00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,230
should stop wearing those kind of

00:14:28,709 --> 00:14:32,790
clothes etc etc that is part of the rape

00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:34,949
culture and they would invite you to go

00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:37,680
read more about it and of course the

00:14:34,949 --> 00:14:40,560
word is really heavy because the the

00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:42,389
left experience as someone who has the

00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,519
lived experience of a woman is really

00:14:42,389 --> 00:14:46,459
heavy and that's why we want to move

00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:50,910
from rape culture to constant culture

00:14:46,459 --> 00:14:52,920
and yes of course even me myself um a

00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:56,100
word that a man could just harass me

00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:58,470
with a higher chance than a woman would

00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:01,339
but me understand my understanding of

00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:05,790
gender is not only about the physical

00:15:01,339 --> 00:15:07,829
appearance it's it does go and farther

00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:17,910
than that I don't know if I could answer

00:15:07,829 --> 00:15:20,310
fully your question so over the last day

00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:23,759
and a half we've heard about how

00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:27,300
technology and the Internet in various

00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:29,069
ways embed power structures and can have

00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:32,310
detrimental effects on minorities of all

00:15:29,069 --> 00:15:34,560
sorts sexual minorities people of color

00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:36,540
it's generally poor people around the

00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:40,350
world whose national bodies may not be

00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:44,699
as robust as some other countries are

00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:46,610
their alliances or groupings of these

00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:49,069
various affected grew

00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:51,619
that get together to take on these power

00:15:49,069 --> 00:15:54,050
structures well to be honest there

00:15:51,619 --> 00:15:57,709
should be many of them but again they do

00:15:54,050 --> 00:16:00,279
remain so-called marginalized because

00:15:57,709 --> 00:16:03,259
they're not in the center of product

00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:05,869
production basically they're always been

00:16:03,259 --> 00:16:08,809
thought up at the second stage that's

00:16:05,869 --> 00:16:10,519
true and then also it depends on how

00:16:08,809 --> 00:16:13,429
many intersectional identities you're

00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:15,259
holding so you can be part of that

00:16:13,429 --> 00:16:16,790
community like in Iran

00:16:15,259 --> 00:16:19,339
I'm not considered as a person of color

00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:21,889
it's only in France that I'm considered

00:16:19,339 --> 00:16:24,110
a person of color right or maybe in a

00:16:21,889 --> 00:16:26,899
very like heteronormative society I'm

00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:29,299
not considered minority because I'm a

00:16:26,899 --> 00:16:32,540
bisexual woman let's say it really

00:16:29,299 --> 00:16:34,910
depends where you are and what part of

00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:37,189
your identity you're expressing and your

00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:39,199
what part of it you're oppressing but of

00:16:37,189 --> 00:16:41,029
course there are lies alliances and of

00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:43,100
course in among us there are many people

00:16:41,029 --> 00:16:45,829
who are taking care and were thinking

00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:47,989
about this inclusion and being inclusive

00:16:45,829 --> 00:16:51,139
but there is so much of work to be done

00:16:47,989 --> 00:16:53,029
so so much of work to be done well for

00:16:51,139 --> 00:16:54,799
instance but I was I'm just coming from

00:16:53,029 --> 00:16:57,049
yoga Europe's conference and then we had

00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:58,730
this digital I gene a workshop and

00:16:57,049 --> 00:17:02,629
people were amazed how they were not

00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:04,039
even using the privacy filters on their

00:17:02,629 --> 00:17:05,600
phones and they were like we didn't even

00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:08,600
know that exists and you know how they

00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:10,130
can change people's lives that's amazing

00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,720
how that can change and then we start to

00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:13,959
talk about the encryption etc it's a

00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:17,929
Tran which makes people's lives even

00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:19,669
harder and they also many people many of

00:17:17,929 --> 00:17:21,679
these minorities I don't like the word

00:17:19,669 --> 00:17:24,319
minorities but they're really put in

00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:26,959
margins or let's say underrepresented

00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:29,510
people they do not have access to

00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:31,130
information and they do not know such

00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:33,110
things exist actually

00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:36,230
and they're also living inside and in a

00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:38,299
numbness situation like a bisexual

00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:40,159
person in Iran they think like the

00:17:38,299 --> 00:17:42,200
Iranian government knows everything so

00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:44,659
what I'm gonna just use this dating apps

00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:46,070
and they basically are using the

00:17:44,659 --> 00:17:48,350
features of the dating apps like

00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:49,429
geographic features the picture etcetera

00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:51,470
etcetera and they're putting themselves

00:17:49,429 --> 00:17:52,820
in danger not that something is going to

00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:56,000
happen tomorrow we don't we don't want

00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:59,480
to scare them we really want to give

00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:02,750
people the choice of their privacy

00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:04,159
okay you have not been taking care of

00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:06,590
this part of your privacy know that

00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:14,570
these are the dangers you might risk be

00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:16,639
prepared for that thank you I'm really

00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:18,830
curious about this idea that identity is

00:18:16,639 --> 00:18:21,309
contextual right so in France you're a

00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:25,279
person of color but in Iran you're not

00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:27,710
how does that fit into a world like say

00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:29,360
online where the the things that we

00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:30,919
build don't necessarily have borders and

00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,659
so how do we think about identity in

00:18:30,919 --> 00:18:36,740
different spaces if they're going to be

00:18:32,659 --> 00:18:39,320
translated into different context to say

00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:41,870
that I can identify myself as anything

00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:44,809
like I can identify myself as a unicorn

00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:47,600
and that's not a joke okay but it

00:18:44,809 --> 00:18:50,809
depends like if other people are seeing

00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:53,269
me as that identity no one asked me here

00:18:50,809 --> 00:18:55,700
what my pronouns were were but people

00:18:53,269 --> 00:18:58,909
assume that I'm a woman so do I identify

00:18:55,700 --> 00:19:02,389
myself as a woman well I can say yes or

00:18:58,909 --> 00:19:04,460
no at the same time actually or is it

00:19:02,389 --> 00:19:06,830
that the society is reflecting or not

00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:09,350
well yeah in Iran I'm I'm considered a

00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:11,000
white person because I'm I was born in

00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:13,700
Tehran and I've come from that like

00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,919
central region but those people in

00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:18,440
margins that could Kurdish people Arab

00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:23,990
people they're considered considered as

00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:26,269
I say people of color when it comes to

00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:30,590
like social media or Internet everyone

00:19:26,269 --> 00:19:34,010
has millions of choices to assume or to

00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:37,100
identify themselves with but I think any

00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:39,549
ident any any identity I take it because

00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:42,380
it's re it comes in a package of

00:19:39,549 --> 00:19:44,809
privileges but also discriminations so

00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:46,549
if I'm going out as a feminist as a

00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:49,220
queer feminist if I'm tweeting something

00:19:46,549 --> 00:19:51,980
I should be ready to react I should be

00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:54,350
ready for the tools etc etc so I can

00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:57,769
defend this part of my identity whatever

00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:59,809
idea I have just put out there

00:19:57,769 --> 00:20:01,429
I have no solution for that the only

00:19:59,809 --> 00:20:03,529
solution is that they can do it all

00:20:01,429 --> 00:20:06,470
together and if there is any change to

00:20:03,529 --> 00:20:08,750
be met it can only be met together it

00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:10,970
can only happen with every single one of

00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:12,649
us going one step forward together and

00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:13,070
actually listen to each other

00:20:12,649 --> 00:20:14,750
it's

00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:17,389
good that I'm coming here I'm telling

00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:19,429
you who I am but more than that I should

00:20:17,389 --> 00:20:21,860
be ready to sit here and listen to you

00:20:19,429 --> 00:20:23,480
so you tell me who you are and then we

00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:25,759
can find these bridges and every one of

00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:27,710
us should be and I would really love

00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:29,809
that that every one of us could be a

00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:32,149
bridge of different identities we are

00:20:29,809 --> 00:20:33,950
holding so we could all together have a

00:20:32,149 --> 00:20:36,139
better understanding of the world we're

00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:39,470
living in and stop just telling these

00:20:36,139 --> 00:20:40,429
stereotypes about gender countries I

00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:58,940
don't know

00:20:40,429 --> 00:21:01,429
companies etc etc thank you very much

00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:03,500
very very interesting talk and you're

00:21:01,429 --> 00:21:04,850
doing such important work and it's great

00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,919
that there are people out there doing it

00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:11,559
I have a bit of a provocative one for

00:21:06,919 --> 00:21:14,149
you towards the end do you think that

00:21:11,559 --> 00:21:16,460
having all of these identities in making

00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:21,049
them visible helps us recognize

00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:23,269
diversity or creates more boxes and

00:21:21,049 --> 00:21:25,309
labels to attach to people that they

00:21:23,269 --> 00:21:26,740
have to carry with them for the rest of

00:21:25,309 --> 00:21:29,000
their life and perhaps we'll have

00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:31,159
difficulty shape

00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,830
leaving behind at some point thank you

00:21:31,159 --> 00:21:36,440
of course that's a very question we get

00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:39,379
as queer people many people and feminist

00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:41,659
people when we say yeah feminism is

00:21:39,379 --> 00:21:42,919
about gender equality then they say okay

00:21:41,659 --> 00:21:45,350
then what are we talking about women

00:21:42,919 --> 00:21:48,740
only and not men only as a matter of

00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:51,259
fact we are all born human and equal and

00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:53,179
free but this is not the ideal word

00:21:51,259 --> 00:21:55,580
we're living in and until we get there

00:21:53,179 --> 00:21:57,679
we need to talk more and more about

00:21:55,580 --> 00:22:00,769
labels and those labels on not only

00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:01,909
labels they're only about not only but

00:22:00,769 --> 00:22:04,370
they're also reflecting the

00:22:01,909 --> 00:22:07,730
under-representation and the identities

00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:09,529
we tend to forget and until we get there

00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:12,799
we need these flags we need these

00:22:09,529 --> 00:22:15,169
different boxes knowing that moving from

00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:17,659
one box to the other is absolutely free

00:22:15,169 --> 00:22:19,490
and everyone can move and everyone can

00:22:17,659 --> 00:22:21,470
just identify themselves one day's

00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:22,760
something and the other day something

00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:25,460
else and there should be no

00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:26,659
discrimination until we get there we

00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:29,269
need these labels

00:22:26,659 --> 00:22:32,659
I'm boxes but the boxes are not really

00:22:29,269 --> 00:22:35,359
that boxes they're really just some tick

00:22:32,659 --> 00:22:38,210
points it's kind of like identity

00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:41,330
portability yes we call it an identity

00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:43,609
wheel we call it an identity wheel so I

00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:46,009
would invite you maybe to go search for

00:22:43,609 --> 00:22:47,539
it and then in that identity world

00:22:46,009 --> 00:22:49,489
you're holding every day you can have

00:22:47,539 --> 00:22:51,799
different portions and then you can use

00:22:49,489 --> 00:22:54,289
one of portions one day more or less

00:22:51,799 --> 00:22:56,180
thank you thank you very much thank you

00:22:54,289 --> 00:23:04,150
thank you everyone

00:22:56,180 --> 00:23:04,150
[Applause]

00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:35,850
all right so that's uh this is our last

00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:38,100
chat for the day and indeed for most

00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:41,010
Fester's here with me I have Mitchell

00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:44,760
Baker co-founder and chairwoman of the

00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:48,330
Mozilla project what we're going to do

00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:50,430
is we're going to go over some of the

00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:54,300
themes of the conversations we've been

00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:55,430
having over the past two days and try

00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:58,710
and carry them forward look forward

00:23:55,430 --> 00:24:01,050
before we do that though I just would

00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:02,610
like everyone to acknowledge Kevin

00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:04,860
Zawacki who's hiding in that corner over

00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:06,660
there who's responsible for putting this

00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:09,060
program together and inviting all of

00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:10,710
these speakers coming up with the talks

00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:13,860
and I think has done an absolutely

00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:15,390
spectacular job at the diversity both of

00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:25,380
ideas and of people who have been up

00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:29,460
here today which will thank you for

00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:32,940
joining us see you so we discussed in

00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:34,380
the lunch break since I think there have

00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:38,390
been several people here actually who've

00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:42,680
been for every single session panel talk

00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:42,680
but I know for a fact I've been here so

00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:51,900
you asked me to identify sort of the

00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:53,670
themes and I think what we've had a lot

00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:55,380
of over the past couple of days is

00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:57,180
diagnosis

00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:59,730
I think we've diagnosed a number of

00:24:57,180 --> 00:25:00,810
problems in the information society in

00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:03,240
which we live and I'll tell you what I

00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:05,040
think those are and if anybody wants to

00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:09,120
shout out ones I've forgotten please go

00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:11,760
ahead so the the sort of running team

00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:13,050
and all of this quite openly named is

00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,310
that Facebook and Google of too much

00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:16,560
power that's been something that's come

00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:21,030
up in practically every talk and

00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:23,940
practically every panel a second is sort

00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:26,850
of inadequate regulation inadequate

00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:29,310
structures for competition the third was

00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:31,320
that and this was more today than

00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:34,040
yesterday but indeed a she boot is was a

00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:36,560
very narrow world view of Silicon Valley

00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:38,880
and the fourth which so they again

00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:39,990
referred to was the embedding of power

00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:44,250
structures

00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:47,660
and so that's the diagnosis in the man

00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:51,210
the sort of dawn of the debate I thought

00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:52,790
was you know it was optimistic as well

00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:54,810
as pessimistic but occasionally

00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:57,180
occasionally quite angry or quite

00:25:54,810 --> 00:26:00,480
worried or quite reactionary which are

00:25:57,180 --> 00:26:02,760
things that worry me what I'm hoping you

00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,180
can offer is having diagnosed the

00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,850
problem

00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:07,410
having issued a very grim prognosis so

00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:14,040
I'm hoping you can offer some

00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:18,060
prescription sure like let's have the

00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:21,860
answers okay well why don't I start and

00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:21,860
and and then we'll see where it goes I

00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:40,980
will probably well the prescription

00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:43,110
maleic there's an answer out there or

00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:46,620
one answer that's really clear where I

00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:49,080
think what is clear to me as a path

00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:51,900
rather than exactly like what are the

00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:54,570
exact steps or what is the exact

00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:57,840
destination look like because we do now

00:26:54,570 --> 00:27:00,420
have a fair amount or some understanding

00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:03,030
of what's happening that's pretty recent

00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:05,580
but actually understanding not just the

00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:08,580
advertising business model of the big

00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:09,900
platforms but but how content is being

00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:12,540
moved and how people are being

00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:14,430
manipulated is pretty recent the last

00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:19,980
couple years I would say and especially

00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:22,590
on the manipulating societies it's been

00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:25,080
the last couple years so so we we have a

00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:28,350
very early and incomplete understanding

00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:32,190
of some of the dangers of the forms of

00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:34,500
technology that we have we have but a

00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:37,890
beginning certainly have angst a

00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:39,690
beginning sense of regulation and there

00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:46,140
are data protection regimes in a few

00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:48,810
places now so a pretty reasonable cadre

00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:52,509
of activists of which I think Moz Fest

00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:56,259
is an interesting microcosm but

00:27:52,509 --> 00:27:57,639
you know we're just a small group so so

00:27:56,259 --> 00:28:00,999
large you know a growing set of

00:27:57,639 --> 00:28:05,679
activists and the piece that I think is

00:28:00,999 --> 00:28:07,539
not developed at all is like what are

00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:10,749
the role of technologists and making

00:28:07,539 --> 00:28:13,659
something different and how do activist

00:28:10,749 --> 00:28:16,570
citizens consumers like both encourage

00:28:13,659 --> 00:28:19,119
choice I can at the big level we don't

00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:20,739
have it yet for a couple reasons all the

00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:22,329
social media platforms are the big

00:28:20,739 --> 00:28:24,129
platforms there's only a handful

00:28:22,329 --> 00:28:26,639
you can't leave Facebook and go to

00:28:24,129 --> 00:28:30,089
whatsapp or Instagram right you know so

00:28:26,639 --> 00:28:32,949
and and and or even the you know the

00:28:30,089 --> 00:28:36,899
alternatives from China probably aren't

00:28:32,949 --> 00:28:39,159
going to be our privacy focused security

00:28:36,899 --> 00:28:40,809
individual empowerment alternatives

00:28:39,159 --> 00:28:42,639
either so the big level there's

00:28:40,809 --> 00:28:44,199
currently no alternatives I don't

00:28:42,639 --> 00:28:47,199
actually think there will be an

00:28:44,199 --> 00:28:50,139
alternative to Facebook or if there is

00:28:47,199 --> 00:28:52,269
that it will be exactly the same thing

00:28:50,139 --> 00:28:54,159
and really successful now I could be

00:28:52,269 --> 00:28:56,229
wrong there isn't LibreOffice you know

00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:57,579
for the Microsoft office suites maybe it

00:28:56,229 --> 00:29:00,339
will you know we'll start using it

00:28:57,579 --> 00:29:03,969
instead of Google in one sense Firefox

00:29:00,339 --> 00:29:05,619
was that but not exactly so I but I do

00:29:03,969 --> 00:29:07,929
think that there are new things in the

00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:10,329
future but it will be a long time I

00:29:07,929 --> 00:29:12,459
think before a citizens or consumers we

00:29:10,329 --> 00:29:16,569
have a choice of something that is

00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:18,879
potentially rich as big platforms today

00:29:16,569 --> 00:29:20,409
where we can make one choice I mean that

00:29:18,879 --> 00:29:21,099
was a great thing about Firefox has it

00:29:20,409 --> 00:29:23,259
covered everything

00:29:21,099 --> 00:29:27,059
you could leave ie and choose Firefox in

00:29:23,259 --> 00:29:29,440
it it affected a huge part of your world

00:29:27,059 --> 00:29:31,959
so I think that is a long time coming

00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:34,419
and I think it is not accurate or fair

00:29:31,959 --> 00:29:37,509
to consumers or citizens to suggest it's

00:29:34,419 --> 00:29:39,869
our job to fix things as individuals but

00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:42,129
I do think part of the answer is the

00:29:39,869 --> 00:29:45,629
development and understanding of

00:29:42,129 --> 00:29:48,549
technologies that behave differently and

00:29:45,629 --> 00:29:50,829
that those when they occur they're often

00:29:48,549 --> 00:29:53,559
really small they may be niche they may

00:29:50,829 --> 00:29:57,129
be pilots they may be things that solve

00:29:53,559 --> 00:30:01,149
a little part of the problem and it can

00:29:57,129 --> 00:30:03,819
be easy to just not bother but but it

00:30:01,149 --> 00:30:05,200
those choices do send signals into the

00:30:03,819 --> 00:30:06,190
market I mean we're starting to see some

00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,019
at Mozilla so

00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:13,200
for a decade we've been saying privacy

00:30:08,019 --> 00:30:18,190
privacy security security and and and it

00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:21,039
hasn't changed consumer behavior I think

00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:24,580
because the it just sounded so abstract

00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:27,299
exactly and and and so now and so the

00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:30,340
conventional wisdom across the internet

00:30:27,299 --> 00:30:32,440
consumer product part of the world has

00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:34,960
been that consumers will not make a

00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:36,549
choice for privacy like you can build

00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,889
you have to build a great product if it

00:30:36,549 --> 00:30:41,519
happens to be better on privacy nice and

00:30:38,889 --> 00:30:43,779
so as consumers we want to change that

00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:46,570
but that's gonna be a lot of small

00:30:43,779 --> 00:30:48,669
choices over time you know oh I can fix

00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:51,909
this little problem or that problem but

00:30:48,669 --> 00:30:57,700
but but we need we need some of that and

00:30:51,909 --> 00:31:01,509
then I think I'm I hear what you're

00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:04,059
saying about simplistic that wasn't your

00:31:01,509 --> 00:31:07,960
word but simplistic responses or angry

00:31:04,059 --> 00:31:10,360
responses Jackson Aries the reactionary

00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:15,700
ah okay because I was gonna say I think

00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:17,620
anger is appropriate hmm now what you do

00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:19,330
with it is another like how you channel

00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:21,700
anger into something productive is

00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:26,049
really important I I'm not advocating

00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:29,139
just spontaneous expression of outrage

00:31:26,049 --> 00:31:31,090
which is usually violent so you know but

00:31:29,139 --> 00:31:33,580
but anger and the productive channeling

00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:36,669
of anger I think is important and for

00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:38,440
those of us who live in societies that

00:31:36,669 --> 00:31:41,399
have you know democratic voting in

00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:44,259
theory it should be a campaign issue

00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:45,789
it's certainly not right now and and

00:31:44,259 --> 00:31:48,879
there are other things very high on the

00:31:45,789 --> 00:31:53,620
list so I think that the what we have is

00:31:48,879 --> 00:31:55,480
the activism now is a yet another phase

00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:57,129
of how to translate that into the

00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:59,350
mainstream and and what are the

00:31:57,129 --> 00:32:01,830
activities that one could take based on

00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:05,679
that and also I think a real

00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:08,379
encouragement pushing prodding of every

00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:11,710
technologist we know to be trying to do

00:32:08,379 --> 00:32:14,080
better so certainly so for example at

00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:16,269
Mozilla we've made very formal

00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:18,909
commitments about being committed to

00:32:16,269 --> 00:32:19,910
technology that promotes critical

00:32:18,909 --> 00:32:22,970
thinking

00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:25,730
or that promotes humane behavior and not

00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:29,180
addictive or violent behavior and so

00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:31,310
that's now part of the canonical what

00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:33,820
are we as technologists trying to build

00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:37,490
into product and put into the market and

00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:40,340
so that is not enough because that alone

00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:42,170
if you're I mean we're not a commercial

00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:44,570
organization so we're not trying to

00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:46,070
maximize every penny you know and that

00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:48,080
that business motive can push you

00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:50,240
anywhere so it's not by any means enough

00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:53,000
but if if there isn't a set of

00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,980
technologists trying to build technology

00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:58,520
that's not addictive

00:32:54,980 --> 00:33:00,080
that's humane that allows you to really

00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:02,720
think about where something comes from

00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:05,330
is it rational that is not trying to

00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,650
promote outrage so you keep clicking I

00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:09,200
think the word the world will be better

00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:11,270
and we should be building that and so I

00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:13,550
think that part of the conversation and

00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:15,950
with technologists about what are you

00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:18,080
doing does that enter into your work is

00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:22,070
important I mean it it should become a

00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:31,280
mainstream discussion and then I think

00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:35,060
the the regulatory piece is necessary

00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:37,220
and it's so hard to get right so cookies

00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:40,130
in Europe yeah like like that was the

00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:43,420
first before the GDP or what did what

00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:46,750
was the effort to try and break up the

00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:50,720
advertising tracking surveillance system

00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:53,390
cookies but but it's just this notice

00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:56,110
now that it's just another thing that

00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:58,820
you have to click as quote consent or so

00:33:56,110 --> 00:34:01,580
important effort on behalf of the EU to

00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:04,490
make a substantial change but irrelevant

00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:07,490
like as it turns out learning irrelevant

00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:08,810
possibly going to productive could be

00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:10,940
indulge of training people just click

00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:13,910
things where oh well yes although we're

00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:15,320
plenty trained you know the whole idea

00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:18,950
that we're consenting to Terms of

00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:20,360
Service is ridiculous so there was I

00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:22,970
don't know if it's during Europe there

00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:25,700
there was a there is a concept in the US

00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:28,850
that there is a category of contracts

00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:32,730
with consumers that is just unacceptable

00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:35,760
the word is awkward it's unconscionable

00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:38,490
and it was applied in the 60s to a kind

00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:44,429
of contract which kept people in

00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:46,200
financial entanglement forever and and

00:34:44,429 --> 00:34:48,150
and they just ruled this kind of

00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:50,760
contract yes someone has agreed to it

00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:52,740
but you can't enforce it by this ongoing

00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:55,650
monthly payment where essentially you're

00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:59,040
just stuck forever um and and I so for

00:34:55,650 --> 00:35:01,590
example and user agreements in terms of

00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:03,450
service of the type that we now click

00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:05,250
maybe they should be onion you know

00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:07,830
aspects of them should be unenforceable

00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:09,540
as a matter of public policy like so for

00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:12,690
example at GD P R which is trying to

00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:15,660
balance which is very hard but it

00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:17,370
doesn't say you can't track people hmm

00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:19,170
like that's too far or that's too much

00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:21,780
with the business models and I think

00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:24,060
that's probably we make sense at this

00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:26,130
point but we as citizens and consumers

00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:28,290
what would that mean well I think you

00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:31,890
might mean maybe Facebook would not be

00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:33,750
here like that's not actually what a lot

00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:34,470
of consumers want right now if it just

00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:36,900
disappeared

00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:39,570
yeah like there's a lot of life and

00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:43,320
economic value so so this question of

00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:47,430
what kind of regulation and what what is

00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:51,060
a society we want rational thought but

00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:52,530
but I think that like the GD P R is

00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:54,420
putting a stake in the ground and saying

00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:56,370
well something's unaccept or we tried

00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:58,890
with cookies we you know the

00:35:56,370 --> 00:36:01,020
surveillance economy we tried we thought

00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:03,240
that wasn't good and we tried and it

00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:05,550
didn't work like here's another effort

00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:07,440
and like we intend to keep trying like

00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:11,490
that's that's a really critical piece

00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:13,890
and I I don't know incrementally how far

00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:16,770
you can get with the interpretation of

00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:19,080
this practice and is it really control

00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:21,620
or what exactly does it mean for me to

00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:24,360
have control like that that's so long

00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:26,370
that that's a long process it's a long

00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:27,660
term project the I'm really glad you

00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:29,610
mentioned economic value though because

00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:30,960
I do worry as I said in a previous panel

00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:34,020
I do worry about throwing the baby out

00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:36,630
in both water and we do need to remember

00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:38,010
that these companies have actually done

00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:39,180
a lot of good for society and indeed

00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:42,120
have brought a lot of value to society

00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:44,430
to all of us individually as well but

00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:45,420
one of the things that that are thinking

00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:47,160
about the post

00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:50,059
days that we spent a lot of time talking

00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:52,020
about this exactly this we talked about

00:36:50,059 --> 00:36:53,819
the stuff that's happened over the past

00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:56,099
two years or that people have realized

00:36:53,819 --> 00:36:59,819
over the past two years I'm not

00:36:56,099 --> 00:37:01,710
convinced we're fully prepared for

00:36:59,819 --> 00:37:03,510
thinking about the future because we're

00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:05,790
thinking about it very much in the terms

00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:09,450
of the past which is natural it's human

00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:10,920
um but is there a sort of more realistic

00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:14,099
way of thinking about the future a way

00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:16,650
that is not you know shut it all down

00:37:14,099 --> 00:37:18,750
it's it's terrifying a way that is not

00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:20,280
all well innovation is going to happen

00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:24,630
not deterministic where you feel like

00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:25,049
you have no say in how how things

00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:27,690
develop

00:37:25,049 --> 00:37:30,660
is there a sensible middle ground we

00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:33,660
could have talked I don't know I I think

00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:36,210
the curve of technical change is I mean

00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:38,130
the slope may still be increasing but in

00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:40,049
the sense of things happening so fast

00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:45,030
that it's it's actually hard to know and

00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:46,890
understand and so certainly there's a

00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:48,809
lot of change coming but but might

00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:51,000
actually be increasing so I'm not sure

00:37:48,809 --> 00:37:53,130
how to get to a middle ground there I'm

00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:57,450
not a believer that you just can just

00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:59,130
stop it like I I don't even know how one

00:37:57,450 --> 00:38:02,880
would do that or what what it would look

00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:04,940
like and and you can't you can't

00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:08,579
globally so so I think that is happening

00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:10,260
I think realistically that the degree of

00:38:08,579 --> 00:38:12,599
the surveillance state is still

00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:16,770
increasing and and will increase over

00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:18,359
time because we're just beginning to

00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:20,460
react against it like it's got a

00:38:18,359 --> 00:38:22,980
momentum so the curve may change but

00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:24,780
it's not it's not now if that's a lot of

00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:28,170
work I think to get that curve to change

00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:32,280
I do think that there is there is a

00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:34,640
large again you might not be surprised a

00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:39,720
large role for technologists and the

00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:42,089
funding and supporting of lots of

00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:44,400
technical experiments like what would it

00:38:42,089 --> 00:38:46,859
look like for me to have defensive

00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,990
technology or even offensive technology

00:38:46,859 --> 00:38:50,280
in the world that we live in like I I'm

00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:51,839
not sure you can on the Facebook

00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:54,420
platform you know because they own it

00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:56,700
but if you take or some of the AI things

00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:58,690
that are aimed at you like this it's

00:38:56,700 --> 00:39:00,700
hard but in terms of

00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:03,940
what are the tracking devices around us

00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:06,490
who's tracking us how do I know and so

00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:10,240
we are trying to do some of that at

00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:12,520
Mozilla but I think that there is a huge

00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:15,400
amount of experimentation and that those

00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:17,020
things need funding as well and that we

00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:20,619
do see more and more countries you know

00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:22,750
trying to have incubators and VC funds

00:39:20,619 --> 00:39:27,250
and you know create a technology

00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:30,130
community in in their environment more

00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:31,990
attuned to original or some other set of

00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:35,619
issues and then Silicon Valley might be

00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:38,290
and yet even those organizations don't

00:39:35,619 --> 00:39:41,800
typically fund social enterprises they

00:39:38,290 --> 00:39:43,450
don't typically fund a broader range of

00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:46,359
people that might be engaged in

00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:49,060
technology they might have inclusion

00:39:46,359 --> 00:39:52,119
programs they might not but very often

00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:54,760
it is the model of you know we want the

00:39:52,119 --> 00:39:57,790
young hotshot technologists and we want

00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:59,800
you know the best financial return and

00:39:57,790 --> 00:40:01,990
we're not really interested in privacy

00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:04,839
and oh wow if it had a double bottom

00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:08,650
line like why would we fund that and and

00:40:04,839 --> 00:40:14,109
so there are I think that's an area

00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:17,560
where policymakers and funders could

00:40:14,109 --> 00:40:19,690
actually make a difference over time so

00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:22,720
I think we've scooted around this topic

00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:28,510
oh so what is the role of government

00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:30,280
here well that's a probably a political

00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:32,859
science question like with answers

00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:37,150
across the spectrum but I think most

00:40:32,859 --> 00:40:41,530
would say protected citizens but funding

00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:42,940
encouraging zooms oh well so so protect

00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:45,099
your citizens actually I was singing on

00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:47,650
the regulatory side and first so I think

00:40:45,099 --> 00:40:50,010
that there's to me it's obvious there's

00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:52,480
a role of government these are the

00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:58,180
technological advances just like

00:40:52,480 --> 00:41:00,550
anything else I mean oil discovery you

00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:02,800
know what is a technological advance and

00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:05,290
you know every industry you know cars or

00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:07,390
they don't you know government has some

00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:11,360
role in protecting citizens so I think

00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:13,910
that's important I think

00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:16,550
and governments vary in the degree of

00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:22,700
investment in the kinds of future that

00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:24,380
you want so it probably varies I think

00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:25,850
most governments feel like they should

00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:27,320
be investing and the things that are

00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:29,600
important for their citizens

00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:31,880
I mean sometimes they invest in what

00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:37,280
keeps them in power that's that that's a

00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:38,780
different kind of thing so yeah and and

00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:41,240
most governments invest in

00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:43,970
infrastructure one one way or another so

00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:48,260
development programs and so on so to me

00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:49,940
this investment in a lot of governments

00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:52,070
are trying to invest in technology but

00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:55,070
it's it's kind of importing the model of

00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:57,680
what success looks like and so some

00:41:55,070 --> 00:42:01,010
aspect of success would be sure if your

00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:04,400
local tech scene is developing the next

00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:06,620
global platforms good great right but

00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,510
that's that's like replicating or moving

00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:12,890
or winning at the Silicon Valley model

00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:15,530
and there is this what is the set of

00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:17,960
smaller scale experiments that we can

00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:20,060
find and try and see if they scale that

00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:22,040
build something slightly different so

00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:24,020
investing in social enterprise and in

00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:27,200
fact governments typically do this

00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:29,360
through regulated monopolies which is

00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:33,530
you know model from the past that the

00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:35,150
you know the phone companies right they

00:42:33,530 --> 00:42:37,910
were all they were all the early ones

00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:39,920
who are national regulated and well not

00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:41,750
all but but many of them in you know in

00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:43,910
Europe became national regulated

00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:46,130
monopolies or the way we do water so

00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:48,730
that's one model it's not the one that

00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:51,260
you know I think works best for the

00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:54,440
technology space right now because it's

00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:57,440
just so the scope of change is so fast

00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:58,610
but but so I'm not actually advocating

00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,140
but to answer your question most

00:42:58,610 --> 00:43:02,330
governments are trying to build roads

00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:05,090
and you know the old infrastructure and

00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:08,570
so there's there's clearly some but you

00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:10,910
know range for government that brings me

00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:12,260
to my final point which is something we

00:43:10,910 --> 00:43:13,280
haven't actually talked about over the

00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:14,780
last two days but I thought it's

00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:17,600
something that we should be thinking

00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:20,630
about right now which you know various

00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:23,410
various thinkers have been warning about

00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:26,289
this for years but it does see

00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:28,510
increasingly like the web is sort of

00:43:26,289 --> 00:43:30,099
diverging in because of regulatory

00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:32,109
structures and other government

00:43:30,099 --> 00:43:34,539
interventions in different parts of the

00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:36,190
world you have all the Chinese model is

00:43:34,539 --> 00:43:39,609
the Chinese model which were all

00:43:36,190 --> 00:43:41,349
familiar with but even in the West you

00:43:39,609 --> 00:43:44,740
have a sort of divergence at the moment

00:43:41,349 --> 00:43:46,780
between European regulation and American

00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:49,390
and as a result very often has somebody

00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:53,920
who accesses the internet from inside

00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:56,230
the EU for the moment I do not have

00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:58,839
access to certain websites in the States

00:43:56,230 --> 00:44:01,150
and indeed elsewhere um is this also

00:43:58,839 --> 00:44:02,950
something that we should be thinking

00:44:01,150 --> 00:44:13,890
about as governments intervene as

00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:17,470
regulators intervene well there's a lot

00:44:13,890 --> 00:44:20,319
sort of in that in that question because

00:44:17,470 --> 00:44:23,920
I don't know what content you mean but

00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:25,270
probably DRM protected kinds of saying

00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:26,890
not even I mean so that's one example

00:44:25,270 --> 00:44:27,880
you're right there's many ways of

00:44:26,890 --> 00:44:29,619
looking at this I'm thinking of

00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:32,980
something much more basic which is the

00:44:29,619 --> 00:44:35,109
LA Times website I cannot access that

00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:38,740
because the LA Times is the company that

00:44:35,109 --> 00:44:40,779
owns it with this new it doesn't matter

00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:45,339
the point is they haven't got around

00:44:40,779 --> 00:44:46,930
even now in October 2018 they haven't

00:44:45,339 --> 00:44:53,799
got around to implementing GDP or

00:44:46,930 --> 00:44:56,920
compliance oh well yeah so the this

00:44:53,799 --> 00:44:58,990
sense of that and they may not write

00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:01,299
which is partly why I think that the

00:44:58,990 --> 00:45:03,069
regulation is trying to be in the middle

00:45:01,299 --> 00:45:05,260
somewhere and trying to negotiate and

00:45:03,069 --> 00:45:08,980
figure out what ownership what ownership

00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:11,020
actually means and but that's true

00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:14,020
everywhere like in theory you cannot buy

00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:16,990
a car that would be cheaper if it didn't

00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:18,490
meet local safety regulations you know

00:45:16,990 --> 00:45:20,859
and some set of people could buy cars

00:45:18,490 --> 00:45:22,690
that can't today thought because you

00:45:20,859 --> 00:45:24,640
know if the tires were gonna explode and

00:45:22,690 --> 00:45:28,450
the windshield was gonna kill you like

00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:32,090
it would be cheaper so so we

00:45:28,450 --> 00:45:35,360
you know we make those decisions about

00:45:32,090 --> 00:45:36,770
every industry you know it's just that

00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:38,330
right now the internet were so

00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:40,520
accustomed to everything is free and

00:45:38,330 --> 00:45:42,680
available that we're not actually used

00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:44,120
to making that trade-off so that that

00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:46,480
will be an interesting choice whether we

00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:50,900
really want it as citizens I hope so

00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:53,150
because safety you can't you can't make

00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:55,220
yourself safe on your own like as a

00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:57,530
society you know it has to it has to be

00:45:55,220 --> 00:46:00,950
spread around um yes I think the

00:45:57,530 --> 00:46:04,550
Internet is fragmenting and prop up my

00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:07,100
own view is it will fragment more and so

00:46:04,550 --> 00:46:12,460
that's not the early everything is the

00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:16,340
same everywhere but we don't currently

00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:18,800
you know have global mechanisms for for

00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:21,080
doing things so I I understand you want

00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:23,960
to get to the LA Times but I think it

00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:26,560
has a paywall anyway so like after by

00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:33,320
the third time you'll have to pay for it

00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:34,310
my my experience so anyway so I think

00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:35,990
there is let's look at these in the

00:46:34,310 --> 00:46:37,700
context of other industries and see if

00:46:35,990 --> 00:46:39,560
tech is really different and we don't

00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:43,010
want protection because we want it

00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:46,430
available all the time for free I I

00:46:43,010 --> 00:46:50,120
think there Manette is fragmenting some

00:46:46,430 --> 00:46:53,930
and I I would question that and I get in

00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:57,350
the in the IOT space maybe like I don't

00:46:53,930 --> 00:47:02,210
want I want an Internet of sort for my

00:46:57,350 --> 00:47:04,520
home smart home things but I don't

00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:07,430
really want that on the global Internet

00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:09,350
so why in the world do I want mine why

00:47:07,430 --> 00:47:11,870
do I want to participate in taking my

00:47:09,350 --> 00:47:13,910
private information and putting it in

00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:15,560
this system now when you use one of the

00:47:13,910 --> 00:47:18,980
platforms you have to because that's the

00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:21,260
trade-off so so as I said I'm not sure

00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:24,080
we'll see another Facebook that's like

00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:25,370
Facebook but different but I think you

00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:27,500
know there'll be some changes but I

00:47:25,370 --> 00:47:29,930
think in the home and IOT and smart

00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:32,600
devices and voice we could see something

00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:34,400
different and coincidentally that's

00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:37,010
where Mozilla is investing technical

00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:38,860
energy and time is because we see

00:47:37,010 --> 00:47:42,340
there's an opportunity there

00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:44,290
and so I hope that that's correct

00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:47,650
because then then we'll get enough

00:47:44,290 --> 00:47:50,440
consumer you need like not only does the

00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:53,800
market bring economic value but the

00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:58,180
power of a consumer when given choice to

00:47:53,800 --> 00:48:00,430
drive change is it's really powerful and

00:47:58,180 --> 00:48:02,440
so I am hoping that in some of these

00:48:00,430 --> 00:48:07,350
spaces where we don't yet currently have

00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:11,590
the one giant platform based on a

00:48:07,350 --> 00:48:13,090
surveillance business model that not

00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:14,560
just Mozilla about others who can offer

00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:16,810
something different like we could gets

00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:19,450
enough positive response to you know try

00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:21,670
and use that to drive proof of interest

00:48:19,450 --> 00:48:23,970
in privacy and security because we as

00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:29,110
consumers have not proved it yet as

00:48:23,970 --> 00:48:31,630
citizens that you have but as consumers

00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:36,160
we have not and partly we're not getting

00:48:31,630 --> 00:48:38,320
enough choice and and then when we have

00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:40,270
them we have to make them finally

00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:41,260
because I realize we are out of time I'm

00:48:40,270 --> 00:48:43,750
sure lots of people have lots of

00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:47,200
questions so finally it's more of a plea

00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:59,340
than a question can you give us a reason

00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:59,340
to be optimistic yeah Oh several yes

00:49:01,830 --> 00:49:09,460
we've had you know 20 years let's say

00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:12,490
over the Internet we tend first of all

00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:14,950
to forget how much value it's currently

00:49:12,490 --> 00:49:16,330
bringing on a day to day basis because

00:49:14,950 --> 00:49:18,940
what's what's in front of us right now

00:49:16,330 --> 00:49:22,510
are this sudden realization of the the

00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:24,220
risk and the damage so so so first of

00:49:22,510 --> 00:49:26,550
all there's a lot more value that we're

00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:29,530
still accruing than we actually

00:49:26,550 --> 00:49:32,350
emotionally feel but also if you look at

00:49:29,530 --> 00:49:34,150
you know how humans work like the danger

00:49:32,350 --> 00:49:36,190
in front of you is a lot more important

00:49:34,150 --> 00:49:42,040
than you know spread out spread out

00:49:36,190 --> 00:49:44,020
value and like we are just so early in

00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:46,390
understanding what's wrong and trying to

00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:51,070
fix it so one of the things that makes

00:49:46,390 --> 00:49:52,150
me very hopeful is that the problems

00:49:51,070 --> 00:49:55,630
have had you know

00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:58,329
period of time to develop and and and

00:49:55,630 --> 00:50:00,819
we're on like I don't know you know

00:49:58,329 --> 00:50:03,339
maybe we we've been born but maybe we're

00:50:00,819 --> 00:50:05,529
like a three week old infant in trying

00:50:03,339 --> 00:50:06,160
to figure out well how do we fix them

00:50:05,529 --> 00:50:08,849
mmm

00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:13,020
and then realizing that they the

00:50:08,849 --> 00:50:16,029
intersectionality of the problem in

00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:19,990
technical development this this view

00:50:16,029 --> 00:50:23,230
that technology is so magic but you know

00:50:19,990 --> 00:50:25,960
in the early days it was just this

00:50:23,230 --> 00:50:27,760
wonderful powerful force and because it

00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:30,849
was both different but seemed so great

00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:32,230
it lived outside of the rest of the

00:50:30,849 --> 00:50:35,049
world they lived a little tech bubble

00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:37,000
with no regulation and this belief among

00:50:35,049 --> 00:50:39,849
the technologists that oh my god we just

00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:41,410
get to do whatever we want and we're so

00:50:39,849 --> 00:50:43,720
great and it's everything we do is gonna

00:50:41,410 --> 00:50:45,520
be good for the world you know even even

00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:48,849
though it's just a very small group and

00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:53,589
that's not true and they many completely

00:50:48,849 --> 00:50:58,950
unbalanced and arrogant in in approach

00:50:53,589 --> 00:51:02,260
so so like bursting that bubble and the

00:50:58,950 --> 00:51:04,839
and the sense that technology is is you

00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:07,650
know humanity in action and and we need

00:51:04,839 --> 00:51:11,230
to pay attention to it like human nature

00:51:07,650 --> 00:51:13,599
is so new that that that we don't even

00:51:11,230 --> 00:51:16,569
yet have tools like worse you can see

00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:18,760
lots of diagnosis right like unique

00:51:16,569 --> 00:51:21,640
diagnosis before you can even start to

00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:23,680
test and build tools and so the the

00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:25,569
diagnosis piece is getting pretty rich

00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:27,160
like it's not complete that's going to

00:51:25,569 --> 00:51:30,130
grow for a long time but we're starting

00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:31,480
to understand the subfields and some of

00:51:30,130 --> 00:51:35,020
the intersectionality through the

00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:36,839
diagnosis and so we're I think fact just

00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:41,140
even coming up to beginning to build

00:51:36,839 --> 00:51:44,049
tools and we don't have many yet so I

00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:47,460
think that the power of the movement of

00:51:44,049 --> 00:51:50,619
people and our effectiveness at

00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:52,150
harvesting the the good things out of

00:51:50,619 --> 00:51:54,010
the internet and and finding ways to

00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:56,500
deal with the hatred and the violence

00:51:54,010 --> 00:51:59,260
and the misogyny and the racism and

00:51:56,500 --> 00:52:02,980
those things like we haven't even really

00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:05,770
didn't started yet so I think there is a

00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:09,520
lot of power in that

00:52:05,770 --> 00:52:11,260
even the core boy I'm I'm just so great

00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:13,450
technologists have realized there's a

00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:17,110
problem there are some who still think

00:52:13,450 --> 00:52:22,180
they're great hmm I won't name them but

00:52:17,110 --> 00:52:25,840
you might guess but but for many like

00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:27,610
that that realization which fair

00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:30,460
critique to say you should have had it

00:52:27,610 --> 00:52:33,369
at the beginning you know arrogance you

00:52:30,460 --> 00:52:35,530
know us whatever but fair critique and

00:52:33,369 --> 00:52:37,720
even so I'd say the fact the set of

00:52:35,530 --> 00:52:41,320
technologists you are now like oh wow

00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:46,360
okay I've got to do better you know it

00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:48,520
is growing and we find you know we

00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:50,860
aspire to be that at Mozilla we're

00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:52,990
imperfect and flawed and we have plenty

00:52:50,860 --> 00:52:55,450
of our own biases and we're struggling

00:52:52,990 --> 00:52:57,970
to you know change our org and you know

00:52:55,450 --> 00:53:01,330
be inclusive lot of range effectors so

00:52:57,970 --> 00:53:07,860
deeply flawed but highly aspirational

00:53:01,330 --> 00:53:07,860
and and we find that the incoming

00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:14,920
comments from the industry are starting

00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:17,650
to shift tone from oh god you're so cute

00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:24,369
little nonprofit run by a woman you're

00:53:17,650 --> 00:53:26,260
just so cute - why Oh God like you your

00:53:24,369 --> 00:53:28,240
message of the last decade was real and

00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:30,220
we just didn't hear it so so there are

00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:31,930
some signals there and so I'm hopeful

00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:34,119
that as we diagnose the skin structure

00:53:31,930 --> 00:53:35,740
we start to have some tools they start

00:53:34,119 --> 00:53:37,600
to see some signal from consumers and

00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:40,390
their and from citizens through their

00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:42,910
regulators and legislators that you know

00:53:40,390 --> 00:53:46,710
the power of the let's build something

00:53:42,910 --> 00:53:48,700
decent and humane and powerful wool girl

00:53:46,710 --> 00:53:51,300
Mitchell thank you very much I'm sure

00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:51,300
there's lots of questions

00:53:54,850 --> 00:54:03,400
[Applause]

00:54:04,580 --> 00:54:12,240
there's no question that's amazing all

00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:14,190
right this one hi a lot of the work that

00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:16,380
I do is in political strategies so when

00:54:14,190 --> 00:54:18,540
I was listening to describe the current

00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:21,480
dynamics of the internet and internet

00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:23,940
politics one thought that struck me as a

00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:27,050
possible prescription to the problem and

00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:29,850
also as a possible solution is that it

00:54:27,050 --> 00:54:31,890
seems that the internet as it exists now

00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:34,590
is very unipolar in the sense that

00:54:31,890 --> 00:54:36,840
Western society and Western countries

00:54:34,590 --> 00:54:39,420
primarily the United States tend to

00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:41,190
dominate on the global scale what the

00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:44,790
internet looks like the products that

00:54:41,190 --> 00:54:46,590
tend to have mass appeal and the tools

00:54:44,790 --> 00:54:49,800
that we build in the United States is

00:54:46,590 --> 00:54:52,440
what gets mass exported so my question

00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:54,840
is is it possible to see a future that

00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:56,790
is more multipolar on the Internet where

00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:58,920
you have more regionalism where

00:54:56,790 --> 00:55:00,390
different countries and local tech

00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:01,650
scenes in that sense regional tech

00:55:00,390 --> 00:55:03,780
scenes start building their own

00:55:01,650 --> 00:55:06,210
alternatives to Facebook to a lot of

00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:08,580
these tools that have kind of gone mask

00:55:06,210 --> 00:55:10,290
global and instead can they

00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:12,630
self-regulate they know the tools that

00:55:10,290 --> 00:55:15,840
they need and how to increase privacy

00:55:12,630 --> 00:55:17,580
that is relevant to them is that

00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:20,810
something that could could happen or is

00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:24,450
that it just like in politics infeasible

00:55:20,810 --> 00:55:28,200
well so I think it could happen but I

00:55:24,450 --> 00:55:32,540
think there is an appeal to global there

00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:35,130
are some benefits to me in global I am I

00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:36,840
we don't actually have the answer if you

00:55:35,130 --> 00:55:38,670
wanted to build the most profitable

00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:41,520
thing possible you might rebuild

00:55:38,670 --> 00:55:43,290
Facebook like you might ban it from your

00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:49,370
country and rebuild it yourself I mean

00:55:43,290 --> 00:55:56,190
but so so yes and on a regional level

00:55:49,370 --> 00:55:57,390
you have to have a motivation or you

00:55:56,190 --> 00:55:59,550
have to look at what the motivation

00:55:57,390 --> 00:56:02,010
would be so if you're just trying to

00:55:59,550 --> 00:56:05,400
build a regional variant of something

00:56:02,010 --> 00:56:06,720
and and/or capture the revenue from it

00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:08,640
and make sure it doesn't go to you you

00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:09,359
might build exactly the same thing but

00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:11,190
but you might

00:56:09,359 --> 00:56:14,430
get more experiments or you might be

00:56:11,190 --> 00:56:16,440
easier before the fact to set out what

00:56:14,430 --> 00:56:20,130
would be acceptable terms and conditions

00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:23,039
so I think it's possible but you might

00:56:20,130 --> 00:56:26,390
get more variance in it

00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:29,279
what should we discussed this yesterday

00:56:26,390 --> 00:56:31,109
Massa was mentioning in Iran they

00:56:29,279 --> 00:56:33,259
basically just built a local messenger

00:56:31,109 --> 00:56:35,190
app to replace the International one

00:56:33,259 --> 00:56:36,690
which is as you say it's just

00:56:35,190 --> 00:56:38,519
replicating what was already there and

00:56:36,690 --> 00:56:39,779
saying this time we're going to keep all

00:56:38,519 --> 00:56:43,109
the data instead of letting it flow

00:56:39,779 --> 00:56:45,299
outside our country yes yes and so we

00:56:43,109 --> 00:56:47,369
may see more you know regulations of

00:56:45,299 --> 00:56:50,369
that sort but then it it it is

00:56:47,369 --> 00:56:54,420
fragmented and so depending on if and

00:56:50,369 --> 00:56:57,839
when your society would benefit from

00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:59,759
interacting beyond the borders I mean

00:56:57,839 --> 00:57:01,769
you're setting yourself up not to be

00:56:59,759 --> 00:57:04,859
able to do that yeah right

00:57:01,769 --> 00:57:17,130
and so like in some economies can do

00:57:04,859 --> 00:57:18,749
that not many yes your danger collection

00:57:17,130 --> 00:57:20,039
might be regionalised and depending on

00:57:18,749 --> 00:57:27,210
where you are that could be better or

00:57:20,039 --> 00:57:29,789
worse for you right and I would say it's

00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:32,759
interesting exactly what that will mean

00:57:29,789 --> 00:57:36,239
in practice because where your data is

00:57:32,759 --> 00:57:38,099
stored depending on what what the

00:57:36,239 --> 00:57:40,529
legislation is you might be unable to

00:57:38,099 --> 00:57:44,819
complete a transaction right because the

00:57:40,529 --> 00:57:47,880
internet is not always within national

00:57:44,819 --> 00:57:50,009
or regional boundaries and so depending

00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:51,989
on how much you want your data under

00:57:50,009 --> 00:57:53,970
your own little say national and

00:57:51,989 --> 00:57:56,609
regional law you may not actually be

00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:57,749
able to do commerce you know I it's not

00:57:56,609 --> 00:57:59,789
really clear what that looks like

00:57:57,749 --> 00:58:01,890
maybe Amazon is big enough to have

00:57:59,789 --> 00:58:04,829
everything in Europe so you could buy

00:58:01,890 --> 00:58:07,440
from there but the smaller one wouldn't

00:58:04,829 --> 00:58:10,069
you know so there's a lot of

00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:15,809
consequences as you think about actually

00:58:10,069 --> 00:58:17,609
fragmenting further Mitchell um we hear

00:58:15,809 --> 00:58:20,220
a lot about how we need to work to

00:58:17,609 --> 00:58:22,270
protect children online that we need to

00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:23,920
create a box for them and keep

00:58:22,270 --> 00:58:25,720
to keep the children in a box make sure

00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:27,880
they're secure and whatnot but yet we're

00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:29,620
now in a world where there's a

00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:31,750
generation that's coming up that is that

00:58:29,620 --> 00:58:33,070
has the internet is fundamental to them

00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:35,080
and they've they've they've grown up

00:58:33,070 --> 00:58:37,300
with that and I'm wondering if how we

00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:38,910
can strike a balance between that that

00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:41,200
protection and then at the same time

00:58:38,910 --> 00:58:42,730
exposing the Internet to the children

00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:44,440
like where the Internet we don't need to

00:58:42,730 --> 00:58:45,460
protect the internet from children we

00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:46,960
may need to protect children from

00:58:45,460 --> 00:58:50,710
something that's on the internet now but

00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:52,000
we actually need to find ways to bring

00:58:50,710 --> 00:58:54,190
in that youthful energy that youthful

00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:56,170
creativity and I'm wondering if what

00:58:54,190 --> 00:58:57,910
ideas you have about how we can how we

00:58:56,170 --> 00:58:59,770
as Mozilla and how we as an Internet

00:58:57,910 --> 00:59:02,290
community can can make that happen and

00:58:59,770 --> 00:59:13,600
enable the youth to really take control

00:59:02,290 --> 00:59:16,660
and shape that Internet well so I'd

00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:19,900
start by saying and I'm not like a lot

00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:22,840
of what I would call tech libertarians

00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:24,990
and the young children we we try to

00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:27,970
protect young children from many things

00:59:24,990 --> 00:59:30,400
and clearly the Internet today is

00:59:27,970 --> 00:59:30,970
probably one of them I mean clearly the

00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:35,590
Internet today

00:59:30,970 --> 00:59:37,930
is is one of them and so so I think that

00:59:35,590 --> 00:59:43,300
you're talking about that transition

00:59:37,930 --> 00:59:46,290
phase when children begin to be able to

00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:49,270
make decisions that we think are healthy

00:59:46,290 --> 00:59:52,270
and and and when and how do you allow

00:59:49,270 --> 00:59:56,950
that which is one set of questions but

00:59:52,270 --> 01:00:00,580
but then I think the other one is how to

00:59:56,950 --> 01:00:02,530
get the creative energy of youth

01:00:00,580 --> 01:00:03,820
whatever you mean I don't know if you

01:00:02,530 --> 01:00:06,580
mean twelve or eighteen you know

01:00:03,820 --> 01:00:10,390
seventeen or whatever into the process

01:00:06,580 --> 01:00:13,060
and so for that I would say there is

01:00:10,390 --> 01:00:15,780
something about creating and making and

01:00:13,060 --> 01:00:17,800
engaging that goes beyond clicking as a

01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:21,820
conservator it goes beyond being a

01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:23,680
consumer and so one of the this is for

01:00:21,820 --> 01:00:25,990
the second question and so one of the

01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:30,040
things I think like it's just

01:00:25,990 --> 01:00:34,030
fundamental is how many all of us but in

01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:36,190
particular young or youth you know get

01:00:34,030 --> 01:00:38,049
both the excitement and

01:00:36,190 --> 01:00:42,660
tools and the learning and the training

01:00:38,049 --> 01:00:44,920
to actually engage in making things

01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:46,780
because I hear over and over and over

01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:48,490
oh this generation you know they're you

01:00:46,780 --> 01:00:50,920
know they're native which is true but

01:00:48,490 --> 01:00:56,049
what people mean is what they really are

01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:58,809
saying is that young people are more

01:00:56,049 --> 01:01:00,460
comfortable with massive inputs you know

01:00:58,809 --> 01:01:02,140
a set of headphones music in the

01:01:00,460 --> 01:01:04,750
background playing a game doing homework

01:01:02,140 --> 01:01:07,450
and turns out a that's they're actually

01:01:04,750 --> 01:01:10,150
probably not like humanity has not

01:01:07,450 --> 01:01:12,369
changed that much in one generation that

01:01:10,150 --> 01:01:14,200
that the human brain is not set up for

01:01:12,369 --> 01:01:15,160
that so the effectiveness is

01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:16,690
questionable

01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:18,609
even though multiple inputs are there

01:01:16,690 --> 01:01:21,339
for deep thinking I mean not not for

01:01:18,609 --> 01:01:23,260
switchboard stuff but but they're not

01:01:21,339 --> 01:01:25,839
actually looking at us does this person

01:01:23,260 --> 01:01:29,559
understand what lies underneath the

01:01:25,839 --> 01:01:31,630
surface and it turns out that's actually

01:01:29,559 --> 01:01:35,230
not H correlated and two or three

01:01:31,630 --> 01:01:36,819
generations ago when the web was new we

01:01:35,230 --> 01:01:38,530
were actually pretty far along so I

01:01:36,819 --> 01:01:42,460
think there's a learning and how to be

01:01:38,530 --> 01:01:44,619
both a a knowledgeable consumer but more

01:01:42,460 --> 01:01:46,779
than that the remix line that that we

01:01:44,619 --> 01:01:49,000
mark uses or we use it Moz vest what's

01:01:46,779 --> 01:01:50,650
underneath it and how like how can I get

01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:53,740
to it and make something that I want

01:01:50,650 --> 01:01:55,779
more because we're many people are still

01:01:53,740 --> 01:01:58,240
in the phase I called the luxury of

01:01:55,779 --> 01:02:00,309
consumption which the internet is great

01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:02,230
at or the web is it's there it's free I

01:02:00,309 --> 01:02:05,500
mean if you can buy a phone and pay the

01:02:02,230 --> 01:02:07,119
data charges or pay your ISP there's so

01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:11,079
much available that's just there

01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:12,970
instantly and it's free and I think for

01:02:11,079 --> 01:02:17,049
those people who have experienced the

01:02:12,970 --> 01:02:18,849
luxury of consumption which is a just a

01:02:17,049 --> 01:02:21,730
small percentage of the population but

01:02:18,849 --> 01:02:23,470
we're probably in it like then the the

01:02:21,730 --> 01:02:25,930
luxury after that it you know it's the

01:02:23,470 --> 01:02:28,029
luxury of creation because if you're

01:02:25,930 --> 01:02:30,309
solely a consumer you get what someone

01:02:28,029 --> 01:02:31,210
made for you and someone made it for you

01:02:30,309 --> 01:02:33,940
for a reason

01:02:31,210 --> 01:02:35,859
and sometimes that reason is great I

01:02:33,940 --> 01:02:37,299
mean I like to think you know most

01:02:35,859 --> 01:02:40,359
Ellison reasons are great but but we

01:02:37,299 --> 01:02:42,460
make it for a reason we make it to make

01:02:40,359 --> 01:02:44,289
something but there are a lot of reasons

01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:48,160
that are not great and and a lot of this

01:02:44,289 --> 01:02:51,849
technology is so incredibly manipulative

01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:55,650
that you think teaching all of us but

01:02:51,849 --> 01:02:59,079
you asked about use what makes it up and

01:02:55,650 --> 01:03:01,569
how can we amend it to make it less

01:02:59,079 --> 01:03:03,099
addictive and manipulative us and get

01:03:01,569 --> 01:03:06,490
some joy into it what you know would be

01:03:03,099 --> 01:03:08,260
the right path so okay we'll take one

01:03:06,490 --> 01:03:09,579
last question because we've already sort

01:03:08,260 --> 01:03:12,369
of basically double the amount of time

01:03:09,579 --> 01:03:15,339
allotted to us so you think one of those

01:03:12,369 --> 01:03:18,339
at the back one last question and then

01:03:15,339 --> 01:03:21,730
I'd like to make a very brief very brief

01:03:18,339 --> 01:03:30,880
closing I'll get off the stage

01:03:21,730 --> 01:03:37,599
oh no no no like that yeah if you want

01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:39,460
to see I admire your your position your

01:03:37,599 --> 01:03:42,250
role and yours possibilities you have

01:03:39,460 --> 01:03:44,470
taken for your role and I have a

01:03:42,250 --> 01:03:48,460
question for you we have talked about

01:03:44,470 --> 01:03:51,549
governments and other entities I'm a bit

01:03:48,460 --> 01:03:55,779
more minded low-level if you can say in

01:03:51,549 --> 01:03:59,380
that way what people in their daily

01:03:55,779 --> 01:04:03,190
lives can do to tackle these questions

01:03:59,380 --> 01:04:04,839
for people like 95 jobs or not or people

01:04:03,190 --> 01:04:08,589
that are I will be aware of these

01:04:04,839 --> 01:04:12,059
problems but don't even know where to

01:04:08,589 --> 01:04:14,950
look for or who don't who to contact

01:04:12,059 --> 01:04:17,500
what little changes we can do in our

01:04:14,950 --> 01:04:20,410
lives not only technology I mean not

01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:24,190
only for the technology itself something

01:04:20,410 --> 01:04:26,770
else we're talking about programs of

01:04:24,190 --> 01:04:31,539
solutions so multiple questions multiple

01:04:26,770 --> 01:04:35,140
issues multiple problems is it's fine to

01:04:31,539 --> 01:04:39,339
have to apply with some from compromises

01:04:35,140 --> 01:04:41,770
on the convenience it's fine I'd like to

01:04:39,339 --> 01:04:45,849
have a more original and genuine

01:04:41,770 --> 01:04:51,099
question as possible okay let's see if I

01:04:45,849 --> 01:04:53,520
can be original okay so first of all I

01:04:51,099 --> 01:05:00,430
think for most people living their lives

01:04:53,520 --> 01:05:01,819
we can't make people feel too bad for

01:05:00,430 --> 01:05:03,319
not doing very much I mean like

01:05:01,819 --> 01:05:05,749
a lot of people like paying the bills

01:05:03,319 --> 01:05:09,979
and like just getting through the months

01:05:05,749 --> 01:05:11,509
is difficult so one I I think sporting

01:05:09,979 --> 01:05:13,670
the regulator's like there's been this

01:05:11,509 --> 01:05:16,549
view with tech that and and it you know

01:05:13,670 --> 01:05:18,469
certainly the view of tech is that you

01:05:16,549 --> 01:05:20,749
know regulators are bureaucrats they're

01:05:18,469 --> 01:05:23,420
all bad they don't know anything we know

01:05:20,749 --> 01:05:25,609
all the right stuff like and that can be

01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:27,559
contagious especially about I think was

01:05:25,609 --> 01:05:29,449
very effectively contagious so

01:05:27,559 --> 01:05:31,789
regulation is tough and it doesn't work

01:05:29,449 --> 01:05:33,499
well with tech I mean I read that and

01:05:31,789 --> 01:05:36,979
society has to do something so I think

01:05:33,499 --> 01:05:39,859
counteracting the narrative that only

01:05:36,979 --> 01:05:46,759
tech you know knows what's good for tech

01:05:39,859 --> 01:05:48,589
like it is really important a um you

01:05:46,759 --> 01:05:58,190
postulated that people don't know what

01:05:48,589 --> 01:06:01,549
to do right and so that's a tough one

01:05:58,190 --> 01:06:03,529
like my the answer from Mozilla is in

01:06:01,549 --> 01:06:05,779
part we try to make products that people

01:06:03,529 --> 01:06:08,799
want so they're answering a different

01:06:05,779 --> 01:06:12,319
question of like oh what helps me online

01:06:08,799 --> 01:06:13,849
let me do that and then you are making

01:06:12,319 --> 01:06:20,259
that a choice that's also good for the

01:06:13,849 --> 01:06:20,259
system I I think there's there's some

01:06:21,009 --> 01:06:28,940
it's so local to society how you get

01:06:23,900 --> 01:06:37,130
tech issues to to be relevant but let's

01:06:28,940 --> 01:06:39,049
see if I've gotten enough in there as a

01:06:37,130 --> 01:06:41,479
set of people like I think we have to

01:06:39,049 --> 01:06:44,299
find a few go-to places of what you can

01:06:41,479 --> 01:06:46,400
actually do you know at Mozilla we try

01:06:44,299 --> 01:06:49,459
to have tips for those but our reach is

01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:52,099
not as large as we'd like it to be so I

01:06:49,459 --> 01:06:54,380
I think there's some general movement of

01:06:52,099 --> 01:06:58,459
where do you go or where do you look so

01:06:54,380 --> 01:07:02,390
that's an incomplete answer but before

01:06:58,459 --> 01:07:03,799
you do your closing I just want to say

01:07:02,390 --> 01:07:04,789
also that you guys have been amazing

01:07:03,799 --> 01:07:07,729
you've started for two whole days

01:07:04,789 --> 01:07:09,979
listening to stuff put regulation data

01:07:07,729 --> 01:07:11,420
protection competition these are not

01:07:09,979 --> 01:07:13,549
exactly the sexiest topics in the world

01:07:11,420 --> 01:07:14,609
so thank you very much for turning out

01:07:13,549 --> 01:07:19,039
asking lots of good

01:07:14,609 --> 01:07:19,039
being great audience give yourself time

01:07:22,460 --> 01:07:26,579
so my last thought is very similar it's

01:07:25,019 --> 01:07:27,930
a little broader you know my husband

01:07:26,579 --> 01:07:31,079
always says that I come back from

01:07:27,930 --> 01:07:35,789
Ozzfest totally jest and then it's part

01:07:31,079 --> 01:07:37,470
of the invigorating cycle and the sort

01:07:35,789 --> 01:07:39,599
of the juice that keeps going when we

01:07:37,470 --> 01:07:41,190
live these issues every day and so I

01:07:39,599 --> 01:07:42,989
want to thank everyone at Moz fest

01:07:41,190 --> 01:07:45,299
whether you were a denizen of this room

01:07:42,989 --> 01:07:50,730
or or came or been doing something else

01:07:45,299 --> 01:07:54,779
it's um it is amazingly invigorating but

01:07:50,730 --> 01:07:57,690
