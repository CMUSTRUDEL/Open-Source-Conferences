all right so that's uh this is our last

00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,490
chat for the day and indeed for most

00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:14,400
Fest this year with me I have Mitchell

00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:18,119
Baker co-founder and chairwoman of the

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:21,689
Mozilla project what we're going to do

00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:23,820
is we're going to go over some of the

00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:26,160
themes of the conversations we've been

00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:28,740
having over the past two days

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,510
and try and carry them forward look

00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:33,420
forward but before we do that though I

00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:35,969
just would like everyone to acknowledge

00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,160
Kevin sawaki who's hiding in that corner

00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:39,960
over there who's responsible for putting

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,450
this program together and inviting all

00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,100
of these speakers coming up with talks

00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:47,219
and I think has done an absolutely

00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,930
spectacular job at the diversity both of

00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:51,079
ideas and of people who've been up here

00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:51,079
today

00:00:57,379 --> 00:01:04,010
Mitchell thank you for joining us see

00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:06,840
you so we discussed in the lunch break

00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:08,100
since I think they've been several

00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:12,840
people here actually who've been for

00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:18,930
every single session panel talk but I

00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:22,490
know for a fact I've been here so you

00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:25,770
asked me to identify sort of the themes

00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:28,770
and I think what we've had a lot of over

00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:30,570
the past couple of days is diagnosis

00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:33,119
I think we've diagnosed a number of

00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:34,170
problems in the information society in

00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,659
which we live and I'll tell you what I

00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:38,430
think those are and if anybody wants to

00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:42,479
shout out ones I've forgotten please go

00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:45,149
ahead so the the sort of running theme

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,409
in all of this quite openly named is

00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:47,700
that Facebook and Google of too much

00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:49,950
power that's been something that's come

00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:54,420
up in practically every talk and

00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:57,329
practically every panel a second is sort

00:01:54,420 --> 00:02:00,240
of inadequate regulation inadequate

00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:02,700
structures for competition a third was

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,680
that and this was more today than

00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,329
yesterday but indeed a she boot days was

00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:09,950
a very narrow world view of Silicon

00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:12,270
Valley in the fourth which so they again

00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:13,489
referred to was the embedding of power

00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:17,640
structures

00:02:13,489 --> 00:02:21,049
and so that's the diagnosis in the man

00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:24,599
the sort of dawn of the debate I thought

00:02:21,049 --> 00:02:26,329
was you know it was optimistic as well

00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:28,170
as pessimistic but occasionally

00:02:26,329 --> 00:02:30,540
occasionally quite angry you're quite

00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:33,840
worried or quite reactionary which are

00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:36,150
things that worry me what I'm hoping you

00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,569
can offer is having diagnosed the

00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:39,420
problem

00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:40,799
having issued a very grim prognosis so

00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:47,430
I'm hoping you can offer some

00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:51,450
prescription sure like let's have the

00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:55,250
answers okay well why don't I start and

00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:55,250
and and then we'll see where it goes I

00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:13,370
will probably well the prescription

00:03:11,329 --> 00:03:16,470
Massoud like there's an answer out there

00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:19,980
or one answer that's really clear where

00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:22,470
I think what is clear to me as a path

00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:25,260
rather than exactly like what are the

00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:27,959
exact steps or what is the exact

00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:31,230
destination look like because we do now

00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:33,810
have a fair amount or some understanding

00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:36,419
of what's happening that's pretty recent

00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:38,970
but actually understanding not just the

00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:41,910
advertising business model of the big

00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:43,290
platforms but but how content is being

00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:45,930
moved and how people are being

00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:47,280
manipulated is pretty recent the last

00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:50,640
couple of years I would say and

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,190
especially on the manipulating societies

00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,349
[Music]

00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:57,599
it's been the last couple of years so so

00:03:55,349 --> 00:03:59,849
we we have a very early and incomplete

00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:04,739
understanding of some of the dangers of

00:03:59,849 --> 00:04:07,169
the forms of technology that we have we

00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:09,949
have but a beginning certainly have

00:04:07,169 --> 00:04:12,840
angst a beginning sense of regulation

00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:18,530
and there are data protection regimes in

00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:21,840
a few places now so a pretty reasonable

00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:25,990
cadre of activists of which I think Moz

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:29,650
Fest is an interesting microcosm but

00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:31,030
you know we're just a small group so so

00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:34,419
large you know a growing set of

00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:39,070
activists and the piece that I think is

00:04:34,419 --> 00:04:40,930
not developed at all is like what are

00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:44,139
the role of technologists and making

00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:47,020
something different and how do activist

00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:49,780
citizens consumers like both encourage

00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:51,250
choice like and at the big level we

00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:53,889
don't have it yet for a couple reasons

00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:55,750
all the social media platforms are the

00:04:53,889 --> 00:04:57,520
big platforms there's only a handful

00:04:55,750 --> 00:05:00,030
you can't leave Facebook and go to

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:03,479
whatsapp or Instagram right you know so

00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:06,310
and and or even the you know the

00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:10,289
alternatives from China probably aren't

00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:12,550
going to be our privacy focused security

00:05:10,289 --> 00:05:14,199
individual empowerment alternatives

00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:16,000
either so the big level there's

00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:17,590
currently no alternatives I don't

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,590
actually think there will be an

00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:23,530
alternative to Facebook or if there is

00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:25,660
that it will be exactly the same thing

00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:27,550
and really successful now I could be

00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:29,620
wrong there isn't LibreOffice you know

00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:30,970
for the Microsoft office suites maybe it

00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,729
will you know we'll start using it

00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:37,360
instead of Google in one sense Firefox

00:05:33,729 --> 00:05:38,979
was that but not exactly so I but I do

00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,320
think that there are new things in the

00:05:38,979 --> 00:05:43,690
future but it will be a long time I

00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:46,050
think before a citizens or consumers we

00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:49,840
have a choice of something that is

00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:52,270
potentially rich as big platforms today

00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,800
where we can make one choice I mean that

00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:54,490
was the great thing about Firefox is it

00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,650
covered everything

00:05:54,490 --> 00:06:00,419
you could leave ie and choose Firefox in

00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:02,800
it it affected a huge part of your world

00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:05,349
so I think that is a long time coming

00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,810
and I think it is not accurate or fair

00:06:05,349 --> 00:06:10,900
to consumers or citizens to suggest it's

00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:13,260
our job to fix things as individuals but

00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:15,520
I do think part of the answer is the

00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:19,020
development and understanding of

00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:21,940
technologies that behave differently and

00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:24,220
that those when they occur they're often

00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:26,919
really small they may be niche they may

00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:30,310
be pilots they may be things that solve

00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:34,539
a little part of the problem and it can

00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:37,270
be easy to just not bother but but it's

00:06:34,539 --> 00:06:38,590
those choices do send signals into the

00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,670
market I mean we're starting to see some

00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:41,590
at Mozilla so

00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:47,920
decade we've been saying privacy privacy

00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:51,580
security security and and and it hasn't

00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:54,430
changed consumer behavior I think

00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:57,970
because the it just sounded so abstract

00:06:54,430 --> 00:07:00,690
exactly and and and so now and so the

00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:03,730
conventional wisdom across the internet

00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:05,830
consumer product part of the world has

00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:08,290
been that consumers will not make a

00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:09,910
choice for privacy like you can build

00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:12,280
you have to build a great product if it

00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:14,880
happens to be better on privacy nice and

00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:17,170
so as consumers we want to change that

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,930
but that's gonna be a lot of small

00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:22,030
choices over time you know oh I can fix

00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:25,270
this little problem or that problem but

00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:31,120
but but we need we need some of that and

00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:34,900
then I think I'm I hear what you're

00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:37,450
saying about simplistic that wasn't your

00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:41,350
word but simplistic responses or angry

00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:43,750
responses reactionaries the reactionary

00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:49,090
ah okay because I was gonna say I think

00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:51,010
anger is appropriate hmm now what you do

00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:52,720
with it is another like how you channel

00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:55,060
anger into something productive is

00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:59,410
really important I I'm not advocating

00:07:55,060 --> 00:08:02,500
just spontaneous expression of outrage

00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:04,450
which is usually violent so you know but

00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:07,480
but anger and the productive channeling

00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:09,940
of anger I think is important and for

00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:11,830
those of us who live in societies that

00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:14,760
have you know democratic voting in

00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:17,590
theory it should be a campaign issue

00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:19,150
it's certainly not right now and and

00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:22,240
there are other things very high on the

00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:27,010
list so I think that's a what we have us

00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:28,870
say activism now is a yet another phase

00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:30,520
of how to translate that into the

00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:32,740
mainstream and and what are the

00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:35,400
activities that one could take based on

00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:39,040
that and also I think a real

00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:41,770
encouragement pushing prodding of every

00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:45,070
technologist we know to be trying to do

00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:47,470
better so certainly so for example at

00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:49,660
Mozilla we've made very formal

00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:52,270
commitments about being committed to

00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:53,050
technology that promotes critical

00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:56,380
thinking

00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:59,110
or that promotes humane behavior and not

00:08:56,380 --> 00:09:02,560
addictive or violent behavior and so

00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:04,690
that's now part of the canonical what

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:07,200
are we as technologists trying to build

00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:10,840
into product and put into the market and

00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:13,720
so that is not enough because that alone

00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:15,550
if you're I mean we're not a commercial

00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,950
organization so we're not trying to

00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:19,450
maximize every penny you know and that

00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:21,460
that business motive can push you

00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:23,620
anywhere so it's not by any means enough

00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:26,380
but if if there isn't a set of

00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:29,980
technologists trying to build technology

00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:32,710
that's not addictive that's humane that

00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:35,320
allows you to really think about where

00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:37,510
something comes from is it rational that

00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:39,550
is not trying to promote outrage so you

00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:41,170
keep clicking I think the word the world

00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:43,660
will be better and we should be building

00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:45,850
that and so I think that part of the

00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:48,220
conversation and with technologists

00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:50,680
about what are you doing does that enter

00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:53,820
into your work is important I mean it it

00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:56,590
should become a mainstream discussion

00:09:53,820 --> 00:10:05,860
and then I think the the regulatory

00:09:56,590 --> 00:10:06,520
piece is necessary and it's so hard to

00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:10,090
get right

00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:13,210
so cookies in Europe yeah like like that

00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:16,630
was the first before the GDP or what did

00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:18,850
what was the effort to try and break up

00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:23,350
the advertising tracking surveillance

00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:26,380
system cookies but but it's just this

00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:28,720
notice now that it's just another thing

00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:31,690
that you have to click as quote consent

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:34,420
or so important effort on behalf of the

00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:37,000
EU to make a substantial change but

00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:39,750
irrelevant like as it turns out learning

00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,710
irrelevant possibly going to productive

00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:43,720
could be in the chip training people

00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:46,420
just click things where oh well yes

00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:48,280
although we're plenty trained you know

00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:51,760
the whole idea that we're consenting to

00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:53,500
Terms of Service is ridiculous so there

00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,930
was I don't know if it's during Europe

00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:58,090
there there was a there is a concept in

00:10:55,930 --> 00:11:01,360
the US that there is a category of

00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:04,300
contracts with consumers that is just

00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,810
unacceptable the word is awkward it's

00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:09,139
unconscionable

00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:11,870
and it was applied in the 60s to a kind

00:11:09,139 --> 00:11:16,569
of contract which kept people in

00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:19,579
financial entanglement forever

00:11:16,569 --> 00:11:21,529
and and and they just ruled this kind of

00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:24,139
contract yes someone has agreed to it

00:11:21,529 --> 00:11:26,120
but you can't enforce it by this ongoing

00:11:24,139 --> 00:11:29,029
monthly payment where essentially you're

00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:32,389
just stuck forever um and and I so for

00:11:29,029 --> 00:11:34,970
example and user agreements Oh Terms of

00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:36,829
Service of the type that we now click

00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:38,629
maybe they should be onion you know

00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:41,209
aspects of them should be unenforceable

00:11:38,629 --> 00:11:42,949
as a matter of public policy like so for

00:11:41,209 --> 00:11:46,069
example at GD P R which is trying to

00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:49,220
balance which is very hard but it

00:11:46,069 --> 00:11:51,019
doesn't say you can't track people like

00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:52,699
that's too far or that's too much with

00:11:51,019 --> 00:11:56,059
the business models and I think that's

00:11:52,699 --> 00:11:57,949
probably we make sense at this point but

00:11:56,059 --> 00:11:59,930
we as citizens and consumers what would

00:11:57,949 --> 00:12:02,509
that mean well I think you might mean

00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:05,360
maybe Facebook would not be here like

00:12:02,509 --> 00:12:07,129
that's not actually what a lot of

00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,680
consumers want right now if it just

00:12:07,129 --> 00:12:12,230
disappeared yeah like there's a lot of

00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:14,870
life and economic value so so this

00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:20,120
question of what kind of regulation and

00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:23,899
what what is a society we want rational

00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:25,699
thought but but I think that like the GD

00:12:23,899 --> 00:12:27,529
P R is putting a stake in the ground and

00:12:25,699 --> 00:12:29,750
saying well something's unaccept or we

00:12:27,529 --> 00:12:32,269
tried with cookies we you know the

00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:34,399
surveillance economy we tried we thought

00:12:32,269 --> 00:12:36,470
that wasn't good and we tried and it

00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,899
didn't work like here's another effort

00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:40,819
and like we intend to keep trying like

00:12:38,899 --> 00:12:44,870
that's that's a really critical piece

00:12:40,819 --> 00:12:47,269
and I I don't know incrementally how far

00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:50,179
you can get with the interpretation of

00:12:47,269 --> 00:12:52,459
this practice and is it really control

00:12:50,179 --> 00:12:55,000
or what exactly does it mean for me to

00:12:52,459 --> 00:12:57,740
have control like that that's so long

00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,750
that that's a long process it's a long

00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:01,040
term project the I'm really glad you

00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,990
mentioned economic value though because

00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,339
I do worry as I said in a previous panel

00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:07,279
I do worry about throwing the baby out

00:13:04,339 --> 00:13:09,110
with the bathwater and we do need to

00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:11,029
remember that these companies have

00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:12,230
actually done a lot of good for society

00:13:11,029 --> 00:13:14,420
and indeed have brought a lot of value

00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:17,540
to society to all of us individually as

00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:19,189
well but one of the things that that I

00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,580
was thinking about the past two days is

00:13:19,189 --> 00:13:21,350
that we

00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:24,650
spent a lot of time talking about this

00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:25,970
exactly this we talked about the stuff

00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:27,560
that's happened over the past two years

00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:32,420
oh that people have realized over the

00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:34,310
past two years I'm not convinced we're

00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:35,930
fully prepared for thinking about the

00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:38,090
future because we're thinking about it

00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:41,540
very much in the terms of the past which

00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:43,460
is natural it's human um but is there a

00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:46,940
sort of more realistic way of thinking

00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:48,260
about the future a way that is not you

00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:50,660
know shut it all down it's it's

00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:52,250
terrifying a way that is not all well

00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:53,780
innovation is going to happen not

00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:58,580
deterministic where you feel like you

00:13:53,780 --> 00:14:00,230
have no say in how how things develop is

00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:03,860
there a sort of sensible middle ground

00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:07,040
we could adopt I don't know I I think

00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:09,590
the curve of technical change is I mean

00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,510
the slope may still be increasing but in

00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:13,430
the sense of things happening so fast

00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:18,410
that it's it's actually hard to know and

00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:20,270
understand and so certainly there's a

00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:22,220
lot of change coming but but might

00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:24,380
actually be increasing so I'm not sure

00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:26,510
how to get to a middle ground there I'm

00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:30,830
not a believer that you just can just

00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:32,360
stop it like I I don't even know how one

00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:36,260
would do that or what a what it would

00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:38,300
look like and and you can't you can't

00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:41,960
globally so so I think that is happening

00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:43,670
I think realistically that the degree of

00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:45,980
the surveillance state is still

00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:50,150
increasing and and will increase over

00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:51,740
time because we're just beginning to

00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:53,810
react against it like it's got a

00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:56,360
momentum so the curve may change but

00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:58,160
it's not it's not now if that's a lot of

00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:01,550
work I think to get that curve to change

00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:05,660
I do think that there is there is a

00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:08,020
large again you might not be surprised a

00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:13,100
large role for technologists and the

00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:15,470
funding and supporting of lots of

00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:17,780
technical experiments like what would it

00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:20,240
look like for me to have defensive

00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:22,370
technology or even offensive technology

00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,660
in the world that we live in like I I'm

00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:25,220
not sure you can on the Facebook

00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:27,800
platform you know because they own it

00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:30,080
but if you take or some of the AI things

00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:32,080
that are aimed at you like this it's

00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:33,640
hard but in terms of

00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:36,850
of what are the tracking devices around

00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:39,850
us who's tracking us how do I know and

00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:43,630
so we are trying to do some of that at

00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:45,880
Mozilla but I think that there is a huge

00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:48,790
amount of experimentation and that those

00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:50,380
things need funding as well and that we

00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:53,980
do see more and more countries you know

00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:56,140
trying to have incubators and VC funds

00:15:53,980 --> 00:16:00,610
and you know create a technology

00:15:56,140 --> 00:16:03,520
community in in their environment more

00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:05,380
attuned to original or some other set of

00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:09,070
issues and then Silicon Valley might be

00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:11,680
and yet even those organizations don't

00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:15,160
typically fund social enterprises they

00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:16,810
don't typically fund a broader range of

00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:19,720
people that might be engaged in

00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:22,450
technology they might have inclusion

00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:25,480
programs they might not but very often

00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:28,120
it is the model of you know we want the

00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:31,180
young hotshot technologists and we want

00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:33,160
you know the best financial return and

00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:35,200
we're not really interested in privacy

00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:38,230
and oh wow if it had a double bottom

00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:42,040
line like why would we fund that and and

00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:47,500
so there are I think that's an area

00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:50,260
where policymakers and funders could

00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:53,410
actually make a difference over time I

00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:57,600
think we've scouted around this topic of

00:16:53,410 --> 00:17:01,900
so what is the role of government here

00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:03,670
well that's a probably a political

00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:06,220
science question like with answers

00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:10,510
across the spectrum but I think most

00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:14,920
would say protected citizens but funding

00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:16,330
encouraging zooms oh well so so protect

00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:18,459
your citizens actually I was singing on

00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:21,040
the regulatory side and first so I think

00:17:18,459 --> 00:17:23,350
that there's to me it's obvious there's

00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:25,870
a role of government these are the

00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:31,570
technological advances just like

00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:33,910
anything else I mean oil discovery you

00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:36,190
know what is a technological advance and

00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:38,680
you know every industry you know cars or

00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:40,780
they don't you know government has some

00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:44,710
role in protecting citizens so I think

00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:47,289
that's important I think

00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:49,929
in governments vary in the degree of

00:17:47,289 --> 00:17:56,080
investment in the kinds of future that

00:17:49,929 --> 00:17:57,760
you want so it probably varies I think

00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,230
most governments feel like they should

00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,700
be investing and the things that are

00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:02,980
important for their citizens

00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:05,260
I mean sometimes they invest in what

00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:10,659
keeps them in power that's that that's a

00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:12,159
different kind of thing so yeah and and

00:18:10,659 --> 00:18:14,620
most governments invest in

00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:17,350
infrastructure one one way or another so

00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:21,640
development programs and so on so to me

00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:23,289
this investment in a lot of governments

00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:25,450
are trying to invest in technology but

00:18:23,289 --> 00:18:28,450
it's it's kind of importing the model of

00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:31,059
what success looks like and so some

00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:34,390
aspect of success would be sure if your

00:18:31,059 --> 00:18:37,630
local tech scene is developing the next

00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:40,000
global platforms good great right but

00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:41,890
that's that's like replicating or moving

00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:46,270
or winning at the Silicon Valley model

00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:48,909
and there is this what is the set of

00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:51,340
smaller scale experiments that we can

00:18:48,909 --> 00:18:53,440
find and try and see if they scale that

00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:55,690
build something slightly different so

00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,880
investing in social enterprising in fact

00:18:55,690 --> 00:19:01,419
governments typically do this through

00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:03,789
regulated monopolies which is you know

00:19:01,419 --> 00:19:07,179
model from the past that the you know

00:19:03,789 --> 00:19:08,799
the phone companies right they were all

00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:12,520
they were all the early ones who are

00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:13,840
national regulated well not all but many

00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:16,270
of them in you know in Europe became

00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:19,179
national regulated monopolies or the way

00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:21,490
we do water so that's one model it's not

00:19:19,179 --> 00:19:23,919
the one that you know I think works best

00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:27,190
for the technology space right now

00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:30,070
because it's just so the scope of change

00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:31,480
is so fast but but so I'm not actually

00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:33,100
advocating but to answer your question

00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:34,720
most governments are trying to build

00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:36,399
roads and you know they're the old

00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:39,490
infrastructure and so there's there's

00:19:36,399 --> 00:19:42,789
clearly some but you know range for

00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:44,320
government that brings me to my final

00:19:42,789 --> 00:19:46,000
point which is something we haven't

00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,500
actually talked about over the last two

00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,820
days but I thought it's something that

00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:52,080
we should be thinking about right now

00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:54,580
which you know various various thinkers

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,720
have been warning about this for years

00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:59,670
but it does

00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:01,890
increasingly like the web is sort of

00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:03,480
diverging in because of regulatory

00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:05,490
structures and other government

00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:07,920
interventions in different parts of the

00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:09,570
world you have all the Chinese model is

00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:12,990
the Chinese model which were all

00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:14,730
familiar with but even in the West you

00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:18,120
have a sort of divergence at the moment

00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:20,160
between European regulation and American

00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:22,770
and as a result very often has somebody

00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:27,300
who accesses the internet from inside

00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:29,610
the EU for the moment I do not have

00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:32,220
access to certain websites in the States

00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:34,530
and indeed elsewhere um is this also

00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:36,330
something that we should be thinking

00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:47,270
about as governments intervene as

00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:50,880
regulators intervene well there's a lot

00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:53,700
sort of in that in that question because

00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:57,270
I don't know what content you mean but

00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:58,650
probably DRM protected kinds of thing

00:20:57,270 --> 00:21:00,270
not even I mean so that's one example

00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:01,260
you're right there's many ways of

00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:03,000
looking at this I'm thinking of

00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:06,360
something much more basic which is the

00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,490
LA Times website I cannot access that

00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:12,120
because the LA Times is the company that

00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:14,160
owns it with this new it doesn't matter

00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:18,720
the point is they haven't got around

00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:20,310
even now in October 2018 they haven't

00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:27,180
got around to implementing GDP or

00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:30,300
compliance oh well yeah so the this

00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:32,400
sense of that and they may not write

00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:34,680
which is partly why I think that the

00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,450
regulation is trying to be in the middle

00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:38,640
somewhere and trying to negotiate and

00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:42,360
figure out what ownership what ownership

00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:44,400
actually means and but that's true

00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:47,400
everywhere like in theory you cannot buy

00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:50,370
a car that would be cheaper if it didn't

00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:51,870
meet local safety regulations you know

00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:54,690
and some set of people could buy cars

00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:56,400
that can't today that because you know

00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:58,170
the tires were gonna explode and the

00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:01,830
windshield was gonna kill you like it

00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:05,350
would be cheaper so so we

00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:08,619
you know we make those decisions about

00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:10,149
every industry you know it's just that

00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:11,710
right now the internet were so

00:22:10,149 --> 00:22:13,899
accustomed to everything is free and

00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:16,059
available that we're not actually used

00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:17,529
to making that trade-off so that that

00:22:16,059 --> 00:22:19,860
will be an interesting choice whether we

00:22:17,529 --> 00:22:24,279
really want it as citizens I hope so

00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:26,529
because safety you can't you can't make

00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:28,600
yourself safe on your own like as a

00:22:26,529 --> 00:22:30,909
society you know it has to it has to be

00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:34,450
spread around um yes I think the

00:22:30,909 --> 00:22:37,929
Internet is fragmenting and probably my

00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:40,480
own view is it will fragment more and so

00:22:37,929 --> 00:22:45,840
that's not the early everything is the

00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:49,720
same everywhere but we don't currently

00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:52,179
you know have global mechanisms for for

00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:54,460
doing things so I I understand you want

00:22:52,179 --> 00:22:57,340
to get to the LA Times but I think it

00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:59,940
has a paywall anyway so like after by

00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:06,700
the third time you'll have to pay for it

00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:07,690
my my experience so anyway so I think

00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:09,369
there is let's look at these in the

00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:11,080
context of other industries and see if

00:23:09,369 --> 00:23:12,940
tech is really different and we don't

00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:16,389
want protection because we want it

00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:20,950
available all the time for free I think

00:23:16,389 --> 00:23:23,619
there Manette is fragmenting some and I

00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:27,850
I would question that and I get in the

00:23:23,619 --> 00:23:32,009
in the IOT space maybe like I don't want

00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:35,859
I want an Internet of sort for my home

00:23:32,009 --> 00:23:38,950
smart home things but I don't really

00:23:35,859 --> 00:23:41,049
want that on the global Internet so why

00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:43,239
in the world do I want mine why do I

00:23:41,049 --> 00:23:45,369
want to participate in taking my private

00:23:43,239 --> 00:23:47,289
information and and putting it in this

00:23:45,369 --> 00:23:48,970
system now when you use one of the

00:23:47,289 --> 00:23:52,359
platforms you have to because that's the

00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:54,639
trade-off so so as I said I'm not sure

00:23:52,359 --> 00:23:57,460
we'll see another Facebook that's like

00:23:54,639 --> 00:23:58,749
Facebook but different but I think you

00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:00,879
know there will be some changes but I

00:23:58,749 --> 00:24:03,309
think in the home and IOT and smart

00:24:00,879 --> 00:24:06,039
devices and voice we could see something

00:24:03,309 --> 00:24:07,779
different and coincidentally that's

00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:10,389
where Mozilla is investing technical

00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:12,230
energy and time is because we see

00:24:10,389 --> 00:24:15,710
there's an opportunity there

00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:17,690
and so I hope that that's correct

00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:21,050
because then then we'll get enough

00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:23,840
consumer you need like not only does the

00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:27,170
market bring economic value but the

00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:31,550
power of a consumer when given choice to

00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:33,800
drive change is it's really powerful and

00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:35,809
so I am hoping that in some of these

00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:40,750
spaces where we don't yet currently have

00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:44,960
the one giant platform based on a

00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:46,460
surveillance business model that not

00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,929
just Mozilla about others who can offer

00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:50,179
something different like we could gets

00:24:47,929 --> 00:24:52,820
enough positive response to you know try

00:24:50,179 --> 00:24:55,070
and use that to drive proof of interest

00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:57,559
in privacy and security because we as

00:24:55,070 --> 00:25:02,480
consumers have not proved it yet as

00:24:57,559 --> 00:25:05,030
citizens that you have but as consumers

00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:09,530
we have not and partly we're not getting

00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:11,690
enough choice and and then when we have

00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:13,640
them we have to make them finally

00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:14,630
because I realize we are out of time I'm

00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:17,120
sure lots of people have lots of

00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:20,570
questions so finally it's more of a plea

00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:32,740
than a question can you give us a reason

00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:32,740
to be optimistic yeah Oh several yes

00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:41,050
we've had you know twenty years let's

00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:44,870
say over the Internet

00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:46,940
we tend first of all to forget how much

00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:49,130
value it's currently bringing on a day

00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:50,540
to day basis because what's what's in

00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:53,270
front of us right now are the sudden

00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:56,450
realization of that the risk and the

00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:58,340
damage so so so first of all there's a

00:25:56,450 --> 00:26:02,000
lot more value that we're still accruing

00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:04,340
than we actually emotionally feel right

00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,470
also if you look at you know how humans

00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:08,900
work like the danger in front of you is

00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:13,309
a lot more important than you know read

00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:16,460
out spread out value and like we are

00:26:13,309 --> 00:26:19,160
just so early in understanding what's

00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:21,080
wrong and trying to fix it so one of the

00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:25,520
things that makes me very hopeful is

00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:29,000
that the problems have had you know

00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:31,700
period of time to develop and and and

00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,190
we're on like I don't know you know

00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:36,710
maybe we we've been born but maybe we're

00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:38,900
like a three week old infant in trying

00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:39,560
to figure out well how do we fix them

00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:42,220
mmm

00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:46,390
and in realizing that they the

00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:49,400
intersectionality of the problem in

00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:53,360
technical development this this view

00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:56,630
that technology is so magic but you know

00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:59,330
in the early days it was just this

00:26:56,630 --> 00:27:01,130
wonderful powerful force and because it

00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:04,220
was both different but seemed so great

00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:05,630
it lived outside of the rest of the

00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:08,420
world they lived a little tech bubble

00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:10,400
with no regulation and this belief among

00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:13,220
the technologists that oh my god we just

00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,810
get to do whatever we want and we're so

00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:17,090
great and it's everything we do is gonna

00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:18,890
be good for the world you know even even

00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:22,220
though it's just a very small group and

00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:26,960
that's not true and they many completely

00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:32,330
unbalanced and arrogant in in approach

00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:35,630
so so like bursting that bubble and the

00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:38,240
and and the sense that technology is you

00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:41,050
know humanity in action and and we need

00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:44,540
to pay attention to it like human nature

00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:46,790
is so new that that that we don't even

00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:49,970
yet have tools it's like worse you can

00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:52,250
see lots of diagnosis right like unique

00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:55,010
diagnosis before you can even start to

00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:57,050
test and build tools and so the the

00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:58,940
diagnosis piece is getting pretty rich

00:27:57,050 --> 00:28:00,530
like it's not complete that's going to

00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:03,500
grow for a long time but we're starting

00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:04,850
to understand the subfields and some of

00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:08,390
the intersectionality through the

00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:10,240
diagnosis and so are I think like just

00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:14,540
even coming up to beginning to build

00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:17,420
tools and we don't have many yet so I

00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:20,860
think that the power of the movement of

00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:23,930
people and our effectiveness at at at

00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:25,700
harvesting the the good things out of

00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:27,410
the internet and and finding ways to

00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:29,870
deal with the hatred and the violence

00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:32,630
and the misogyny and the racism and

00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:36,560
those things like we haven't even really

00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:39,140
been started yet so I think there is a a

00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:42,890
lot of power in that

00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:44,660
even the core boy I'm I'm just so great

00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:46,820
technologists have realized there's a

00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:50,480
problem there are some who still think

00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:55,549
they're great hmm I won't name them but

00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:59,210
you might guess um but but for many like

00:28:55,549 --> 00:29:01,010
that that realization which fair

00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:03,530
critique to say you should have had it

00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:05,600
at the beginning you know arrogance

00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:08,510
you know USA whatever about fair

00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:09,920
critique and even so I'd say the fact

00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:13,309
the set of technologists who are now

00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:19,490
like oh wow okay I've got to do better

00:29:13,309 --> 00:29:21,559
you know it is growing and we find you

00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:23,990
know we aspire to be that at Mozilla

00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:26,059
we're imperfect and flawed and we have

00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:28,130
plenty of our own biases and we're

00:29:26,059 --> 00:29:30,470
struggling to you know change our org

00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:34,400
and you know be inclusive lot of range

00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:38,230
effectors so deeply flawed but highly

00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:44,059
aspirational and and we find that the

00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:47,600
incoming comments from the industry are

00:29:44,059 --> 00:29:50,630
starting to shift tone from oh god

00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:56,030
you're so cute little nonprofit run by a

00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:58,970
woman you're just so cute - why Oh God

00:29:56,030 --> 00:30:00,950
like you your message of the last decade

00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:02,870
was real and we just didn't hear it so

00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:05,120
so there are some signals there and so

00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:07,280
I'm hopeful that as we diagnosis cancer

00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:09,080
ensure we start to have some tools they

00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:10,880
start to see some signal from consumers

00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:13,040
and their and from citizens through

00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:15,980
their regulators and legislators that

00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:19,130
you know the power of the let's build

00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:21,710
something decent and humane and powerful

00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:24,669
wool girl Mitchell thank you very much

00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:24,669
I'm sure there's lots of questions

00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:36,779
[Applause]

00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:45,750
there's no question that's amazing all

00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:47,549
right this one hi a lot of the work that

00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:49,770
I do is in political strategies so when

00:30:47,549 --> 00:30:51,929
I was listening to describe the current

00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:54,840
dynamics of the internet and internet

00:30:51,929 --> 00:30:57,330
politics one thought that struck me as a

00:30:54,840 --> 00:31:00,440
possible prescription to the problem and

00:30:57,330 --> 00:31:03,240
also as a possible solution is that it

00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:05,280
seems that the internet as it exists now

00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:07,950
is very unipolar in the sense that

00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:10,230
Western society and Western countries

00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:12,809
primarily the United States tend to

00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:14,549
dominate on the global scale what the

00:31:12,809 --> 00:31:18,179
internet looks like the products that

00:31:14,549 --> 00:31:19,980
tend to have mass appeal and the tools

00:31:18,179 --> 00:31:23,190
that we build in the United States is

00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:25,679
what gets mass exported so my question

00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:28,230
is is it possible to see a future that

00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:30,150
is more multipolar on the Internet where

00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:32,309
you have more regionalism where

00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:33,780
different countries and local tech

00:31:32,309 --> 00:31:35,010
scenes in that sense regional tech

00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:37,169
scenes start building their own

00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:39,600
alternatives to Facebook to a lot of

00:31:37,169 --> 00:31:41,280
these tools that have kind of gone mask

00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:43,350
global and instead

00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:45,480
can they self-regulate they know the

00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:49,230
tools that they need and how to increase

00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:50,940
privacy that is relevant to them is that

00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:54,200
something that could could happen or is

00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:58,080
that it just like in politics infeasible

00:31:54,200 --> 00:32:01,679
well so I think it could happen I think

00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:06,929
there is an appeal to global there are

00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:08,490
some benefits to mean global I am I we

00:32:06,929 --> 00:32:10,200
don't actually have the answer if you

00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:12,059
wanted to build the most profitable

00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:14,880
thing possible you might rebuild

00:32:12,059 --> 00:32:16,650
Facebook like you might ban it from your

00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:22,790
country and rebuild it yourself I mean

00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:29,580
right so so yes and on a regional level

00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:30,780
you have to have a motivation or you

00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:32,910
have to look at what the motivation

00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:35,400
would be so if you're just trying to

00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:38,790
build a regional variant of something

00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:39,929
and add or capture the revenue from it

00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:42,059
and make sure it doesn't go to you you

00:32:39,929 --> 00:32:44,010
might build exactly the same thing but

00:32:42,059 --> 00:32:46,169
but you might get more experiments or

00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:48,570
you might be easier before the

00:32:46,169 --> 00:32:51,179
to set out what would be acceptable

00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:54,419
terms and conditions so I think it's

00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:58,249
possible but you might get more variance

00:32:54,419 --> 00:33:01,950
in it yeah what we discussed this

00:32:58,249 --> 00:33:04,019
yesterday Massa was mentioning in a room

00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:05,369
they basically just built a local

00:33:04,019 --> 00:33:08,220
messenger app to replace the

00:33:05,369 --> 00:33:09,690
International one which is as you see

00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:11,580
it's just replicating what was already

00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:12,899
there and saying this time we're going

00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:16,109
to keep all the data instead of letting

00:33:12,899 --> 00:33:18,539
it flow outside our country yes yes and

00:33:16,109 --> 00:33:20,730
so we may see more you know regulations

00:33:18,539 --> 00:33:23,759
of that sort but then it it is

00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:27,809
fragmented and so depending on if and

00:33:23,759 --> 00:33:31,230
when your society would benefit from

00:33:27,809 --> 00:33:33,119
interacting beyond the borders I mean

00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:36,179
you're setting yourself up not to be

00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:39,379
able to do that yeah right and so like

00:33:36,179 --> 00:33:50,669
in some economies can do that not many

00:33:39,379 --> 00:33:52,289
right yes your danger collection might

00:33:50,669 --> 00:33:53,580
be regionalised and depending on where

00:33:52,289 --> 00:34:00,570
you are that could be better or worse

00:33:53,580 --> 00:34:03,149
for you right and I would say it's

00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:06,149
interesting exactly what that will mean

00:34:03,149 --> 00:34:09,599
in practice because where your data is

00:34:06,149 --> 00:34:11,609
stored depending on what what the

00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:13,889
legislation is you might be unable to

00:34:11,609 --> 00:34:18,510
complete a transaction right because the

00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:21,089
internet is not always within national

00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:23,399
or regional boundaries and so depending

00:34:21,089 --> 00:34:25,379
on how much you want your data under

00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:27,359
your own little say national and

00:34:25,379 --> 00:34:29,970
regional law you may not actually be

00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:31,139
able to do commerce you know it's not

00:34:29,970 --> 00:34:33,149
really clear what that looks like

00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:35,280
maybe Amazon is big enough to have

00:34:33,149 --> 00:34:38,220
everything in Europe so you could buy

00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:40,799
from there but the smaller one wouldn't

00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:43,460
you know so there's a lot of

00:34:40,799 --> 00:34:49,169
consequences as you think about actually

00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:51,000
fragmenting further Mitchell um we hear

00:34:49,169 --> 00:34:53,609
a lot about how we need to work to

00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:56,250
protect children online that we need to

00:34:53,609 --> 00:34:57,450
create a box for them and keep the keep

00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:59,160
the children in a box make sure they're

00:34:57,450 --> 00:35:01,260
secure and whatnot but yet we're

00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:03,000
now in a world where there's a

00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:05,130
generation that's coming up that is that

00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,450
has the Internet is fundamental to them

00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:08,460
and they've they've they've grown up

00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:10,680
with that and I'm wondering if how we

00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:12,140
can strike a balance between that that

00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:14,580
protection and then at the same time

00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:16,110
exposing the Internet to the children

00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:17,820
like where the Internet we don't need to

00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:18,870
protect the Internet from children we

00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:20,340
may need to protect children from

00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:24,090
something that's on the internet now but

00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:25,380
we actually need to find ways to bring

00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:27,570
in that youthful energy that youthful

00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:29,580
creativity and I'm wondering if what

00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:31,290
ideas you have about how we can how we

00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:33,150
as Mozilla and how we as an Internet

00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:35,670
community can can make that happen and

00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:46,980
enable the youth to really take control

00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:50,040
and shape that Internet well so I'd

00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:53,280
start by saying and I'm not like a lot

00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:56,220
of what I would call tech libertarians

00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:58,370
and the young children we we try to

00:35:56,220 --> 00:36:01,350
protect young children from many things

00:35:58,370 --> 00:36:03,780
and clearly the Internet today is

00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:06,680
probably one of them I mean clearly the

00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:09,620
Internet today is is one of them and so

00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:13,760
so I think that you're talking about

00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:17,730
that transition phase when children

00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:21,690
begin to be able to make decisions that

00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:23,910
we think are healthy and and and when

00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:27,060
and how do you allow that which is one

00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:31,050
set of questions but but then I think

00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:35,460
the other one is how to get the creative

00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:36,630
energy of youth whatever you mean I

00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:38,520
don't know if you mean twelve or

00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:42,990
eighteen you know seventeen or whatever

00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:45,480
into the process and so for that I would

00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:48,330
say there is something about creating

00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:50,850
and making and engaging that goes beyond

00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:54,840
clicking as a conservator it goes beyond

00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:56,910
being a consumer and so one of the this

00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:59,120
is for the second question and so one of

00:36:56,910 --> 00:37:03,420
the things I think like is just

00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:07,410
fundamental is how many all of us but in

00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:10,230
particular young or youth you know get

00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:12,150
both the excitement and the tools and

00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:17,039
the learning and the training to

00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:18,299
actually engage in making things because

00:37:17,039 --> 00:37:20,160
I hear over and over and over

00:37:18,299 --> 00:37:21,900
oh this generation you know they're you

00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:24,299
know they're native which is true but

00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:29,430
what people mean is what they really are

00:37:24,299 --> 00:37:32,190
saying is that young people are more

00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:33,839
comfortable with massive inputs you know

00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:35,520
a set of headphones music in the

00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:38,329
background playing a game doing homework

00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:40,859
and turns out a that's they're actually

00:37:38,329 --> 00:37:43,529
probably not like humanity has not

00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:45,750
changed that much in one generation that

00:37:43,529 --> 00:37:47,579
that the human brain is not set up for

00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:48,539
that so the effectiveness is

00:37:47,579 --> 00:37:50,069
questionable

00:37:48,539 --> 00:37:51,990
even though multiple inputs are there

00:37:50,069 --> 00:37:54,720
for deep thinking I mean not not for

00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:56,640
switchboard stuff but but they're not

00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:59,220
actually looking at us does this person

00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:02,940
understand what lies underneath the

00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:05,010
surface and it turns out that's actually

00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:08,609
not H correlated and two or three

00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:10,200
generations ago when the web was new we

00:38:08,609 --> 00:38:11,910
were actually pretty far along so I

00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:15,839
think there's a learning and how to be

00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:18,000
both a a knowledgeable consumer but more

00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:20,160
than that the remix line that that we

00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,380
mark uses or we use it Moz vest what's

00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:24,029
underneath it and how like how can I get

00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:27,119
to it and make something that I want

00:38:24,029 --> 00:38:29,220
more because we're many people are still

00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:31,619
in the phase I called the luxury of

00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:33,690
consumption which the internet is great

00:38:31,619 --> 00:38:35,609
at or the web is it's there it's free I

00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:38,880
mean if you can buy a phone and pay the

00:38:35,609 --> 00:38:40,500
data charges or pay your ISP there's so

00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:44,460
much available that's just there

00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:46,349
instantly and it's free and I think for

00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:50,430
those people who have experienced the

00:38:46,349 --> 00:38:52,410
luxury of consumption which is a just a

00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:55,109
small percentage of the population but

00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:56,849
we're probably in it like then the the

00:38:55,109 --> 00:38:59,309
luxury after that it you know it's the

00:38:56,849 --> 00:39:01,410
luxury of creation because if you're

00:38:59,309 --> 00:39:03,690
solely a consumer you get what someone

00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:06,660
made for you and someone made it for you

00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:08,910
for a reason and sometimes that reason

00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:10,559
is great I mean I like to think you know

00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:13,619
most of those reasons are great but but

00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:15,839
we make it for a reason we make it to

00:39:13,619 --> 00:39:17,670
makes it but there are a lot of reasons

00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:21,079
that are not great and and a lot of this

00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:25,799
technology is so incredibly manipulative

00:39:21,079 --> 00:39:25,980
that I think teaching all of us but you

00:39:25,799 --> 00:39:30,090
have

00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:32,880
about use what makes it up and how can

00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:35,280
we amend it to make it less addictive

00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:37,440
and manipulative us and get some joy

00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:39,900
into it what you know would be the right

00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:41,609
path so okay we'll take one last

00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:42,840
question because we've already to

00:39:41,609 --> 00:39:45,780
basically double the amount of time

00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:48,720
allotted to us so you think one of those

00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:51,720
at the back one last question and then

00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:55,109
I'd like to make a very brief very brief

00:39:51,720 --> 00:40:04,260
closing I'll get off the stage

00:39:55,109 --> 00:40:10,980
oh no no no like that yeah if you want

00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:12,840
to see I admire your your position your

00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:15,630
role and your responsibilities you have

00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:17,850
taken for your role and I have a

00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:21,840
question for you we have talked about

00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:24,930
governments and other entities I'm a bit

00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:29,160
more minded low level if you can say in

00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:32,490
that way what people in their daily

00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:36,570
lives can do to tackle these questions

00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:38,220
for people like 95 jobs or not or people

00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:41,970
that are I will be aware of these

00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:44,430
problems but don't even know where to

00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:48,240
look for or who don't talk who to

00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:50,880
contact what little changes we can do in

00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:53,790
our lives not only technology I mean not

00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:57,570
only for the technology itself something

00:40:53,790 --> 00:41:00,150
else we're talking about programs of

00:40:57,570 --> 00:41:04,920
solutions so multiple questions multiple

00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:08,820
issues multiple problems is it's fine to

00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:12,720
have to apply with some compromises on

00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:15,150
the convenience it's fine I'd like to

00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:19,230
have a more original and genuine

00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:24,480
question as possible okay let's see if I

00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:26,900
can be original okay so first of all I

00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:33,840
think for most people living their lives

00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:35,670
we can't make people feel too bad for

00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:37,380
not doing very much I mean like a lot of

00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:39,569
people like paying the bills and like

00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:43,410
just getting through their months is

00:41:39,569 --> 00:41:45,089
is difficult so one I think sporting the

00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:47,069
regulator's like there's been this view

00:41:45,089 --> 00:41:49,949
with tech that and and it you know

00:41:47,069 --> 00:41:51,869
certainly the view of tech is that you

00:41:49,949 --> 00:41:54,119
know regulators are bureaucrats they're

00:41:51,869 --> 00:41:56,339
all bad they don't know anything we know

00:41:54,119 --> 00:41:58,680
all the right stuff like and and that

00:41:56,339 --> 00:42:00,930
can be contagious especially about I

00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:02,849
think was very effectively contagious so

00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:05,160
regulation is tough and it doesn't work

00:42:02,849 --> 00:42:06,869
well with tech I mean I read that and

00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:10,349
society has to do something so I think

00:42:06,869 --> 00:42:13,229
counteracting the narrative that only

00:42:10,349 --> 00:42:19,619
tech you know knows what's good for tech

00:42:13,229 --> 00:42:21,749
like it is really important a um

00:42:19,619 --> 00:42:31,199
you postulated that people don't know

00:42:21,749 --> 00:42:33,599
what to do right and so that's a tough

00:42:31,199 --> 00:42:35,999
one like my might the answer from

00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:38,400
Mozilla is in part we try to make

00:42:35,999 --> 00:42:40,140
products that people want so they're

00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:43,709
answering a different question of like

00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:46,289
oh what helps me online let me do that

00:42:43,709 --> 00:42:49,380
and then you are making that a choice

00:42:46,289 --> 00:42:55,920
that's also good for the system i I

00:42:49,380 --> 00:43:00,299
think there's there's some it's so local

00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:03,059
to society how you get tech issues to to

00:43:00,299 --> 00:43:11,339
be relevant but let's see if I've gotten

00:43:03,059 --> 00:43:13,499
enough in there and as a set of people

00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:16,349
like I think we have to find a few go-to

00:43:13,499 --> 00:43:18,599
places of what you can actually do you

00:43:16,349 --> 00:43:21,329
know at Mozilla we try to have tips for

00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:23,729
those but our reach is not as large as

00:43:21,329 --> 00:43:26,400
we'd like it to be so I think there's

00:43:23,729 --> 00:43:28,289
some general movement of where do you go

00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:33,410
or where do you look so that's an

00:43:28,289 --> 00:43:36,539
incomplete answer but before you do your

00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:37,709
closing I just want to say also that you

00:43:36,539 --> 00:43:39,209
guys have been amazing you've sat here

00:43:37,709 --> 00:43:41,569
for two whole days listening to stuff

00:43:39,209 --> 00:43:43,799
both regulation data protection

00:43:41,569 --> 00:43:45,539
competition these are not exactly the

00:43:43,799 --> 00:43:47,579
sexiest topics in the world so thank you

00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:49,440
very much for turning out asking lots of

00:43:47,579 --> 00:43:52,400
good questions and being great audience

00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:52,400
give yourself time

00:43:55,830 --> 00:43:59,950
so my last thought is very similar it's

00:43:58,390 --> 00:44:01,300
a little broader you know my husband

00:43:59,950 --> 00:44:02,850
always says that I come back from

00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:06,010
Ozzfest totally jest

00:44:02,850 --> 00:44:09,850
and then it's part of the invigorating

00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:11,650
cycle and the sort of the juice that

00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:13,630
keeps going when we live these issues

00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:15,250
every day and so I want to thank

00:44:13,630 --> 00:44:17,650
everyone at Moz fest whether you were a

00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:20,410
denizen of this room or or came or been

00:44:17,650 --> 00:44:25,510
doing something else it's um it is

00:44:20,410 --> 00:44:28,960
amazingly invigorating but also deeply

00:44:25,510 --> 00:44:31,680
gratifying to learn and meet the set of

00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:35,740
people engaged on the set of issues and

00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:37,690
the the work and the ideas that you

00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:39,790
bring to Moz Fester

00:44:37,690 --> 00:44:42,880
really I've been quite boggling and it's

00:44:39,790 --> 00:44:46,390
been been quite a year for that and so

00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:47,560
just to say how important each of you in

00:44:46,390 --> 00:44:49,420
