Title: The Data Balancing Act | MozFest 2018
Publication date: 2018-11-02
Playlist: MozFest 2018 - Dialogues and Debates
Description: 
	As billions more people and tens of billion more devices come online, boundless amounts of data are created. How do we use it for good (development, smarter cities) and not bad (surveillance, insecurity)? 

This panel from MozFest 2018 features Zara Rahman, researcher at the Engine Room working at the intersection of technology and social justice; and Malavika Jayaram, executive director of Digital Asia Hub and faculty associate at Harvardâ€™s Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society.

MozFest is Mozilla's seven-day celebration for, by, and about people who love the internet. Learn more: https://mozillafestival.org/

new along some of those themes

00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:13,610
especially the first pointed number man

00:00:11,269 --> 00:00:15,650
so broadly and we'll that's specifically

00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:17,359
a specific example of something we're

00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:19,550
going to talk about which is identity I

00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:23,570
should introduce you to the panelist

00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:25,460
first immediately to my left is Sarah

00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:27,590
Raymond who has just got a promotion and

00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:29,599
has a new job title that I have spilled

00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:31,520
over the old one which is director of

00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:35,690
research and engagement at the engine

00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:39,260
room and she can tell you what the

00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:43,460
engine room is and Malvika further to

00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:48,170
the left politically is executive

00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:50,239
director of digital Asia have been

00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:52,040
faculty associate at Harvard's Berkman

00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:53,750
Kline center the internet in society

00:00:52,040 --> 00:01:00,170
that I think we can figure out what it

00:00:53,750 --> 00:01:01,790
does welcome thank you do you want to

00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:04,460
vaguely tell us what the engine room is

00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:06,049
no we are an international nonprofit

00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:08,420
organization our mission is to support

00:01:06,049 --> 00:01:11,750
civil society to use technology and data

00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:12,740
in a strategic and effective way Monica

00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:16,189
do you want to tell us what digital

00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:17,929
issue hub it's a baby outpost of the

00:01:16,189 --> 00:01:20,209
Buckman Kline Center for all of Asia

00:01:17,929 --> 00:01:25,130
just a very small mandate was the whole

00:01:20,209 --> 00:01:27,109
region but I'm gonna do something I'm

00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:28,759
going to do at the start of every panel

00:01:27,109 --> 00:01:31,279
so I'm not sure how many of you have

00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:33,859
read this different memorize it

00:01:31,279 --> 00:01:36,859
but so I'm just gonna read out the

00:01:33,859 --> 00:01:38,119
subject of the balance you know the

00:01:36,859 --> 00:01:38,810
terms in which we're having this

00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:41,569
discussion

00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:43,159
it's think could think of what I'm

00:01:41,569 --> 00:01:46,130
saying as being in italics or in

00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:47,620
inverted commas so as billions more

00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:49,420
people and

00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:51,310
of billions more devices come online

00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:53,170
boundless amounts of data or creative

00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:55,750
how do we how do we use it for good

00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:58,810
rackets developments motor cities those

00:01:55,750 --> 00:02:00,520
brackets and not bad market surveillance

00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:04,950
for my own security those brackets

00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:09,310
question all right close inverted commas

00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:12,850
so data the reason I do it wants to put

00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:15,670
a few combos back in editor in me wants

00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:15,820
to do a lot of things with this here we

00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:18,100
are

00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:19,690
um the reason the reason I do this is

00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:22,620
because I think it's important to define

00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:24,700
the terms of what we're discussing so

00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:27,070
it's about oh we should use data for

00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:28,870
good rather than even but this is a

00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:32,340
problematic notion to start with

00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:37,540
I mean it's villainous topic this week

00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:40,240
but what is is there XV I mean any state

00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:42,190
even liberal democracies you know they

00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,900
see it as good that they have lots of

00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:45,730
data on their citizens I mean these can

00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:48,030
be used both for development and for

00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:50,890
surveillance businesses seeds as good

00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:52,989
taken track what doing in all of our

00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:56,620
needs and can serve us better more

00:02:52,989 --> 00:02:57,910
efficient productivity Rises etc utility

00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:00,910
see it is good that they get to speak

00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:03,340
not meters no homes less wastage better

00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:04,989
billing so on and so forth but I don't

00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,770
necessarily see all of these things is

00:03:04,989 --> 00:03:09,700
good Oh

00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:12,010
as the topic says there's a balance

00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:14,260
start with who is this we in the how do

00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:17,640
we make this happen and who decides

00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,640
what's good either one of you is

00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:22,659
I mean I guess ideally the we would be

00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:25,150
every individual who would be well

00:03:22,659 --> 00:03:26,709
equipped to make informed decisions and

00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:28,870
have the skills to make those decisions

00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:30,579
in a way that matches their politics and

00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:33,430
their preference I think what we're

00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:34,870
seeing today is that we don't have that

00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:36,640
access to that information and we don't

00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:38,230
we aren't able to question our devices

00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,390
and to question the companies in the way

00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:41,890
that we like and the engineering we've

00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:44,799
been referring to this kind of lack of

00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:48,310
skill as a lack of technical intuition

00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:50,319
so basically the ability to understand

00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:52,060
where the technology the technical

00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:54,819
systems that were using actually match

00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:56,620
our politics not preferences the ability

00:03:54,819 --> 00:03:58,810
to ask the right questions ask smart

00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:01,120
questions and understand the answers in

00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:02,439
a way that makes sense to us and the

00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,840
capacity to do something about that

00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:06,879
we've changed our decisions based on the

00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:09,069
information that we've learned and I

00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,299
think you're I mean I appreciate the

00:04:09,069 --> 00:04:13,180
kind of the sentiment of your question

00:04:10,299 --> 00:04:14,980
that the binary of good or bad is is

00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:17,590
actually really not helpful because

00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:19,299
that's so subjective I guess the the

00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:21,519
subject line is more helpful than the

00:04:19,299 --> 00:04:23,480
longer topic is the balancing bit that's

00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:27,020
the key word here

00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:29,180
you don't like balancing I think the

00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:33,980
road potato hell is paved with balancing

00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:35,420
metaphors I really load this idea that

00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:37,310
you know you have these binaries we

00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:39,830
balance it we get it wrong it's okay we

00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:41,600
tried it's some kind of calibration some

00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:43,880
kind of equilibrium it doesn't matter if

00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,280
it's the right one but we try it and I

00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:48,610
don't know I feel like we're often

00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:51,590
framing these things as being

00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:53,570
oppositional or at least orthogonal when

00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:55,220
when you can actually optimize for both

00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:58,100
things you can have privacy and security

00:04:55,220 --> 00:05:00,410
you can have transparency and privacy

00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:02,750
and I think framing them either as

00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:04,790
hierarchical values along the chain or

00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:07,220
framing them as things that can never be

00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:09,350
reconciled and that somehow there has to

00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:13,040
be some kind of really awkward balancing

00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:14,810
act I I really dislike that though

00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:19,700
so basically we've shredded the entire

00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:22,580
good I know a real complicated now it

00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:24,800
does so what got you working order is

00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:27,500
that Chris I have done you have work

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,750
towards me yeah those of you who already

00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,490
here for immersive will be familiar with

00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:33,170
it do we you need to go through that

00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:36,970
entire thing again but those of you

00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:41,480
who've just walked in order is India's

00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:44,990
gigantic digital identity scheme name

00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:47,350
address did both fingerprints iris scans

00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:52,250
um I'm not eligible for one

00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:54,830
unfortunately so

00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:57,260
well because to what degree is our the

00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:59,600
hell do you think where does it fall on

00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:01,220
that I don't think you even use spectrum

00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,569
you said these things can be used for

00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:06,009
everything but so Arthur obviously has

00:06:04,569 --> 00:06:08,439
good things about it the fact is that

00:06:06,009 --> 00:06:11,050
until her hundreds of millions of

00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:13,149
Indians who had no way of proving who

00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:15,580
they were no birth registration even but

00:06:13,149 --> 00:06:18,550
as we've discussed or rather Sombra

00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:20,469
discussed who has can be used not just

00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:23,889
for widespread surveillance but it also

00:06:20,469 --> 00:06:26,889
become a tool for private interests that

00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:28,809
don't necessarily square with what is in

00:06:26,889 --> 00:06:31,030
the interests of citizens so how would

00:06:28,809 --> 00:06:32,950
you deal with something like that

00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:35,320
when I've dealt with it by resisting it

00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:38,200
and every way I can but I think one of

00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:40,900
the problems that other and other sort

00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:42,820
of surveillance systems that start off

00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,860
with some kind of good intention or at

00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:47,920
least that's how they're framed as being

00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:50,200
developmentally utilitarian and good I

00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:52,810
think the problem is that they are seen

00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:54,220
as solutions to a genuine problem so

00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:56,800
it's not like they're sort of you know

00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:59,680
birthed in the void for no reason at all

00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,720
they are seen as an answer to a problem

00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,400
which is a very real genuine one which

00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,890
is the fact that there are a lot of

00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:07,690
people up because they don't have good

00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:09,400
birth records decent you know

00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:12,100
registrations no other kind of

00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:14,590
identification documents there is a

00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:16,390
problem right whether this is the right

00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:18,910
one whether it's proportional whether

00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:20,830
it's you know launched in a vacuum of

00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:22,870
legal rights and obligations and checks

00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:25,750
and balances is I think the real

00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:27,640
question so I think there are many ways

00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:29,650
you could calibrate a program like this

00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:32,080
for it to be more rights respecting it

00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:34,630
could be genuinely voluntary the way it

00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,040
was originally intended to be and which

00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:38,790
they still they know there's still this

00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:41,169
doublespeak around the fact that it is

00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:43,540
which which i think is really kind of

00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:46,510
cynical in some sense when you say it is

00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:49,060
voluntary you don't have to have this ID

00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:50,680
oh but wait you want to go to school you

00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:52,210
want the meal you want education you

00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:54,400
want a scholarship you want a bank

00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:56,260
account or well then you need one right

00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,690
so then when you sort of make every

00:07:56,260 --> 00:08:01,120
single thing dependent on this ID and

00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:03,400
use it as your gatekeeper

00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,530
then it's really cynical to keep saying

00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:07,750
it's voluntary right it's it's it it's

00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:09,760
voluntary if I don't know for those of

00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:11,800
you who live inside of the Ice Age if

00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:14,140
you remember the old sort of google

00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,880
village was it where of course you can

00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:17,470
have privacy but you live in this you

00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:20,380
know windowless bunker in the middle of

00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:22,270
a cornfield in Utah or wherever it was

00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:24,070
the sort of your animation around how

00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:26,590
this is how you can have absolute

00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:28,900
privacy and not be seen you can also not

00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:30,490
function in the real world right so I

00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:32,140
think that's the problem we're dealing

00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:34,870
with the thing is

00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:37,540
very easy a suspect I mean no offense

00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:40,169
but cz people in this room to think are

00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:42,209
these are problems

00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:45,389
in other places especially in the

00:08:42,209 --> 00:08:47,430
anglo-saxon world where the idea of

00:08:45,389 --> 00:08:51,779
national ID has always been fiercely

00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:54,089
resisted there's this idea

00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:55,290
this country and in and in America but

00:08:54,089 --> 00:08:57,540
especially in this country that you know

00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:59,819
this is not Germany nobody can ask me to

00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:01,379
show my papers even Germany says don't

00:08:59,819 --> 00:09:03,089
ask me to show me my face but the

00:09:01,379 --> 00:09:04,199
difference is that in Germany you do

00:09:03,089 --> 00:09:07,620
have a national ID you need to carry it

00:09:04,199 --> 00:09:09,059
around but I think this like the other

00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:10,379
argument where you point out that it's

00:09:09,059 --> 00:09:13,529
framed as voluntary but isn't

00:09:10,379 --> 00:09:15,420
necessarily in this country you guys may

00:09:13,529 --> 00:09:18,149
not have the the Brits amongst you may

00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:21,389
not have national IDs but the fact is in

00:09:18,149 --> 00:09:25,559
this country because of this sort of

00:09:21,389 --> 00:09:29,009
bringing in borders away from airport

00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:30,300
and boat until they're obviously to be

00:09:29,009 --> 00:09:32,399
your home in your workplace you are

00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:33,720
asked to show ID when I show up in this

00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,819
country and I want to rent a house where

00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:38,100
I want a job I need to prove my right to

00:09:35,819 --> 00:09:40,019
work here and to live here is fine I'm a

00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,189
my dreams I hold an Indian possible but

00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:43,009
you need to do the same thing you need

00:09:41,189 --> 00:09:45,240
to show you a British passport you

00:09:43,009 --> 00:09:47,100
whatever the form of British ID that you

00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,600
have you're still being asked to show

00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,339
your papers it's just you know it's a

00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:53,339
bit the roundabout way of doing the same

00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:57,420
thing sorry minor complaint of mine that

00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:59,399
I sir remind people sir you're also

00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:02,220
working with ID and with biometric

00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:04,079
registration but in your case with here

00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:06,180
looking at the revenger refugees in

00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:07,230
Bangladesh

00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:10,920
now that's a very different situation

00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:13,950
you have a Bangladesh has a large number

00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:18,050
of new residents who they need to

00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:18,050
register hopefully provide services

00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,279
does that qualitatively differ from the

00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:25,399
indian debate yeah I think it really

00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:26,899
does the Rena are a I guess a little bit

00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:29,149
of background one of the world's most

00:10:26,899 --> 00:10:31,459
persecuted ethnic minorities not the

00:10:29,149 --> 00:10:32,870
most they've suffered a couple of

00:10:31,459 --> 00:10:35,029
genocides in the last couple of years

00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:38,089
and been driven from their homes so up

00:10:35,029 --> 00:10:40,730
until I think 2016 there were an

00:10:38,089 --> 00:10:43,639
estimated 1 million people living in

00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:46,310
Myanmar now 700,000 of those have fled

00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:48,680
to Bangladesh after the genocide so that

00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:52,130
means in Bangor if we have 700 thousand

00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:54,199
refugees and both the Bangladeshi

00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:56,560
government and the meanies government

00:10:54,199 --> 00:10:59,569
have said that they don't want to give

00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:02,269
refugee status or a home or land the

00:10:59,569 --> 00:11:04,550
Rohini Rafi so the way the context in

00:11:02,269 --> 00:11:05,930
which this registration is happening the

00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:07,610
Bangladeshi government have explicitly

00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:09,620
said the reason that they're registering

00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:11,389
and collecting the data of the Rohingya

00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:13,940
is to make sure they do not stay

00:11:11,389 --> 00:11:15,500
environment so they've been very

00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:17,480
explicit about this it's not even that

00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:19,639
it's been doing being done in a this is

00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:21,230
to help you access all these services

00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:24,410
they've been very explicit about that

00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:27,230
they're collecting in in some cases in

00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:29,660
in partnership with various refugee

00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:31,399
agencies who are doing it in a you know

00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:32,720
with good intentions or the ideas we

00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,529
need to know who you are so we can roll

00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,110
you up and knock you out

00:11:33,529 --> 00:11:38,569
well I mean there isn't they've not been

00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:40,430
that explicit but if we were to be

00:11:38,569 --> 00:11:42,110
cynical which it's not even being that

00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:43,550
cynical they've suffered a genocide and

00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:46,730
they've been yeah out of both countries

00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:48,529
they're stateless they're collecting

00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:50,690
their biometric their fingerprints and

00:11:48,529 --> 00:11:53,420
their names and family members and

00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:54,769
building this database a named I'm a -

00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:56,899
for example you need to give your

00:11:54,769 --> 00:11:59,089
fingerprints even to get a SIM card and

00:11:56,899 --> 00:12:01,370
the ringer who are there are operating

00:11:59,089 --> 00:12:02,870
under a code of conduct by which they

00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:04,279
are not allowed to leave the land that

00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:05,569
they have been assigned they're not

00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:06,889
allowed to get jobs they're not allowed

00:12:05,569 --> 00:12:07,939
to get SIM cards they're not allowed to

00:12:06,889 --> 00:12:09,980
get ferns and not allowed to have

00:12:07,939 --> 00:12:12,110
contact with other people and it's just

00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:13,970
it's it's really not a far jump to

00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:16,519
imagine that this database could be used

00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:18,500
to control either their freedom of

00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:20,720
movement or their actions or what they

00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:23,269
do and yeah I mean I think that the

00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,339
basic premise is that this is this is

00:12:23,269 --> 00:12:27,199
being done not even with the good

00:12:25,339 --> 00:12:29,360
intentions what's the alternative do I

00:12:27,199 --> 00:12:30,460
mean you look at it from the point of

00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,770
view of Enys

00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:34,840
when you have 700,000 people sure you do

00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:36,310
need to know who they are whatever you

00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:38,800
do with that information that is a

00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:41,920
starting point when I have some sympathy

00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:43,420
with the collection of this sort of

00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,490
information whether for natural-born

00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:47,020
citizens or for migrants I think the

00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:48,490
alternative is to treat them as human

00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:51,100
beings just in a way that you would

00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:52,960
treat other people as human beings if

00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:54,730
you're not asking Bangladeshi citizens

00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:56,050
to do that and why are you asking the

00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:59,110
Rohingya to do that but quite the

00:12:56,050 --> 00:13:02,769
country already has 100 160 million

00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:04,269
people 700,000 isn't even honest

00:13:02,769 --> 00:13:07,600
if we think of the way that data is

00:13:04,269 --> 00:13:09,279
being collected on migrants in in in

00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,889
various countries they're being treated

00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:14,619
as though they have they are subhuman

00:13:11,889 --> 00:13:17,800
people who can give up their rights the

00:13:14,619 --> 00:13:19,540
data to privacy in a way that citizens

00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:21,249
of countries like the UK are not and I

00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:23,410
think that double standard is hugely

00:13:21,249 --> 00:13:24,699
hypocritical as somebody who's had to

00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:26,060
give up my fingerprint in several

00:13:24,699 --> 00:13:28,790
occasions

00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:32,420
nonspecific um you've also said sir that

00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:34,130
in terms of the use of development

00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:35,860
agencies by humanitarian aid workers

00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:38,140
you've used the words

00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:40,269
slow and thoughtful and intentional in

00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:41,769
the way they adopt new technology I said

00:13:40,269 --> 00:13:44,940
they should be I didn't say they all

00:13:41,769 --> 00:13:44,940
right yes they should be

00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:49,350
a I want to know that means but also I

00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:51,540
want to know what happens when and I

00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:54,029
think this relates to a degree toward

00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:55,800
her as well what happens when we start

00:13:54,029 --> 00:13:57,000
off with the idea that would be building

00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:00,000
something for good and then it's just

00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,810
sort of Lipson do if not evil has been

00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,300
conferred him

00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:05,770
I mean I think starting with the premise

00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:08,230
that we're doing anything for good is a

00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:10,240
really dangerous for a good um I think

00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:12,370
it opens us it's a huge vulnerability in

00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,870
the nonprofit space because we say oh

00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:15,910
we're doing this for good so we can

00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:18,070
justify anything and we can say the ends

00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:19,630
justify the means and yeah we're

00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:21,279
violating a few privacy rights on the

00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:24,370
way but look at the end they get food

00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:27,040
and mosses and it's wonderful and I

00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:29,110
think that's usually hypocritical the

00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,880
ends do not justify those means and we

00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:32,260
need to be holding us if we're if we're

00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,670
saying that we're fighting for social

00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:35,230
justice we're trying to protect human

00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:37,450
rights we need to be doing that along

00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:40,390
the way or else we're being not being

00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:44,020
true to our mission and with regards to

00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:46,300
the my fee that humanitarian workers

00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:48,610
would be a slow and thoughtful I see

00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:49,779
sometimes that innovation is seen as

00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:52,360
this quick

00:14:49,779 --> 00:14:54,880
you know fail fast move fast and break

00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:57,180
things approach that has been way too

00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:59,200
quickly adopted from Silicon Valley

00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:00,760
despite the fact that humanitarian

00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:03,100
workers are working in a very different

00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:05,050
space I think we really need to get that

00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:07,000
out of our heads and think of innovation

00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:11,050
as being something that solves problems

00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:13,150
in a new way if we can't we don't afford

00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:14,589
to make mistakes in the same way yes

00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:15,910
there's human beings in blue yeah

00:15:14,589 --> 00:15:17,170
there's human beings who are already the

00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:20,050
most vulnerable human beings in the

00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:22,470
world who don't have the luxury of

00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:25,060
saying no I don't want this service or

00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:27,220
or even they don't have access to so

00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:28,720
many things and we need to be cognizant

00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:32,830
of that when we're thinking about what's

00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:34,570
being built and what's going on think

00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:36,180
about the fact that whenever we think of

00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:38,250
development we

00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:40,230
get some country far away poor people if

00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:42,270
the lipid tribals it's you know ethnic

00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:43,710
minorities what about people in inner

00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:45,360
city Detroit why aren't they being

00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:47,700
developed picking and screaming against

00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,170
their will by their using mesh network

00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:51,750
they're trying to do everything they can

00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:54,149
to survive in a city that's actually

00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:56,399
crumbling and dysfunctional but we're

00:15:54,149 --> 00:15:58,020
always thinking of doing good somewhere

00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:00,300
else in a country far far away in

00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:02,550
another galaxy right we never think of

00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:05,700
it actually as being a local issue so I

00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:08,459
I'm really nervous about schemes that

00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:11,580
are beta tested in poorer countries on

00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:14,010
people with less agency and choice as if

00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:16,140
somehow they can be seen as object of

00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:18,480
development and targets of empowerment

00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:20,790
rather than participants who have an

00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,860
equal right and an equals say and how

00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:24,720
their lives will be shaped right I I

00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:27,180
really don't like this petri dish of

00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,520
Silicon Valley being exported somewhere

00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:32,640
else without the norms institutions

00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:35,250
health care legal institution safeguards

00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:37,830
also being exported with it exactly

00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:40,680
that's exactly it isn't led on to your

00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:43,410
question and answered yourself is it's

00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:45,270
because of the state of regulation and

00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:48,020
enforcement in the countries in which is

00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:50,720
being supposed to

00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:53,510
I've been working on a piece this week

00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:56,410
about credit scoring and you know

00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:59,930
America we're crediting really the both

00:16:56,410 --> 00:17:02,149
first through the 60s and 70s and 80s

00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:05,420
and then sort of mainstream consumer

00:17:02,149 --> 00:17:07,730
credit or the hood of a 1989 there's

00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:09,650
still between 25 and 50 million

00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:11,630
Americans who don't have credit suppose

00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:15,730
and then when you read about FinTech

00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:18,949
companies that are using telephone data

00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:21,470
if they behave a little suppose people

00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:24,500
and you ask yourself why aren't they

00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:25,610
doing this in the US it was lots of very

00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,470
strong data protection and privacy

00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:31,400
regulation in the States and they con I

00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:33,050
mean the US has we know in terms of in

00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:35,380
terms of presentator protecting yes but

00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:39,590
in terms of credit it has it you know

00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:43,610
what a couple of bad 1970s lows that

00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:45,110
brings us that brings us when I think

00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:46,220
I was thinking Chinese Petitte yeah I

00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:48,590
saw you were gonna go in that direction

00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:50,510
super core you know people call it

00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:52,460
Chinese so look I didn't think the

00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:56,570
Chinese Social Credit debate I find like

00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:58,700
very plain mixed up and try and avoid it

00:17:56,570 --> 00:18:00,980
because one thing I am no expert on it

00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:03,380
and for another a lot of it seems in the

00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:05,420
same way that if you find that I'm

00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:06,580
complaining too much the military on an

00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:10,460
awesome day

00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:13,160
in the same way that we're complaining

00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:15,950
about development generally being like

00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:17,750
them poor kid in Africa I think very

00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:19,640
often when we talk about anything

00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:22,190
happening in China's is sort of framing

00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:24,400
of the big evil Communist Party that

00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:26,780
isn't always helpful isn't even always

00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:29,270
for example with social credit where

00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:30,530
there's at the moment a number of how am

00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:32,179
i doing one of those Mizpah back to face

00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:36,060
I live in Hong Kong so it is very real

00:18:32,179 --> 00:18:38,250
for me let's discuss this after yeah

00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:40,740
in terms of starting with the

00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:42,510
proposition of good or bad oh it's

00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:44,280
alright you said not necessarily very

00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:49,430
helpful started good either

00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:49,430
what really concerns me about Facebook

00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:54,670
poor ideologies that it it takes

00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:57,020
simultaneously two things simultaneously

00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:59,060
simultaneously it takes as a given that

00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:01,320
it is a good at connecting people on it

00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:02,490
known as

00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,690
seems to me there will to be kind of

00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:04,919
neutral about it and we're connecting

00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:06,690
people then they can do what they want

00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:10,250
with it and both of these I think are

00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:10,250
very very tenuous positions

00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:13,980
something like an activity that would on

00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:15,720
it

00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:18,420
can it be neutral and it discipline

00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:21,270
neutral I think any kind of technologies

00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:23,960
I think it's deeply naive and I hope I

00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:26,160
mean maybe one day Facebook will stop Oh

00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:27,990
Silicon Valley in general people working

00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,990
in tech corporations will stop saying

00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:33,300
that their new all objective whatever I

00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:36,510
think that kind of approach actually

00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:39,120
just emphasizes the existing power in it

00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:41,850
he's that we have today um so again I

00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:44,340
mean the premise of your question was on

00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:45,870
good or bad and Aiden as I said earlier

00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:47,970
I don't think that's a very helpful they

00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:49,500
start okay so we have not we gone do

00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:52,790
bird we obviously don't want to do bad

00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,790
contra you do neutral

00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:59,230
IFS we can assess each decision as it

00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:01,659
comes to us given the context by

00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:03,549
designing with the people who were who

00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:06,490
were involved speaking more user centric

00:20:03,549 --> 00:20:08,909
approach so making any kind of Universal

00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:12,809
or global approach to any of these

00:20:08,909 --> 00:20:16,600
complicated political social problems is

00:20:12,809 --> 00:20:18,429
where we have leader discussions on

00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,960
Monday mornings of work where people

00:20:18,429 --> 00:20:22,000
were living one of

00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:24,220
leaders should be and then everybody

00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,330
debates it and I didn't he

00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,710
at the end of the week there's a bunch

00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:29,860
of leaders in there and very often

00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:31,840
that's well you know

00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:35,010
and then somebody drones on for 45

00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:36,570
minutes about reserve or whatever others

00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:40,260
to me like the answer to this question

00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:42,570
is best it's complicated it is a

00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:45,020
facebook status about relationship it's

00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:47,400
not meant to explain the whole world

00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:48,990
things are complicated and that's why

00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:51,020
you don't come up with a magic bullet

00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:53,520
you know you don't sort of assume that

00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:54,900
connecting communities is your sort of

00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:58,110
get-out-of-jail-free card

00:20:54,900 --> 00:21:00,750
I also think there's a certain hypocrisy

00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:02,490
in a company like Facebook and I'm

00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:04,920
saying like with is you know and they're

00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:06,900
making across the field is when you're

00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:10,080
very willing to take credit for an Arab

00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:11,580
Spring but then you say oh the US

00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,840
election being swayed or no that

00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:15,810
couldn't possibly have happened on our

00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:16,530
platform right so you you can't have it

00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:18,150
both ways

00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:20,730
either you're able to shift opinion or

00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:24,360
you're not right so I think this is a

00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:27,540
certainly know of attitude behind that

00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:31,170
when you take credit for good things so

00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:32,970
just on on debate and discussion being

00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:36,750
complicated and taking things step by

00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:39,690
step that's it's possible to do

00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:42,169
rising Li to a degree when the Indian

00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:45,179
government is pushing widespread

00:21:42,169 --> 00:21:47,309
adoption of a certain technology on you

00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:49,360
the civil 30 years we were discussing

00:21:47,309 --> 00:21:51,039
earlier

00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,679
and I'll see you can vote out the Indian

00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:56,169
government as Indian electorate tends to

00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:58,989
do every 10 years or so um you can't do

00:21:56,169 --> 00:22:04,870
anything with baseball leave which also

00:21:58,989 --> 00:22:08,170
let's face it you can't really not only

00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:10,270
users say there's also new shareholders

00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:12,850
able to class the share class the way

00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:14,110
the company structure

00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:16,840
in that sort of a situation because what

00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:19,210
you're dealing with there is a company

00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:22,330
that has huge amount of influence and is

00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:24,370
basically setting public policy with

00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:26,900
almost no civil society participation

00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:28,790
except on their terms

00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:30,590
I think the problem isn't just the lack

00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:32,270
of civil society it's a lack of

00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:36,500
accountability in regulation and

00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:39,050
oversight in any way effectively I mean

00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:41,120
I'm no lawyer but I've look actually the

00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:43,370
regulation and policy thing that kind of

00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,900
problem they think it's too big I mean

00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:46,880
if there's one thing I could emphasize

00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:49,040
from all of this is that this is a this

00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,390
is a collective problem all of these

00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:52,400
things that were discussing technology

00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:54,260
connects our stuff therefore these are

00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,880
all collective Network problems and that

00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:58,340
means that we need collective solution

00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:00,050
there's never going to be one individual

00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:02,810
appen that is going to change any of

00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:04,520
this it's gonna have to be a solution

00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:06,010
that has various parts from the policy

00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:08,870
level to the civil society participation

00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:11,360
to recognizing the different context in

00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:13,190
which facebook is being implemented to

00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:16,550
setting up country offices to hiring

00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:18,080
people who speak the languages where who

00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:20,450
deeply understand the context where

00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:22,100
Facebook is being used and can react

00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:24,560
accordingly to various things that are

00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:26,480
happening and I think this is really I

00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:28,790
mean why having a diverse group of

00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:31,870
people with diverse sets of skills is

00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:31,870
really variable

00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:37,370
it's also not sustainable that they give

00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,890
escaping regulation of any time right

00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:42,350
you can the amount of lobbying that goes

00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:43,429
into having regulatory capture is

00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:45,470
astonishing

00:23:43,429 --> 00:23:47,660
right if they spend that much money

00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:49,580
actually affecting their product we

00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:51,620
might have a very different face right

00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:54,920
but I think as long as they keep saying

00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:56,570
wages the pipes we wavy can't be in a

00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:58,790
way now we're not actually an editor

00:23:56,570 --> 00:24:00,679
they are a media company in an

00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:02,450
advertising company to keep saying

00:24:00,679 --> 00:24:04,970
they're just pipe is no longer tenable

00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:06,290
right you can't keep avoiding liability

00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:08,600
for everything that happens on your

00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:10,040
platform and keep saying Orwell where

00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:12,380
infrastructure but we don't want to be

00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:14,390
regulated as a utility I think it's

00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:17,270
becoming you know more and more clear

00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:20,960
that that position is just didn't like

00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:24,110
by today in October 28 indices finally

00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,580
sort of started gaining more what this

00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:27,730
argument is finally started gaining more

00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:30,040
widespread

00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:32,830
in policy circles and even in generals

00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:34,540
with Labour's and circles just until a

00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:36,850
year ago was a much harder argument to

00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:38,740
make but okay having said all of this

00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:41,320
all the kinds of breaches that they've

00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:42,970
had now become more visible and it's

00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:45,250
just become more and more embarrassing

00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:47,800
for them to keep saying we can do this

00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:50,350
if we don't need to be regulated look

00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:54,020
we've spent we spent about 20 odd

00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:56,390
minutes I think um complaining

00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:57,649
I mean I think we've been pretty no not

00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:58,970
just complaining well but he was

00:24:57,649 --> 00:25:01,850
suggesting solutions we're being

00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:04,120
constructive um okay and this sounds

00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:06,070
kind of deterministic

00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:07,840
but I do think there's no good please

00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:10,840
feel free to agree with me as vociferous

00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:12,550
ly as you like I do think there's no

00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:15,520
gettin on the fact that a world a sort

00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:19,030
of large-scale pervasive biometric data

00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:21,100
entity is going to going to be our

00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:25,010
future not this

00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:28,020
but everywhere and I think

00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:31,470
probably more helpful to acknowledge

00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:33,540
that accept it and shape it that it's

00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:36,000
done well rather than fight it so that

00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:38,730
it's not done at all maybe what done

00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,580
well okay and I ask you what does well

00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:43,350
look why don't you talking to someone

00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:45,060
looks like I don't think it can never be

00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:46,500
done well see yeah I mean I was gonna

00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:48,390
say I think it's interesting that you

00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:50,460
phrase it as it's gonna happen select

00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:52,080
accept it I think for me one of the

00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:54,750
biggest fights that we have in social

00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:56,970
justice or Internet health or privacy or

00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:59,280
anything is that with our imagination

00:25:56,970 --> 00:26:01,260
mm-hmm if we're just accepting the very

00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:04,020
easy convenient options that are

00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:05,760
presented in front of us by people by

00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:07,500
governments are companies who hold huge

00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:10,290
amounts of power then of course it's

00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:14,490
gonna happen I can think of few examples

00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:17,790
being done well if one is the Austrian

00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:19,890
one which has a national ID is inverting

00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:21,570
its national ID do any idea if there's

00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:26,300
anybody here for sure please raise your

00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:26,300
hand and tell me for making us a vaguely

00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:31,480
okay uh

00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:34,659
where my understanding is the way the

00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:35,919
Austrian system works is that when

00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:39,390
you're interacting with government you

00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:39,390
use your Eid but you only

00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:43,519
need to provide as much information as

00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:46,049
especially necessary from whatever

00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:48,269
transaction or service you are presently

00:26:46,049 --> 00:26:51,960
engaged in that's one example another

00:26:48,269 --> 00:26:55,180
one is the median one that was set up

00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:57,850
employment interfer but my bang

00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:59,500
some government and a third party forget

00:26:57,850 --> 00:27:01,810
the details of it I'm not going to go in

00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:05,410
through it in too much detail and then

00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:06,880
there's heard to the tangential one this

00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:08,970
sort of this sort of discussion would be

00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:12,190
incomplete on some demon in Estonia

00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:15,580
might as well get it over with where the

00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:19,300
law is that you can only request any

00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:20,950
form of data from any citizen once this

00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:22,420
being the government and once you have

00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:23,580
it then it's your job to go find it the

00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:26,490
next time you need it rather than

00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:29,340
hassling the citizen and you know

00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:30,810
collecting it over and over again

00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:33,320
one can argue up but that means there's

00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:35,880
some vast database somewhere right I

00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:37,260
mean I think going between like we were

00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,430
talking about governments and then we

00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:41,760
were talking about Facebook minute or

00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:43,440
fut agencies I think for me it makes

00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,610
more sense to think about this in a in a

00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,100
much broader picture rather than

00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:48,810
thinking of like very specific cases mmm

00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:50,280
so even in the Estonian case which is as

00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:52,560
you say kind of held up as a golden

00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:54,600
child they've had date week over went to

00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:55,890
a presentation once where someone had to

00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:58,260
hack into their system and found

00:27:55,890 --> 00:28:00,300
creatures right in front of us on the

00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:02,790
stage and I think that just doesn't get

00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:04,590
is enough as much press as the Marigold

00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:06,420
in general look at this amazing sis I

00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:08,790
think the the premise of what you said

00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:10,470
earlier of this pervasive biometric data

00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:12,390
collection going to happen is is more

00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:15,930
the kind of the thing I want to push

00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:17,670
back again and say maybe there is there

00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:19,800
is there are various problems that have

00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:21,990
led to people suggesting the solution of

00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:23,670
collecting biometric data I would much

00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:25,380
rather that we return to those problems

00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:27,900
and think about solutions to those

00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:30,270
problems that do not involve connection

00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:32,550
if I'm entering data right we got to

00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:34,020
know if you like the logical and going

00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:36,110
to that argument is sort of Donald

00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:37,700
Trump's

00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:39,590
a device that you should just like send

00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:42,280
handwritten letters people if you don't

00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:42,280
want to be

00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:47,080
interceptive I think that's an Aquarius

00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:48,370
stream answer that's that's I mean is

00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:51,010
Donald Trump is not the answer

00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:54,190
any logical get the whatever the

00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:57,100
question is the wrong answer it seems to

00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:58,930
be the what you're saying is I'm saying

00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:00,580
like let's go back to the problem I mean

00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:02,830
I using biometrics themselves or

00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:13,780
biometric databases themselves are

00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:16,270
problematic yes okay why you go show me

00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:18,880
under the bus I think they're inherently

00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:22,000
problematic one because the technology

00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:24,520
isn't perfect it differentiates between

00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,910
people it the error rates are worse on

00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:30,550
darker skin darker eyes they're not

00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:32,920
perfect in any scenario because there

00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:34,930
are new they're asking you can't get rid

00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:38,080
of them you can't change them if they

00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:39,820
stay with out of reach do I change this

00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,200
is not Minority Report I'm not Tom

00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:43,630
Cruise I'm not gonna walk around with my

00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:46,510
balls in a plastic bag you know changing

00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:48,520
them so I think biometrics are deeply

00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:50,050
deeply problematic all those reasons if

00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:52,180
they weren't were born with like I can't

00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:54,400
go change my fingerprints I can't go

00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:56,530
change my irises so they're they be

00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:58,450
presented as a very strong security

00:29:56,530 --> 00:30:00,250
people they're actually really really

00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:02,530
weak what happens if they've reached

00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:04,270
ones like that's it over it listen about

00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:06,070
five minutes sorry sorry the only way to

00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:08,110
the only way that I can imagine that

00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:10,270
being done well is if the individual

00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:12,220
were the one that held your biometric

00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:14,260
data so if there weren't some way of

00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:16,660
saying actually all you need to do is

00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:18,700
verify that I am the same person as the

00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:20,560
person who gave you're my finger means

00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:22,450
to this thing and you just need to match

00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:24,400
them the system that I'm interacting

00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:27,010
with does not need to sold or support

00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:29,680
any of that data and I mean I remain in

00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:31,150
control of all of my I meant main kind

00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:32,530
of literally in control and in

00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:34,480
possession of all of my biometric data

00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:36,700
and perhaps but that's a very different

00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,200
nature the thing that you save a massive

00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:39,520
image of because that brings me to my

00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,570
last question which I actually want to

00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,160
rush through because we have five

00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:44,320
minutes oh sure there are questions as

00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:46,120
well thank you because some things have

00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,710
been looking into this quite a bit and

00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:49,760
there's a phrase I've heard quite a lot

00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:52,850
which is

00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:56,630
self sovereign health variances were

00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:59,210
self sovereignty over an eternity self

00:30:56,630 --> 00:31:01,640
sovereign ID cells over 90 on the Block

00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:03,320
in office be where else even if it we

00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:06,080
said Donald Trump and blockchain and

00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:07,790
let's just get it all over okay can we

00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:12,380
just say AI and then we're done with

00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:14,180
yeah yeah no I know but this point about

00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:16,520
self sovereignty I think all of the

00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:18,890
examples that you mentioned are things

00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:21,530
with systems which are about attribute

00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:25,040
things like anonymous credentials that's

00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:27,350
worth it in work and I think ambient

00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:29,810
data is where all the analogies collapse

00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:32,240
right as long as I am presenting

00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:34,580
biometrics to a system and I know that I

00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,920
have to present my fingerprint I stand

00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:40,040
before something and it ends my irises I

00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:41,930
know the collection is happening I think

00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:44,150
everything break down when its ambient

00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:46,850
collection when is facial recognition at

00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:49,100
fifty paces and that fifty paces is

00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:50,720
getting shorter and shorter I don't even

00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:51,980
know it's being collected I don't know

00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,500
it's being matched I don't know it's

00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:56,930
being triangulated so I don't have the

00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:59,300
ability to consent right I don't have

00:31:56,930 --> 00:32:01,940
the ability to not walk into public face

00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:04,250
so I think all of these things around

00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:06,590
yes we can keep it safe yes we can have

00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:08,900
rules around it it all sort of gets very

00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:10,670
very blurred and problematic when you're

00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:13,340
dealing with ambient data collection in

00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:15,260
at the city level in an airport in all

00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:16,910
kinds of areas where voice is being

00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:19,190
collected as you walk down this big

00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:21,860
conversations are being recorded your

00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:24,980
faces being you know matched every way

00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:27,350
or your location is being mapped so I

00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:29,270
think all of the rules that you talk

00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:31,700
about they can work in smaller systems

00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:34,520
and you mentioned Estonia it's really

00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:36,290
easy to implement a secure system when

00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:38,210
you're dealing with a small country a

00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:40,760
rich country in a country that's

00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:42,140
relatively homogeneous right the second

00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:44,360
you are dealing with disparities of

00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:46,760
income of gender ethnicity class

00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:49,070
sexuality everything becomes that much

00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:51,500
more complicated so I think there are

00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:53,720
ways that attribute based systems can

00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:56,510
work like you were saying where you have

00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:58,220
control over the data and you decide

00:32:56,510 --> 00:33:00,350
what attribute you presents so like very

00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:02,759
very basic example if you go to a bar

00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:04,349
and you want to order a drink

00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:05,999
need to know you're above the drinking

00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:07,949
age they don't need to know your name

00:33:05,999 --> 00:33:10,349
and address and all that you know well

00:33:07,949 --> 00:33:11,969
what how much exactly all kinds of other

00:33:10,349 --> 00:33:14,339
things so you don't even need to present

00:33:11,969 --> 00:33:15,959
your driver's license you and my old

00:33:14,339 --> 00:33:17,820
friend Casper Bowden had a wonderful

00:33:15,959 --> 00:33:20,309
analogy we said it's like a Rubik's Cube

00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:22,679
each of them is like an attribute you

00:33:20,309 --> 00:33:25,079
don't have to show everything to every

00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:26,820
transaction in a particular scenario

00:33:25,079 --> 00:33:28,979
you're just sort of saying oh you want X

00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:31,259
amount of information for me to do this

00:33:28,979 --> 00:33:33,269
transaction hang on a minute and you

00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:35,099
just sort of scramble it and show just

00:33:33,269 --> 00:33:37,739
the pieces of data that are necessary

00:33:35,099 --> 00:33:39,479
for that right Amazon we need your

00:33:37,739 --> 00:33:40,859
address to deliver a package then you

00:33:39,479 --> 00:33:42,209
give them your address but you then you

00:33:40,859 --> 00:33:43,529
don't need to tell them what gender you

00:33:42,209 --> 00:33:45,959
are because that's not relevant

00:33:43,529 --> 00:33:47,650
nothing credentials is the future not

00:33:45,959 --> 00:33:50,500
identity

00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:51,850
or maybe it's multiple identity yeah but

00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:54,130
you can you can be fluid with your

00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:55,840
identity and decide which attribute from

00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:57,790
your identity you present the different

00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:00,780
places and different space there's a

00:33:57,790 --> 00:34:00,780
book really good

00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:06,660
we do openness of questions we have

00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:09,720
minute 17 seconds but

00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:11,340
you can hang around and sort of shorten

00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:14,190
your break um I'm perfectly happy to

00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:16,669
hang around somebody will come to you

00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:16,669
with a mic

00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:22,020
thanks I'd add to that the right to be

00:34:20,129 --> 00:34:24,740
forgotten you've produced it and then

00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:24,740
left it yeah

00:34:25,419 --> 00:34:28,409
a small supplement

00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:32,109
I think you have to say that

00:34:33,899 --> 00:34:39,869
Thanks it was really great um I was

00:34:37,499 --> 00:34:42,450
wondering about how we as researchers

00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:44,639
we're really interested in how we

00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:48,240
translate these arguments about digital

00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:51,869
rights to a non digital civil society

00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:53,819
say for example organizations who work

00:34:51,869 --> 00:34:56,099
on working on police accountability on

00:34:53,819 --> 00:34:59,549
violence against women or on those kind

00:34:56,099 --> 00:35:02,549
of social justice issues how do we talk

00:34:59,549 --> 00:35:04,829
to those organizations about these

00:35:02,549 --> 00:35:07,019
critical issues and make sure that

00:35:04,829 --> 00:35:08,490
they're part of these debates these

00:35:07,019 --> 00:35:11,690
people have been being incredibly

00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:13,769
effective advocacy in the face of

00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:16,859
boycotts and all the rest of it for many

00:35:13,769 --> 00:35:19,799
years how do we broaden out these issues

00:35:16,859 --> 00:35:21,269
of being a non-digital focus on yeah I

00:35:19,799 --> 00:35:22,799
think that translation piece is an

00:35:21,269 --> 00:35:24,869
incredibly important one and that's what

00:35:22,799 --> 00:35:26,339
we also at the end room working a lot

00:35:24,869 --> 00:35:27,869
with working with social justice

00:35:26,339 --> 00:35:31,289
organizations who don't come from this

00:35:27,869 --> 00:35:33,349
HEC open webby type place

00:35:31,289 --> 00:35:35,539
who wouldn't be at Moz fest for example

00:35:33,349 --> 00:35:39,359
the strategies that I found are actually

00:35:35,539 --> 00:35:40,950
speaking their language literally or

00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:43,680
just in the terms that they use whether

00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:46,140
it's movement justice language or social

00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:47,670
justice or putting it into context as

00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:51,029
the particular problem that they're

00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:53,039
facing and trying to dial back the

00:35:51,029 --> 00:35:55,739
assumptions that we make when we talk

00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:57,690
about technology in the politicization

00:35:55,739 --> 00:35:59,549
and understanding that the way that heck

00:35:57,690 --> 00:36:01,380
is set up right now these all these

00:35:59,549 --> 00:36:03,900
systems people are actually almost

00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:06,359
discouraged to ask questions like if our

00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:08,069
laptops break we can you know in my own

00:36:06,359 --> 00:36:09,660
case my last arts my leftover actually

00:36:08,069 --> 00:36:12,180
food together I couldn't be more

00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:15,690
discouraged to fix that myself they make

00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:17,369
it so that I am not and not being yeah I

00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:18,450
guess I mean again live the phrase of

00:36:17,369 --> 00:36:19,619
the framing that we're using at the end

00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:21,450
room is building their technical

00:36:19,619 --> 00:36:23,789
intuition so part of that is recognizing

00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:25,259
that people other people working in

00:36:23,789 --> 00:36:27,960
social justice have a deeply critical

00:36:25,259 --> 00:36:29,549
and political lens on things and all we

00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:31,410
need to do is show them that they need

00:36:29,549 --> 00:36:33,450
to apply that to this technical space

00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:35,549
instead of putting buddhas up on a

00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:37,289
pedestal and saying the technologists

00:36:35,549 --> 00:36:38,940
have it fit is they really don't and

00:36:37,289 --> 00:36:44,269
they really need people from diverse

00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:44,269
back to her by this point

00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:51,500
I hope I don't know I mean all of us in

00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:53,359
this room would be a similar level of

00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:56,270
familiarity with the stuff I have no

00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:58,369
idea the other response I have to Becky

00:36:56,270 --> 00:37:00,470
is that we're actually learning from

00:36:58,369 --> 00:37:01,820
these other fields rather than it being

00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:04,099
about you know you need directional

00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:06,740
thing because things like nothing about

00:37:04,099 --> 00:37:09,890
us without us came from the disability

00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:12,410
rights movement thinking of damage in

00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:14,450
this technical space as ecological and

00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:17,839
environmental thinking of externalities

00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:21,230
and you know digital harm and like

00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:22,970
footprints and you know toxic waste that

00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:24,619
came from the environmental movement so

00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:27,080
I think actually that cross-pollination

00:37:24,619 --> 00:37:29,750
of metaphors ideologies and even

00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:32,390
tactical and strategic ways of actually

00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:34,070
achieving policy reform deciding where

00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:36,080
along the policy lifecycle do you

00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:38,210
intervene what what does a good campaign

00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:40,250
look like we're actually learning from

00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:42,140
fields in the technical space although

00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:44,330
it seems all-encompassing is a very new

00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:45,980
one we've learned from movements that

00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:47,839
have been working on you know feminism

00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:49,460
on all kinds of things way way way

00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:51,950
longer than us so we're actually very

00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:54,740
humble when way with taking lessons and

00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:56,390
I think it it really takes a village and

00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:59,300
we all need to be in this together

00:37:56,390 --> 00:38:02,859
because it is very intersectional these

00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:02,859
are also certain technical systems

00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:06,619
you know this

00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:11,270
stunned everyone in Thailand

00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:22,000
um I know you've mentioned instead of

00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:23,590
thinking about solutions to say

00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,750
biometrics and why not we need to look

00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:27,580
like the very notion developing them in

00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:30,460
the first place I was wondering if you

00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:32,200
have any ideas of or any examples of

00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:34,180
organizations or folks that are actually

00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:35,770
working on that aspect instead of saying

00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:37,450
more diversity more inclusion let's fix

00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:39,370
them and make them better whether to

00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:41,650
actually work on the other end saying

00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:43,559
let's just not develop it's not actually

00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:45,620
to that

00:38:43,559 --> 00:38:47,660
and that are on the front lines of where

00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:49,010
yeah I mean I don't know if this is

00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:50,750
quite front lines but we've been working

00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:53,840
with Oxfam over the past couple of years

00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:55,250
and they actually I talked about son all

00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:57,940
the time and listen I really like their

00:38:55,250 --> 00:39:00,380
approach and they instituted an

00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:02,360
organization-wide moratorium on using

00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:04,430
biometric two years ago and that was at

00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:06,710
a time when almost all other

00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:08,990
humanitarian agencies were running a

00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:10,910
biometrics as this magical solution to

00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:13,130
solve all of their problems and instead

00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:14,780
of some said no we actually can't assess

00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:16,130
the risk right now we don't know what

00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:18,350
the consequences might be so we're just

00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:20,180
not going to use them and some people

00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:22,220
criticize that and said you know what a

00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:24,140
backwards way of approaching technology

00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:26,170
for me that was an incredibly innovative

00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:28,160
way of approaching this new technology

00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:31,220
and we worked with them earlier this

00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:34,820
year to carry out some research and look

00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:36,500
at how the risk how using biometrics in

00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:38,630
other humanitarian situations have paid

00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:40,460
out and then worked with Oxfam to

00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:42,640
Institute to figure out how that

00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:44,750
research would speak into their specifiy

00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:47,870
and what we found was that there were

00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:49,970
very very very very specific use cases

00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:51,740
where collecting biometric could be

00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:53,300
helpful with many many caveats

00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:55,280
afterwards like you delete it all

00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:58,280
afterwards you spray it you use it for

00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:01,100
this one specific purpose thing but in

00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:03,200
the in the general space there is no

00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:05,150
need for that and that the risk are just

00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:07,040
they far out wide outweigh what the

00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:09,320
positives could be but for me that's a

00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:11,420
really good example if nominated yes

00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:13,880
what you sing also would slow in yeah

00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:15,230
exactly they were yeah we really take

00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:19,670
another

00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:22,000
but if there's no more there's no more

00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:22,000
question

00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:28,280
we know all of us alright good thank you

00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:28,280
everyone come back in half an hour

00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:38,190
