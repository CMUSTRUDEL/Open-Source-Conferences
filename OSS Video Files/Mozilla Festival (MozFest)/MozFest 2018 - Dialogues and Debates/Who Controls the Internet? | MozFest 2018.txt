usually if we need to said my left is

00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,380
Chris Riley who's director of public

00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:12,690
policy at Mozilla and also at my left I

00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:14,610
suppose is Marian Fernandez who's senior

00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:16,740
policy advisor at European Digital

00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:20,609
Rights which defends rights and freedoms

00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:23,220
online in Brussels and our topic is who

00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:25,859
controls the Internet the longer version

00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:28,400
is and I'm reading this article I find

00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:31,470
it quite amusing the longer version is

00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:33,690
the Internet was intended for many but

00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:34,530
today it's controlled by few and we're

00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:36,120
going to have a discussion about

00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,730
centralization and possible solutions

00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,800
from antitrust to a new economic model

00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:43,320
and the reason I find that quite amusing

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,780
is because it has echoes of the Labour

00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,890
Party's manifesto in it which I don't

00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,809
know if it was intentional I was

00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:51,809
assuming it was written in San Francisco

00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:54,539
not in London but there you are

00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:58,920
anyway um Chris I know that you're very

00:00:54,539 --> 00:01:01,440
very keen to get riffing on an article

00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,149
you recently read in Wired so why don't

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,719
I let you do that and then we can take

00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:06,240
it from there

00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:07,740
Thank You Leo yeah we started talking

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,470
about how to structure this session a

00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:12,119
while ago so many different things fit

00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:14,790
under the umbrella stay about internet

00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:16,110
control centralization the better future

00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:18,630
for the internet that we need to shape

00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:20,250
and how we can get there we had started

00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:22,830
emails back and forth already and then I

00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:24,509
read this article in Wired from the last

00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:25,830
week of us Monday of last week an

00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:28,140
alternative history of Silicon Valley

00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:29,820
disruption and there was this incredibly

00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,829
powerful passage in it that I just

00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,930
really wanted to use to help bring this

00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:36,950
conversation because it feels so spot-on

00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:39,840
to me so please forgive me for a minute

00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:41,729
it is only now a decade after the

00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,770
financial crisis that the American

00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:45,590
public seems to appreciate that what we

00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:48,869
thought was disruption worked more like

00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:52,439
extraction of our data our attention our

00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:54,810
time our creativity our content our DNA

00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:57,240
our homes our cities our relationships

00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:59,250
the tech visionaries predictions did not

00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,770
offer us into the future but rather a

00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:03,899
future where they are kings they

00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:06,600
promised the open web we got walled

00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:09,660
gardens they promised individual liberty

00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:11,760
then broke democracy and now they've

00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:14,370
appointed themselves the right men

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,900
to fix it really powerful passage

00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:17,700
obviously for an American audience I

00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,379
think the Europeans in this community

00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,659
started to appreciate that a few years

00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:23,250
before her the Americans did and we've

00:02:21,659 --> 00:02:25,769
seen the the legal and the policy

00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:27,269
developments to follow that but I wanted

00:02:25,769 --> 00:02:30,060
to pick two pieces out of this that I

00:02:27,269 --> 00:02:32,220
think are really spot-on the first is

00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:34,799
the concept of extraction it's obviously

00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:36,840
a harsh term but the reality is we gave

00:02:34,799 --> 00:02:38,549
this up we didn't understand we signed

00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,870
some agreements we click through some

00:02:38,549 --> 00:02:42,599
terms and conditions but we never really

00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:43,709
had a choice and that's I think one of

00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:46,230
the things that we need to keep in mind

00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:48,599
as we look ahead to how we can shape the

00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:50,250
Internet in the future and and frankly

00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:52,470
how we understand who controls it and

00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,879
how we can do more and the other piece

00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:55,200
of this that I really wanted to pick out

00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:58,170
was that word at the end which I

00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,389
emphasized men I this is a really great

00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:01,889
space to be thinking about this but we

00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:06,750
really need to make sure that we don't

00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:08,909
have the same cultural gender regional

00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:09,900
and other biases going into the future

00:03:08,909 --> 00:03:11,970
of the internet that we've had

00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,319
dominating so much of its past so I

00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:15,780
think it's really important for us to

00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:17,879
all be thinking about that but with all

00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,889
of that dire backdrop I actually am here

00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:22,199
as an optimist I think that this is a

00:03:19,889 --> 00:03:23,669
moment of opportunity to talk about who

00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:26,190
controls the internet a moment when we

00:03:23,669 --> 00:03:28,260
can try to change things and try to leap

00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:29,910
ahead and I have two reasons for that

00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:31,739
the first is discontent with the status

00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:34,440
quo is very high right now we can see

00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:36,780
that among the engaged public in

00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:39,060
sessions throughout the Mozilla festival

00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:41,310
experience but it's also true among

00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:42,870
policy makers which is my chief audience

00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:44,790
working on public policy and government

00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:47,340
relations from Mozilla I think it's even

00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:48,690
more poignant there as we see a wave of

00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:50,699
privacy and data protection laws

00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:53,480
following the general data protection

00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:56,790
regulation or gdpr in Brussels in the EU

00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:58,230
and I think that we're gonna see even

00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:00,180
more change in that direction over the

00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:02,069
years to come now there's a big question

00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:04,500
whether that discontent will be enough

00:04:02,069 --> 00:04:06,299
and I think that that depends on whether

00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:09,090
there's something meaningful you can

00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:10,769
switch to so there are two audiences of

00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:12,329
people here at Moss fest they're

00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:13,650
builders and they're activists it's a

00:04:12,329 --> 00:04:15,989
non-exclusive set by the way you might

00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:18,419
be both and I think that this is a

00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:20,190
really powerful moment to look at the

00:04:18,419 --> 00:04:21,690
builders who are here and how we can

00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:22,860
help build something better something

00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:25,620
that bakes in

00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:27,900
solution and a good ui/ux paradigm into

00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:29,699
the core and have those builders working

00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:31,469
alongside the activists you're pushing

00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:33,479
for privacy data protection law and

00:04:31,469 --> 00:04:35,120
pushing on what I've been specializing

00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:36,900
in over the past year and a half or so

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,060
competition and how we can use

00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:41,969
competition laws a lever to try to

00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:44,310
inject more choice more portability more

00:04:41,969 --> 00:04:47,069
interoperability into the internet

00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:48,569
ecosystem so I'll stop there and we'll

00:04:47,069 --> 00:04:49,710
continue with the rest of conversation

00:04:48,569 --> 00:04:51,689
but thank you for letting me unpack that

00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:53,430
I think it frames up this thinking about

00:04:51,689 --> 00:04:56,099
control and a really powerful and useful

00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:57,719
way Chris I want to come back to both of

00:04:56,099 --> 00:05:00,419
those words you picked out extraction

00:04:57,719 --> 00:05:02,279
and men but I'm going to come back to

00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:05,279
that in a minute for the moment I want

00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:08,250
to focus on competition and ask Mary Ann

00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:10,800
a question so you're based in Brussels

00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:12,360
you work I assume and I know that you

00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,560
work a lot you talk a lot you spend a

00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,979
lotta time talking to people in the

00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:20,580
Commission and the European Parliament

00:05:15,979 --> 00:05:23,939
and as we all know the Eve's been the

00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:25,050
most proactive of any I hesitate to say

00:05:23,939 --> 00:05:26,819
government because I feel like that's

00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:29,339
non popular were to use for the EU in

00:05:26,819 --> 00:05:32,099
this forum but let's to say it's been

00:05:29,339 --> 00:05:35,250
the most active regulator of tech

00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:36,779
companies know the word antitrust from

00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:40,830
the tropical assist focus on that for a

00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:43,909
second or competition Margaret the state

00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:45,360
has made a number of high-profile

00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:48,539
announcements and come to conclusions

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,550
over the past few years and I don't

00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:51,599
think everybody's been entirely happy

00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:53,969
about those I'm not talking the

00:05:51,599 --> 00:05:55,770
companies affected but even outside

00:05:53,969 --> 00:05:59,009
observers from your point of view from

00:05:55,770 --> 00:06:00,839
address point of view do you think let's

00:05:59,009 --> 00:06:03,810
take for example the Google shopping

00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:05,310
decision did that go in a direction you

00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:07,860
were comfortable with and do you think

00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:08,189
it could have been improved and thank

00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,710
you

00:06:08,189 --> 00:06:12,659
so I'm your action actually happens in

00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:14,129
different levels so honest competition

00:06:12,659 --> 00:06:16,139
another one in the state of protection

00:06:14,129 --> 00:06:19,050
like with the GDP our but also now with

00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:21,870
a privacy reform and there are there are

00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:24,919
many different layers that action is

00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:28,099
happening like net neutrality and also

00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:30,270
unfair terms liability responsibilities

00:06:28,099 --> 00:06:31,360
content moderation in the areas of

00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:33,189
copyright

00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,439
speech and so on with different degrees

00:06:33,189 --> 00:06:38,409
of success when it comes to competition

00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:40,569
and audrey has not really been focusing

00:06:38,409 --> 00:06:42,699
too much on competition but we really

00:06:40,569 --> 00:06:44,650
have welcomed what the European

00:06:42,699 --> 00:06:46,750
Commission has been doing we think that

00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:48,789
this has been a really step forward into

00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:51,340
helping the privacy and data protection

00:06:48,789 --> 00:06:55,060
community into achieving our objectives

00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:59,349
and it has shown that you know if you

00:06:55,060 --> 00:07:01,689
put work into practice good things can

00:06:59,349 --> 00:07:04,060
be achieved and of course if you think

00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:06,759
of the amount of money of you know that

00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:10,539
these fines contain maybe it's peanuts

00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:14,620
for companies like Google and the issues

00:07:10,539 --> 00:07:16,960
that timing is of essence like this most

00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:19,779
recent decision from the European

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:23,379
Commission on Google this fine that was

00:07:19,779 --> 00:07:27,129
imposed of 4.3 billion we started in

00:07:23,379 --> 00:07:29,289
2015 and we're in 2018 so we see that

00:07:27,129 --> 00:07:30,879
the process is a bit slow we also see

00:07:29,289 --> 00:07:33,610
that competition rules need to be

00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:35,680
adapted to the digital area because in

00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:37,960
competition rules economic factors have

00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,969
been you know are the key but in the

00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:42,069
digital markets as you know there are

00:07:39,969 --> 00:07:44,110
many surprisement sections that doesn't

00:07:42,069 --> 00:07:46,330
mean that anti-competitive behavior is

00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:48,940
not happening so both from the e

00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:50,050
perspective but also us perspective and

00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:53,169
from other countries around the world

00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:54,789
there has been several consultations and

00:07:53,169 --> 00:07:57,759
some of our members have been very

00:07:54,789 --> 00:08:00,310
active to ensure that data protection

00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:03,699
and privacy are part of the

00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:05,710
anti-competitive analysis and also to

00:08:03,699 --> 00:08:07,599
ensure that there is cooperation between

00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:09,610
our Thorat ease between computational

00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:11,589
authorities and between data protection

00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:14,349
with beta bi-directional authorities

00:08:11,589 --> 00:08:15,939
consumer authorities exactly just very

00:08:14,349 --> 00:08:17,379
quickly for those in the audience who

00:08:15,939 --> 00:08:19,599
are not familiar with their do you want

00:08:17,379 --> 00:08:21,490
to just describe that it's a coalition

00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:24,400
and what any mention objectives what

00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:26,039
your objectives are yeah so I'm sorry I

00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,509
should have maybe started by that

00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:30,969
European meteorite III it's an umbrella

00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:34,110
organization of the ITO rights NGOs from

00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:37,000
across Europe where represent 39

00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:38,469
associations in Brussels and what we do

00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,449
is to ensure that every piece of

00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:42,610
legislation that we have the capacity to

00:08:40,449 --> 00:08:44,589
work on actually takes into account and

00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:46,630
respects the rights to privacy

00:08:44,589 --> 00:08:48,819
personal data protection freedom of

00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:52,120
expression online transparency and

00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:54,100
accountability so we have been you know

00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:56,829
pushing for the European Union to adopt

00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:59,440
the famous now GDP are the general data

00:08:56,829 --> 00:09:02,160
protection regulation and and many other

00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:05,140
you know initiatives like net neutrality

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:07,690
you know so now that you privacy reform

00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:09,310
I can I can vote for this I first spoke

00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:12,520
to Adria both the general data

00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:14,050
protection regulation in 2012 so they've

00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:15,190
been they've been looking at this for

00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:16,209
way longer than any of us have been

00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:18,760
aware of it

00:09:16,209 --> 00:09:22,600
you also mentioned Marian an interest in

00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:23,890
you know in our pre in our emails for

00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,110
going back and forth you mentioned and

00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:28,510
interest in EU regulators are

00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:30,399
outsourcing public duties into the hands

00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:32,769
of private companies like Google of

00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:35,339
Facebook and then you in brackets said

00:09:32,769 --> 00:09:38,709
what we assume weaving a tree call

00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:41,519
privatized law enforcement this doesn't

00:09:38,709 --> 00:09:44,140
sound like very flattering

00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:46,600
characterization you policy do you want

00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:49,089
to unpack that for us yeah so no I'm

00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,890
also an optimist like Chris so I started

00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:53,290
by mentioning the good things that the

00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:55,230
European Union is doing but also the

00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:57,699
European EA and actually has been doing

00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:59,740
certain things that are not appropriate

00:09:57,699 --> 00:10:01,149
and not only like the EU but actually

00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:03,910
the government's that form the European

00:10:01,149 --> 00:10:05,769
Union and and one of these practices is

00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:09,190
really outsourcing public interest

00:10:05,769 --> 00:10:11,529
policies into the big players and so

00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:13,899
governments are overwhelmed you know

00:10:11,529 --> 00:10:16,870
they understand that you know the

00:10:13,899 --> 00:10:18,579
googles Facebook's Microsoft's Amazon's

00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:21,130
of the world are having too much power

00:10:18,579 --> 00:10:23,290
so it's like look we don't have the

00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:26,079
capacity to deal with everything so you

00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:29,829
know you fix it and so they sell it as

00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:32,620
you know and it's the moment for big

00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:34,990
companies to take the leads and they are

00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:37,660
not realizing that by outsourcing this

00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:42,089
public duties into them actually they're

00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:46,510
worsening the situation for example and

00:10:42,089 --> 00:10:49,089
there there's currently some logistic

00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:52,029
discussions around copyrights and then

00:10:49,089 --> 00:10:54,010
the European Union is asking for

00:10:52,029 --> 00:10:57,610
companies to have upload filters and

00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:59,829
this technology and like Content ID is

00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:02,500
something that's yeah like Google

00:10:59,829 --> 00:11:05,170
already has and but many other companies

00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:07,029
do not have the capacity to actually put

00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:09,430
that in place and that technology is

00:11:07,029 --> 00:11:12,250
flawed so the European Union things that

00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:14,680
if we do that we're gonna have a safer

00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:18,130
internet and it's not really considering

00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:21,180
the anti-competitive behavior you know

00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:26,140
towards users and also towards other

00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:27,370
business players so there's two places I

00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:28,630
can go with that one is to come back to

00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:30,870
extraction and men but I'm going to

00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:34,180
leave that aside for one more question

00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:37,360
to see you know just in terms of handing

00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:39,970
more power to these companies I read I

00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:43,959
read something recently I forget where

00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:48,089
on the internet that in the six months

00:11:43,959 --> 00:11:52,540
after GDP are kicked in website trackers

00:11:48,089 --> 00:11:53,949
on sites in the EU declined 4% however

00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:56,559
during the same period

00:11:53,949 --> 00:11:59,559
they grew 16 or 18 I forget the precise

00:11:56,559 --> 00:12:02,559
number percent in the US so in the one

00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:04,329
hand you could say we're just handling

00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:06,939
more power to the big companies who have

00:12:04,329 --> 00:12:09,160
the ability to comply with legal

00:12:06,939 --> 00:12:10,510
departments and compliance departments

00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:12,579
who can spend the money to do all this

00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:14,800
stuff and in fact we're harming

00:12:12,579 --> 00:12:16,630
competition on the other hand you could

00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,250
also make the argument that perhaps this

00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:19,689
is good perhaps it's better to have a

00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:22,209
handful of bigger more powerful

00:12:19,689 --> 00:12:24,520
companies with more to lose that you can

00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:26,290
more easily police then a vast number of

00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:30,459
fly-by-night operators that are sticking

00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:31,839
their code on every site you go to so

00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:35,980
maybe I mean my question is maybe

00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:37,899
centralization isn't always bad either

00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:39,429
one of Perth's it's a challenging prompt

00:12:37,899 --> 00:12:42,130
I'll starve I'm sure I'll have many

00:12:39,429 --> 00:12:43,720
things to add as well we do need to look

00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:45,790
at a little bit of a longer time horizon

00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:48,850
than that of course and I think that

00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:50,290
over the longer term horizon the the

00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:52,630
principles and the protections that have

00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:53,490
been established in the GDP are will be

00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:55,980
adopted

00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:58,020
more and more places around the world my

00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:59,730
fantastic policy team at Mozilla is

00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:02,640
working on data protection law right now

00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:05,160
in India and Kenya and certainly we are

00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:06,779
engaging very much with the privacy law

00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:09,240
conversations in the United States and

00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:10,830
hope to see as an outcome of that some

00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,660
of the same fundamental principles like

00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:14,760
purpose limitation that we've seen in

00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:16,440
the GDP are so I think over time there

00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:18,570
will be a bit of a smoothing out and and

00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:20,040
some of the sort of traffic arbitrage

00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:21,209
that we might have seen in the first few

00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:24,510
months will will go away

00:13:21,209 --> 00:13:28,320
um I do think that there's a non-trivial

00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:30,450
concern that comes from laws that

00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:33,029
require a hefty amount of compliance

00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:34,589
because it is generally easier for

00:13:33,029 --> 00:13:36,480
larger companies to put together the

00:13:34,589 --> 00:13:38,640
resources to figure out how to do that I

00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,160
think that there's an ecosystem building

00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:42,839
around that to mitigate some of that

00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:44,520
burden for smaller players in the

00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:47,040
industry so I again I don't think this

00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:48,510
is a long-term concern I also think that

00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,040
there are lots of different ways in

00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:51,839
designing a legal instrument that you

00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,970
can account for that and make sure that

00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:56,040
the outcome is pretty balanced so in the

00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:57,600
long term I'm not concerned about that

00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,459
and I definitely don't think that that's

00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,410
a reason why we should be more

00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:02,550
sympathetic to or tolerant of the

00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:05,670
centralization that we've seen in

00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:06,839
ecosystem yeah I mean I would agree and

00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:09,959
something that I would encourage

00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:11,399
everybody is like when people talk about

00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:15,149
the GDP I have the impression that

00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:18,600
nobody has read it so I would start but

00:14:15,149 --> 00:14:20,579
please read they did appear and it is

00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,620
true that actually the GDP our has had

00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:25,110
many effects like Chris did an excellent

00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:27,180
job in explaining some of those and but

00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:29,670
it's also important to be cognizant of

00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:32,070
the fact that this GDP is not a silver

00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:33,230
bullet we're not gonna you know the GDP

00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:35,550
are does not solve all of the problems

00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:38,310
we're actually currently for example

00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:40,920
fighting for having an update of the e

00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:43,980
privacy directive which focuses on the

00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:46,140
electronic communications sector and so

00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:47,520
we wish actually the lady DPR and we

00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:50,160
would solve all the issues you know I

00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:52,440
would be on holidays right now but

00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,940
unfortunately that's not the case and I

00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:56,370
also read another study that I thought

00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:59,279
it was interesting from that's the

00:14:56,370 --> 00:15:01,350
Financial Times actually showed some

00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:04,589
visibility of its it said that's 88

00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:10,110
percent of the data that is transferred

00:15:04,589 --> 00:15:14,040
from apps that are in Android you know

00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:16,140
in androids actually go to third parties

00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:19,890
owned by alphabets Coco's a parent

00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:22,290
company and 43% go to Facebook so we see

00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:24,240
again that there is a concentration that

00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:27,029
it's not a problem of the GDP are it's a

00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,410
problem of the fact that well the

00:15:27,029 --> 00:15:31,260
subject of this panel really who

00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:33,540
controls the internet so the DVP are I

00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:36,060
would describe it as just one piece of a

00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:37,920
big puzzle a complex one a moving

00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:40,709
interactive path so if you are realizing

00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:42,839
that in your mind and we need to put

00:15:40,709 --> 00:15:45,930
more pieces together like updating the

00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:48,720
computation rules having confidentiality

00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:50,820
and security of communications also

00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:53,850
ensuring that neutrality and once

00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:57,390
actually the legal framework is there as

00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:59,339
you know enforcement is the key it's not

00:15:57,390 --> 00:16:02,070
enough to just have the GD P R in paper

00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:04,079
and you know we have seen this week that

00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:06,660
all the big tech companies are saying

00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:08,209
that the DBPR is wonderful and some of

00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:11,070
our members actually have launched

00:16:08,209 --> 00:16:13,339
complaints against for example Google or

00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:16,709
Facebook for not complying with the DPR

00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:19,079
so we see that the rules are important

00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:20,490
but enforcement is the key if I could

00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:21,600
riff on that I'd love to add just a

00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:24,029
little bit because I really like

00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,010
calamari on setting that up the GD P R

00:16:24,029 --> 00:16:28,440
is one piece of sort of what we need is

00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:30,240
a foundation for long policy in this

00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,709
space and it's been the absence of that

00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,420
foundation that has gotten us to where

00:16:31,709 --> 00:16:35,190
we are today with the internet so I

00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:36,690
think setting up the conditions for the

00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:37,980
future of the Internet we want one where

00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:38,550
we have more control and more

00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:41,820
empowerment

00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:44,310
requires not only data protection

00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:45,690
it requires security to be something

00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:47,520
that we can build in a little bit more

00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:50,100
it requires a net neutrality and

00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:52,589
openness and pieces at that side of the

00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:55,050
ecosystem and it requires competition

00:16:52,589 --> 00:16:58,140
and competition law and and all of these

00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:59,740
things are not things that we we we let

00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:01,510
the internet grow for a long

00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:02,920
and and there are many fantastic

00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:04,690
innovations and a lot of fantastic

00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:07,000
things done with the Internet but these

00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:08,890
elements were were not as baked in at

00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,230
the infrastructure layer as we assumed

00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:13,030
they were so now we're seeing the cracks

00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:14,950
in that and we need policy across these

00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:17,200
dimensions to come in and fill them so

00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:18,760
just adding to that the gdpr is an

00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,470
important piece I think that we have a

00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:22,270
sense of what we need out of net

00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:23,920
neutrality pretty good sense now after a

00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:26,560
decade of work by many people here

00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:28,720
myself included I must say um

00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:30,400
security is obviously an element of this

00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,260
for which we need to do a fair bit more

00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,210
work but I think that we've come as a

00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:36,070
polity to a better understanding of what

00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:37,810
we need there and the one element where

00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:40,120
we really need to do a lot more thinking

00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:42,940
is the competition side is how we can

00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:45,880
use competition as a way to unlock the

00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:48,520
vertical integration the silos the giant

00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:51,430
vats of data that are fundamental to

00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:56,260
having an effective business presence

00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:58,990
online today just to add to that I think

00:17:56,260 --> 00:18:01,480
I think one of the reasons it's so easy

00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:04,270
to get carried away with gdpr is we've

00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:06,730
had so little for so long that this

00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:09,370
little this tiny little crumb seems like

00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:10,930
manna from heaven you know it's first

00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:14,680
time ever or the GP are called a tiny

00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:15,970
little crumb but no you're right you're

00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,680
right it's it's a piece of a bigger

00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:19,270
frame with it that's fair and let's not

00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,590
forget we were not entirely unregulated

00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:22,450
before that either there's still the

00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:24,690
data production directive that was

00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:27,550
implemented each country individually um

00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:28,870
also the FD piece that Marianne mentions

00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:31,180
you should look it up it's really good

00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:33,100
and it allows you to type in online you

00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:35,380
can type in the names of the apps you

00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:36,760
regularly use and see where they go if

00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,900
you just go to the FT and Google I don't

00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:40,560
even work for the FT I don't know why

00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:45,180
I'm being so complimentary um

00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:47,530
so coming back to extraction and men um

00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:52,260
it's the men bit I want to focus on

00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:54,910
because it's not just men it's it's a

00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:57,010
particular type of man in a very

00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:58,690
particular location with a very

00:18:57,010 --> 00:19:01,360
particular way of looking at the entire

00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:04,960
world see yesterday we were discussing

00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:08,020
on the stage the importance of homegrown

00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:10,340
innovation not from the point of view of

00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:12,650
mercantilism or protectionism

00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:14,570
from the point of view of people in

00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:16,130
certain locations simply know better how

00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:18,950
other people in those locations do

00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:21,760
things and we were also just discussing

00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:23,750
how you know what was the phrase used

00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,909
privatised law enforcement is again

00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:28,100
flowing back to these same the same

00:19:25,909 --> 00:19:31,159
group of very similar men in one part of

00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:35,630
the world um Chris you also work in this

00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:37,970
part of the world how do you how do you

00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:40,820
serve ensure diversity of viewpoints I

00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:42,529
feel like as a white cisgender male from

00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:45,049
San Francisco I need to let Mary Ann

00:19:42,529 --> 00:19:48,169
offer any thoughts that she out of

00:19:45,049 --> 00:19:49,760
principle actually the first thing I was

00:19:48,169 --> 00:19:52,399
thinking what you said the men I was

00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:55,220
thinking what about the woman the point

00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:57,590
yeah yeah but not because we're women

00:19:55,220 --> 00:20:01,429
but because of what we can you know give

00:19:57,590 --> 00:20:03,529
to the world actually yesterday I was

00:20:01,429 --> 00:20:05,840
listening to to some of the panels that

00:20:03,529 --> 00:20:08,840
took place here and one thing that make

00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:11,480
me rethink this panel was that one

00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:15,110
person in the floor maybe is here and if

00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:18,049
you are say hi but said that you know

00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:21,020
white people from the Western world have

00:20:18,049 --> 00:20:23,419
a hero complex that we think you know we

00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:26,029
have the best and smartest ideas to

00:20:23,419 --> 00:20:26,720
solve the issue around the world for

00:20:26,029 --> 00:20:29,270
example China

00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:32,570
everybody has from the West world have

00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:35,029
concerns about China and actually long

00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:38,630
time ago I did actually a master thesis

00:20:35,029 --> 00:20:40,250
on China and and comparing a bit and the

00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:42,860
practices within China and the European

00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:45,500
Union and you can see that there's a

00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:47,750
several surveys of perception of users

00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:49,220
in China that don't think that what we

00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:51,649
are concerned about this Western

00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:53,840
Europeans for example concerns them

00:20:51,649 --> 00:20:56,299
because actually the Internet has opened

00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:59,120
many possibilities that were not there

00:20:56,299 --> 00:21:01,820
yet whereas for us the Internet's also

00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:07,100
opened possibilities in the 19th but it

00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:09,940
was alright and now we're seeing the you

00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,940
know the opposite

00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:16,000
yeah event can we're seeing really

00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:20,010
repression and that's where we are all

00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:22,330
discontented and want to change it so

00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:24,160
it's true that we should not try to

00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:25,810
impose the same solution everywhere and

00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:28,450
the DDP are I think it's a great example

00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:30,640
we what I think it's important to

00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:32,050
understand is that the DDP are in Europe

00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,690
is a result of a political compromise

00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:36,250
and they actually received huge huge

00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:38,680
huge lobbying there's even a movie

00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:40,690
called democracy and that explains part

00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:42,910
of the lobbying around it so you know if

00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:44,620
it up was up to a tree and I remembers

00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:47,320
this EVP I would have been a bit

00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:49,420
different as you could imagine so I

00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:51,400
would you know encourage other parts of

00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:54,730
the world to actually think about their

00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:56,620
legal frameworks and adapt it there some

00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:59,020
principles are key that can be extracted

00:21:56,620 --> 00:22:00,850
to favor more competition but that

00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:03,250
doesn't mean that ward by ward needs to

00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:05,860
be copied for example if you don't have

00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:08,350
an independent authority and in your

00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:11,170
country that can monitor and enforce

00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:13,030
data protection rules perhaps the model

00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:15,820
of the gdpr might not be the best until

00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:17,710
you have that independent authority and

00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:20,050
yeah that's just one through an example

00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:23,980
so it's important not to pretend that

00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:26,140
you know we westerns have the solutions

00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:26,980
for everything across the globe of

00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:29,080
course you can't abdicate all

00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:30,460
responsibility though I certainly can no

00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:33,310
you're absolutely right I think that

00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:35,920
it's been a really powerful year couple

00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:37,450
of years for raising awareness about the

00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:39,070
lack of diversity and inclusion in

00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:42,490
Silicon Valley we clearly have a long

00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:45,580
long ways left to go but a series of

00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:48,430
high-profile stories I'm sure there are

00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:49,960
are many many many board of directors

00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:51,900
level meetings at all of the companies

00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:55,240
in Silicon Valley that are taking these

00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:56,710
very very seriously clearly a long ways

00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,540
to go but obviously last week's New York

00:22:56,710 --> 00:23:00,420
Times story about Google's that is the

00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:02,650
latest but the latest in a series

00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:04,390
indicating incredible problems within

00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:05,920
the valley so I think we need to work on

00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:07,990
two tracks though and especially in the

00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:09,760
context of this panel I want to

00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:12,040
highlight the two different tracks of

00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:14,320
first of all putting pressure on the

00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:15,700
companies that currently are whether we

00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,990
like it or not in control of the

00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:19,720
internet that we experience day to day

00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:21,410
to try to get them to fix their

00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:23,350
historical challenges on this rock

00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:25,130
and second of all looking at the

00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:27,350
alternatives that we're trying to build

00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:29,930
I went to the decentralized Web Summit

00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:31,850
in San Francisco a couple months ago was

00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:33,260
great to see you know some some more

00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:36,380
diversity there than I was expecting

00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:37,880
frankly which is great to have but but

00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:39,950
just making sure that that's at the

00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:41,990
front of mind for everyone in that

00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:43,550
community and in that conversation that

00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:45,800
when we are looking at how to build a

00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:47,950
better decentralized version of the

00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:51,290
Internet in the web that were not

00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:52,790
focused exclusively on the shiny on the

00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:54,200
technology because that was Silicon

00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:57,500
Valley's problem it was a focus on the

00:23:54,200 --> 00:24:00,350
shiny and not the context and the humans

00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:02,320
around that that end up factoring in in

00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:05,300
such a significant way to how technology

00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,860
decisions are made and how processes and

00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:09,080
policies around the were being built so

00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:10,790
I want to make sure that we can learn

00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:13,190
from the mistakes of Silicon Valley in

00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:14,750
not baking that in from the beginning

00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:17,030
and try to bring that into the

00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:18,710
decentralized web community and and

00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:20,120
that's gonna play out in a lot of ways

00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:22,430
that we're not even necessarily thinking

00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:24,950
about so a little bit further afield

00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:27,530
from this topic my my main agenda going

00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:29,690
into the decentralized web the summit

00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:31,310
conversations was to talk about the wave

00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:33,470
of speech regulations that we see coming

00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:35,990
down the pike especially I think in

00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:39,110
Washington DC and in Brussels so as as

00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:41,090
we watch more things like the terrorists

00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:42,740
directive in the EU the e-commerce

00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:45,830
directive is going to be opened up in

00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:47,300
all likelihood bills like the stop

00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:49,340
exploiting sex trafficking act in the

00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:51,170
United States or cesta as it's commonly

00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:52,460
called or coming down the pike to we're

00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:55,160
going to see more and more regulatory

00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:57,680
attention on how user-generated content

00:24:55,160 --> 00:25:00,400
is managed by these platforms getting

00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:03,740
right into the privatized enforcement of

00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:06,830
public obligations kind of a point these

00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:09,320
decisions the system-level decisions

00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:12,320
that you make when you pick how to build

00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:14,450
a decentralized network matter in how

00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:16,850
you're going to do content management

00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:18,950
down the line blockchain is built by

00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:21,800
design to not allow you to take anything

00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:25,430
off of the chain so we need to be a bit

00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:27,830
more open minded and open eyed and take

00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:29,300
off the technology blinders when we're

00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:30,410
building new communities and building

00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:32,810
the future of the Internet so that we

00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:34,330
don't repeat these same mistakes we've

00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:36,399
talked quite a bit about the country

00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:39,340
themselves we've talked about regulators

00:25:36,399 --> 00:25:43,990
lawmakers what is the role do you think

00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:45,700
of multi-stakeholder organizations the

00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:48,490
the one I'm thinking about which is far

00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:52,360
from a perfect example as I can but do

00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:54,570
we need more of those well I think we

00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:56,980
need a better use of the existing ones I

00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:59,590
mean there's several standardization

00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:01,390
bodies where some of our members are

00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:04,120
actually involved and there are several

00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:06,250
organizations around the world that deal

00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:08,950
with different parts of the internet I

00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:10,210
would say that in order for these

00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:12,730
organizations to truly be

00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:16,049
multi-stakeholder there needs to be more

00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:18,760
resources for civil society for example

00:26:16,049 --> 00:26:20,080
you know in Brussels were actually two

00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:21,519
people and a half at the moment dealing

00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:24,130
with all the policy issues you're

00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:27,940
hearing right now so as you can imagine

00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:30,340
we're not many people and we want a

00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:33,750
better internet but you know just

00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:36,730
because one person from you know an NGO

00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:38,740
can be at one place doesn't mean that

00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:42,159
we're gonna solve everything and so I

00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:43,750
would not try to invent new new bodies

00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:45,490
but actually ensuring you know that

00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:48,070
there's actually resources being put in

00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:50,260
the right place and ensuring more

00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:54,039
transparency and participation so are

00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:55,929
you calling for funding yeah

00:26:54,039 --> 00:26:57,490
it feels like a few years ago

00:26:55,929 --> 00:26:58,990
multi-stakeholder Internet Governance

00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:01,720
was all the rage and was the frame that

00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:03,789
everybody was talking about I remember a

00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:07,960
moment I went to net mundial in Sao

00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:09,669
Paulo Brazil and I remember watching the

00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:11,230
lines in the way that people queued up

00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:12,549
to give interventions on the floor there

00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:17,049
and there were four separate microphones

00:27:12,549 --> 00:27:18,820
for the industry for civil society for

00:27:17,049 --> 00:27:21,490
governments and then for a sort of a

00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:23,620
catch-all which included professional

00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:26,889
engineers and academics and so forth and

00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:29,889
and I distinctly remember the watching

00:27:26,889 --> 00:27:31,659
Danny Sepulveda then ambassador within

00:27:29,889 --> 00:27:33,820
the US State Department waiting

00:27:31,659 --> 00:27:35,889
patiently in line in a queue of about

00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:37,450
seven governmental folk as there was a

00:27:35,889 --> 00:27:38,860
rotation among the microphones and that

00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:40,929
was a really high point for me and

00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:42,820
appreciating how we can try to do a

00:27:40,929 --> 00:27:45,010
better job of baking equity into these

00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:46,820
processes but we don't use enough of

00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:49,220
what we have today but our Marianas

00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:50,809
exactly right I think that some of the

00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:53,450
momentum around trying to fix that has

00:27:50,809 --> 00:27:54,559
slowed a lot and and I'm not sure what

00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:56,090
to do about that but I think that that's

00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:57,320
a different dimension that frankly I

00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:58,490
wasn't even thinking about when I sat

00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,899
down here about how do we think about

00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:02,509
controlling the Internet in the future

00:27:59,899 --> 00:28:04,100
and I will give a brief shout out to the

00:28:02,509 --> 00:28:05,509
Internet Society since they're one of

00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,799
the sponsors as well but also because

00:28:05,509 --> 00:28:09,139
they've they've done a lot of great

00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:11,149
thinking and support in this and and

00:28:09,139 --> 00:28:14,450
they have Larry Strickling working for

00:28:11,149 --> 00:28:15,860
them now to map out another vision for

00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:18,110
multi-stakeholder Internet governance

00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:19,730
and how to try to find some consensus

00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:21,500
building processes within that structure

00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:22,730
so I'm glad to see them pushing in the

00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:24,049
space and I wish more people were as

00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:27,740
well to try to figure out how we can

00:28:24,049 --> 00:28:29,629
make more progress on this I feel like a

00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:33,679
lot of what we're talking about right

00:28:29,629 --> 00:28:35,600
now is when it's stuff that turns you on

00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:39,049
it turns me on but it's it's it's a

00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:42,049
little bit abstract let's let's pick a

00:28:39,049 --> 00:28:43,309
sort of concrete example which various

00:28:42,049 --> 00:28:45,850
of the people have spoken about over the

00:28:43,309 --> 00:28:49,669
course of the past day and a half

00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:52,519
economic incentives the business models

00:28:49,669 --> 00:28:54,860
of the people who control the companies

00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:56,000
are control the Internet as we were

00:28:54,860 --> 00:29:00,190
discussing the previous panel and the

00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:03,919
one yesterday are advertising which is

00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:05,120
driven by engagement um so in terms of

00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:07,909
changing things whether through

00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:09,710
regulation multi-state whatever do we

00:29:07,909 --> 00:29:11,870
need to change the fundamental business

00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:16,879
model first or is it possible to keep

00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:18,279
this one and do it better I would assert

00:29:16,879 --> 00:29:20,570
by saying that I would not define

00:29:18,279 --> 00:29:22,490
advertisement by engagement I think

00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:24,590
that's very polite that we would call it

00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:28,039
surveillance advertising we actually

00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:30,340
think that's the the real problem what

00:29:28,039 --> 00:29:33,169
is a real problem is online manipulation

00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:35,990
combined with power concentration data

00:29:33,169 --> 00:29:39,129
concentration and you know I say you sir

00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:42,049
I want to engage this is not that

00:29:39,129 --> 00:29:45,039
advertisement this response I just don't

00:29:42,049 --> 00:29:47,629
want to be tracked all around the web by

00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:50,149
you know companies or third parties that

00:29:47,629 --> 00:29:51,960
I don't even know and I am bothered by

00:29:50,149 --> 00:29:55,230
some of these advertisements as

00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:58,680
user and and I think I mean I think the

00:29:55,230 --> 00:30:01,290
root of several problems that we have

00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:03,830
right now is the business model so we I

00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:06,360
would think we would encourage actually

00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:08,970
the development of new business models

00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:11,220
to be creative to move away from the

00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:14,430
surveillance advertising advertisement

00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:17,670
model and to really change I mean for

00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:20,600
example in the newspapers back in time

00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:24,000
when people used to read them you know

00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:26,160
in their house in the morning or in the

00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,130
coffee shop and you would I don't know

00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:31,830
for example have a page about sports and

00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:35,070
then you would see an ad about a Sport

00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:36,780
Shop you know which makes sense and you

00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:39,240
know on the internet it seems that in

00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:41,670
order to offer us a better experience or

00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:43,440
to engage they need to track us all

00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:46,800
around and then to make assumptions

00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:50,670
about oneself like for example on

00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:52,830
Instagram Instagram things that I don't

00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:54,690
know I want to get pregnant because I

00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:57,240
keep getting and for a lot of years now

00:30:54,690 --> 00:31:02,310
so I should have had already lots of

00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:04,620
babies and have asked about pregnancy

00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:07,410
tests so of course I can just say you

00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:09,120
know I don't even want them but I don't

00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:10,950
want them to know that this bothers me

00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:13,440
or I don't want them to just show me

00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:16,170
these ads at all and even the way they

00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:18,090
showed them to me sometimes I get the

00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:20,400
pregnancy ads already I'm used to but

00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:22,440
very new ones I don't even know if it's

00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:26,430
something that my friends my friend

00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:28,890
posted or that is an apt no so the

00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:30,800
design we are seeing like the their dark

00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:33,180
patterns no there's a research I

00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:35,210
recommend to read from the Norwegian

00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:40,500
consumer council that showed that

00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:42,600
there's design that is really misleading

00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:47,070
so there are dark patterns around there

00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:49,340
it's it's to deal with the colors with

00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:52,160
with which we are presented with options

00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:54,270
the way that advertisements are shown

00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:56,580
you know these annoying pop-ups that

00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:59,860
keep you know going around

00:31:56,580 --> 00:32:03,310
we are being misled and I think that

00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:04,750
needs to stop I only get ads for private

00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:07,020
Butler's for some reason so clearly

00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:09,160
these things are not working very well

00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:12,820
if I could riff on that just immediately

00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:13,960
I will get back to the quote that I gave

00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:16,600
at the opening and the concept of

00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:18,340
extraction in that and and really the

00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:19,840
reason I react to that word is that I do

00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:22,450
feel like we didn't have a realistic

00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:25,990
choice hmm other than to take part of

00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:28,390
into that business model which is so

00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:29,920
prevalent and so dominant and that we

00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:31,570
really do need to be looking ahead to a

00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:33,010
future where there are other business

00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:35,220
models Marron that's exactly right and

00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:37,870
we need to figure out how to catalyze

00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:39,910
healthy sustainable long term business

00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:41,710
models for the internet that allow the

00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:42,850
companies investing in new technologies

00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:45,250
to make a good return on that investment

00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:47,290
and that give us as Internet users

00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:48,910
choices um I don't think that's being

00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:50,290
talked about enough I think that the

00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:54,100
problems of the current business model

00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:55,990
are being highlighted but for many

00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:57,610
people that translates into an attitude

00:32:55,990 --> 00:33:00,820
of we need to stop all of that right

00:32:57,610 --> 00:33:02,770
away which is not only not feasible but

00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:05,470
also I think not right because there are

00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:07,270
people who are happy with that trade-off

00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:08,770
I think they need to understand what it

00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:10,600
is so that they know that they're happy

00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:11,890
with it with a better understanding of

00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,630
what they're giving up and what's

00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:16,630
happening to them in exchange but I

00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:19,180
think that unless there are meaningful

00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:21,580
alternatives to that then it's all sort

00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:24,760
of new I'm completely with you I think

00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:26,740
you know every time I read about how

00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:29,290
certain things should be paid for and

00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:32,610
that strikes me as deeply unjust because

00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:35,020
then what you end up with is a certain

00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:38,290
economic group a certain socio-economic

00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:39,700
group is able to avoid intrusion but the

00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:43,240
rest of the world still has to put up

00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:45,820
with it so we create a tiered Society so

00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:47,290
I agree that you know hitting stock

00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:49,590
right now is not the answer what is

00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:52,090
because it's you know not every

00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:54,670
organization can be as fortunate as

00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:57,370
Mozilla in the way that it's structured

00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:59,290
as unfunded not every enterprise

00:33:57,370 --> 00:34:00,610
attracts as many passionate people

00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:03,640
willing to donate their time as

00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:05,830
Wikipedia as I said payment will exclude

00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:07,180
billions what are the I mean you said

00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:08,710
we're not talking about enough water

00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:11,550
some of the ideas we could be thinking

00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:11,550
about are talking about

00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:17,989
but um I think the fact of I'm promoting

00:34:16,489 --> 00:34:20,450
all their eternity because that already

00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:21,829
exists it's for me it's one of the

00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:23,450
starting points so when we talk about

00:34:21,829 --> 00:34:25,879
alternatives and yeah

00:34:23,450 --> 00:34:27,349
one part of the the reality is that

00:34:25,879 --> 00:34:29,299
there not many alternatives for some of

00:34:27,349 --> 00:34:30,649
the services that we are using or some

00:34:29,299 --> 00:34:33,200
of the apps that we are using but there

00:34:30,649 --> 00:34:35,989
are other and actually alternatives that

00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:38,869
exist it's just that it's difficult to

00:34:35,989 --> 00:34:40,940
reach the right people and for example

00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:44,499
in terms of search engines you have

00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:46,609
ponts and that actually does not do

00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:52,609
behavioral or surveillance advertising

00:34:46,609 --> 00:34:55,069
as I want want it's a search engine

00:34:52,609 --> 00:34:56,839
it's a French company actually and you

00:34:55,069 --> 00:34:59,269
also have start page and other European

00:34:56,839 --> 00:35:01,190
company and that also provides search

00:34:59,269 --> 00:35:04,279
engine services that let go that

00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:07,460
probably it's more known to some of you

00:35:04,279 --> 00:35:10,789
you also have massive immune at most you

00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:15,049
have you know protein milk and the Tres

00:35:10,789 --> 00:35:17,450
rates the list is really big but we so

00:35:15,049 --> 00:35:18,980
we have certain alternatives and even

00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:20,989
some are non profit like from a soft

00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:22,880
again another French initiative that is

00:35:20,989 --> 00:35:24,829
nonprofit that tries to bring

00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,779
alternatives to Google but the issue is

00:35:24,829 --> 00:35:29,239
that there it's very difficult to change

00:35:26,779 --> 00:35:30,109
and it's very difficult to actually have

00:35:29,239 --> 00:35:33,019
a meaningful choice

00:35:30,109 --> 00:35:35,720
we're not presented by with actual

00:35:33,019 --> 00:35:38,359
choices for example they find that the

00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:40,970
Commission put into Google recently it's

00:35:38,359 --> 00:35:43,849
because Google was paying to get a

00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:49,099
chrome and search and Google searches

00:35:43,849 --> 00:35:52,039
their default and as exclusive means by

00:35:49,099 --> 00:35:54,470
default and so if you don't get a choice

00:35:52,039 --> 00:35:56,359
how can you actually change even if

00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:58,730
there are alternatives then the other

00:35:56,359 --> 00:36:01,309
thing is network effects I may decide

00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:04,069
like okay I want to you know get out of

00:36:01,309 --> 00:36:06,079
Facebook but maybe I didn't think that

00:36:04,069 --> 00:36:08,029
Instagram also be understood to Facebook

00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:09,890
I did maybe think that was supposed to

00:36:08,029 --> 00:36:11,960
feelings to Facebook I maybe didn't

00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:13,970
think that in order to access I don't

00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:16,220
know Airbnb I'm subscribed with my

00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:18,170
Facebook account and so it's really

00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:20,540
difficult and then have been very clever

00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:22,940
to make you be very dependent

00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:25,400
on their services from many different

00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:27,080
angles for you not to be able to be like

00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:29,630
with a click and I want to disappear

00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:32,000
from you so you can't so we need to work

00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:33,950
more to ensure that the environment is

00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,440
right not only to have alternatives but

00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:39,230
actually to be able to switch to trucks

00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:40,130
we go on another very concrete example

00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:43,130
that I think the gdpr

00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:46,640
has provided by a benefit is beta

00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:48,560
portability which is great the thing is

00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:50,900
that well the right is basically that

00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:52,160
you can take your data from a service

00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:54,380
that you're using and take it somewhere

00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:57,800
else the issues like how are you gonna

00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:59,030
take that no and I think Chris yeah I

00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,740
would like you to talk more about

00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:03,050
interpretability because we were

00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:05,000
discussing this but you know and I think

00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:06,410
this is key you know like not only to

00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,410
have the rights to take your data

00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:11,540
elsewhere but for example can I wouldn't

00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:13,850
it be great if I decided for example for

00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:15,650
you signal and send your message then

00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:17,270
you can receive my single message in

00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:18,830
your whatsapp if that's your choice

00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:22,130
wouldn't it be great that you can use

00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:25,400
whatever app you want to get the same

00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:27,770
service like right now I can have a

00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:30,080
different phone and call you it would be

00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:30,830
great that we can have the same thing on

00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:34,100
the Internet

00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:35,930
thank you yeah thank you for the setup

00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:38,630
making it easy for me

00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:40,190
this is this is I think the principle of

00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:41,600
interoperability is one on which the

00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:44,540
internet has been built for its entire

00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:47,900
life and it's a very powerful and

00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:49,580
underappreciated concept one I and

00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:51,110
Mozilla have been working for a while to

00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:53,330
get in front of the attention of

00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:56,120
competition in antitrust authorities in

00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:57,560
a few places the I love the reference

00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:59,120
network affects mine and that's exactly

00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:02,410
right now Herick effects and data or I

00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:05,210
think two of the big challenges in

00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:07,670
realizing meaningful options and the

00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:09,350
idea of baking interoperability into

00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:11,930
both the technical and the legal

00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:13,550
frameworks of the internet helps us to

00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:17,540
get at those obviously there's a long

00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:20,420
way to go but if you have meaningful API

00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:22,130
application programming interfaces into

00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:24,200
these platforms they don't have to be

00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:25,730
open and in fact if you have open API so

00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:27,650
sensitive data in them that gets you in

00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:29,420
big trouble as we've seen over the past

00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:30,860
few months but I think that there are

00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:33,290
meaningful paths for to get

00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:35,750
interoperability and functional API

00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:40,550
that have the kinds of data and services

00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:42,920
that you need to help bootstrap

00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:45,440
alternatives to these systems by

00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:46,340
allowing you to have connectivity so to

00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,110
put this in a little bit more concrete

00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:49,790
responding to your point I do tend

00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:51,770
towards the academic sometimes if that

00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:54,200
hasn't been clear the first piece of

00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:56,060
lengthy writing I did about this I put

00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:57,950
out a hypothetical and the hypothetical

00:38:56,060 --> 00:39:00,200
is the Facebook whatsapp merger so in

00:38:57,950 --> 00:39:02,150
competition terms this is a vertical

00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:04,100
merger Facebook and whatsapp or services

00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:06,350
that are different and a lot of the

00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:08,810
competition conversation when it tries

00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:10,490
to be advanced is saying well what if

00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:12,440
Facebook and whatsapp eventually become

00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:13,790
horizontal competitors shouldn't we be

00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:16,790
looking at that in the merger review

00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:19,280
that's important it's possible for me

00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:20,540
the more important point here is imagine

00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,700
if Facebook and whatsapp started to

00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:24,410
merge their code bases or started to

00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:26,150
integrate through a suite of private

00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:28,700
api's that nobody else could access

00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:30,650
there's a whole bunch of cool value

00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:33,260
there that's not being unlocked

00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:35,210
unless whatever Facebook figures out to

00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:36,680
do with whatsapp to pair the

00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:38,420
functionalities of a social network and

00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:41,150
a messaging platform unless other

00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:43,100
messaging services like signal can find

00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:45,260
a way to negotiate for the same kinds of

00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:47,240
benefits and there's a lot of innovation

00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:49,310
we're not unlocking and that's

00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:51,050
fundamentally antithetical to the way

00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:53,450
the internet was built it was built to

00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:54,710
be open and interoperable with platforms

00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:56,690
and services built on top of them

00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:58,400
because by putting two services together

00:39:56,690 --> 00:40:00,320
like that that's how you unlock new

00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:02,270
ideas and new value that you could never

00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:04,250
have anticipated just looking at the

00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:06,290
services by themselves so I really do

00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:08,570
hope to see interoperability come into

00:40:06,290 --> 00:40:10,250
these conversations more I'm glad to see

00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:12,620
data portability starting to become a

00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:14,180
big piece of this I think that gdpr was

00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:15,830
a big variable in that and an

00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:17,420
implementation on the gdpr

00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:19,490
has led to efforts like the data

00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:21,020
transfer project which gets the big

00:40:19,490 --> 00:40:22,970
platforms together to talk about how

00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:25,700
they can make effective data portability

00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:27,170
reality I think that's a great start the

00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:29,960
question of what do you port the data to

00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:32,390
remains open but but the secret sauce

00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:34,400
here is that the same kinds of data and

00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:36,950
functionality that you need to make data

00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:38,540
portability real almost the same are

00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:40,970
also capable of supporting effective

00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:42,290
interoperability so I can sort of see

00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:44,180
the light at the end of the tunnel even

00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:46,470
though we still have a ways to go but I

00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:47,760
know that I said we're gonna go over

00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:50,310
and I hope everyone's okay with that if

00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:51,510
you're not raise your hands and we skip

00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:54,570
to the questions but I have one last

00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:57,420
question before we could known through

00:40:54,570 --> 00:41:01,050
his four hands before we open it up to

00:40:57,420 --> 00:41:03,060
the audience which I think the Facebook

00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:05,550
what's a hypothetical that you present

00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:07,650
is a good prompt for that um which is do

00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:09,810
you think and this for both of you do

00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:13,290
you think existing competition law in

00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:15,119
the EU in the u.s. is fit for purpose in

00:41:13,290 --> 00:41:16,910
dealing with these companies with these

00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:21,210
new forms of business and new forms of

00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:22,800
competition I suppose so I would

00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:25,349
highlight what I've said in the

00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:27,720
beginning that basically currently it's

00:41:25,349 --> 00:41:29,849
been a bit slow um it takes a lot of

00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:32,609
time and then we see that technology

00:41:29,849 --> 00:41:34,349
goes faster and the second thing is that

00:41:32,609 --> 00:41:36,840
data protection and privacy implications

00:41:34,349 --> 00:41:38,310
are not appropriately being taken into

00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:40,170
account and I'm always talking about the

00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:42,450
EU angle because I'm not I'm not gonna

00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:46,590
pretend I'm an expert on US law and I'd

00:41:42,450 --> 00:41:51,000
love not only that Cyprus or any other

00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:53,820
kind of no really um for example that

00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,830
you had to actually assess the Facebook

00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:58,500
and West half murder and they actually

00:41:55,830 --> 00:42:00,869
considered privacy but they didn't they

00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:02,369
actually were happy just with Facebook

00:42:00,869 --> 00:42:05,040
telling them that no we're gonna not

00:42:02,369 --> 00:42:07,260
gonna share the data between Facebook

00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:10,230
and whatsapp and guess what Facebook and

00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:12,780
whatsapp did and so that lets afterwards

00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:17,400
to another fine but you know the damage

00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:20,070
is already done so we see really a needs

00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:22,320
to to put more data protection and

00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:25,440
privacy implications there and as I said

00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:27,060
every slowly entering into these into

00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:29,220
this topic remember previous

00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:31,020
international has recently responded to

00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:33,510
the European Commission's consultation

00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:36,420
on this I also think you should look at

00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:38,099
what the European consumer Association

00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:40,980
baiyoke is doing they actually have

00:42:38,099 --> 00:42:43,680
achieved competition officers so they're

00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:45,720
really doing great work to actually

00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:48,869
update the competition rules of the

00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:51,150
digital era that's be a you see yeah

00:42:48,869 --> 00:42:52,500
anybody wants to look at I was actually

00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:53,880
going to give Baker shout out as well

00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,480
because they did a fantastic job with

00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:56,730
their calm

00:42:54,480 --> 00:43:00,329
in the recent European competition a

00:42:56,730 --> 00:43:02,609
digital competition review they they

00:43:00,329 --> 00:43:05,220
talk about a vicious cycle in the

00:43:02,609 --> 00:43:08,970
competition space and and I think that

00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:10,680
competition law is in theory fit for

00:43:08,970 --> 00:43:12,329
purpose here the challenges of lengthy

00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:15,000
enforcement the Merion reference to is

00:43:12,329 --> 00:43:16,589
very very real a multiple year cycle for

00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,630
enforcement means whatever competitor

00:43:16,589 --> 00:43:19,980
was trying to survive is dead already

00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:22,020
and the realities of the Internet

00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:23,609
economy but I do think that there's a

00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:25,920
lot more competition law than just the

00:43:23,609 --> 00:43:28,230
big investigations and so you have that

00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:30,390
that specter and the reality of an

00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:32,430
infective of enforcer with the ability

00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:34,770
to do incredibly punitive things not

00:43:32,430 --> 00:43:36,210
just large fines but also breaking up

00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:38,880
companies and other structural changes

00:43:36,210 --> 00:43:39,960
that's the backdrop and building up to

00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,599
that you have a number of different

00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:44,280
investigations and and pressures of both

00:43:42,599 --> 00:43:46,589
soft and hard power different forms that

00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:49,619
I think that we have the pieces that we

00:43:46,589 --> 00:43:51,839
need it is harder in the u.s. there are

00:43:49,619 --> 00:43:53,430
precedents and and substantial

00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:55,260
precedents and understandings and

00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:57,150
theories that we need to change and

00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:59,250
evolve and overcome but I think that we

00:43:57,150 --> 00:44:00,930
can get there with competition law

00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:03,390
without even necessarily new statute

00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:06,569
even in the US that's encouraging um

00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:08,130
that not thank you both and now as you

00:44:06,569 --> 00:44:10,980
there's somebody with a mic back there

00:44:08,130 --> 00:44:12,630
so if anybody wants to raise their hands

00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:19,490
and ask about any of these things we've

00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:19,490
been talking about I'm coming

00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:25,380
this is for Maria thank you very much to

00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:27,240
you and dad really for all of the work

00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:34,950
that you've done around GDP art and many

00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:37,079
other areas um

00:44:34,950 --> 00:44:40,020
you spoke about the adverts that you

00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:41,430
yourself have been shown stepping away

00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:45,390
from the big picture issues of

00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:47,609
regulation and large companies in terms

00:44:45,390 --> 00:44:51,329
of what individual users can do on their

00:44:47,609 --> 00:44:53,849
own machines to increase their control

00:44:51,329 --> 00:44:55,619
over their own views of the internet

00:44:53,849 --> 00:44:57,300
there's actually quite a lot that one

00:44:55,619 --> 00:45:00,660
can do and there are many free software

00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:02,880
applications including many Firefox

00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:08,869
plugins and things like this that people

00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:12,660
had installed within the Adri network is

00:45:08,869 --> 00:45:15,690
there kind of a push internally to try

00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:18,000
to move the organisations that are part

00:45:15,690 --> 00:45:19,890
of that network over to more ethical

00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:23,300
alternatives so away from things like

00:45:19,890 --> 00:45:26,490
Google Drive and towards frame is soft

00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:30,390
you know away from what's happened

00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:32,099
towards signal etc like our is that

00:45:30,390 --> 00:45:38,130
community kind of eating its own dog

00:45:32,099 --> 00:45:40,380
food to use the vernacular yeah

00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:42,119
absolutely we have been thinking about

00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:44,609
that and actually we have a project to

00:45:42,119 --> 00:45:46,770
have ethical web designing because of

00:45:44,609 --> 00:45:48,810
course it's important to advocate for

00:45:46,770 --> 00:45:50,940
something but what it's also important

00:45:48,810 --> 00:45:54,839
is to walk the talk right it would be a

00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:56,430
bit weird for Adria to say like you know

00:45:54,839 --> 00:45:58,020
there's a lot of online manipulation and

00:45:56,430 --> 00:46:00,510
we using the same tools that leads to

00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:03,540
online manipulation as of course we use

00:46:00,510 --> 00:46:06,270
certain social media like Facebook are

00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:08,369
also Twitter to reach to people and

00:46:06,270 --> 00:46:10,440
because yeah there's some alternatives

00:46:08,369 --> 00:46:12,510
but not that many people are there so

00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:15,420
we're trying to reach new publics but we

00:46:12,510 --> 00:46:17,250
are have been thinking about how to Lou

00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:18,960
for example in do you go to address

00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:21,420
website you would not see any trackers

00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:24,750
and we have updated also our privacy

00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:26,369
policy to explain what exactly happens

00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:27,750
when you share something with a tree

00:46:26,369 --> 00:46:29,369
what happens if you're subscribed to our

00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:31,050
newsletter what happens if you apply for

00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:32,370
a job at a tree

00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:34,710
how long do we keep the data etc

00:46:32,370 --> 00:46:36,540
etcetera so indeed we have that and

00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:38,760
we're helping some of our members to

00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:40,200
actually do the same and so we have a

00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:42,570
project at the moment that we haven't

00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:45,630
not launched the yetze called ethical I

00:46:42,570 --> 00:46:48,090
work design - how can we have a web that

00:46:45,630 --> 00:46:49,680
it's ethical but not in the ethics

00:46:48,090 --> 00:46:52,710
washing that we're seeing at the moment

00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:56,700
like a real you know responsible way to

00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:59,220
have work which is just going to the

00:46:56,700 --> 00:47:01,590
Adri website some guidance to the sort

00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:03,930
of tools he was talking about yeah but

00:47:01,590 --> 00:47:05,490
we have not published that yet but we I

00:47:03,930 --> 00:47:07,740
mean you can go to our privacy policy

00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:09,780
and see what we use and there are some

00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:11,940
two members of a jury that actually have

00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:13,740
done even a Data Protection guide and

00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:16,380
also a user's guide those are private

00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:18,960
international access now they have shown

00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:20,460
how for example axes now have shown how

00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:24,840
they have gone through the process

00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:26,160
internally and also we all of our

00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:28,830
members have gone through the process of

00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:31,470
compliant with daily PR as well and so

00:47:28,830 --> 00:47:33,600
there has been several articles in in

00:47:31,470 --> 00:47:35,810
that regards and if you're interested to

00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:38,820
know more go to as you those org and

00:47:35,810 --> 00:47:40,380
yeah that's the project of ethical web

00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:44,310
design is not out yet

00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:50,380
where is still working on it anyway

00:47:44,310 --> 00:47:52,699
Oh Martin

00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:56,599
that's Martin he works at the economist

00:47:52,699 --> 00:48:00,829
everyone should buy a subscription not

00:47:56,599 --> 00:48:04,759
not talking to do any pronto this is one

00:48:00,829 --> 00:48:07,969
for Chris I love Firefox and I've been a

00:48:04,759 --> 00:48:10,789
user for many years thank you but I I

00:48:07,969 --> 00:48:12,709
mean I I have some internal debate in

00:48:10,789 --> 00:48:15,049
some struggle with some of the decisions

00:48:12,709 --> 00:48:17,569
that were made lately like for example

00:48:15,049 --> 00:48:19,399
with the looking-glass add-on and with

00:48:17,569 --> 00:48:21,319
the pocket integration and there has

00:48:19,399 --> 00:48:24,949
been some people criticizing all of this

00:48:21,319 --> 00:48:27,919
and I don't know just kind of implying

00:48:24,949 --> 00:48:30,439
them till I strain a bit away from the

00:48:27,919 --> 00:48:32,109
open source into trying to find new ways

00:48:30,439 --> 00:48:35,449
I mean it's Leddy to find new ways for

00:48:32,109 --> 00:48:38,179
new business models but this is still

00:48:35,449 --> 00:48:41,359
frame this kind of limit between people

00:48:38,179 --> 00:48:42,979
that are activists and that know about

00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:46,880
all these privacy rights and then and

00:48:42,979 --> 00:48:49,369
also there is changing constantly and no

00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:53,689
in some cases you would say that is some

00:48:49,369 --> 00:48:58,189
way to you know get the privacy get data

00:48:53,689 --> 00:49:02,059
and I know is messing with the history

00:48:58,189 --> 00:49:03,589
and installing things without permission

00:49:02,059 --> 00:49:05,119
and things like that so what do you

00:49:03,589 --> 00:49:07,069
think about these kind of things I'm

00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:10,009
sure there was a heavy internal debate

00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:11,569
about that yeah I mean we have a lot of

00:49:10,009 --> 00:49:14,179
internal debate when we do make changes

00:49:11,569 --> 00:49:15,259
like that so there's probably a category

00:49:14,179 --> 00:49:17,239
of things that fits under that umbrella

00:49:15,259 --> 00:49:19,279
so I won't try to address each of them

00:49:17,239 --> 00:49:20,659
but I will say that we try to be

00:49:19,279 --> 00:49:23,179
transparent about everything that we do

00:49:20,659 --> 00:49:25,039
in this sense I will acknowledge that we

00:49:23,179 --> 00:49:26,419
have made mistakes in the past and if I

00:49:25,039 --> 00:49:27,439
weren't gonna say that wouldn't be

00:49:26,419 --> 00:49:29,239
honest everyone makes mistakes

00:49:27,439 --> 00:49:32,239
especially when you try to do

00:49:29,239 --> 00:49:33,919
interesting things I think that one of

00:49:32,239 --> 00:49:34,969
the one of the observations I've seen

00:49:33,919 --> 00:49:37,189
I've been a Mozilla for a little over

00:49:34,969 --> 00:49:39,439
five years now we went from an

00:49:37,189 --> 00:49:42,559
organization our roots that really

00:49:39,439 --> 00:49:44,959
didn't use data like we tried to avoid

00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:47,659
getting data we had a long time

00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:50,269
understanding and tracking our own user

00:49:47,659 --> 00:49:51,709
base and we have been evolving over the

00:49:50,269 --> 00:49:53,929
past few years and trying to position

00:49:51,709 --> 00:49:56,630
ourselves as an organization that uses

00:49:53,929 --> 00:49:58,849
data right and does it in a way that

00:49:56,630 --> 00:50:00,919
respects users keeps users at the center

00:49:58,849 --> 00:50:02,490
and respects the fundamental principles

00:50:00,919 --> 00:50:03,990
of purpose limitation and

00:50:02,490 --> 00:50:05,700
so forth that the rest of the industry

00:50:03,990 --> 00:50:06,450
is still catching up on um and I think

00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:07,680
that's the right place for them is a

00:50:06,450 --> 00:50:10,590
little to be I think we should be at a

00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:12,119
place where we know how to understand

00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:13,800
our users with them understanding our

00:50:12,119 --> 00:50:15,119
understanding right and I think that

00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:17,580
that's the right way for us to have an

00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:20,700
impact on the ecosystem not to stay in a

00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:22,920
place of not using data and staying on

00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:24,630
the outside so um and I'm sure that in

00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:27,000
the years to come we will make more

00:50:24,630 --> 00:50:28,770
mistakes because I'm not gonna pretend

00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,630
that we're perfect than anybody else is

00:50:28,770 --> 00:50:31,950
but I will say that we want to be open

00:50:30,630 --> 00:50:33,810
we want to be transparent we want to

00:50:31,950 --> 00:50:35,460
hear from our users whenever there's

00:50:33,810 --> 00:50:36,810
anything that they're uncomfortable with

00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:38,760
or unhappy with and hopefully there are

00:50:36,810 --> 00:50:40,980
places along the way as we start to roll

00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:42,810
out experiments and trials and so forth

00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:45,360
because we try to roll these things out

00:50:42,810 --> 00:50:47,190
in nightly and and be very social and

00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:48,360
sociable and run experiments and talk

00:50:47,190 --> 00:50:50,190
about the data that we learn from those

00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:51,630
experiments and so here along the way

00:50:50,190 --> 00:50:53,220
certainly before things make it out into

00:50:51,630 --> 00:50:55,230
production and into a broader user base

00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:56,700
one the community around us including

00:50:55,230 --> 00:50:58,590
both the privacy communities the

00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:59,700
open-source communities and others when

00:50:58,590 --> 00:51:01,830
they have concerns with what we're

00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:05,210
working on but I think we have time for

00:51:01,830 --> 00:51:05,210
one final question

00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:17,730
hi this is a question about regulation

00:51:15,510 --> 00:51:20,430
kind of a two-parter I guess the first

00:51:17,730 --> 00:51:21,930
is GDP our has the provision about being

00:51:20,430 --> 00:51:24,900
the right to forgot right to be

00:51:21,930 --> 00:51:26,160
forgotten and I think that's a that's a

00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:30,060
good right

00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:32,400
it protects users on the other hand we

00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:35,510
have technologies such as blockchain and

00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:39,060
on the blockchain nothing is forgotten

00:51:35,510 --> 00:51:41,790
so how do we deal with conflicts like

00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:44,040
that is is blockchain fundamentally

00:51:41,790 --> 00:51:46,860
flawed as a technology or to GDP are

00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:49,260
overreach and then the second part is

00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:53,390
you mentioned the EU copyright directive

00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:57,390
or aka link tax and I'm curious when you

00:51:53,390 --> 00:52:01,020
policy is made like this why is such

00:51:57,390 --> 00:52:03,990
policy focused on protecting some subset

00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:07,140
of businesses rather than trying to

00:52:03,990 --> 00:52:09,690
protect the most vulnerable or rather

00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:11,640
why not prioritize trying to protect the

00:52:09,690 --> 00:52:15,950
most vulnerable before they try to

00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:18,360
protect businesses do you stick the

00:52:15,950 --> 00:52:21,720
locks in that get one already sure but I

00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:23,580
can take either of them and well I can

00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:25,220
start maybe with the with the last

00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:29,970
question with the most were little one

00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:33,870
once yeah indeed I mean I agree with you

00:52:29,970 --> 00:52:35,790
the focus should be on really okay let

00:52:33,870 --> 00:52:38,100
me start if there's a public policy

00:52:35,790 --> 00:52:40,650
objective that a government wants to

00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:43,350
reach or the Parliament or the European

00:52:40,650 --> 00:52:45,420
Union as a whole it's important to do it

00:52:43,350 --> 00:52:49,350
in a way that you actually achieved your

00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:51,900
purpose and and you analyze unintended

00:52:49,350 --> 00:52:54,480
consequences so I want to believe that

00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:57,230
the European Commission and the European

00:52:54,480 --> 00:53:00,870
Parliament when they actually adopted a

00:52:57,230 --> 00:53:02,700
version of the EU copyright directive

00:53:00,870 --> 00:53:06,120
that is currently a steal and the

00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:08,490
discussion they thought this is a fight

00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:10,470
against Google and Facebook they

00:53:08,490 --> 00:53:12,150
actually you know you can read that in

00:53:10,470 --> 00:53:15,150
the press this is a fight against the

00:53:12,150 --> 00:53:17,610
big tech in reality they didn't think

00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:19,800
that or I want to believe that they

00:53:17,610 --> 00:53:22,230
didn't think that the opposite was true

00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:23,710
that they actually were helping them of

00:53:22,230 --> 00:53:25,300
course now

00:53:23,710 --> 00:53:28,180
and Google and Facebook are doing this

00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:30,190
voluntarily and probably they don't want

00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:31,960
this to be compulsory but other than

00:53:30,190 --> 00:53:33,700
that they have a relative technology and

00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:36,069
the key question is that are we really

00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:37,599
solving the issues that we're that

00:53:36,069 --> 00:53:42,760
they're trying to be solved

00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:46,270
let's take I don't know online abuse if

00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:49,300
a Content let's say a Facebook post is

00:53:46,270 --> 00:53:50,950
deleted me as a victim I you know my

00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:53,260
problem doesn't disappear because you

00:53:50,950 --> 00:53:56,230
know the the post was raised the person

00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:58,809
behind the post actually still there and

00:53:56,230 --> 00:54:00,970
are there being any investigations or

00:53:58,809 --> 00:54:03,040
prosecutions if actually that the person

00:54:00,970 --> 00:54:04,599
in question is committing a crime

00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:07,660
we actually have asked those questions

00:54:04,599 --> 00:54:10,390
via any piece and the answer is that

00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:12,609
both neither the Commission nor Europol

00:54:10,390 --> 00:54:14,559
are actually having a statistics on how

00:54:12,609 --> 00:54:17,950
many investigations or prosecutions are

00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:20,619
happening and following deletions of

00:54:17,950 --> 00:54:23,410
posts online so the focus in the

00:54:20,619 --> 00:54:25,690
European Union is how many posts are

00:54:23,410 --> 00:54:27,309
being deleted and how often so that's

00:54:25,690 --> 00:54:29,020
why with the terrorism regulation you

00:54:27,309 --> 00:54:31,660
see they one-hour delay and this is

00:54:29,020 --> 00:54:33,670
great and those thought of are we really

00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:35,440
addressing the issue and we're really

00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:37,750
protecting the most vulnerable ones or I

00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:39,940
would just you know reinforcing the same

00:54:37,750 --> 00:54:43,420
situation and even worsening it and I

00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:45,460
think and that's where the European is

00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:49,150
not being that successful as with the

00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:50,260
GDP are and still the GDP are going back

00:54:49,150 --> 00:54:51,520
to your first question I'm not a

00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:53,619
technical person so I don't want to

00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:56,290
enter into blockchain and stuff like

00:54:53,619 --> 00:54:57,099
that but their only thing I can say is

00:54:56,290 --> 00:55:01,859
that the DBPR

00:54:57,099 --> 00:55:04,720
and was drafted from a technological

00:55:01,859 --> 00:55:06,609
analogically neutral perspective so it

00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:09,849
was not thinking out of a particular

00:55:06,609 --> 00:55:15,520
technology and the DD pris yeah it's not

00:55:09,849 --> 00:55:18,099
perfect but at the same time the right

00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:21,309
to be forgotten for example it's not

00:55:18,099 --> 00:55:23,650
something new and perhaps a term that

00:55:21,309 --> 00:55:26,470
has been now put into the gdpr it's more

00:55:23,650 --> 00:55:27,360
of a novelty but the issue I would say

00:55:26,470 --> 00:55:29,010
is they

00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:31,170
datian and how this can be put into

00:55:29,010 --> 00:55:33,240
practice and I would not be too scared

00:55:31,170 --> 00:55:35,400
about it and the DBPR has just been

00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:36,900
entering divorce and now it's time to

00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:38,850
gather evidence if there's you know

00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:41,160
evidence that this doesn't work in

00:55:38,850 --> 00:55:42,900
doctrine for example then this feedback

00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:45,270
should be put into the policy making

00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:48,870
process and perhaps in the future when

00:55:45,270 --> 00:55:51,480
the DBPR would be reviewed this can be

00:55:48,870 --> 00:55:52,650
addressed yeah I think that to riff on

00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:54,930
that and then I'll get into the the

00:55:52,650 --> 00:55:56,280
copyright question I referenced this

00:55:54,930 --> 00:55:57,690
earlier with blockchain how it's built

00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:59,730
as an infrastructure to not be able to

00:55:57,690 --> 00:56:00,930
take content out of it I I think that

00:55:59,730 --> 00:56:03,750
the right to be forgotten

00:56:00,930 --> 00:56:05,340
has has interpretations and

00:56:03,750 --> 00:56:07,770
implementations and applications yet to

00:56:05,340 --> 00:56:10,860
be discovered over the years to come but

00:56:07,770 --> 00:56:13,320
we're already seen questions about its

00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:15,270
its precise manner of implementation in

00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:17,400
the countries of search engines and does

00:56:15,270 --> 00:56:19,080
delinking count or does it need to be

00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:20,940
somehow removed more fundamentally than

00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:22,530
that and I'm not gonna presume that I

00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:23,670
know the answers to these questions and

00:56:22,530 --> 00:56:24,720
certainly not and how they get into the

00:56:23,670 --> 00:56:25,800
blockchain world as well but I'm glad

00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:27,300
that we're asking them I'm glad that

00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:28,800
we're thinking about them and how to

00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:31,080
realize very important fundamental

00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:32,670
principles and rights like that through

00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:34,110
the lens of technology design I think

00:56:32,670 --> 00:56:35,780
that's a really really important

00:56:34,110 --> 00:56:38,670
question for us all to be thinking about

00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:40,290
getting into copyright look the the

00:56:38,670 --> 00:56:41,520
parliaments outcome of the copyright

00:56:40,290 --> 00:56:43,590
reform process was a deep deep

00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:45,480
disappointment to me to Mozilla to

00:56:43,590 --> 00:56:48,390
almost everyone on our side of this

00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:50,250
conversation and in particular the way

00:56:48,390 --> 00:56:51,630
that article 13 is shaping them it's not

00:56:50,250 --> 00:56:53,370
through trial log yet it's not through

00:56:51,630 --> 00:56:55,020
nation-state implementation that there

00:56:53,370 --> 00:56:56,280
will be court challenges I'm sure I'm

00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:59,340
sure a jury will be involved in those

00:56:56,280 --> 00:57:00,870
which I'm happy to see let's hope that

00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:04,110
something changes because the idea of

00:57:00,870 --> 00:57:05,990
baking into law upload filters over

00:57:04,110 --> 00:57:08,520
technology is the antithesis of

00:57:05,990 --> 00:57:10,440
empowering users to control the Internet

00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:13,260
of the future that we should be pushing

00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:14,670
for and we're already seeing that coming

00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:16,020
into the terrorists content directive

00:57:14,670 --> 00:57:18,030
we're gonna see it come up even more and

00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:19,800
more and I just I'm fundamentally

00:57:18,030 --> 00:57:22,880
uncomfortable with a future internet

00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:25,820
that has private networks and services

00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:28,140
implementing upload filters to realize

00:57:25,820 --> 00:57:30,810
government objectives that were indeed

00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:32,760
pushed by specific powerful niche

00:57:30,810 --> 00:57:35,370
political audiences if there's so many

00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:37,380
different ways in which that ecosystem

00:57:35,370 --> 00:57:39,630
is broken but let's hope that we can

00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:40,680
avoid that future outcome well so I just

00:57:39,630 --> 00:57:42,300
like to add on this

00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:45,079
framing of that question that it's I

00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:47,130
think it is important to remember that

00:57:45,079 --> 00:57:49,109
business of businesses are not

00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:51,900
necessarily the problem I mean of course

00:57:49,109 --> 00:57:53,280
it is a worry when a handful of

00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:55,800
businesses a handful of private

00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:58,380
companies assume tremendous amounts

00:57:55,800 --> 00:58:01,109
power are police saying or enforcing or

00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:02,520
doing basically everything but Binod we

00:58:01,109 --> 00:58:04,819
live in liberal Western democracies

00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:07,650
based on free-market capitalism and

00:58:04,819 --> 00:58:10,290
businesses are what keep us in work that

00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:11,880
would bring us here they know they're

00:58:10,290 --> 00:58:13,230
not the enemy anyway sorry with that

00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:16,260
impassioned plea that I haven't

00:58:13,230 --> 00:58:17,819
contractually obliged to make thank you

00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:19,650
all very much you've sat here for fifty

00:58:17,819 --> 00:58:22,200
eight minutes listening to us chatter

00:58:19,650 --> 00:58:25,910
about regulation it's probably some sort

00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:28,560
of new record coming along

00:58:25,910 --> 00:58:31,909
[Music]

00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:31,909
[Applause]

00:58:36,130 --> 00:58:41,940
