Title: Let's fight for our Right to Repair!
Publication date: 2021-03-11
Playlist: Mozilla Festival 2021
Description: 
	The movement for Right to repair is growing globally, and it’s starting to get traction with policy makers. Yet, we’re still far from securing a universal Right to repair. And increasingly we need to make the case for removing software barriers set by manufactures, preventing us from repairing and reusing products. In the session we’ll present the European Right to Repair campaign, and work with participants on our next challenges. Participants will first contribute their priorities for the campaign to consider. Then we’ll work in small groups to prototype solutions to key issues we face: - How best to collaboratively document and tackle the mounting software barriers to our right to repair? - How can individuals and organisations in the MozFest community multiply the reach and impact of the campaign? The session is just the beginning, and we’ll encourage participants to get involved in ongoing campaign activities

into the campaign uh it's

00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:41,039
repair.eu and

00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:43,759
we are we've been active

00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:45,360
for uh about a year and a half

00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,080
officially as a campaign

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,759
and it all starts with this with a few

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,880
people that are

00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:55,039
really passionate about realizing

00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:58,319
helping everyone else realize that

00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:59,759
to repair unfortunately is become almost

00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:03,440
a rebellion

00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:05,280
and we want this to change and we want

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:09,440
everyone to have the right

00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:12,720
to repair all the products that we owned

00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:16,639
we are currently a coalition of

00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:19,199
just over 40 members uh active in 15

00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:22,319
european countries including

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:25,440
all kinds of repairs community repairs

00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:29,199
professional repairs sustainability

00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:33,039
activists and community organizations

00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:36,080
and we are

00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:39,759
campaigning for bringing change

00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,639
uh to repair regulations at european

00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,199
level

00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,560
but also in each of the individual

00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:48,880
european countries

00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,880
uh so not just within the eu

00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,639
and why do we do this we do this because

00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,919
we believe

00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:59,680
right now europe has a unique

00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:00,560
opportunity to bring this change and

00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,759
inspire

00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,280
changing legislation everywhere else as

00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,319
well

00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:11,520
so that products can

00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,639
be made in a way that can last longer be

00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,479
more easily

00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:20,240
and affordably repaired preventing waste

00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:21,599
and giving fairer access to

00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,440
products for people that wouldn't

00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:27,199
necessarily be able to afford

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,199
buying again when something breaks

00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:33,520
the pillars of

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:35,680
our campaign work are that we want

00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,880
three things we want products to be

00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,360
built

00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,560
with good design and they should be

00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,039
designed to last

00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,160
and repair whenever we need them to be

00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,879
repaired

00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,199
everyone needs fair access to things

00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,720
like

00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:54,000
spare parts and repair manual

00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:56,639
and ideally this

00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,039
should include all the schematics that

00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,680
will help you also repair a component

00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,000
level

00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,440
something that no regulation anywhere in

00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,720
the world at this moment

00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:09,199
is even contemplating

00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,919
and i'll come back to that and also we

00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,360
want

00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:15,759
people consumers as people first and

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,919
consumer second to be

00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,800
informed when they make a purchasing

00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,680
decision

00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,840
and that's why we think that

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,680
manufacturers need to come very clean

00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,520
and transparent about the amount of

00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:32,240
support that they provide

00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:35,120
to everyone before you buy a product

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,320
and i'm not going to go into too much

00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,360
more detail but

00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,440
there's plenty happening at european

00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,479
level there's been a so-called circular

00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,959
economy action

00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:47,760
plan presented last year there's a lot

00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:51,040
of discussions on so-called eco-design

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,760
regulations that and and then there is a

00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,560
desire

00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,950
to bring a european-wide reparability

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,120
index

00:08:55,950 --> 00:09:00,640
[Music]

00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:03,680
what what really matters is that

00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:06,160
while there's been a lot of talk

00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,160
about

00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,720
how europe now has the right to repair

00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,800
there's been a lot of

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,120
positive press that the european

00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:18,640
commission has received in the last

00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,040
few days um because as of the 1st of

00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,399
march

00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:25,440
there's indeed been plenty

00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:28,480
of new regulations for the first time

00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:31,279
bringing access to spare parts

00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,200
for a certain amount of time and repair

00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:36,560
information and products built

00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:38,800
in a way that they can be more easily

00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41,200
repaired

00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,800
unfortunately this is just the very

00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,839
first small step

00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:48,959
that only concerns some appliances

00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:51,120
and it also only

00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,080
applies in terms of access to spare

00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,680
parts and

00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,160
repair information for vast parts of

00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,760
this

00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:02,800
only to professional repairs

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,000
and not to everyone and that's why we

00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,640
need to change this

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,600
particularly as it might affect future

00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,440
legislation

00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,360
for other types of products starting

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,480
with smartphones

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,120
but i don't want to say too much about

00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,800
this

00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:22,560
and i'll hand over

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:26,240
uh to frank who is going to

00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:28,720
take us straight to our mirror board

00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,160
where everyone can introduce themselves

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,160
and that's right so this

00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,560
this is meant to be a workshop so

00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:37,839
there's no no passive sitting and

00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,959
um just listening so i'll post a link to

00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,920
a mirror board

00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,399
uh in the chat um that should take you

00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,160
straight

00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:49,519
to the section for introductions um

00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:52,240
fill in a speech bubble

00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:54,160
with your introductions and there's some

00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,680
some instructions there as well

00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,040
include whatever you want to include on

00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,959
there include what you want to get out

00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,519
of the session as well

00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:04,800
once you've done that um scroll to the

00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:08,320
right and you'll find a quiz

00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:11,279
um and you can see um

00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,079
you know grab a ball and try to solve

00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,640
the quiz and

00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:15,360
we'll come back to that uh once

00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,480
everyone's

00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,200
uh done this uh i see there's a question

00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,800
about the

00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,279
mirrorboard billboard is not part of the

00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:29,839
recording um

00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:29,839
so it's just this this screen

00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,000
i guess and see lots of people are

00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,600
looking to learn more

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,519
and looking to support the movement

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,320
that's exactly what we want to

00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,360
to hear and and what we're expecting for

00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,839
people to

00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,839
to do as a result of this session

00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,240
right i can see there's one coder in

00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,680
there

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,440
we'll definitely draw in your skills

00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:44,639
later in the session as well

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:47,920
um with a specific question for that

00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:49,200
um i guess while while you're filling

00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:53,279
things out

00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:54,240
um i i want to share one a repair story

00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,560
already actually

00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,240
i think what do you think should we move

00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,639
to that well people are filling things

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,639
out or

00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,760
go for it definitely go for it right

00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:07,040
okay so because you mentioned software

00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,920
and

00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,279
i think i've i've got a tablet here

00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,639
which is a

00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:16,000
first generation uh samsung galaxy tab

00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:20,000
10.1 from

00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:23,040
2012. obviously that runs android 3.2

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,959
or used to run android 3.2

00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,560
and then that stopped being supported to

00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,079
the point where nothing was actually

00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:31,040
running out anymore

00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:32,240
um and so it's kind of what we touched

00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,040
upon in a previous session around

00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:38,560
built-in obsolescence uh software

00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:41,519
barriers and so on and so

00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,560
after a lot of research it's now running

00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,880
some sort of

00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,920
hybrid version of android 5 and android

00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:49,040
7.

00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:51,360
um but yeah basically running on open

00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:54,880
source software so he's kind of showing

00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,959
the what is possible to do

00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:59,680
if you have the knowledge and and if you

00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:03,279
do want to do the research and so on

00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:07,360
so we'll come back to that later i think

00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:10,020
someone has just joined so i will

00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,240
just repost the

00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:14,880
[Music]

00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,760
link to the mirror boards for your

00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:20,560
introductions

00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:20,560
and then uh for the quiz

00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,560
to see if the first person has voted

00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:28,480
which is excellent

00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:31,839
while you keep voting i'll tell another

00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:35,839
similar parallel story about repair

00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:39,120
i don't have the device next to me but i

00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:42,720
many years ago over 10 years ago

00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:46,160
i was using a strange kindle

00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,920
dx it was like a very oversized version

00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,480
of a kindle

00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,160
that never really took off it was

00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:55,760
theoretically to

00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:58,880
use for well reading large text but

00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,440
guess what the support for pdfs which

00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,839
was

00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,800
all the text that i wanted to read on it

00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:06,560
was

00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:08,399
terrible and amazon stopped supporting

00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:11,440
the software development of that

00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,240
device straight away citing that it

00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,720
wasn't

00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,680
powerful enough to get the new features

00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,240
that the new

00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,000
gener newer generation of smaller

00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:23,360
kindles would have

00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:26,720
but somehow someone magically

00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:29,279
extracted the full operating system

00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,560
from the newer generations and

00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:34,399
recompiled it

00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:37,600
so that it could be used or installed

00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:40,480
on this version of of the device

00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,279
and magically all of a sudden that same

00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,480
device

00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:48,480
was displaying pdfs much better

00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:51,360
darker more readable and i went from

00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:54,240
being about to give up on the device of

00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:56,399
actually making a lot more use of it and

00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,360
the manufacturer certainly wasn't

00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:00,560
helping

00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:03,600
so it shows that the product you own

00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:06,639
can actually do more than what you are

00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,399
told and much have can have a much much

00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,959
longer life

00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,240
so these were among the many

00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:14,800
inspirations that

00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:17,040
made me want to do more on on all of

00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,040
this

00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:24,560
see people are voting and there will be

00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:26,639
after the votes and there will be

00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,880
time for people to share their own

00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:31,120
stories

00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,320
yeah we'll do that in the breakout rooms

00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,680
i think shall we uh

00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,079
run through the the quiz also for the

00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,480
the

00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,839
youtube listeners if any and so the

00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,160
first question is

00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,759
over 200 million smartphones are sold in

00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:46,959
europe every year

00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:50,079
that's 6.7 sold every second

00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:51,839
but how long do they really last with

00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:53,360
the consumer i think someone made a fair

00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,199
point they never go away

00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,639
i think it depends how you look at that

00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,399
but um

00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,320
you know how long do they really lost on

00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:04,480
average with a consumer so it's two

00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:07,600
three or five years and

00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:09,520
still under under debate i think as i

00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,600
see cursor is moving around

00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,720
second question is in terms of

00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:15,919
smartphones

00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,760
how much waste does a 200 gram

00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:20,079
phone generate during production

00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,600
including all stages of mining and

00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:24,640
manufacture

00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:28,240
and it's between 23 kilograms

00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:30,640
47 kilograms or 86 kilograms

00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,320
people are gravitating towards the

00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:35,760
larger end of that

00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:38,000
um the third question is europe is the

00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,840
largest generator of electronic waste

00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,520
per person in the world

00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,440
how much do europeans generate on

00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:47,600
average per year and again

00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:51,039
7 13 or 16 kilograms you go do you wanna

00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:54,640
enlighten us with the answers yes

00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:56,960
so um well

00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,679
studies show that smartphones last on

00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,720
average

00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:02,160
three years which is two years less than

00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,280
what people would like

00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,720
them to last according to surveys

00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,640
extending the lifetime of all

00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:12,280
smartphones in the eu

00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:15,039
by just one year would save

00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:19,039
2.1 megatons

00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:21,280
of co2 per year by 2030

00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:22,400
which is the equivalent of taking over 1

00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,520
million cars

00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,520
of the roads

00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:33,360
second question unfortunately each

00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:37,120
smartphone generates 86 kilogram on

00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:39,679
so-called invisible waste which

00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,640
can include mining waste slug and other

00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:42,480
type of waste

00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,480
produced during the extraction of

00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:47,280
minerals and the manufacturing

00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,240
of the product so those of you that went

00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,679
for

00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:56,080
the worst option

00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:59,600
were indeed right and finally

00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:01,280
equally europeans on average produce 16

00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:04,720
kilograms

00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:07,840
of electrical waste every year

00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:09,919
and so europe ranked first worldwide

00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:12,080
in terms of electrical waste generation

00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:15,360
per capita

00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:20,799
and so those that were pessimists there

00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:22,559
were absolutely right and spot-on

00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:24,960
which is the majority of people for

00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:28,160
those of you on youtube unfortunately

00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:29,280
right so we we have shared our stories

00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,280
about repair

00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,480
and we're now going to break out into

00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,720
rooms

00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:37,039
and so there's one group that's going to

00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,080
stay in the main room

00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:39,520
and then there is a group that's going

00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,440
to go into breakout room so don't the

00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,240
breakout room is not recorded as far as

00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,480
i'm

00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,000
aware and i would encourage you to to

00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,240
switch on your cameras there

00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,320
uh for the interaction because the main

00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,960
room is recorded in live stream so that

00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,679
might be

00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,200
different there but yeah so i will post

00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:58,559
the link in the chat

00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,520
um where you can capture your repair

00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:02,320
stories or your

00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:04,080
repair frustrations and share them with

00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:07,200
with the breakout room and then

00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:11,039
um we'll come back um

00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:21,840
here to talk about that probably about

00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:21,840
five to ten minutes

00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,640
i think

00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,640
there might be some problem with the not

00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:56,960
working

00:20:50,640 --> 00:21:02,960
yeah um

00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:04,799
but not maybe not um

00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:08,480
sorry i thought i had set it up right

00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:08,480
i'll just click away

00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:19,919
apologies for the live fixing

00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,919
all right

00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:35,280
okay so the ones in here

00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:35,280
i think

00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,280
except for two people are meant to be in

00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,360
here so yeah please

00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,799
please tell us about your repair stories

00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:45,840
or fill them in on the

00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:45,840
mirror board or both

00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:51,600
does anyone have a great repair story to

00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:51,600
share or a frustration

00:21:55,120 --> 00:22:00,320
i think most of things get repaired on

00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,320
the west coast in the united states

00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,159
they're made available to nonprofits and

00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:06,720
youth who can't afford

00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:09,039
new equipment but there's always a

00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:12,400
performance issue

00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:14,799
it's it's not even a personal consumer

00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,799
idea

00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,720
with as much maker community as we have

00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:21,280
out here we're still not being able to

00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:25,280
refurbish the things that can

00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:30,400
tackle a contemporary experience

00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:30,400
of the web you know and apps

00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:34,480
okay thank you

00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:40,400
does anyone else have anything that they

00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:43,200
would like to share yeah hey

00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,240
i am i repair some nintendo switch

00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,200
controllers

00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,960
uh which was fine it relatively easy to

00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:52,080
do i picked up all the bits

00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:54,159
uh just off of uh off of ebay

00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,919
but i think what the frustration was for

00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:58,640
me was that the design was

00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:00,240
terrible because um as soon as you fold

00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:03,360
as soon as you clip the controllers back

00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,360
together and screw them back together

00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,840
oh

00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,760
i think we lost neil their mid-sentence

00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:23,840
i'm sure um mauro or martin did you want

00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,840
to uh did you have anything to share

00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:33,360
possibly not well um

00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:36,960
i i come from the easier

00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:42,240
end of things i used to work

00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:42,240
for charity um doing pc um

00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:50,480
reuse and recycling um and

00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:53,520
yeah repairing pcs is still pretty

00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,640
easy um unfortunately that's not where

00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:57,120
the world is anymore

00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:59,039
so um although having said that i did

00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:01,039
spend the morning being very frustrated

00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:05,760
with an old pc

00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:09,120
um but in terms of

00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,679
where thing things are now things break

00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,159
at school

00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:13,279
and i'm just having trouble with almost

00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:17,679
everything

00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:19,919
um because electro like

00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:21,440
am possibly not the right person for a

00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:23,840
lot of these things but

00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,720
surface mounts just make things really

00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,919
difficult

00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:31,760
um and things are not as modular as

00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:33,840
as they used to be so um

00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:35,120
makes yeah it's kind of more more

00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:38,320
integrated

00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:41,360
more uh more compact but yeah

00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:42,080
potentially less repairable yeah um at

00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:48,159
least for me

00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:48,159
i've got huge hands and no skill so

00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:52,720
but repairing things on the software

00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:53,840
side i'm really interested in but i'm

00:24:52,720 --> 00:25:01,840
also not particularly

00:24:53,840 --> 00:25:04,400
great out just a minute

00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,840
great thank you maro is there anything

00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,120
you would like to share

00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,039
interesting really because i'm coming

00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:11,679
from a journalistic background and

00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:13,120
not kind of a repair background but i'm

00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:15,440
thinking

00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:17,279
just thinking how kind of how it got

00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,720
lost within kind of a generation i don't

00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:21,039
know because i remember my

00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,559
like grandparents and parents like

00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:23,919
always fixing stuff they're always

00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:25,279
fixing stuff around the house and i

00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,880
don't think i've done that

00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:28,480
over the last 15 years and i'm just

00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:32,000
wondering what how that

00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:34,000
in one generation how that kind of gap

00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,360
went i don't know kind of i mean people

00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,480
still do it they stood it around but

00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,799
it's not as much and

00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:41,440
i'm just curious to know how that how it

00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:43,679
changed and how we can go back to

00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,679
to what it how it was when we was easy

00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:47,840
to fix things i'm just interested in

00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:47,840
that

00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,840
is that the planned obsolescence that

00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:57,840
we've grown up with

00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,919
yeah there is definitely some of that

00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:05,600
right and

00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:07,760
i mean yeah things are

00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,960
i think what we here at the repair cafe

00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,720
a lot is people have

00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,480
come with a toaster let's say and so i

00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,720
would like to repair this toaster

00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,720
and they try to ask around so oh you

00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,799
know how do we repair a toaster

00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,320
and the standard response is well just

00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:22,159
buy a cheap one from amazon

00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:25,840
and and it's like no that's not the

00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:25,840
point how to repair the toaster

00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:33,360
so before the pandemic

00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:35,120
in the northern california that small

00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,400
workshops would come up in our maker

00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,480
spaces where people

00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,520
would just do repair you know so there

00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,840
is a

00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:43,840
a small movement inside of our

00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:46,960
microculture to do that

00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:48,799
the best is um sewing clothes

00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,799
on the street corners for people that

00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:53,840
need their clothes repaired

00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:53,840
it's my favorite

00:26:54,480 --> 00:27:00,559
more analog yeah that's great

00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:02,880
i'm gonna send the message to close the

00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,880
room

00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,559
and bring everyone back in here thank

00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,799
you

00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:10,559
very much inside script we had a very

00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:12,000
nice script with timings and so on and

00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:14,240
we're not sticking to it at all so i'm

00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,760
just trying to

00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,840
yeah thank you thank you everyone for

00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:21,679
sharing those stories i think it's great

00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:22,480
and and i think hopefully the the next

00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:24,399
bit

00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,240
is is really where we want to focus

00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:28,399
which is you know basically what can we

00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,399
do

00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,840
um

00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,399
and i think that the repairing of

00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,399
clothes and sookie as you were saying i

00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:55,279
think it's such a powerful thing as well

00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:56,960
um in a previous session i think there

00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:59,520
were a few sessions around actually

00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:01,200
a visible repair of of certain clothing

00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:04,000
as a fashion statement i think it's a

00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,919
it's a really cool trend and even um

00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,200
i think there's uh north face who are

00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:10,799
picking up on it as well

00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,440
um with their um backpacks and codes and

00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:14,000
so on so

00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:16,000
yeah it's great rei i don't know if

00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,440
that's there's a european equivalent you

00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,440
can send things back and they'll stitch

00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,919
them back together for you and

00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,919
it's nice

00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,320
right i think we've got everyone back

00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:31,120
here um

00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,919
are there any particular highlights um

00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,320
from

00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:36,559
breakout room one that people want to

00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,559
share

00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:43,039
sorry you got any particular highlights

00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:46,559
from room one that

00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:50,960
you want to share and bring out oh yeah

00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:54,960
oh sorry or anyone else is fine

00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:57,440
glad god well i just wanted to share how

00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,320
i had like a 10 year old macbook and at

00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,840
some point

00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:03,919
um in in my classes i

00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,520
was supposed to use like the software

00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:08,320
but then i i couldn't

00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:10,080
run it on my computer so i wasn't able

00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,919
to work on that part and it was really

00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:16,159
frustrating because

00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:18,480
just because my operating systems was

00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:20,880
not the latest i couldn't install

00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,880
something

00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:29,000
i mentioned a similar issue where i had

00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:32,559
to

00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:35,279
re-phone because there was an issue with

00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:41,840
the hardware and software compatibility

00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:41,840
phone just kept randomly resetting

00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:48,640
okay um i think we go

00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:50,399
let's should we move to the next part

00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:55,840
which is the very exciting what can we

00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:55,840
do part

00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:03,279
a muting is helpful

00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:06,799
so um one

00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:07,200
one of the it's it's excellent to to get

00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:10,240
the

00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,880
the range of stories uh from everyone in

00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,000
the end

00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:17,200
they all tend to

00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:20,240
include either some thing that was

00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:23,039
built in a way that cannot be

00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:24,640
easily fixed or conveniently fixed or

00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:28,000
something where

00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:32,000
a piece of software is no longer kept

00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:34,960
up to date by the manufacturer and

00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
as a result you have to give up not at

00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:39,200
the time when you would

00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:43,600
have liked to move on but much sooner

00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:47,440
and this just absolutely has to stop

00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:51,440
and um what we are

00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:54,559
working on as a campaign is to

00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:57,279
help change this by bringing

00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:58,399
a lot more focus on particularly the

00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:01,600
software

00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:04,799
obsolescence part of the problem because

00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:07,840
this is not yet included in any

00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:11,120
regulation whatsoever and

00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:14,000
there is in fact

00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:15,120
only the requirements are that any

00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,960
software

00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:21,519
version which could be version 1.0

00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:23,519
of a product could continue to be

00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:26,559
available for

00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:27,360
a minimum number of years as part of

00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:30,880
this

00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:34,000
recently approved regulations well

00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:35,760
we need to change that and we need to

00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,120
raise a lot more awareness

00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:42,960
of it um there is a positive development

00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:45,279
which has happened in france which is

00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,559
some of you might have heard of it um in

00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:49,360
france

00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:51,919
manufacturers of five types of products

00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:55,760
including smartphones and laptops

00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:59,679
from 2021 are required to

00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:00,000
publish a score of reparability score

00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:02,559
which

00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
includes various criteria including the

00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:07,279
price of spare parts

00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:10,480
and the availability of software uh

00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:13,200
support and the availability of

00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:14,240
spare parts and the ease of disassembly

00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,360
and

00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:20,960
what we find interesting

00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:24,240
here is that because this data

00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:26,000
will start to have to make made to be

00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:29,360
made available

00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:32,320
people will be able potentially to learn

00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:33,200
from this data and use that data to push

00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:36,399
for

00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:40,720
repair um in other places not just

00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:44,559
in france and so

00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:48,399
we would like we'll do a second round uh

00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:52,000
of breakout rooms uh asking

00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:54,559
you to uh pick in your groups

00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,559
like a topic out of one of the four that

00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:59,200
we we put in there

00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:59,840
one is indeed on raising more awareness

00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:03,039
about

00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:04,399
uh software and how to to target

00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:06,880
manufacturers in

00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:09,039
creative ways so any ideas or thought

00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:11,519
about that would be amazing

00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:13,679
what can we learn from the data that's

00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:14,320
becoming available and how can we turn

00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:17,440
it into

00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,440
power for change

00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:23,279
and how can we make right to repair more

00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:26,320
mainstream than it is because

00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:30,320
trust me the policy making part of it

00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:33,519
is extremely slow and we have to

00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:36,159
make it in impossible to stop

00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:36,799
like already we know that 80 percent of

00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:39,279
people

00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:40,399
around the world want it but that

00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:43,519
doesn't seem to be

00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:45,360
enough to stop the lobbies that

00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:47,279
reduce the effectiveness of any

00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:51,279
legislative effort

00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:53,679
so any idea uh

00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:56,159
campaigning idea that you'd like to see

00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:57,440
us pursue or that you would like to get

00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:00,720
involved in

00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:04,559
uh we'd love to uh collect them

00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:06,080
and uh to turn them into actions

00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:07,840
with those of you that might be

00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:10,240
interested in sticking around

00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:11,440
and cooperating after the session as

00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:14,800
well

00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:18,240
so we'll be splitting people again in

00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:35,839
uh small groups yeah again

00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:35,839
i've mixed up the groups a little bit

00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:04,640
all right um

00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,680
i think any any ideas did you was there

00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:09,760
a particular topic

00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:14,720
that people wanted to pick up uh

00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:14,720
or um

00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,320
that people interested in or what are

00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:21,760
different topics where

00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,760
or people here want to contribute

00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:26,800
i probably have the least experience so

00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:28,320
i defer to others

00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,160
it's not about experiences it's about

00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:32,160
ideas as well right in terms of

00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:33,200
creating awareness um so it's not

00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:35,440
necessarily the

00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:37,599
the practical side of things that we're

00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:39,880
looking for so it's around

00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:43,119
yeah policymaking um

00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:43,119
[Music]

00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:49,599
around repairability data um

00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,520
software barriers to repair but also any

00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:55,040
anything else basically

00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:58,079
so yeah

00:35:55,040 --> 00:36:01,920
i seem to find that the thing that kill

00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:03,359
kills most of the dead tech that i have

00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:08,079
around my house

00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:13,280
is software and batteries

00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:15,040
that seems to be those

00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,400
those are the ones that are frustrating

00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:19,280
because

00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,280
if they've been

00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:29,200
it's been created that way kind of

00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:32,320
um a capacitor going in a

00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:34,400
it in something is wear and tear and

00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:35,440
you need it to be designed well enough

00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:39,599
to co

00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:43,119
to be repairable but the software thing

00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:43,839
they do it on purpose at least seemingly

00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:46,320
so

00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:47,440
or at least through lack of thinking

00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:50,720
about it

00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:52,480
so to me there's

00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:54,720
like this software block that you've got

00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:58,640
here is a great i have no idea

00:36:54,720 --> 00:37:04,560
what what did you put there frank sorry

00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:08,640
yes batteries and software basically

00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:10,800
um yeah i mean it's it's twofold so ugly

00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:13,760
and i had a chat about you know the

00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:15,920
aspect of software it's about um the

00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:18,560
software being a blocker to repair

00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,680
and so with with the examples of of more

00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:22,720
for example cars

00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:24,400
or even agricultural machinery now

00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:26,640
relying on software and the software

00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:29,920
actually being a barrier to a repair

00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:32,160
and as well as software not being

00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,839
maintained and therefore becoming

00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:35,160
you know your product becomes like the

00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:36,960
tablet example i had

00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:39,599
[Music]

00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,560
the object becomes obsolete because the

00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:44,560
software is not

00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:44,560
maintained or accessible or

00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:53,200
convertible

00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:55,119
okay this might be an entirely crazed

00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:58,320
idea an ego can

00:37:55,119 --> 00:38:01,200
already do frank can tell me that

00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:02,839
there's a legal reason why this would be

00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:07,040
impossible

00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:07,040
but would it not

00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:18,800
if you're going to abandon a version or

00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:21,839
in or an entire software stack but in a

00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:23,520
thing can you not be obligated to open

00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:27,200
source it

00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:28,640
yeah or open source

00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,720
something that will give you the basic

00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:34,160
functionality

00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:36,480
yeah or or even if it's just the docs to

00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:40,720
be able to do it because

00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:43,760
having to re reverse engineer things

00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:44,320
is the reason why so so much stuff does

00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:48,160
not

00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:51,040
work um and also kind of

00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:52,480
what we now call jail breaking surely at

00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:54,480
the point where somebody stops

00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,920
supporting the software

00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:59,200
you shouldn't have to jailbreak your

00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:02,800
stuff anymore yeah

00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:06,079
um and those are actually regulatory

00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:08,560
things those could actually be i suppose

00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:08,560
achieved

00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:17,520
yeah yeah great

00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:22,320
um i think sorry it says lab

00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:25,040
for sure um your idea about the um

00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:25,040
rent a bench

00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:30,320
did you want to elaborate on that in the

00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:32,640
session or did you want to

00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,640
um

00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,839
yeah okay

00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:49,040
i realized i see you're typing away is

00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:52,640
there something that you want to

00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:55,520
share with the group here or talk about

00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:56,720
um i yeah i mean i can sort of try and

00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:59,119
explain some of the

00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:00,640
it's quite late here in the uk so i'm

00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:04,000
like my brain

00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:04,880
um function is decreasing like my

00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,880
connectivity

00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:12,000
um yeah i

00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:13,440
as you were talking with martin i was

00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,880
thinking about

00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:19,520
software monopolies as a

00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:21,280
barrier that could be campaigned against

00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:24,800
around this maybe

00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:28,000
um like certain

00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:29,280
yeah so i think you started then talking

00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,400
about these um

00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:36,839
monoliths of uh

00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:40,000
software um and then

00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:42,880
i as you started talking about

00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,520
uh the usability and accessibility of

00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,560
software

00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:49,680
like a lot of it is just impossible to

00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:51,200
use and that is um

00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:53,280
something that could be campaigned

00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:56,720
better actually maybe it's not that

00:40:53,280 --> 00:41:00,640
it needs to be like

00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:03,839
repaired or gel break broken it's just

00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:07,040
not usable in its current function form

00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:09,280
and needs to be simplified or you know

00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:10,560
and then the last thing sorry sorry on

00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,920
that one do you mean

00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:13,680
so what do you mean would use that is

00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:16,480
about documentation or is it

00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:17,839
that it's not fit for purpose or what

00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,359
would you mean

00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:21,200
um what's the solution to it i suppose

00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:25,520
is there

00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:26,400
well i mean not to kind of try and give

00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:28,000
myself more

00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,599
reason to exist but i'm a user

00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,440
experience designer

00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:32,880
um but i think a lot of things are not

00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:36,319
user experience designed

00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:38,480
very well so there's

00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:40,160
not and i don't know of much campaigning

00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:43,040
around

00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:44,079
stuff to do with like that okay so

00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,920
basically make it

00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:47,280
make the software and then the tools

00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,280
more accessible

00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:50,319
to more people you don't have to be an

00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:53,760
expert to

00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:55,359
do certain operations um

00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:58,160
yeah yeah i would say there's a lot of

00:41:55,359 --> 00:42:00,319
complex systems that don't

00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:02,000
need to be as complex i suppose but then

00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:04,079
i guess you would repair

00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,599
them quote unquote repair them by trying

00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:06,319
to simplify them but if they were made

00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:07,760
simple

00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:09,520
and usable in the first place they

00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:11,839
wouldn't anyway

00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:13,599
um but then as you spoke about open

00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:14,560
source don't get me wrong i love open

00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:16,960
sources

00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:17,599
much as the next open source advocate

00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:20,800
but

00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:23,920
it's not always the alternative to

00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:27,440
unusable inaccessible

00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:30,160
um and like hard to break

00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:31,440
slash needing to repair things in fact

00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:36,240
yeah i think

00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:39,200
a lot of it is as bad if not worse

00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:40,880
um yeah it's all yeah the the

00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:43,440
accessibility argument doesn't go away

00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:46,640
with open source right or the

00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:50,400
readability or yeah

00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:53,920
okay um

00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:59,839
darius did you want to

00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:59,839
share anything

00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,720
no okay

00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:09,359
so keith did you have any any more ideas

00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:14,000
as we're talking about or examples from

00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:15,680
how things have happened in north

00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:19,520
california

00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:19,520
yeah i mean here we are

00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:24,240
we're up against an incentive for uh

00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:28,000
capitalism to take place

00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:28,800
so the objective for climate change for

00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,960
example

00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:33,119
is uh taking a back seat to the

00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:35,920
objective for profit

00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:36,800
so it's really hard you know you can do

00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:38,480
policies

00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:40,000
we could probably do policies at a local

00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:42,319
level here

00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,359
um or the state level you know

00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:46,160
california is

00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:47,520
a large economy and and people look to

00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:49,200
california to model

00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:51,040
some of these things but i haven't seen

00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:53,520
it in

00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:54,800
all of my democracy work at the state

00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:58,480
level

00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:59,200
um but i'm kind of taking a lot of notes

00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:01,119
and following up

00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:02,480
on all the references that are in the

00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:04,720
chat

00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:07,040
um so i don't think it's helpful to say

00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:10,560
let's dismantle

00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:12,880
um how how these products are made

00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:15,359
um because we're we'd be dismantling

00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:17,599
industries and it would

00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:19,119
um that's a very large-scale public

00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:22,560
policy problem

00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:24,720
you know i'll look at you

00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:26,960
depressing that's right i mean there are

00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:29,200
examples actually of of the

00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:31,280
phones for example that are uh

00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:34,319
completely modular so

00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:36,880
i've got a fair phone and

00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:38,720
it's not being paid by them but it's a

00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:41,040
great phone it's completely modular

00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:42,720
uh and you actually you can take it

00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:44,160
apart without any tools or with a

00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:46,960
standard screwdriver

00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:47,760
and replace modules so there is actually

00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:49,920
it is just

00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:51,359
i think you're absolutely right about

00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:53,200
you know

00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:54,960
it's not necessarily about um

00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:56,319
dismantling the capitalist system or

00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,520
anything like that but it

00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:59,920
it's understanding that there are

00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:03,359
different business models as well right

00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:05,680
around repair around spare parts

00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:07,040
that are currently not being accessed

00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:10,960
yeah for sure

00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:13,920
it's um it's at a very low volume here

00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:17,280
but i think it could be powerful because

00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:17,280
we share the same frustrations

00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,720
okay

00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:35,760
is there anything else

00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:38,000
or any other ideas

00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:39,760
is so maybe not necessarily on the

00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,720
different topics around software

00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:43,599
and repairability or policy making but

00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:46,400
you know if you've got

00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:48,720
ideas how how you think you could help

00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:50,960
in your community or in your

00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:52,160
area or or at work or something like

00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:55,119
that any

00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:55,920
any thoughts on that and i guess ariel

00:45:55,119 --> 00:46:00,079
you'd be

00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:03,839
um campaigning for more user experience

00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:03,839
people to be employed more generally

00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:12,319
yeah i mean yeah i suppose that would be

00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:15,599
nice for me

00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:17,839
and the others around but um i'm also

00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:19,920
trying to think about what i do

00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:21,200
at work so i work at the open food

00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:24,160
network

00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:25,440
and um we're all about short supply

00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:27,119
chains

00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:29,920
um through open source tools so i'm

00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:31,040
trying to think of like

00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:33,040
you know all the different kinds of

00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:35,760
things within agritech

00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:36,880
as well after i've had a thing i'll come

00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,839
back and see whether there's another

00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:43,839
thing that i can

00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:43,839
think of right

00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:49,119
and anything else martin or suki in

00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:49,119
there or

00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:54,839
no sorry i missed the last question

00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:57,920
somebody rang me

00:46:54,839 --> 00:46:59,760
okay this is uh just more in general so

00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:01,040
how how else so not necessarily on a

00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:04,240
specific theme but how

00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:06,000
else could you help um with you know

00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:06,640
maybe at work or within the community or

00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,680
around you

00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:12,240
any any ideas on how we can

00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:13,359
engage more people and the right to on

00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:16,720
the repair

00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:18,079
and awareness so obviously i run a local

00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:19,920
repair cafe

00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:21,280
i try to convince more people to to

00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:23,760
think differently

00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:24,400
about repairing in general and just

00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:27,200
having

00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:27,839
the concept that you can repair things

00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,640
and

00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:32,880
so that's how i'm trying to approach

00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,880
that

00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:41,680
um yeah i um an irregular

00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:44,160
attender at our local repair cafe

00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:45,040
and had already decided with my other

00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,640
half

00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:48,319
who happens to have just bought a flat

00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:51,359
around the corner from where it's

00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:52,079
uh where it is that i'm going to kind of

00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:54,880
when

00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:56,480
they start up again i will try and go

00:47:54,880 --> 00:48:00,079
more regularly to help

00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:03,599
um that which is just

00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:03,599
obviously just a personal thing

00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:09,599
i kind of one of the reasons i joined

00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:12,319
the session today

00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:12,319
uh because

00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:18,480
whilst the campaign's moved on the

00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:21,839
concept hasn't

00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:21,839
changed particularly since

00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:29,119
several modsfests and and such like

00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:32,800
um what i actually turned up for

00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:36,720
was i think i can like i'm an educator i

00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:41,119
i teach kids who were doing computing

00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:44,640
and starting off on a career and

00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:48,640
being open and writing

00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:52,480
kind of resilient software but

00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:54,880
and thinking about environmental issues

00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:58,559
and stuff is stuff that we do

00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:58,559
but i haven't actually

00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:06,400
started integrating

00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:08,640
um like right to repair

00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,640
and

00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:14,400
we've raised the issue of sustainable

00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:17,359
thinking in design

00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:19,200
but we haven't had i have no idea how

00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:22,000
will you do that

00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:22,480
um so i don't have a clue how to teach

00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,400
it

00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:26,160
because i absolutely don't think about

00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:28,160
getting getting the right tools

00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:31,839
or or the language or what what do you

00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:31,839
think is

00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:39,040
um so

00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:41,920
one of the aspects of

00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:42,400
designing i.t systems in the modern

00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:46,240
world

00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:49,599
is making sure that it is uh

00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:52,160
secure that and i know how

00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:55,520
i know how to think about that i have

00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:55,520
been on training about

00:49:55,760 --> 00:50:01,280
about cyber security i have an idea of

00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:03,280
the kind of things i need to be teaching

00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:04,480
the kids as fundamentals when they first

00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:07,839
start programming about

00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:10,400
validating stuff and i know

00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:11,680
um how to teach them about really

00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:14,079
advanced tech

00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:15,680
fairly advanced techniques to attack

00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:17,200
their stuff

00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:20,400
which means that they know how how to

00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:24,720
defend it i have no framework for that

00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:27,280
when it comes to the environmental side

00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:29,119
uh other than try not to make it out of

00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:32,880
heavy metals try to kind of

00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:35,920
kind of try not to rely on

00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:37,200
massive clout cloud structures or do

00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:40,000
stupid things like

00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:41,359
generate massive random numbers for no

00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,599
good reason

00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:46,079
why did we think that bitcoin was a good

00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:46,079
idea

00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:49,359
that's a separate discussion

00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:52,960
well yes but you shouldn't even mean i

00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:56,559
thought i don't

00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:59,359
um yeah so i have no frame framework

00:50:56,559 --> 00:51:00,240
from which to then teach other people um

00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:06,319
um

00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:09,760
so um yeah basic courses lab just said

00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:09,760
anybody got any clothes

00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:13,119
yeah okay

00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:19,839
sorry martin did you mention like

00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:20,960
what kind of excuse me if i

00:51:19,839 --> 00:51:22,720
don't get this right but what kind of

00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:23,200
young people is it young people that you

00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:26,720
you

00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:30,480
are i work in a computing specialist

00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:34,000
school we do um

00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:36,400
it courses around designing things

00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,760
and a level of gcse computing and stuff

00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:41,920
like that so

00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:45,440
but we do fairly practically so we have

00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:50,720
um a whole bunch of employers who set

00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:53,200
challenges and stuff like that so

00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:54,400
hmm yeah young people it's hard with

00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:56,480
anything

00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:59,520
wow not always hard anything tech i

00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:03,280
remember i judged a computer

00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:04,720
some kind of um but have you built some

00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:07,760
software competition

00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:10,800
and i was uh

00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:13,920
very sad about the

00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:16,640
gender balance of people

00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:17,839
um wanted more of people that look like

00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:21,680
me

00:52:17,839 --> 00:52:23,440
we are working looking for ideas

00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:26,880
constantly

00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:28,880
yeah so i guess you know it's i wonder

00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:30,400
sometimes if it's not necessarily about

00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:32,240
the content

00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:34,319
because the content makes sense when you

00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:35,680
get there with it like the idea of

00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:38,160
repairing

00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:40,720
actually the process of it working with

00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:43,839
tools working with tech working with

00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:45,359
chips it's fun but i think it's um the

00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:48,000
relational

00:52:45,359 --> 00:52:49,359
make it relevant to me with that's what

00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,119
i found when i've

00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:52,400
learned very limited work with young

00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:55,599
people like

00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:59,200
i defer to your like length of service

00:52:55,599 --> 00:53:00,960
but um they can also smell a rat like a

00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:01,680
mile away right so if you feign an

00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:03,599
interest

00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:05,280
they will get it immediately so if

00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:08,640
you're like oh yeah i

00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:11,359
love music i'm cool

00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:12,720
i've made that mistake before trying to

00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:15,760
i like that i'm kind of

00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:17,440
a little eliciting some laughs but yeah

00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:19,440
i guess like i started to get better

00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:19,760
results when i genuinely was like okay

00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:22,240
what

00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:23,760
what is this genre of music oh okay

00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:26,000
right i can appreciate this for this

00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:26,880
and hey here's a synthesizer you can

00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,359
build

00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:30,880
um out of bits you know to make

00:53:29,359 --> 00:53:36,079
something like

00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:39,440
anyway you know yeah sorry rambled

00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:41,920
but having them

00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:43,200
do stuff that interests them and solves

00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:46,960
their own problems

00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:50,079
is has always been my

00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:53,599
most powerful way of getting stuff done

00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:56,960
um but um so like

00:53:53,599 --> 00:54:00,400
i have no doubt get off topic so

00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:03,440
you're not wrong but

00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:07,119
they are all almost

00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:10,079
all of them pretty concerned about

00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:12,240
environmental issues and very frustrated

00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:14,960
when stuff breaks and they can't

00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:17,440
sort it out and conversation about fair

00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:20,640
phones come up fairly frequently

00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:24,559
no i don't know anybody that has

00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:27,760
yet uh out of our group no one actually

00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:30,319
out of a group of i'd say 50 kids uh

00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:30,880
all together uh one has gone for a fair

00:54:30,319 --> 00:54:38,559
phone

00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:42,000
but everybody else has gone power um

00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:44,000
yeah so uh but

00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:46,000
the conversation has been there but

00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:49,200
mostly about the modularity and repair

00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,200
and being able to keep things going

00:54:50,839 --> 00:54:53,839
right

00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:57,599
great yeah i think we've got everyone

00:54:56,640 --> 00:55:01,440
back

00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:03,280
um i think let's start to share

00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:05,200
about our session that the last part of

00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:08,799
the conversation was mostly around

00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:09,760
uh education um i'm sure martin did you

00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:11,280
want to

00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:14,480
pick out some points of what you

00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:17,280
mentioned i i think your comparison to

00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:19,359
sorry i might as well do because you

00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:20,880
don't know where i'm going

00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:22,880
thought your comparison of saying well

00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:23,920
in it design in software design you

00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:25,760
teach people

00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:27,280
uh cyber security and how to how to

00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:28,319
protect for cyber security we don't

00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:30,000
teach them

00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:31,920
how to build in repair ability or

00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:34,319
maintain ability so i think

00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:36,559
um something around that some sort of

00:55:34,319 --> 00:55:37,760
framework for for teaching that in in

00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:41,680
software level i think is

00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:41,680
is a really interesting thought

00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:45,839
yeah definitely definitely but i would

00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:48,480
um

00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:51,040
i'm just going to try and i think

00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:53,440
somebody's already doing a box for that

00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:55,359
yeah i've i've taken the liberty of the

00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:57,839
merchant

00:55:55,359 --> 00:55:58,960
thank you um is there anyone else who

00:55:57,839 --> 00:56:00,799
wants to share anything

00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:04,400
with with the bigger group or someone

00:56:00,799 --> 00:56:04,400
came out of the other breakout room

00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:18,400
thank you sure i don't want to be the

00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:21,760
spokesperson for our

00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:23,599
group but um there was very fruitful

00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:27,040
conversations uh

00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:28,000
uh it mostly revolved on you know what

00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:31,920
we need

00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:33,119
uh to improve campaigning and to make it

00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:36,880
more effective

00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:39,680
and um one i'll just say a couple

00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:40,480
and then people can look at some of the

00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:43,839
the

00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:47,280
the notes but um

00:56:43,839 --> 00:56:49,760
being crucial just to make it not just

00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:50,720
about right to repair as a tinkering

00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:54,319
thing that

00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:58,000
people love because they want to

00:56:54,319 --> 00:57:01,599
uh tinker but but appreciating more the

00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:05,040
connections between the what

00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:05,680
the push we want to see in the north of

00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:07,280
the world

00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:08,880
with the real issues that are

00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:11,280
experienced by people

00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:14,720
in the south of the world in the global

00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:14,720
south particularly around

00:57:14,799 --> 00:57:18,559
you know the environmental consequences

00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:22,880
of this

00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:26,240
insane mining and use of resources

00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:29,680
due to our voracious appetite

00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:32,720
for these devices and and also

00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:36,079
the fairness about equal

00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:36,960
the quality of access to uh products

00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:39,240
that

00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:40,960
more right to repair could ensure

00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:45,280
[Music]

00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:47,839
and also making it unacceptable

00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:49,920
that products are just put out on the

00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:53,520
market

00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:56,799
that are simply not repairable as in

00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:59,200
while the law isn't there yet so the

00:57:56,799 --> 00:58:00,480
real change can happen if we decide that

00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:03,520
just certain things

00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:04,880
cannot be accepted full stop and cannot

00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:08,880
get

00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:12,160
reviews that are so glaring like etc

00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:15,280
yeah honey maybe to say

00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:17,280
others the word you go

00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:19,520
anias put her hand up so she wants to

00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:22,520
share something

00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:24,880
uh yeah uh something i saw i think on

00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:28,319
ifixit.com or the repair

00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:30,640
website they repair eu is um how um

00:58:28,319 --> 00:58:31,760
having repair shops makes it so that we

00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:35,599
have more

00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:36,720
local jobs and you know one way to spin

00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:38,640
this could be that

00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:40,000
um you know when we have the right to

00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:43,040
repair uh

00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:44,160
it's kind of like supporting um local

00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:48,240
businesses because

00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:50,160
um like if the manuals are available

00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:51,040
they're gonna be more local technicians

00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:54,720
in your area

00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:56,640
who can fix the device for you so um

00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:59,040
by campaigning for the right to repair

00:58:56,640 --> 00:59:02,400
you're competing for creation of

00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:05,839
more jobs around this area and

00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:09,119
you know supporting uh local technicians

00:59:05,839 --> 00:59:10,000
so and i think that's always something

00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:12,000
that's

00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,520
kind of good to advocate for so that's

00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:18,000
like one way to frame this

00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:19,359
um movement

00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:22,079
yeah i think that's a great idea but

00:59:19,359 --> 00:59:25,440
yeah local jobs and empowering people

00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:27,280
and local economy yeah i think that's

00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:29,520
great

00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:33,839
there anything else that anyone would

00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:33,839
like to share

00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:37,839
in the last at least one minute if not

00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:39,440
two minutes

00:59:37,839 --> 00:59:41,839
we've got some actions for you to do to

00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:44,839
go away after this so

00:59:41,839 --> 00:59:47,839
here you go you wanna go with the

00:59:44,839 --> 00:59:47,839
actions

00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:56,960
um more repairable means well more

00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:00,880
repairable

00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:05,280
um so um surely

01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:08,720
retailers and all insurers

01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:12,000
would have an angle of

01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:15,200
like in cycling there's been a rash

01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:17,920
of new types of insurance companies

01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:19,760
that have come out of a couple of

01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:23,359
changes in rules

01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:25,119
that um look at

01:00:23,359 --> 01:00:26,559
insuring bikes completely differently

01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:30,000
it's a bit weird

01:00:26,559 --> 01:00:32,000
but surely there is actually business

01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:35,760
models

01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:39,839
that would make people profit by

01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:41,440
pushing you towards like lower prices on

01:00:39,839 --> 01:00:45,040
insurance because

01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:45,040
if your things are more repairable

01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:52,799
rich but i know nothing about money

01:00:49,359 --> 01:00:55,440
yeah it is very interesting and in fact

01:00:52,799 --> 01:00:56,000
insurers are the ones that have some of

01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:59,280
the best

01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:01,200
data on products actual need to be

01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:02,000
repaired but they don't release it very

01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:05,680
much at all

01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:10,160
so that's a very very good point um

01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:13,520
i think we will need to

01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:15,520
leave this meeting very soon

01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:17,920
i don't know whether we get hopefully

01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:21,280
not shut down

01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:22,240
randomly but uh well first i wanted to

01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:24,559
thank everyone

01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:26,160
and just i'd love to stay in touch with

01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:27,040
those of you that would like to stay in

01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:30,559
touch

01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:33,520
um i've added my own twitter

01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:34,400
handle and i'm also myself on the

01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:37,520
mozfest
