Title: Let's fight for our Right to Repair!
Publication date: 2021-03-11
Playlist: Mozilla Festival 2021
Description: 
	The movement for Right to repair is growing globally, and it’s starting to get traction with policy makers. Yet, we’re still far from securing a universal Right to repair. And increasingly we need to make the case for removing software barriers set by manufactures, preventing us from repairing and reusing products. In the session we’ll present the European Right to Repair campaign, and work with participants on our next challenges. Participants will first contribute their priorities for the campaign to consider. Then we’ll work in small groups to prototype solutions to key issues we face: - How best to collaboratively document and tackle the mounting software barriers to our right to repair? - How can individuals and organisations in the MozFest community multiply the reach and impact of the campaign? The session is just the beginning, and we’ll encourage participants to get involved in ongoing campaign activities
