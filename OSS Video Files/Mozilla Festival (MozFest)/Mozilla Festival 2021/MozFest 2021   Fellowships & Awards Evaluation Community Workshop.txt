um there you go

00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:08,639
yes um so yeah as i was saying where the

00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:10,000
idea of the session is to dig in on some

00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:13,280
of the early insights

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,880
um that we have had from the interviews

00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,119
and surveys that we have been doing with

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,480
lots of stakeholders in the community

00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:21,840
um we are planning to do some

00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,439
we were planning to do some breakouts

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,880
since we're a smaller group i still

00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,760
think it might make sense to do at least

00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,320
two um rather than the three we had

00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,320
planned for

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:34,480
which works um but yeah if you are

00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,040
uh we will be asking you to participate

00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:40,559
so that's the warning

00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:43,760
does anyone have any questions

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:46,559
folks have the link to the doc if not

00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,079
we can dive in and let people read and

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:52,879
start

00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:54,320
like digesting and reflecting in groups

00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,480
now everyone's ready for breakouts go

00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,160
ahead susan sorry yeah yeah sorry i

00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,039
don't know if you mentioned the ama

00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,359
option as well

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,879
oh yes thank you yeah so i don't know if

00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,320
anyone here has joined

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,240
to just learn about the programs

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,240
generally um rather than engage with the

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,159
evaluation but if you have

00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,880
we have amy here who can help help

00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,159
answer some questions um but if not

00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,600
uh then she'll just join one of the

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,320
breakouts and participate with the rest

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,439
of us so

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,759
um if anyone uh would like

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,960
to just have some questions answered you

00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,400
can raise your hand

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,400
otherwise we can just jump to the

00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:30,640
breakout groups and look at the findings

00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,680
yeah i just have a question if the

00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,680
findings are in

00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,840
where those are i don't yeah so there's

00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,799
a link i'll drop this in right now we

00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,520
have them in um not the mirror board you

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,680
may have been

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,200
sent or get to from the website uh

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,880
because we wanted to be able to

00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,600
make it a little easier to navigate so

00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,320
there is a oh i just sent that only to

00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,720
one person

00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:56,479
sorry um here you go that we will be

00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,159
the findings will be in this mirror

00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:01,119
board um

00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:03,280
there's uh stickies grouped into general

00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,560
topic areas for everybody to have chance

00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,640
to read and um

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,560
respond to and then each breakout group

00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,239
has like a reflection board

00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,160
so um and there's a little bit of an

00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,879
overview of how to work with miro

00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,760
at the top so if you're not familiar

00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:19,520
with it or

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:21,120
just want a reminder not to get lost

00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,200
or overwhelmed by it we have a little

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,160
overview at the top but feel free to ask

00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,040
any of us questions

00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,959
we can help walk through that um thank

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,959
you daniel

00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,480

00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,599
questions otherwise i will

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,840
open up the breakout rooms and pop us in

00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,840
there

00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,400

two and um

00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:54,319
let me actually go ahead and

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,760
recreate these um and just make sure we

00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:59,200
are moved around

00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:01,519
in a way that works um

00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,519
oops

00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,840

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,280
rooms does that sound good

00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,799
co-hosts since folks are yeah since

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,000

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,519
rooms um and uh

00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,799
yeah you will have your co-hosts in

00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,360
those and then i will

00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,560
some people may join in but i'll um i'll

00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,040
try to push them in with

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,959
instructions so everybody should be

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:54,720
getting an invite to a breakout room

00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:57,519
uh now yeah okay

00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,519
i'm trying to

00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,879
okay hi sorry i'm one of the late

00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,560
joiners

00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,319
you're good i'm just pushing you into a

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,120
breakout room which i realize as i do

00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:10,239
that it's gonna

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:13,120
yeah okay i will

00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,319
it's gonna work um i got put into a

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,439
breakout room but i'm assuming that was

00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:18,799
a mistake

00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:20,560
oh yes sorry yeah let's keep you here

00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:22,560
and i was going to stay with you here

00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,360
that's what i mean i was like i'm going

00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,759
to leave

00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,400
sorry the it like doesn't let you move

00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,440
someone

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:31,199
out can i say move to you can't unassign

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,639
somebody

00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,520
yeah that's why i just left that it's

00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:38,720
fine yeah no it's just weird

00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,720
i'd like to be able to have a sign

00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,680
um i should uh

00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,400
i was excited to get the link to the

00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,520
email this morning

00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:04,560
yes dig into it yeah i'm

00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:07,360
excited for feedback from everybody

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,880
i hope and it's i realized i was like we

00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,320
our whole discussion here gets to end up

00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,360
recording

00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:17,919
should i stop this recording

00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:19,039
you could i mean not much

00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,960
but we're not talking about anything

00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,479
that's helpful right now i know it's

00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,120
just weird because i guess it'll get

00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,240
like

00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,400
published i don't understand the

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,400
publishing flow of the videos anyway

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,440
maybe i will stop this recording or

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:34,240
pause it

00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:34,240
no yeah

00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:40,639
hi everybody always so jarring to be

00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,960
pulled out of the ground

00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,680
i know and i didn't have the option to

00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,680
say how long

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,039
it was for so it was just automatically

00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,000
15 seconds

00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:51,280
just like half control hosting zoom

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,639
sorry about that

00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,680
um do we have everybody back i think we

00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:59,199
do

00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:01,280
hi everybody welcome back um

00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,120
we just thought it would be good to uh

00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,960
since we are on the

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,400
um smaller side overall we figured we

00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,039
would bring the two groups back so that

00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,680
we can

00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:10,880
hear from each other and just reflect as

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,720
like a group as a whole

00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,120
so i don't know if either group wants to

00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,639
share back from their group or

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,240
pick up the thread that they were rudely

00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:21,759
pulled out of

00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:24,360
just now by my close all right button

00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,080
top but um

00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:29,680
[Music]

00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,680
yeah so i'm going to share from there

00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,840
breakout

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,520
i want to invite julia was on a great

00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:41,120
thread i

00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,000
um if you feel comfortable i don't want

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,800
to put you on the spot but

00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,440
sure um hi everybody uh we were just

00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,120
talking a little bit about um

00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,880
something that jumped out to me in the

00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:56,400
evaluation

00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:58,720
was the um the data base

00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,560
idea and and sort of having information

00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,720
about who has been part of the

00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,240
fellowships and awards and how that's

00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,120
really important on a

00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:09,120
internal mozilla side but also it's

00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,720
really important to continue networking

00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,720
with these alumni

00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,960
through time and having an easier way

00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:18,319
for the alumni to network as well

00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:22,319
and so i'm a mozilla fellow um

00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:24,080
alumni and i really still feel connected

00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,759
to the mozilla community but there's

00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,440
there's not really as many official

00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:31,199
channels or

00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:34,560
ways to discover other folks um

00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:36,319
and i think i i think you know there's

00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,400
because we're seeing you know the impact

00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,800
and investment

00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,680
for fellows and awardees is so great

00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,919
like to carry

00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,520
forward those successes and amplify them

00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:46,720
and network them and have

00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,199
folks be able to find each other more

00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,960
easily i think not only is

00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,319
is a powerful return on you know

00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,000
continuing enduring

00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,720
return on investment but it also helps

00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,240
with advertising the programs

00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,240
writ large as these um

00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,160
yeah just giving the programs more

00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,160
visibility as well so that's

00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,080
part of what we were talking about

00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,720
awesome thank you for sharing

00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,720
yeah yeah

00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,240
that's the other group talking very

00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,680
similar any

00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,039
thing from that that connected to the

00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,160
other groups conversation or anyone want

00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:21,440
to

00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:24,319
add i can bring

00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,879
one uh point that we were talking about

00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,160
how for

00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:30,319
current fellows um it has uh

00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,759
been really hard to connect because of

00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,880
the pandemic and so they haven't

00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,120
experienced

00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,880
uh all the traveling that is so key i

00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,080
mean i was a follower when traveling was

00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,120
still a thing

00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:44,800
um and so it was um

00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,880
we were reflecting on how um namodzullah

00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,920
might have uh changed your strategy to

00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,320
like increase

00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,320
uh participation and connection in these

00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,120
times and how that could be

00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,760
something that you could be carried um

00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,680
through

00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,200
you know even post-pandemic times when

00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,959
traveling can come back especially

00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,080
specifically for folks who have a

00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,399
passport that

00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,120
has made it uh traditionally difficult

00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,240
to

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:12,640
travel that was a case for uh for

00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:15,680
in in in our cohort um a nigerian fellow

00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:18,080
that i never met uh and so

00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,760
uh perhaps that could be uh you know

00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,880
again something some strategy developed

00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,800
now that could

00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:28,240
uh help maybe make a mix of uh in-person

00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:31,360
and um virtual uh meetings so that uh

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:35,200
folks like uh that cannot ever

00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:38,720
get to travel can also participate

00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,080
yeah it's a great it's a great point

00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,320
things we've learned from this year that

00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:46,000
we can that can become

00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,000
practices in general yeah

00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,200
other folks i think anyone wants to

00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,560
share from their breakdockers

00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,959
see lots of good notes and lots of

00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,800
stickies i can

00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,399
just read from them see lots of

00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:01,519
questions

00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,519
you don't want to dig in on

00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:05,839
um

00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,800
oh susan is there from your breakout

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,959
group so anything you want to lift up

00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,880
i'm calling you because yeah we were

00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,320
talking about um how

00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,480
um we were talking about lots of great

00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,440
things i think a big theme was

00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,519
how to involve the fna program and

00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,000
fellows and awardees more

00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,880
um cross across mozilla as an

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,920
organization

00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:36,240
um especially like how like campaigns

00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,959
and we've heard that in our findings as

00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,160
well um

00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:42,640
even mo among moko um

00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,959
yeah so that's the whole thread i think

00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,560
that was kind of not so much reflected i

00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:49,839
think in the findings so i added that as

00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,839
something to kind of dig into

00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,920
yeah i feel like we heard about it more

00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:56,959
if it had been a problem as opposed to

00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,480
like um and more in general the missed

00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,560
opportunity of not connecting

00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:03,200
more broadly but not as like with as

00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,200
many specifically

00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,519
i hit the button i'm sorry that's

00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:11,279
entirely my fault

00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:14,959
i was sorry i'm very sorry

00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:17,279
completely me all good

00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:18,959
well zoom was just expressing its

00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,399
opinion on us

00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:22,959
that was me i'm gonna get some more

00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:26,800
coffee i apologize

00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:30,000
totally fine thank you um i'll just

00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:31,360
oh do you want to go yeah i'll be quick

00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,839
i was just going to say i wanted to jump

00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,880
in on

00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,839
on that um but susan was reporting back

00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,640
from our group

00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:40,240
um about the campaign work and um thanks

00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,720
julia also for raising

00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,440
um the points that you did i think that

00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,360
there

00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,720
there are missed opportunities that i

00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,680
don't think you wouldn't be able to

00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,800
identify

00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,920
and then there's also the not

00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,040
not necessarily like a missed

00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,320
opportunity but like there could be a

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,000
moment where

00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,440
we'll be discussing in a campaign

00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,720
meeting it would be great to pull in a

00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,320
fellow on this

00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,440
and we don't really know where to start

00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,440
on that yeah

00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:08,320
yeah and so that's like both uh knowing

00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,240
what

00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,240
past fellows current fellows are working

00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:15,680
on right and how that can happen

00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:18,880
and like how to engage right it's like

00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:22,880
both from um who and how perspective

00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:25,440
yes yes yeah thanks

00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,480
sure thank you yeah did you want to jump

00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,160
in

00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,920
yeah i just wanted to reflect that in

00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,480
the discussion in our group around

00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,800
diversity equity and inclusion

00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,320
and and i think we had some a really

00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,240
interesting discussion around like what

00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,560
that means in practice like how you

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,639
design the program to actually make it

00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:45,760
more accessible for people that

00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:47,600
there may be um there may be because of

00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,120
the nature of the funding that we have

00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,120
and the restrictions that are involved

00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,839
in it and the legal implications that

00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,519
create that very u.s focus that there

00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,519
are also ways to overcome that right

00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,680
that you can

00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:01,680
prepare videos for example that explain

00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,800
a process that are more accessible for

00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,320
people

00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,160
so for me that was a really interesting

00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,920
aspect of that and sort of help

00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,240
trigger some different ways of thinking

00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,240
as well

00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:16,160
yeah yeah there's um

00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:17,760
same want to add to that yeah

00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,920
transparent strategy

00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,839
like making it clear that that's i think

00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,519
a big question and this is

00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:26,320
something that hopefully was reflected

00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:28,320
in the stickies is actually that like

00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,240
actually just transparency around the

00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,680
role and value of dei to the program

00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,720
like how the program feels about it

00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:37,440
and i think the organization as well um

00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,920
that can be really helpful like even if

00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,760
just a program is saying

00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,000
something then that can be a helpful

00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,760
flag for people too

00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,600
yeah does anyone want to add or any

00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,360
other thoughts on that

00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,399
experience from other places where it's

00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,399
been done well yeah go ahead

00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,480
i was just thinking back for a second on

00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,600
the um

00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:02,079
the sharing um i can sort of

00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,440
champion what uh what's happening with

00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:06,880
the mozilla

00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:10,320
um uh fellows like both

00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:13,120
current and and past um

00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,560
one of the things that uh like i'm i'm

00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,199
involved with grant for the web at the

00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,199
moment

00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:19,760
and that's actually one of the things

00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:22,880
they're doing really really well

00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:24,560
that might be a good model to look at

00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:28,079
they've sort of created their own little

00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:29,519
um uh community which other people

00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:32,639
besides

00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,600
grant for the web grantees are able to

00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,480
join

00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,720
uh and they do like weekly sort of

00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,399
newsletters that go out to everybody

00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,399
about what's been happening and they

00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:45,040
share that across social media

00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:48,000
and then they're also keeping an eye on

00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:51,120
what their various grantees are up to

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,519
and uh and sort of magnifying that but

00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,600
also sort of creating a community where

00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,959
everybody's sharing each other's work as

00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,040
well uh

00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:00,480
and coyle has been jumping on that as

00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:03,760
well as cinnamon as well

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:06,240
which um um has just been

00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,959
amplifying everything for everybody and

00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,160
and also

00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:13,120
bringing that community um much more

00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,800
closer together

00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,279
yeah i think it's a good point about

00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:20,560
just um a people don't

00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:22,320
realize how really lightweight lifting

00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,920
can like those sort of like what what

00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,120
might feel like oh people know what's

00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,399
going on it's like actually just putting

00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,600
it in one place can be a really

00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:31,680
lightweight way that

00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:35,199
adds a lot of value for people yeah

00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:37,199
yeah other

00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:41,199
thoughts anyone wanna respond i'll just

00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:43,920
keep prompting questions

00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:44,560
i think we were talking about um how

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,839
just

00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:50,959
the presentation of the feedback here

00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,600
um kind of like flattens the suggestions

00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:54,480
in a way

00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,920
um that doesn't make it clear how these

00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:59,199
interventions happen at

00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:01,440
various levels and some of

00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:03,279
some of these changes are up to

00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,120
individual program officers for example

00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:05,759
and some of them are much higher level

00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,880
and just

00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:11,199
like how recognition of those

00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:13,040
different intervention points is is

00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:16,880
important when considering

00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:17,360
this feedback yes yeah that's a great

00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:22,320
point

00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:24,000
thank you

00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,759
otherwise i see daniella's question but

00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,800
i will uh

00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:31,199
we can respond to that uh

00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,399
like a few more minutes of discussion

00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:35,519
and then i can answer

00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:37,600
that yeah

00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,800
everyone have anything else they want to

00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,480
add or lift up yeah

00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,240
there's anything else katie from your

00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,240
group that

00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:47,360
you wanted to share as well or that you

00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,360
want to call on someone to share

00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:56,320
um let's see i think

00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:57,250
uh lainey was making an interesting

00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,480
point just about um

00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:01,199
[Music]

00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,079
measure how uh measuring impact is

00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:05,120
challenging and

00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:08,720
kind of the question around

00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:09,199
how other stewards of the ecosystem are

00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,559
measuring

00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:16,400
impact and kind of like the value add of

00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:18,559
of um learning from

00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,760
other people in the field and how

00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:21,039
they're approaching that i don't know

00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:24,160
lainey if you wanted to

00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:27,439
add to that no no thank you i was

00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:29,039
responding to you know some of the uh

00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:30,640
posters and they were just talking about

00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,960
how uh

00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,760
impact is you know it's not overnight so

00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,679
it can be

00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:40,400
over many years and also collecting that

00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:42,720
understanding that long-term impact is

00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:45,679
like a hard thing to

00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:48,320
know and collect and so yeah my question

00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:51,919
was more just like how do other

00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:55,039
organizations that do fellowships

00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:57,120
measure impact over time and

00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:59,280
and uh you know i think julia's point

00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,039
earlier about like having a robust you

00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,000
know connected alumni network is

00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:05,120
probably

00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,120
one one way to you know ensure you're

00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:10,240
still maintaining those connections and

00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:13,679
aware of uh

00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:16,080
some of those long-term ripple effects

00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:17,840
yeah i also one thing i think we were

00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,080
surprised to hear is that like

00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,200
no one has a playbook or answer to this

00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,919
um which

00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,840
is like not it's both that like oh we're

00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:27,840
not alone

00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,039
and the space which i think is a really

00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,919
helpful

00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:32,799
note um and actually that this is an

00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:35,520
opportunity

00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:35,919
like mozilla playing with ways to model

00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,080
to

00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:39,600
to measure this as an opportunity to

00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:43,360
help the field as a whole

00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:46,960
so yeah that was a cool

00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:48,640
feedback point um but yeah you get stuck

00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,520
measuring the things you can

00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,559
which are not necessarily impact

00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:56,320
measures it's just

00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:57,120
like counting but everyone things start

00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,559
somewhere

00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:02,559
yeah yeah not a bad thing um or just

00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:03,760
i think has a lot of potential but yeah

00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:05,840
we um

00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,280
this is a place where i think we'll uh

00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,720
we have lots of ideas from the

00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,760
conversations that we've had so there

00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:13,360
will be like specific

00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:16,960
ideas that we have in the final report

00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:19,280
but yeah um i

00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,640
going back to what julia was talking

00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:24,480
about earlier about

00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:28,000
um you know having connecting um

00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:30,320
sort of the alumni and engaging them

00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,400
uh one of the things i'm doing my

00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:36,240
master's in ed tech at the moment

00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:38,960
and that was one of the focuses

00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,480
uh with our program was starting to

00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,799
connect the alumni

00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,000
but rather than just connect the alumni

00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:46,080
they brought them

00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,120
they created the network so it connected

00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,320
the um

00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,039
current students as well and i know

00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,520
that's been

00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:55,600
incredibly valuable to me why i'm

00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:58,880
working through my master's because

00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:01,120
um it's just

00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,000
it's just broadened that that community

00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,520
of people that

00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,919
that i'm interacting with that i'm

00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:07,600
engaging with and it's creating new

00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:09,760
opportunities and new potential

00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:12,880
partnerships between

00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:17,760
like students and the alumni alike

00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:17,760
um so and

00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,760
i mean so far the the way that that's

00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:25,360
being done is

00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:26,000
um well it it's um it's time consuming

00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:30,000
but it's

00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:33,039
it's uh simple in terms of like you know

00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,080
sort of facebook groups and uh

00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:39,600
um uh you know in twitter

00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:42,320
um lists and uh

00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:44,480
and then championing you know students

00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:48,799
and alumni's work over on youtube

00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:50,559
and yeah yeah it sort of comes back to

00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:52,559
that like making the things visible

00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:54,400
like making that network and those like

00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:57,200
connections more visible yeah

00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:59,039
and then figuring out where where the

00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:02,240
community that you've got

00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:05,120
is is most comfortable and engaging

00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,240
um so far with that master's community

00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,240
it seems to be

00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,600
for for them and gate for the community

00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:13,200
engaging together

00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:17,039
it's it's been on facebook but uh

00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:18,480
but and this is one of the good things

00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,760
about what they're doing is

00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,760
is that they're experimenting in

00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,400
different spaces so they've experimented

00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,960
on linkedin

00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,400
and they've experimented uh you know

00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:29,120
with um

00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,400
not slack but it's uh um i can't

00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,880
remember the name of it right now but

00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,280
it's

00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:36,080
like slack for kind of more educational

00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,080
institutions

00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:43,280
yeah yeah yeah okay um

00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,360
well uh well thank you daniella for

00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:48,320
sharing that there's if people

00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:50,720
want to join fellows fast and present to

00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:52,640
chat in the spatial chat that's um

00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,840
danielle i'll put a link so thank you

00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,400
for that

00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,400
um

00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:02,000
okay we'll find it yeah

00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,200
yeah yeah there's apparently meeting

00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,559
there's a meeting point

00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:09,600
or meeting points in spatial chat um

00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:11,760
if let's go do that that's great uh

00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,640
we are we have about five minutes left

00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,000
so i just want i

00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,919
just want to share some last thoughts

00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,600
and then we can talk about what happens

00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:18,880
from here and i can answer danielle's

00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,760
question but go ahead julia i saw your

00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,880
hands

00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:24,640
yeah sorry i just i love um just to

00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,799
to follow up on erica's point just now i

00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:29,760
think um

00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:30,720
uh incorporating alumni into the current

00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,320
fellows like

00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,320
um like she was describing is a really

00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,039
powerful way and i i know mozilla does

00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:39,120
that a little bit

00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:40,320
um but to to work on that with

00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,640
with also meeting some of the

00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:46,400
professional development goals that

00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:48,400
current fellows and alumni have

00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,240
and like you know skills different skill

00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,080
sets to offer that's happened a little

00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,880
bit informally but um

00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,280
i think you know formalizing it and

00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,039
really

00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,480
centering activities around professional

00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:01,200
development rather than

00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,880
um just social stuff could could be a

00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:07,120
really powerful way

00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:09,520
forward i'd be curious about folks here

00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,240
one question that i think is come up is

00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,880
like

00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,799
about how whether or not that network

00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,320
alumni network can exist inclusive of

00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:18,080
people who

00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,760
other awards programs and not just

00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:22,240
fellas i

00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,760
like and what that would if anyone

00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,080
thinks that that would be strange or not

00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,240
or

00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,200
good or bad or reactions to that

00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,200
generally

00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:32,080
um i think we it's easy for us to think

00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:34,480
about it in a fellowship mindset and

00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,840
but there are lots of folks who are sort

00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,720
of part of the ecosystem who didn't

00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,120
necessarily have a

00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:42,080
fellowship structure i don't know if

00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,080
folks have thoughts on that

00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,520
outsider perspective i feel like that

00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,480
would be really useful because i mean

00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,240
i've worked

00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,000
with creative media awardees more

00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:53,120
closely than i've worked with fellows

00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,600
yeah um and i think that that could be

00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,600
useful

00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:58,000
for them you know to cross-pollinate and

00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:02,559
share ideas and support for each other

00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:05,440
yeah yeah that's helpful

00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:08,640
any other last thoughts or else i will

00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,640
talk about what happens from here

00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,320
yeah okay so thank you everyone for

00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:15,760
coming and participating and sharing

00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,159
your feedback and thoughts it's great to

00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,880
have

00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:19,840
um these questions as we are pulling

00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,039
this all together

00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:26,320
uh so to answer daniella's question

00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:29,760
about where does this go um

00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:32,799
we i and the homozygous feedback

00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,360
i can also lean on to speak to that a

00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:35,600
bit

00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,559
um but what's happening right now is

00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,799
we're in this

00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:39,919
sort of final synthesis stage so we've

00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:42,480
been drafting

00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:43,919
an evaluation report um but we're also

00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,640
thinking about how all of this will

00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:49,840
exist in a public forum

00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:51,679
for everyone to explore so um as

00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:53,679
like what portions of the evaluation

00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:55,120
when how it will all appear publicly so

00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:57,200
that it's clear to

00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,240
the broad community that is the mozilla

00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,720
community

00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,080
um as well as like other useful outputs

00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,600
and tools so things like

00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,440
an overview of the timeline of the

00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,360
programs that's easy for people to see

00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,640
like ways to navigate existing projects

00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,720
and stories

00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,400
as well as like um input collected

00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,559
through the evaluation process

00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,159
uh so we're sort of in that phase at the

00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:18,080
moment so all of your feedback here is

00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:20,320
really helpful both in the

00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,840
questions that we can answer or that are

00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:24,960
good to follow up on later

00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:26,720
um so those so thank you for that

00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:29,120
uh and if folks are interested in

00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,720
getting notifications we just dropped in

00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,840
an email address that goes to the simply

00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,400
secure team

00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:36,000
that has been working on this so um if

00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,640
you haven't in some other form

00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,360
expressed interest in following along we

00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,360
will

00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:43,279
uh drop us a note and we'll add you to

00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,880
that list but yeah

00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:47,200
if you want to speak to the mozilla's

00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:49,919
using this going forward

00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:51,600
piece i'm i was like i can defer to you

00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:52,480
very intentionally that's what i'm

00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,120
saying

00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,240
we're actually we've we've been doing a

00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:59,360
lot of reflecting

00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:01,440
um uh over the last well

00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,960
year but six months i started six months

00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,880
ago but i think that

00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,480
um we've been waiting for for the

00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,600
evaluation for a little while to help

00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,520
sort of

00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,600
uh kick start a process that we've been

00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:13,600
doing anyways in the interim

00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,720
um a lot of the things that you said

00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,440
aren't like

00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:19,200
aren't news um some of the suggestions

00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,559
are really fantastic to help us think

00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,400
through some of the challenges that

00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:24,480
we've encountered

00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,159
and some of the the ways in which we can

00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,919
build on the impact that we've had and

00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:32,960
strengthen the program so

00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:34,720
we're actually heading into um a week of

00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,120
kind of strategy planning and thinking

00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,480
through

00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,320
all of the different pieces that have

00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:41,679
informed how we can

00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:42,320
how we can build um uh build on the

00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:44,640
strengths

00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,600
that have come so far to be to be able

00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,600
to sort of

00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:50,320
amplify that impact and so this this

00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:52,559
will very much inform that process

00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,080
so please do continue to feed in i think

00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:56,960
it's really valuable

00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,320
whatever insights you offer um they

00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,640
don't they don't fall into that

00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,640
chamber
