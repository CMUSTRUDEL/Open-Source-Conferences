00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,920
go

00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,240
what is the first thing you think of

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,439
when i say the netherlands

00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,119
maybe our farmlands or windmills some

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,119
cows perhaps

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,320
okay and what comes to mind when i say

00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:34,719
amsterdam

00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:37,200
well that must be our famous kennels

00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,480
a few centuries ago amsterdam relied

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,160
solely on her canals for the

00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,200
transportation of goods into the

00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,280
warehouses

00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,039
so big boats would come into the harbor

00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,200
with the products and smaller boats

00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:49,200
would take them further into the city

00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,320
it looks a lot like the first adaptation

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,239
of the internet

00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,719
where you move data from one place to

00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:59,840
another throughout the use of kennels

00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,840
welcome to today's mosfet studio

00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:17,119
[Music]

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,680
welcome back lovely to see you all for

00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:22,320
the fourth episode of mosfest studio

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,720
let's start off with a fun fact did you

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,640
know

00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,439
that over 82 countries out of 196

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,759
globally

00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,640
have been represented at most fest over

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,119
the years

00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,119
we would like to get to know everyone so

00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,600
please use the selfie flag

00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:38,320
and show us on twitter or on slack with

00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,960

and on the family resource page you can

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,000
find activities from children from

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,879
3 to 12 years old like challenges

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,160
funny videos virtual museum tours from

00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,920
all over the world

00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,520
so pick and choose what works best for

00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,680
you and your family

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,879
and if you have any other ideas on how

00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,120
we can engage

00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,319
families here at mossfest please let us

00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,360
know in the slack channel

00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:31,360
with the hashtag mosfest families

00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:33,440
[Music]

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,160
and of course a lot has happened

00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,599
atmosfest since we last saw you here one

00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,120
of the sessions that took place

00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:44,400
yesterday in the ai in real life space

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,840
was a session a typology of trust for ai

00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,720
where they discussed possible

00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,959
interventions to specific ai harm

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,360
and we've invited alex engler from the

00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:56,080
usa who facilitated the session

00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:59,120
and kiwako sakamoto from germany who is

00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,120
a wrangler of the ai in real life space

00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,959
so hello guys thank you so much for

00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,480
joining us today

00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:08,640
um hi alex i'm going to start with you

00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,640
do you think there should be a global

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:14,239
law to protect everyone in the world

00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:16,319
from a.i yeah this is a really important

00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,360
conversation um and it's sort of the

00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,879
driver for the

00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,959
session because this conversation is

00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:23,519
happening right now the european union

00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:25,280
is working on iai legislation the united

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,959
states is advancing regulations

00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,840
lots of other countries are but there

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:32,560
isn't a global a global law yet

00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,480
not yet and since ai is a general

00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,440
purpose technology it's hard to know

00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,840
when to apply

00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,720
what laws or what interventions to what

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,840
problems

00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,000
that's what we're trying to get at in

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,720
the session nice okay so you're working

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,879
on it

00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,799
kiwako in the session the participants

00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,159
had to work together to find a solution

00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,360
to problematic uses of

00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:54,799
ai um did some of the solutions that

00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,799
they came up with surprise you

00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,720
and actually i'd say we were more

00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,879
focused on

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,599
deepening the understanding of ai harm

00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:05,200
systems through typology exercise

00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,879
it was really helpful and effective

00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,879
exercise the reason about complex

00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:11,599
matters like ai systems

00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:13,120
um for example i picked organization

00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:15,680
critical policy ai

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,280
as typology and we discussed what are

00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,479
the effective criteria that define

00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,919
organization type in

00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:23,199
aircraft technology benefits of air

00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:25,280
technology

00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,520
accountability system technical capacity

00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,520
of the

00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,880
and organization was really different

00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,800
directions thinking start from

00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,040
categorization and think about what

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,440
exact classification would be useful

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,040
in sorting air homes and you actually

00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,479
gain a deeper understanding of the

00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,199
systems

00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:44,880
all right and um alex was there anything

00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,280
that came up that you might be able to

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,479
use

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:51,280
in practice in the near future yeah

00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,479
for sure i um i was really inspired when

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,320
you spend a lot of time

00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:55,600
working on this you get siloed into how

00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,919
you think about the world

00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,919
so it's too much i think about sometimes

00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,520
it's governments using ai and we need to

00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,440
give citizens more feedback and

00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,440
sometimes it's private companies using

00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,199
ai and we need to have more of a role of

00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,680
government oversight or something like

00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,919
that

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,759
but there's so many different ways to

00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:13,039
conceive of the world of ai

00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,039
and that's what we got from the

00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,440
participants some of them thought about

00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,400
ai

00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,960
and how transparent is it to me do i as

00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,880
the person

00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,720
receiving a decision understand what was

00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,479
happening can i go look at the code do i

00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,120
understand what choices it's making

00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:29,199
yeah another example we got was about is

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,919
it power centralizing there's a really

00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,560
fantastic

00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,919
conversation about how for some people

00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,080
it's important that ai

00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:38,080
um brings power together and is more

00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,039
sort of authoritarian or autocratic and

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,440
for other people there's

00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:43,120
instances where ai can give them power

00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,120
give them influence over the world and

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,759
it's more democratic or decentralizing

00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,440
the power

00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,120
and that's not always how i think about

00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,479
the world and so it was valuable to me

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,520
to sort of challenge my

00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:57,039
internal typology of how ai uh

00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:59,199
affects us all right and and um

00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:02,400
what is in your opinion the biggest

00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,400
danger of ai

00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:08,800
oh biggest danger of ai

00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,360
like in the dystopian world take us with

00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,400
you

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,240
what could happen if we don't

00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,479
use it in a right way in a responsible

00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,479
way

00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,440
the most demonstration

00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:26,160
i guess yeah some people are talking

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,360
about the artistic general intelligence

00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,479
so i guess that

00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,039
uh yeah artistry intelligence can take

00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,639
us all

00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:35,280
humans yeah we don't want that we don't

00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,080
want that

00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:40,080
um and um for you both if people want to

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:44,560
know more about using ai in real life

00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,560
uh what would you advise them to do any

00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,840
tips

00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,960
so our space ai in real life was created

00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:04,080
to collect insights and evidence

00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,639
in diverse contexts of what it actually

00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,639
means to

00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,639
develop and deploy air systems from

00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,880
proximate perspectives

00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,240
and this is because there are not enough

00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:15,039
data and evidence

00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,000
in this system it has been mostly

00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:19,599
collected from the

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,199
western countries and um other societal

00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:24,240
contexts or industries it's

00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:27,199
like massively underrepresented so

00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,400
um so the tips is that i i would like

00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:31,599
you to

00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:35,039
start collecting in your

00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:36,880
uh context and uh know

00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,560
how to say no perspective it's like a

00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,120
minor it's it's really

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,759
like we need a diverse context um the

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,639
quality

00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,160
qualitative and quantitative data so for

00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,000
example tomorrow we have a session

00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,479
called developing tools for ai

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,400
implementation case studies equipment

00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:54,400
committees for self-authorship

00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,919
which i highly recommend because it's

00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,319
going to introduce you with

00:07:55,919 --> 00:08:00,879
methodologies and tools and mindset

00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,319
to create a case studies that could

00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:05,039
impact

00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,160
air policies in your own communities and

00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,240
countries

00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,759
okay nice so that's a great tip for

00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,560
people that still have some time

00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,479
tomorrow

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,160

paranoid thriller participants are being

taken on a virtual thrill ride to

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,800
explore themes like deception conspiracy

00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,200
and the way humans create meaning and

00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,480
make

00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:56,800
connections hello lance

thistle sounds very exciting deep fake

00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,360
paranoid thriller

00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,079
can you tell us a bit more about it yeah

00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,160
the

00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:06,480
basically we're going to take you on

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,000
kind of a thrill ride it's a

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,320
it's kind of a bit of an alternate

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,480
reality game meets an escape room

00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:17,839
meets a bit of i'd say role-playing

00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:20,079
uh it's for about 50 different people

00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,959
who will be 50 to 60 participants will

00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,279
be able to come in

00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,959
it takes place in zoom and mirror and

00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:27,040
it's like this thrill ride

00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,000
so it's uh it's very exciting you know

00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,200
people will be able to

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,200
meet new people and also um about

00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,560
90 percent of the experience is actually

00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,440
made by an ai

00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,160
so nice yeah all the creative ai

00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,760
wranglers

00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,440
were agreeing on the fact that nobody

00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,440
wanted to miss out on this session

00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,440
because it's so creative

00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,839
what makes this session so unique when

00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,040
it comes to the storytelling

00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,720
well i think when it comes to the

00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,200
storytelling it's a really interesting

00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,920
mix

00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:56,240
of this ability to step into an

00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:59,279
immersive world the idea is that you

00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,160
are fully immersed and you're with other

00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,399
people

00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,360
uh going through and that the story

00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,279
doesn't happen

00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,440
unless you're part of it right so

00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:09,839
normally traditional story is

00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,560
very uh hierarchical you know it kind of

00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:12,480
comes top

00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,880
down this is very much like kind of

00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,959
bottom up in a really exciting way

00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,720
and um and i think it is a really

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:20,800
interesting way to virtually connect in

00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,720
a time where we're physically distanced

00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,639
for sure so it's not just passive

00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,200
listening you're really you need to be

00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,440
active

00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,519
you're going to be doing things very

00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,680
cool why do you think it's so important

00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:34,560
nowadays to explore themes like

00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:36,480
misinformation and deception well i

00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:39,200
think that there's a lot of polarization

00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,560
currently i think we live in a very

00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,920
fragmented world

00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,880
and some of the work that we're doing

00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:46,800
with this uh is it's kind of exploring

00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,399
that polarization and it's looking at

00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,880
some of the challenges that we face

00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,959
in terms of how we can have a collective

00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,760
narrative um there's a lot of

00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:57,760
kind of misinformation in terms of how

00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,839
things spread very quickly you know fake

00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:02,959
news spreads much faster than

00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:05,839
you know real news yeah say factual

00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:06,639
very clickable yeah exactly and so i

00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:09,680
think a lot of

00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:11,760
a lot of the goal for us is to uh

00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,519
is to kind of allow people to step in

00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:17,760
and start to learn sorry that's my dog

00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:20,480
yeah it's it's immersive it's reality

00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,480
to learn um how they can you know maybe

00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:25,920
better prepare themselves

00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:27,440
for uh for the 21st century cool

00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,519
and if people want to know more about

00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:32,839
this new way of storytelling where

00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:35,760
can they find you can they reach you

00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:38,399
somewhere

00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,120
