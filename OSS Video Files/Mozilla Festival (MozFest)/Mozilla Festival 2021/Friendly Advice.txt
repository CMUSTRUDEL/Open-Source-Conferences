Description: 
	Jonas Lund and Sarah Allen chat about Friendly Artist, which is a new online performative artwork by Jonas Lund, in which he invites anyone to book his time for whatever purpose they chose*  life-coach, remote friend, hang out with you while you cook. The sessions are watched by a range of performance measuring algorithms and AI’s’ that analyze Jonas' behavior in real-time and track his performance, nudges him to be his best self, and suggest things to say, or topics to discuss. Jonas and Sarah will chat about the project, and the data.

00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:11,360
hello

00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,559
hi um well for those who might be

00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,719
watching the live stream

00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:17,039
uh my name is sarah allen i'm the

00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:20,560
director of mozfest and i'm here with

00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:23,840
jonas lund and his project friendly

00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:28,640
advice uh jonas

00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,640
so this project yes

00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:36,559
uh the project yes so before um

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,960
saying anything it's like i would say

00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:39,840
this

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,040
session is entirely up to you to decide

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,440
what we're gonna do

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,960
it's like entirely at your discretion to

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,920
pick and choose exactly what we're going

00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,559
to address

00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,000
so if you then address me to introduce

00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:53,280
the project i will gladly

00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,520
do so this

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,000
this time to learn more about the

00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,000
project

00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,479
i'm happy to oblige yes so i can show

00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,400
first i can just

00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:11,920
demonstrate or like introduce the

00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,400
project

00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,759
which is a new commission for the

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,960
mozilla festival

00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:20,799
and sarah invited me after a meeting

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,520
about a month and a half ago i think

00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,320
something like this yes so it's been

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,759
produced

00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:31,040
in the last month let's say and it's uh

00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:35,040
online performative artwork which

00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:37,040
can he has online performance artwork

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,840
whatever that entails actually

00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,920
but in this is context and setup it's i

00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,920
invite anybody to book my time

00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,720
just like in this type of session and

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,600
this time slots are around one hour

00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,240
and this is entirely up to the person

00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,479
who books

00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:55,240
to use my time for whatever they want

00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:58,079
here are some examples on the website

00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:59,360
friendlyadvice.online which is so i will

00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,280
be your life coach

00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,560
remote friend hang out with hang out

00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,640
with you while you cook

00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,479
watch you browse social media the last

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,000
person missing for your group game

00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,080
assist you with your conceptual art

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,160
problems help you decide what to eat

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,760
remote watch your kids solve your

00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,760
programming problems

00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,800
help like play a song or do absolutely

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,200
nothing

00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,239
and this is going on while this is going

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,200
on like in this

00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,080
totally speculative one hour zoom

00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,280
hangout

00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:29,520
i'm being them what i'm being watched by

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,920
not machines of loving grace but

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:35,680
machines of

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:37,920
horrible judgmental positioning

00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,879
so i'm being watched by a range of

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,519
performance

00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:44,640
measuring algorithms and ais that

00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:48,239
analyze my behavior in real time

00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:50,800
including like my intensity productivity

00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,560
attention my current emotion the

00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,879
sentiment of what i say and

00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,239
how much i talk if i talk too much or

00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:59,840
too little

00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:02,159
and uh it sort of suggests based on all

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,080
this metric it collects it suggests

00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:07,200
things i should talk about or things i

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:10,560
should say to try and be my best self

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,239
it's a sort of uh reinforcement

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,159
learning i think within artificial

00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,200
intelligence a lot of the principles

00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,599
it's about

00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,120
reinforcement learning like you train

00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,599
something over and over and you have a

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,519
sort of

00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:25,200
correct correct um like a training data

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,680
sets it's usually in two parts

00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,200
it's sort of the data you haven't

00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,200
classified and the data that is

00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,480
classified as correct that you can use

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,319
as a sort of test

00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,840
to see if your ai is performing well or

00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,440
not so

00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,720
and then in this case it's called like a

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,840
reinforcement learning because you

00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,640
reinforce the

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,040
the correct behavior so in a way it's me

00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,440
i'm

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,159
subjecting myself to being reinforcement

00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,640
trained

00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,519
by the system that i programmed in a way

00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,360
to kind of

00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,000
you know for me it's more about making

00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:57,920
visible or slightly more tangible

00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,560
that on the sort of hidden or

00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,599
really obvious consequences of automated

00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,040
decision-making

00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:07,519
processes i think in a way i think

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,959
simply described is this so on the

00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,519
website you have a

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:13,280
booking system which is like book a

00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,439
friendly advice with jonas lund which is

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,519
scheduled which unfortunately at this

00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:19,519
point is fully booked out

00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,359
but it's unfortunate for you as the

00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,919
viewer in case you were curious

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:25,840
or had some great tasks for me and it's

00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,680
also slightly unfortunate for me because

00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,919
it means i have to spend time

00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,440
in non-stop in zoom for the coming week

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,199
and a half but actually i'm very excited

00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,080
about it because it's super nice

00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,759
but there is a waiting list so in case

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,199
there is a cancellation or there's more

00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,400
sessions coming up

00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:46,160
due to increased demand of my

00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:47,840
time we can you'll get notified in case

00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,759
there's an opening

00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,520
and it's like kind of on a first come

00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,919
first serve basis

00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,440
so i think in in general that's the

00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:58,960
introduction of the project

00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,800
yeah and just in case folks wanna

00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,560
and stay engaged and learn more about

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,080
the project you and i will do something

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,400
post-mozzfest around

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,199
the reports that come from this so you

00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,240
can

00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,440
and you can attend and hang out with

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,280
jonas at other times

00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,560
so yes it's kind of this is great

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,320
because it's just point

00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,639
pointed out that you're talking to we're

00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:21,440
being very well about your own work

00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:23,199
and so that you were you know you you

00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,120
you entered the classifications

00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,560
and the ultimate desire here is to be

00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,720
your very best self

00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,240
so what were the what were the

00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,880
measurements that you added

00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,240
to be able to quantify when you are out

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,240
here

00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,080
that is it's such a good question and i

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,919
think it's exactly at the heart

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,400
of all of this like if you're thinking

00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:44,720
about artificial intelligence

00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,960
which is really not what we would think

00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,639
about as intelligence to begin with

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,160
but we call it artificial intelligence

00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,800
because that's the domain

00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,560
and in all sort of algorithmic and

00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,759
automated decision-making

00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,639
processes that we are subjected to on a

00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,039
daily basis

00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,400
pretty much constantly almost all kind

00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,800
of automatic systems

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,520
are now governed by opaque algorithms

00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,800
and weird

00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:11,440
neural networks i think most visibly

00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,080
uh like social media is the most sort of

00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,560
that you

00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,080
entirely you can feel it very quickly

00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,560
especially if you're on instagram or

00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,199
twitter

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,240
or using google or facebook because

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,560
these things are

00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,000
it's really like you're kind of working

00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,800
against the item to try and work

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,280
out what's happening right and very

00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,840
often

00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,280
it's entirely opaque what the decision

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,240
is made on

00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,440
so you don't really know what why

00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,080
certain things perform

00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,840
better than others but you with social

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,680
media you can sort of guess

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,600
that there they optimize their

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,840
algorithms for engagement

00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,960
over anything else because that's what

00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,880
sells

00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,160
that's what makes them money in

00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,840
basically because they're in the

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,160
business of selling our attention

00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,960
to the highest bidder for advertising

00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,280
right

00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,440
so in the question of this system i'll

00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,080
try how to figure out what metrics to

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,199
kind of

00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:06,080
use to improve myself

00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:07,599
it's slightly opaque as well but there

00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,520
are certain triggers

00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:10,960
like in terms of talking too much or

00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:14,560
talking too little

00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:16,479
and it's uh also in constant adjustments

00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,039
because the only way to really test how

00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:22,400
it works is to do the decisions

00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:23,840
so i have some like dials very often

00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,639
when it comes to algorithms

00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,919
or these automatic processes it's

00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,280
described as dials

00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:33,360
right so you tweak a dial of this

00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,360
particular type of content that you want

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,319
to favor over this particular type of

00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,240
content

00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,160
and that could be as simple as how many

00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,919
words per minute is normal

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,199
in a normal conversation when it's

00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,960
balanced

00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,120
but then it also very much depends on

00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,680
what type of conversation it is

00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,759
because if it's in this scenario like an

00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,680
interview situation

00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,440
clearly i will be talking a lot because

00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,240
i'm trying to answer questions

00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,199
but if it's more of a therapeutic kind

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,720
of session

00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:03,120
then obviously i shouldn't be talking so

00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:06,080
much because it's all based on

00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:08,080
like listening so then you have to work

00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,240
out how to classify

00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,879
the type of conversation before it's

00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,879
something else

00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,840
the fact that you're talking so much

00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,199
because it's joy or you're talking so

00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,000
much because it's anger

00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,280
like that's by that this is also a good

00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,720
question because it could be

00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:28,879
then there a lot of positive talk

00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,240
with high sentiment obviously that's

00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,680
quite good probably

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,360
but then a lot of talk with negative

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,039
sentiment uh could

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,800
be bad but could also be really good

00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,719
because that's super engaging

00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,479
all right because like fear and anger is

00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:43,519
the most engaging

00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:45,920
like emotional triggers in our brain so

00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,440
in a way like how these three algorithms

00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,399
are programmed the intensity

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,880
productivity

00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,160
and attention i think they're quite good

00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,720
because the productivity

00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,920
is somehow very simply suggests that if

00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,120
i'm talking a lot

00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,959
my productivity decreases because it's

00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,560
based on me sitting in front of my

00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:05,440
computer typing away

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,000
so the productivity algorithm optimizes

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,800
for me

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,320
talking not a lot and having a very

00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,240
neutral expression

00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,959
because it's somehow the computer phase

00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:18,160
you know like this

00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:19,519
so it actually is piano there's facial

00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,279
recognition here

00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,640
yes you can see this little box

00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:25,600
following my face

00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,880
by measuring my emotions yeah so then

00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,440
you can see right now my

00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,720
current emotion is neutral but if i fake

00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,720
smile i'm going to be

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,080
uh current i'm going to be happy i can

00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,080
demonstrate

00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,080
yeah demonstrate your eyebrows let me

00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,760
see maybe get some surprise in there

00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:43,040
let's see

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:45,440
shocked okay

00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,320
maybe disgust i mean it will come yeah

00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,000
see happy

00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:53,279
yay i managed so good

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,800
so and then next to this there's a bunch

00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:57,360
of different triggers

00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,480
that facilitates or augments the

00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,040
conversation

00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,560
so if i would talk about it's cold here

00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,560
or the berlin weather

00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,240
you like get to see the weather in

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,440
berlin straight away

00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,839
now it's again yes

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,760
or if i mention like some other artworks

00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,920
of mine it will show pictures of

00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:18,160
this artworks like if i'm talking about

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,480
the una sloan token project or

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,279
the fear of missing out you get images

00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,760
that pop up

00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:25,440
so it's a sort of automatic presentation

00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,600
tool as well

00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,880
in a way and then it warns me when i'm

00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,000
talking about things that we shouldn't

00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,240
be talking about

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,360
and this is like an art talk word

00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,120
detected

00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,480
where if you mention something like a

00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:40,079
conspiracy or

00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:42,480
trump or uh things you get warnings for

00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:44,560
uh possible controversial topics or

00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,040
political topics we gotta proceed with

00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,040
caution

00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:54,240
basically but this is so like

00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,959
to summarize to suggest the friendly

00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,360
advice

00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:59,120
this system is only for me it's not for

00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,640
the attendance for the person who books

00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,360
the session

00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:05,040
due to privacy concerns and everything

00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,680
so it's only analyzing me

00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,240
yeah so it's like sort of the underlying

00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,320
system

00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,040
in a way because it can also and

00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:16,160
sometimes it's also presented as

00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,760
did like this so it's only me

00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,760
so you don't really see the interface

00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,000
and only i get the feedback

00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,240
so i guess then it's really like uh

00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,880
somehow something else

00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,160
so but so it's kind of like the

00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,320
secondary part

00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,360
because the primary part of the piece is

00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,440
really this uh

00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,720
serendipitous encounters through

00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,880
differently advice

00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,640
session which i think is for me it's

00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,399
super exciting because i get to meet a

00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:43,360
lot of different people

00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,760
so yeah let's talk about so you've and i

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,040
think

00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:49,600
every it's three sessions a day and

00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,079
you've had everybody there people sign

00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,760
up

00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:53,440
without telling us who those people are

00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,760
i guess what are those requests for

00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:58,800
advice that they've come to you about

00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:00,800
so so far i've had like i can give

00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,160
three three four examples of different

00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,839
things

00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:08,560
yesterday i helped the person who

00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:08,959
was walking around in the city uh who

00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,800
had

00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,240
attempted just attempted to deliver a

00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,360
ups package

00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:18,480
but the drop-off shop was closed

00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,200
so she asked me to find the nearest ups

00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,399
package

00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:25,120
shop and direct her to the shop

00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:28,720
to like turn by turn sort of so i became

00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:31,200
like an automated google maps kind of

00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,880
kind of system which was really nice

00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,600
because it was i got to see

00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,480
like the view of the city which was

00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,519
really nice

00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:42,240
because then i was stuck at home

00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,680
practical uh and also yesterday i was

00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,079
speaking with someone who

00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,680
wanted feedback on a recently published

00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:51,120
article

00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:54,000
with the title of why doesn't the key

00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,800
a on a piano and a violin sound

00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,160
different

00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,040
even if they're 440 hertz so the article

00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,440
tried to

00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,279
explain or like give the explanation as

00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,720
to why they sound so different

00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:08,240
with the sort of interactive article

00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,160
where you could change the code and

00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:13,200
upload your own sounds so it

00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:15,279
diverged into us analyzing and comparing

00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,399
brown noise versus white noise and

00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:18,959
what's the difference

00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,800
and then it was super interesting yes it

00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:23,760
was like really nice

00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,279
and and then i was speaking with someone

00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:28,320
who needed advice on

00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:31,120
how to do corporate team building in the

00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:35,360
age of a pandemic

00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,360
yeah trigger word pandemic

00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,519
so my suggestion to that was to organize

00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:41,760
some among us

00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:44,000
uh among us gaming sessions because

00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,600
that's always really nice

00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,399
well if you're not familiar with that

00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,399
it's a great game

00:13:53,279 --> 00:14:00,000
and you have

00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:03,199
and i i think like i was recommended

00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
and your work and through um a third

00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:06,560
party

00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,040
and i was really excited to see the

00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,800
breadth

00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,880
of what you were designing from the

00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,120
token to

00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,880
other and exhibitions that you've done

00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,120
do you want to maybe share with us

00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:19,920
a little bit more about your work and

00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:22,399
and the amazon token

00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,120
uh yeah for sure i can do this browser

00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:26,320
again

00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,920
uh so i usually say that like most of my

00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:32,079
work is about

00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:33,360
power or like power hierarchical power

00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:36,639
structures right

00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:39,680
like the the triangle like in

00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:42,320
how in most systems this top here makes

00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:44,959
the decisions for all the other people

00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,399
and networks so distributed networks

00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:49,600
centralized networks

00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,720
and all of this so in particular in

00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,440
certain contexts

00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,240
who gets to speak for whom and in what

00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,320
context

00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,320
so how we distribute agency and all

00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,000
these different systems

00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,399
and a lot of my work has been about the

00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,120
art world as a network in particular

00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,519
because that's like a super hierarchical

00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,399
uh

00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,800
power structure like it's really due to

00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,440
the

00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,000
how like the subjective value production

00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,839
in art

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,360
like there is not no like real

00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:17,680
quantifiable metrics

00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,279
in determining what's good and bad so

00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,920
everything centers around this

00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:24,320
institutional theory of art that art is

00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:27,760
whatever the art world says is art

00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:29,120
so then like that's such a uh for me

00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,800
coming in the background of being a

00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,040
programmer this is like so

00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,000
ripe for some type of loophole

00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,160
exploitation

00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,160
find some shortcuts something something

00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,040
something so i made a lot of work about

00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,680
this

00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,120
but like i can show a couple of

00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,839
different examples of

00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:48,399
such works so one of the more like

00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:50,000
directly correlated to this is this

00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:51,519
project which is called the jonas lund

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,120
token which

00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:57,120
is a project that

00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,720
the basis is that i created a hundred

00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:02,079
thousand voting shares

00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:04,160
in my artistic practice so uh

00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:05,600
now it overlays other pictures on top

00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,320
because i'm talking about art

00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,880
but that's good news so basically if you

00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,480
get a token you get to vote on proposals

00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,399
for my artistic practice

00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:17,839
and you do all of this on this website

00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:21,199
called jlt.ltd

00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:23,759
so it's a way for me to try and optimize

00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:25,120
optimize which in itself is a very

00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:28,240
complicated and

00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,600
dubious term right because what what do

00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:33,199
i optimize for

00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,759
and what's the sort of core ideology

00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:36,720
behind

00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:38,480
this optimization strategy but in this

00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,360
case i'm optimizing for sort of

00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,720
uh increasing my the success of my

00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,880
artistic career

00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,560
because the theory is that if i make a

00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,120
hundred thousand vote insurance

00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,800
that are a function which is actually a

00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,639
cryptocurrency built on top of the

00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:55,839
ethereum blockchain

00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,240
and then if the if my career performs

00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,880
better

00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,360
the token will be more valuable so then

00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,079
all the

00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:04,000
members are incentivized to reach a

00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:06,319
strategic decision in relation to my

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,360
practice based on this financial

00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:10,400
incentive

00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:12,959
yeah and right now there's a 102

00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:15,039
members of this jonathan token board and

00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:18,000
they get to vote on all kinds of things

00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:18,640
so this is one example from earlier last

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,520
year

00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,079
a tale of four cities which city to live

00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,079
in

00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:25,439
so it's a question to the board on what

00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:28,880
city i should live in

00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:31,679
oh and yes so it has some

00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,799
real life consequences this artwork yes

00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:34,640
so it's like

00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:36,559
the the pitch is like for the longest

00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,360
time i've had troubles deciding where to

00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:39,679
be based

00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,799
every city place location comes with its

00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:43,200
pros and cons

00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:45,120
and this question has been an unanswered

00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,880
one for the last seven years

00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,559
and without any clarity towards where to

00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:51,520
invest and build

00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:53,360
so it says here it's funny it's top

00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,280
secret actually so i shouldn't share it

00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,919
because this is only available to token

00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,960
holders

00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:01,200
so anyways so the four options is

00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,160
amsterdam berlin london and countryside

00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,160
sweden

00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,640
and then in the end the board decides

00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:09,840
that i should live in berlin

00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:12,960
so where you are right now exactly

00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:15,440
yes so it's the minimum effort you know

00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,280
yeah but i secretly hoped that that

00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,880
because countryside sweden was in the

00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,480
lead for a long time

00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,799
and i was secretly hoping they would

00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,520
vote out because then i could justify

00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:26,799
moving to the countryside sweden as part

00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,520
of my artistic practice

00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:31,840
right but so then you get a log of all

00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:35,039
the different votes

00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:37,440
or then you kind of uh so this is like

00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:38,400
and the way you get tokens is by getting

00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:42,799
like wall-based

00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:46,320
pieces like artworks that look like um

00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:46,960
like this for example wait explain that

00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,080
but again

00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,840
the way okay things you get so there is

00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,799
a couple of different ways in which you

00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,360
can acquire

00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,559
the una slum token the most obvious is

00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:59,600
to purchase an

00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:00,559
artwork which is in in the yonasalum

00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,960
token

00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:04,240
sphere you're they're doubly investing

00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,640
in you right

00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,760
yes basically yes it's a good

00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,080
observation

00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,360
in a way it's like the artwork is just

00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,080
like a coupon

00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,960
slash receipt like a relic of the

00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,520
transaction

00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,640
because the actual value is then the the

00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,559
tokens

00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:23,440
but they're also quite pretty so it

00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:26,080
serves as a double function in a way

00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,960
so this is yes i actually keep going

00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,720
keep going

00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,320
so this piece here like careful

00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,080
calibration and consideration

00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,760
it's three hundred and sixty one

00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,840
eurozone tokens

00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,039
so if you buy this one you get 361

00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,600
tokens

00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:42,559
in a way so that's the main principle

00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:44,880
way of getting it but there's also

00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:45,760
a bounty program which is relevant for

00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:49,280
you

00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:51,919
because because check this out

00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,720
in the bounty program you can receive

00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:55,760
tokens

00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:58,960
by doing favors for me so

00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:02,320
it's like instrumentalizing the whole

00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:05,200
favor for favor art world setup right

00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,559
so uh include a work by jonas lund in a

00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:10,400
group show in a gallery

00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:12,000
can get you 10 to 200 tokens include a

00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,240
work by jonas learning a group show in

00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,640
an institution can give you more

00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,000
feature jonas host unison solo

00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,400
exhibition

00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,679
invite jonas lund to give a talk for

00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,159
example

00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:25,120
give a workshop there is no commission

00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:27,600
here but

00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:29,200
how many tokens am i getting exactly

00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,840
well then you have to claim a

00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,240
token here and then and then you can see

00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,919
the

00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,320
log of all the people who received

00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:38,480
tokens for doing certain things like

00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:40,159
this is like uh simon denny included a

00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,880
work by jonas lund in a group show in an

00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,880
institution

00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,159
which is the chico pavilion show and

00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:47,039
then

00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:48,320
so it's kind of like it's really also

00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:51,840
making visible this

00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:54,320
unknown sort of uh

00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,360
it's not necessarily nepotism but there

00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:59,200
is something of

00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:00,480
the fact like something of there's

00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,480
something really great about the

00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,159
transparency of this right so you're

00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,799
showing how everything is

00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:08,240
the dots are joining right so you know

00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:10,799
by investing

00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,720
in your art you're also saying to folks

00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,760
you're investing in the future your

00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,000
future career

00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,120
and in that sense the artwork that they

00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,840
have at home

00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:21,679
and they're able to like make those

00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,880
showing those decisions on who's taking

00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:26,400
those decisions

00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:28,159
and it's like really informative right i

00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,960
think it's

00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:32,559
it's very brave can i say that you're

00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,679
allowed to say that

00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:36,320
and i can be like thank you very much i

00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:38,480
mean it's

00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:40,559
it's like i do a lot of those types of

00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:43,280
work where i create like a system

00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:44,559
like so i define all the rules of how

00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,640
the system operates

00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:47,600
and then like i let it go and then i see

00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,440
what happens

00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,039
and part of it is like automatic part of

00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,480
it is somehow structural

00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:54,799
it's all about creating some type of

00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:57,120
bigger context or community

00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:59,039
or something where you create something

00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,280
else so i don't know how brave it is

00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:03,360
it's more like um

00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,880
i mean if you if you consider it brave

00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:07,120
it's what i mean because

00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,919
other people decide where you live i

00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,159
think yes

00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:12,159
yes but i think then that kind of ties

00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:14,080
back into this whole idea around

00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:16,080
kind of the algorithms and the decisions

00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,520
that go into algorithms that affect us

00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,840
in our day-to-day and so

00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:21,360
often we're not part of those decisions

00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,760
that are making those

00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,120
corrective u-turns or left or right

00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:29,200
turns and so

00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:30,799
maybe you how would you be the algorithm

00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,720
are you living

00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:34,240
a living data set of the algorithm i

00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,840
mean in a way

00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,600
it's true though like i mean there's

00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,600
certainly a parallel between like

00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,280
being subjected to this automatic

00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:44,320
decision making all the time

00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:46,640
and then trying to reclaim more agency

00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,840
in these situations where often you feel

00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,679
like you don't have any

00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,600
yeah and in particular these like

00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:54,799
massive networks online

00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,280
and in this way it's more to share like

00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:58,240
every

00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:59,840
every artist i know have like a group of

00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,640
people they ask for advice

00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:04,240
about certain things but in this way

00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,880
it's a bit more instrumentalized and

00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,880
it's a bit more

00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,799
i'm not sure how to say it exactly but

00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:13,440
it feels

00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:14,960
uh very often it gets very complicated

00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,039
with this advice because

00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,559
often the people you ask for advice are

00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:20,320
also artists and there's a lot of

00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:21,200
competition and there's a lot of sort of

00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:24,400
back and forth

00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,400
so in this way it's more

00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:29,919
because there's now 102 people i also

00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:32,080
get a bit more distance to the whole

00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:32,960
thing although all the advice is really

00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,039
on point

00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,320
so it's a bit like it's a bit like

00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:39,360
trying to create a

00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:42,919
i mean the tagline is a decentralized

00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:45,760
autonomous artistic practice distributed

00:23:42,919 --> 00:23:49,120
decentralized autonomous all like what

00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:50,240
web 3.0 is like what cryptocurrency

00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,960
represents

00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,880
so in a way that was also my goal so

00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,720
actually the end goal of the project is

00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:00,000
to remove myself entirely

00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:02,559
as soon as i lose like my majority share

00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,720
i can become i don't have to do anything

00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:06,080
anymore then like it can run by itself

00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:09,679
that's its own entity

00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:12,080
as a sort of auto autonomous organizing

00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:12,960
organization as well that will be the

00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:16,960
goal but

00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:19,360
i'm not sure there's one example

00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,080
i can show this one because i find it so

00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:23,679
it's like a

00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:25,440
work i did last year for i the system is

00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:28,799
telling me to relax

00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:31,840
yeah because i'm talking too much but

00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:33,360
so it this was a part of a show which

00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,640
was organized by a couple of friends of

00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,880
mine here in berlin

00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,480
where they did an exhibition in these

00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:41,200
e-scooters

00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,559
so they placed like mini wi-fi routers

00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,559
in the e-scooters

00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:45,760
that would only turn on when you rented

00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:47,520
the e-scooter

00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,960
and as soon as the router is on you can

00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,640
connect to it with your phone and then

00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,400
you get to see some net art

00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,840
and i love this concept because i find

00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,240
it so funny

00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,279
and in the text everything was about

00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,120
capitalism

00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:00,880
it's like this type of capitalism this

00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:03,039
type of capitalism it's like the gig

00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,760
economy capitalism this capitalist or

00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:06,320
not

00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:07,200
so i made this text-based piece which

00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,679
just takes

00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,360
the top thousand most common nouns in

00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:15,200
the english language

00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:17,440
and juxtaposes it with capitalism

00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,360
and i was really shocked at how strong

00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,960
of an emotional response you get from

00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,279
all these words

00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,720
so like output capitalism maybe it's not

00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:28,480
the best example but

00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:31,840
like fruit capitalism what is

00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:33,200
it sounds so dark and like a blacksmith

00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:36,400
capitalism

00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,600
so i was like corner capitalism that one

00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,640
is easy to imagine

00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:42,320
it's a bit too fast actually season

00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,840
this piece is still live isn't that

00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,400
correct you can yes yes this

00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,679
just keeps on running forever audience

00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,320
capitalism is pretty

00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,320
appropriate

00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,440
i was just wondering like thinking about

00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:59,279
the

00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:01,120
token piece um how much i might

00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:02,640
how many tokens i might have earned from

00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,039
bringing you to mozfest and then

00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,400
thinking

00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:09,200
about if i put forward a

00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,799
a question to you and then if maybe

00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,400
folks

00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:13,840
so if i put forward a question would you

00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,440
actually

00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:18,960
could i use my tokens to see if you

00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:22,480
would do the the outcome which would be

00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,919
would do a large group session if

00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,600
a certain number of people got on your

00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:28,480
waiting list

00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,960
uh oh yes i mean in principle that could

00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,080
be

00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,880
uh it's possible would be possible but

00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:36,799
there are some

00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:39,520
restrictions unfortunately so if you

00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:41,520
go here this is actually my favorite

00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:44,640
part of this whole project

00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:46,400
is here it's like the terms of ownership

00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:49,440
so this is the terms of ownership

00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:53,360
contract for any jonas land token holder

00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:56,400
so here it says on paragraph

00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:59,120
17 owner may submit

00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,000
proposals to the jlt holders and board

00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:04,080
of trustees

00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:06,320
if owner holds at least 1 000 tokens

00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:08,080
so you would have to get 1000 tokens and

00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:10,000
then you can submit proposals to the

00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:13,039
board okay fine so you're saying

00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,440
yeah so i'm saying it's if

00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:18,159
i'm saying it's unlikely that you will

00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:21,279
receive 1000 tokens as bounties

00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:24,320
we should talk about this offline sure

00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:25,600
but in principle that's my goal yes like

00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:29,360
that's what i would wish

00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:30,960
to have to have it in such a way that

00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,399
all the board members can just submit

00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,080
proposals all the time

00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:36,080
because then it also increases the

00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,000
autonomy of the piece itself

00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:40,240
if everyone who has a token can submit

00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,919
the proposal that gets voted on and all

00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,440
of it is just like this

00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:44,960
then it's more a question of who

00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,039
executes the deci

00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,720
like the output like if there's a

00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:51,120
question of

00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,640
that concerns my time how is that

00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:56,880
negotiated in terms of

00:27:52,640 --> 00:28:00,880
exchange but the token element of it

00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:03,679
if you've got a waiting list of say

00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,720
40 50 people would you consider adding

00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:07,120
extra sessions

00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,080
or a group session yes for sure yeah

00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:11,120
totally yeah

00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:12,080
okay so yeah completely everybody sign

00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,840
up to the waiting list

00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:16,000
and he will inform you to your group

00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:19,520
session

00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,760
no absolutely it's like um it's uh it's

00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,799
still early days we're only on the

00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,919
fourth day

00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:27,840
yeah so we'll see i think also because

00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:29,919
it's also a learning experience for me

00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:31,440
in how to be the best sort of advice

00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:34,960
giver and

00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:37,039
supplier yourself obviously as well yes

00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,480
so i think uh absolutely i'm totally

00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:40,399
open for that i think also

00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,760
that was the point of adding a waiting

00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:44,480
list to

00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:45,840
adjust the amount of sessions and stuff

00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,960
depending on demand

00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:52,480
and then also it's like it's now made

00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:54,240
for the mozilla festival as the first

00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,840
context of this work which i think is a

00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:59,120
perfect

00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:00,399
perfect collaboration because so many of

00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,720
the topics in my work

00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:04,320
is addressed more practically and

00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:07,760
specifically by mozilla

00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:11,200
in how to actually improve the health

00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:14,720
of the internet of the festival right

00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:16,080
yes yes so there's so much like overlap

00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:19,120
in that because i think

00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,919
it's a lot of collaborative goals let's

00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,000
say

00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:22,960
and i'm very often very hopeless when i

00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,440
look at the current state of the

00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,279
internet

00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:28,159
thinking that it's like beyond repair

00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:28,159
and it's all just like

00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:34,480
yeah very depressing so i'm very very

00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:36,000
like uh it's very nice to have

00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,480
conversations with people who

00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,200
every day are fighting for improving

00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,880
this

00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,480
and increasing the discourse the

00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:45,360
understanding all of this

00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,840
thing so that being said like i think

00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,679
the big

00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,679
it begins like this the friendly advice

00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:52,880
but it's also likely to continue

00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:54,399
after as a way to

00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,919
every time i do an online talk for

00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:57,520
example it's such a

00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,600
immediate way of addressing a lot of

00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:02,399
these topics because you get to

00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:03,200
both experience and be the recipient of

00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:05,440
like

00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:07,039
this i mean a lot of my work is like

00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,080
making visible things that aren't

00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:10,080
necessarily visible

00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:12,399
or make it more tangible and i think in

00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:14,240
that sense it's it's very

00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:15,919
i think graspable yeah and this is what

00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,399
you do really really well with your work

00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:18,720
right

00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:20,399
and not just within the tokens but

00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,200
across all the conversations that you've

00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:22,640
been have

00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,320
all your artwork and the conversations

00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,399
that we've been having so i think we've

00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:28,640
come to the end of our time i think we

00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:29,840
just said we were going to be live for

00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,240
30 minutes but i know we could probably

00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:34,000
talk

00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:36,559
another hour and so we will

00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,600
we don't know what we're going to do yet

00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:41,760
jonathan
