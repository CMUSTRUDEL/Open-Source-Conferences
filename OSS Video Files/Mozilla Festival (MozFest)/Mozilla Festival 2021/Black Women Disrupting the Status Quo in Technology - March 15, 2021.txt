Title: Black Women Disrupting the Status Quo in Technology - March 15, 2021
Publication date: 2021-03-25
Playlist: Mozilla Festival 2021
Description: 
	There is a diversity crisis in the tech industry: a homogeneous group of technologists builds solutions for our diverse population. This lack of diversity yields biased technology products that, at best, donâ€™t serve everyone and, at worst, actively harm marginalized groups. This panel of distinguished Black women will discuss the intersectional oppression prevalent in the technology industry and how the voices and work of Black women are imperative in moving us in a more ethical, inclusive direction. This event is part of an ongoing lecture series "The Future is Intersectional: Black Women Interrogating Technology," organized by the Spelman College Center of Excellence for Minority Women in STEM, in collaboration with the Atlanta University Center Data Science Initiative, UCLA Center for Critical Internet Inquiry, and Mozilla. Panelists: Aerica Shimizu Banks (Founder, Shiso), Meredith Brossard (professor, Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute, NYU).
