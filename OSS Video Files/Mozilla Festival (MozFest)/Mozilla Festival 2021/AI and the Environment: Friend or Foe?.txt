Title: AI and the Environment: Friend or Foe?
Publication date: 2021-03-11
Playlist: Mozilla Festival 2021
Description: 
	This panel discussion plans to bring together leading journalists and experts who look at AI and the environment: both the unharnessed potential and potential pitfalls. We know that running AI -- including storing the data that enables it -- takes a huge toll on the environment. The question at hand is: is it worth it? How can AI be harnessed for climate modeling, satellite imagery and weather patterns to help farmers etc.? And, how do we balance the risks? Join us to find out. Panelists: Khari Johnson, Jackie Snow and Arunesh Sinha Moderator: Fieke Jansen

um

00:56:53,599 --> 00:56:57,119
we're excited for everybody to join us

00:56:55,680 --> 00:57:01,200
this is my first

00:56:57,119 --> 00:57:02,319
moss fest session of 2021 so

00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:04,640
we're kick-starting with an

00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:06,559
environmental discussion which is great

00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:07,839
and i'm very happy that we're joined by

00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:11,200
jackie snow alone

00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:13,359
singer and kyrie johnson

00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:15,680
i'll give a little intro into the panel

00:57:13,359 --> 00:57:16,160
and sort of uh the order of today for

00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:18,880
the next

00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:21,040
hour uh but while i'm doing that for

00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:23,280
those of you who are joining us it

00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:24,240
it might be nice if you can write down

00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:26,000
your name

00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:28,240
and maybe what brings you to the session

00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,040
so that the panelists and i can also see

00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:30,559
like

00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:32,960
who you are and what you want to get out

00:57:30,559 --> 00:57:35,920
of it um

00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:38,559
so john and sarah of mozilla they

00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:40,000
organized this panel to

00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:42,000
bring together sort of leading

00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,720
journalists and experts who are looking

00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,680
at ai

00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:47,440
and the environment both the unharmed

00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:48,960
sort of the unharmless potential and the

00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:50,799
potential pitfalls

00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:52,720
and so while a lot of the discussion

00:57:50,799 --> 00:57:53,520
around ai and sort of the environment

00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:55,200
looks at how

00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:57,200
data is stored how much energy is

00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:58,079
consumed can we do this climate neutral

00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:00,319
or not

00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:02,799
uh there's also other questions like is

00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:04,400
it worth it what are the gains

00:58:02,799 --> 00:58:05,920
and how can this be harnessed for sort

00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:09,359
of positive efforts

00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:11,280
and um there's already two um so our

00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:14,240
nash and jackie have some great examples

00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:14,559
as well about the conservational efforts

00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:17,200
uh

00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:19,119
done uh in relation to ai and i know

00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:20,880
jackie and kari are also

00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:22,400
have some critical questions related to

00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:26,160
ai and the environment

00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:28,000
so it will be great to get started um

00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:29,520
what we wanted to do today is sort of

00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,839
first have our

00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:33,520
amazing panelists uh spend spend some

00:58:31,839 --> 00:58:35,520
time telling you about their work

00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:36,720
about sort of the the questions they're

00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:39,440
struggling with

00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:40,079
uh give some examples uh we'll do it in

00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:42,640
the order

00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:45,520
where avanash will start as um

00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:47,119
afterwards jackie and then kari

00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:48,960
will have a small discussion amongst

00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:50,880
each other's that gives all of you also

00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:52,079
the time to sort of type in questions in

00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:53,760
the chat

00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:55,920
and then we can open the discussion to

00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:57,040
everybody maybe you have questions maybe

00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:59,839
you have comments

00:58:57,040 --> 00:59:03,920
maybe of things you want to share and

00:58:59,839 --> 00:59:05,839
that should take us to up to an hour

00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:07,359
then i hope we've had a really fruitful

00:59:05,839 --> 00:59:10,799
conversation

00:59:07,359 --> 00:59:12,799
i see in my tablet that some people

00:59:10,799 --> 00:59:13,920
are well one person has already

00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:15,680
introduced themselves

00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:17,040
so thanks for doing this other people

00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:20,240
also want to do it

00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:20,799
um we can sort of know what your

00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:24,079
interests

00:59:20,799 --> 00:59:26,000
are for joining this panel um and

00:59:24,079 --> 00:59:27,200
without further ado i'll just give it to

00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,599
arunesh

00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:32,119
who can talk about some of his work in

00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:35,040
of ai in relation to

00:59:32,119 --> 00:59:38,160
conservationalism sure

00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:41,359
okay so um so my name is

00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:44,240
sinha i am an assistant professor

00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:46,319
in singapore management university so my

00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:49,280
research is broadly in ai

00:59:46,319 --> 00:59:51,040
where i'm besides fundamental research i

00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:54,000
have worked on applications

00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:55,440
for like ai for security ai for

00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,760
conservation

00:59:55,440 --> 01:00:00,000
and ai for healthcare so uh so in the

00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:01,839
context of this discussion i'll talk a

01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:05,280
little bit about my work

01:00:01,839 --> 01:00:07,359
in ai for conservation so i got

01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:09,119
involved in this conservation project

01:00:07,359 --> 01:00:12,160
when i was doing a postdoc

01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:13,119
under under professor millan tambie so

01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:14,720
at that point

01:00:13,119 --> 01:00:16,160
milland had been working with

01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:18,440
collaborators and these

01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:20,799
include people from wildlife

01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:24,319
conservation society

01:00:20,799 --> 01:00:26,720
and uganda wildlife authority uh in the

01:00:24,319 --> 01:00:29,280
queen elizabeth national park in uganda

01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:30,480
uh the goal of that project of course

01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:34,160
was to prevent

01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:35,359
og so we had access to about 12 years

01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:38,480
worth of data

01:00:35,359 --> 01:00:40,319
so this was data where uh about where

01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:41,520
there had been coaching activity in the

01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:44,480
past

01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:46,319
or where the poachers had laid out these

01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:49,040
traps

01:00:46,319 --> 01:00:49,760
and and these traps or snares are really

01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:52,079
horrific

01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:53,680
they can capture animals and if you

01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:55,359
google search for it the images are

01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:58,720
really hard

01:00:55,359 --> 01:01:01,920
so if you don't want to then please

01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:02,400
don't search that uh but based on this

01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:05,760
data

01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:07,839
um we we built a predictive model

01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:08,839
of where the poachers would lay out

01:01:07,839 --> 01:01:12,160
traps in

01:01:08,839 --> 01:01:16,319
future so that's the predictive part

01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:19,440
but but ai is not just about prediction

01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:20,559
ai is also about how to optimize

01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:23,680
decision making

01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:24,160
on top of predictions so uh for this

01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:26,400
problem

01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:27,920
uh the decision here is uh where to

01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:31,200
petrol uh

01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:34,240
and uh this is patrolling by the rangers

01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:36,880
uh and clearly the wildlife park

01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:37,760
is huge and there are very few park

01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:40,799
rangers

01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:41,520
and not all areas can be controlled of

01:01:40,799 --> 01:01:43,760
course

01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:44,559
so it is very important to intelligently

01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:47,040
decide

01:01:44,559 --> 01:01:48,799
where to petrol so now it might seem

01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:51,359
like somewhat of a easy task

01:01:48,799 --> 01:01:52,799
like we should just patrol those areas

01:01:51,359 --> 01:01:56,079
with the highest

01:01:52,799 --> 01:01:58,000
risk of poaching activity

01:01:56,079 --> 01:02:00,720
and that might seem to be optimal but

01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:02,960
surprisingly it is not

01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:04,480
because the poachers also anticipate the

01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:07,039
rangers behavior

01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:09,119
and they might strike uh somewhere else

01:02:07,039 --> 01:02:12,960
far away from the poaching hotspots

01:02:09,119 --> 01:02:15,760
so uh so a somewhat sophisticated model

01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:17,119
of petrol decision making was used uh

01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:19,920
based on concepts of

01:02:17,119 --> 01:02:21,760
game theory uh so we first estimate the

01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:24,640
poachers response to the petroleum

01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:26,480
itself and then decide where to petrol

01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:28,319
so overall this work was great and it

01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:31,839
was actually successfully deployed

01:02:28,319 --> 01:02:35,920
so all of that seems uh nice but but

01:02:31,839 --> 01:02:39,280
it was not developed in one go

01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:41,920
there were many iterations of

01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:44,000
developing the predictive and petroleum

01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:47,680
models refining them

01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:50,559
accompanied with lot of frustration

01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:51,119
before we finally arrived at the final

01:02:50,559 --> 01:02:54,079
version

01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:56,079
that is used currently and this happened

01:02:54,079 --> 01:02:58,880
over a long time of

01:02:56,079 --> 01:03:00,720
three to four years now of course some

01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:02,400
of these iterations actually happened

01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:04,160
after i had moved on from this

01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:06,960
university moved off

01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:07,760
of this project but my friends and i

01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:10,640
want to mention

01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:11,119
uh my friend fei fang here continued to

01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:14,640
make

01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:16,799
such models uh much better

01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:19,359
the final product of course was quite

01:03:16,799 --> 01:03:22,559
successful it was successfully tested

01:03:19,359 --> 01:03:23,599
in many national parks in the field and

01:03:22,559 --> 01:03:27,440
the whole software

01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:29,440
was named paws and it is now integrated

01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:30,640
in a larger suit of software called

01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:32,960
smart

01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:34,559
that is used by many wildlife parks

01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:37,599
across the world

01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:40,240
so one thing i want to mention uh as a

01:03:37,599 --> 01:03:41,440
as a valuable lesson from this project

01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:45,280
is that

01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:46,880
uh ai for conservation projects are are

01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:49,039
quite different from the proof of

01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:50,480
concept research that's mostly done in

01:03:49,039 --> 01:03:52,799
act

01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:53,599
it is very important for the ai

01:03:52,799 --> 01:03:56,799
researchers

01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:59,200
like me or or even practitioners to

01:03:56,799 --> 01:04:00,720
immerse into the domain uh as in

01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:03,520
understand the domain

01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:06,000
in and out and not just download some

01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:08,880
data set and run some code and that's it

01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:11,440
uh so in in the context of this work

01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:13,760
that i described immersion meant

01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:15,520
visiting and meeting the rangers

01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:17,119
understanding the issues on the ground

01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:18,000
such as what are the constraints in

01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:20,079
patrolling

01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:21,200
how does the topography of the national

01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:24,400
park

01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:26,480
matter and other such practical issues

01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:27,920
immersion in this context also meant

01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:30,160
explaining the ai

01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:31,039
to to people on the ground who who may

01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:34,960
not even

01:04:31,039 --> 01:04:38,559
have had any education at all okay

01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:41,680
so such immersion i believe

01:04:38,559 --> 01:04:43,839
is critical for the success of uh ai for

01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:45,920
conservation kind of

01:04:43,839 --> 01:04:46,960
that was one big lesson that i learned

01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:50,319
out of this project

01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:51,920
uh i'll end just by saying that uh

01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:54,240
of course ai has a lot of potential in

01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:55,680
conservation i i mentioned one work that

01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:57,280
i have worked on here

01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:59,599
but i also know that some of my

01:04:57,280 --> 01:05:02,960
colleagues do work on

01:04:59,599 --> 01:05:06,000
using ai to predict human wildlife

01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:08,000
conflict and also ai can potentially be

01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:10,160
used to prevent smuggling of wildlife

01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:12,079
products in relation to conservation of

01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:14,319
course in the bigger picture

01:05:12,079 --> 01:05:15,520
i think ai can help environment in many

01:05:14,319 --> 01:05:18,640
different ways

01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:20,880
and i hope that we see uh many such

01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:23,200
success stories in future

01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:23,200
thanks

01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:28,000
uh thanks agunesh for sharing and i just

01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:29,839
realized that i

01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,119
completely failed to introduce yourself

01:05:29,839 --> 01:05:32,960
so i'll just give a very small

01:05:31,119 --> 01:05:34,000
background so that everybody on this

01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:36,960
call knows

01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:38,880
where you're coming from so aganesh is a

01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:40,640
leecong chain fellow and an assistant

01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:42,720
professor in the school of computing

01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:44,480
and information systems at singapore

01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:46,880
management university

01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:48,799
um and he's conducted research as he

01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:50,720
said on many different areas

01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:52,160
and in his paper on wildlife protection

01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:53,760
he was nominated actually for the best

01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:55,680
paper in one of the top research

01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:57,920
conferences so i'm just giving a snippet

01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:59,760
sort of of who you are and sort of

01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:00,960
what your background is so you are a

01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:02,799
computer scientist

01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:04,400
working on these issues so thanks for

01:06:02,799 --> 01:06:07,920
sharing your experience

01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:08,799
um in the ugandan context and i think

01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:10,960
you already

01:06:08,799 --> 01:06:12,319
mentioned two important things one ai is

01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:14,079
for optimization

01:06:12,319 --> 01:06:15,359
but optimizing for what are we

01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:16,960
optimizing for

01:06:15,359 --> 01:06:18,880
people and the planet or are we

01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:21,039
optimizing for profits

01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:21,920
uh and then the other thing is sort of

01:06:21,039 --> 01:06:24,799
like

01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:26,319
immersion in the field so uh in the in

01:06:24,799 --> 01:06:29,200
the topic ai will be

01:06:26,319 --> 01:06:29,920
placed upon um for those who haven't

01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:32,480
done it yet

01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:35,039
who just joined welcome to our panel on

01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:36,720
ai and the environment friend or foe

01:06:35,039 --> 01:06:38,160
um if you haven't done it yet you can

01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:40,880
introduce yourself in the chat it's

01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:43,440
helpful to sort of see who's in the room

01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:44,559
and we'll go to our second speaker

01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:46,559
jackie

01:06:44,559 --> 01:06:48,079
who's a freelance journalist published

01:06:46,559 --> 01:06:50,160
in the new york times wall street

01:06:48,079 --> 01:06:50,880
journal national geographics and many

01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:53,680
others

01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:55,039
and she covers issues around technology

01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:57,200
conservation travel

01:06:55,039 --> 01:06:59,680
culture and sort of where all of these

01:06:57,200 --> 01:07:02,880
areas intersect

01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:06,000
and i'll give the floor to jackie

01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:06,799
great thanks so much so i um cover a lot

01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:09,280
about ai

01:07:06,799 --> 01:07:10,480
but conservation is probably my favorite

01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:13,119
area to cover

01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:14,559
and i thought maybe just to show uh

01:07:13,119 --> 01:07:16,880
everyone what that

01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:18,000
can look like um i have some slides of

01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:19,680
the one ai

01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:22,319
and conservation story i've been able to

01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:24,240
cover in person over the last year

01:07:22,319 --> 01:07:25,920
obviously covet has really limited that

01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:27,920
but um i had an outdoor

01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:30,000
i mean it's all outdoors but i had one

01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:30,720
that was next to the ocean which felt

01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:34,240
extra safe

01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:37,440
so um here is a story

01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:40,720
that i did about an ai called shark eye

01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:43,520
ai and um this one was pretty personal

01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:44,240
for me oh wait uh sorry i did not hit

01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:47,680
shift

01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:48,559
share screen oh um the host disabled

01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:51,839
participant

01:07:48,559 --> 01:07:57,839
screen sharing so i actually can't

01:07:51,839 --> 01:07:57,839
uh share my slides

01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:07,680
and we can't hear you you're a mute

01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:09,119
i'm trying to figure out how to do this

01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:10,960
but we also have somebody here that

01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:12,160
helps us with this so maybe they can

01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:14,480
help me

01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:14,480
uh

01:08:18,159 --> 01:08:24,640
wait i am just making you co-host so you

01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:27,679
should be able to share your screen now

01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:32,239
yeah yeah yeah i can okay

01:08:27,679 --> 01:08:35,279
great um sure

01:08:32,239 --> 01:08:38,080
um great it works

01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:38,799
great yes so um we're just going to show

01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:41,199
this whole thing

01:08:38,799 --> 01:08:42,480
so the per this uh project i covered it

01:08:41,199 --> 01:08:45,359
was called shark

01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:46,960
i ai and uh this one felt pretty

01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:48,239
personal for me i went to school in

01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:50,400
southern california

01:08:48,239 --> 01:08:51,759
and i like to surf but anytime i thought

01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:52,000
i'd see anything in the water or even

01:08:51,759 --> 01:08:53,520
thought

01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:55,359
about sharks i just had to get out

01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:56,319
because it's pretty stressful so the

01:08:55,359 --> 01:08:58,880
idea

01:08:56,319 --> 01:09:00,080
of having technology that can maybe spot

01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:02,239
sharks while also

01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:04,719
helping within the conservation of them

01:09:02,239 --> 01:09:07,040
um was particularly of interest to me so

01:09:04,719 --> 01:09:09,359
um when i was living in california this

01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:11,759
summer um i went up to santa barbara to

01:09:09,359 --> 01:09:14,799
this beach where they are piloting

01:09:11,759 --> 01:09:15,839
um this ai and it's especially important

01:09:14,799 --> 01:09:18,080
right now because

01:09:15,839 --> 01:09:20,000
um great white sharks used to be pretty

01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:23,759
uh rare of southern california

01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:26,719
um but now uh they are coming back

01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:28,159
um they think it's partially uh the

01:09:26,719 --> 01:09:31,040
conservation efforts that are helping

01:09:28,159 --> 01:09:32,480
things like gill nets when um

01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:34,319
the laws that push them further out in

01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:35,520
the marine mammal protection act has

01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:37,920
created more

01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:39,199
food for the great white shark so we're

01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:40,799
starting to see a rebound and that

01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:43,279
rebound obviously first starts

01:09:40,799 --> 01:09:44,319
with uh the baby great white sharks and

01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:45,679
they

01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:47,120
because they don't have as much fat on

01:09:45,679 --> 01:09:48,640
them they like to come pretty close to

01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:50,080
shore so those are the ones

01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:51,920
the sharks that if you're gonna see a

01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:53,679
great white uh while you're out

01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:55,280
um surfing those are typically going to

01:09:53,679 --> 01:09:58,480
be the ones

01:09:55,280 --> 01:10:01,520
that you see in fact um this

01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:02,239
is at the beach that i was at here is a

01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:04,239
drone

01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:05,920
capturing a great white shark and you

01:10:04,239 --> 01:10:07,199
can see how close these surfers

01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:08,800
are to them so this is something that

01:10:07,199 --> 01:10:09,440
used to never happen and now it's

01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:11,679
happening

01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:13,360
you know there's spots they're spotting

01:10:11,679 --> 01:10:17,840
them dozens of times

01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:17,840
every summer um

01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:21,840
so uh one surf camp even left this area

01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:22,400
because this is a problem that they

01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:24,960
hadn't

01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:26,080
had to deal with before and they just

01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:27,920
didn't you know want to have a bunch of

01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:31,040
kids in the water and have to deal with

01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:34,880
sharks sightings all the time um

01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:37,520
but there is a way to share the beach

01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:38,880
as well as learn more about sharks um

01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:42,560
and this is the project that

01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:43,199
shark iai wants to do um the goal right

01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:45,600
now

01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:47,199
is to spot sharks faster so people can

01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:48,239
make informed decisions about

01:10:47,199 --> 01:10:51,520
you know if they're going to go into the

01:10:48,239 --> 01:10:53,440
water or not but the future

01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:54,640
potential is learning more about sharks

01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:58,080
helping to protect them

01:10:54,640 --> 01:11:01,520
in the future um and also

01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:03,040
um create tools that can you know not

01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:03,679
even just like oh there's a shark right

01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:05,760
now but

01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:07,040
here is these days or hours that we

01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:10,239
think sharks might be

01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:11,040
uh even more uh present in the water so

01:11:10,239 --> 01:11:14,400
people can make

01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:16,800
further out decisions so they

01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:18,400
they are doing that by collecting data

01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:18,960
to try to spot sharks and what that

01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:20,400
looks like

01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:23,040
is they are going to this beach and

01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:26,400
doing a one pre-programmed flight

01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:28,080
with a drone um to gather data that's

01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:29,199
really comparable but then they also do

01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:31,199
a second flight where

01:11:29,199 --> 01:11:33,120
the pilot is just sort of you know

01:11:31,199 --> 01:11:35,600
looking for things of interest or

01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:36,800
um you know targeting areas that maybe

01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:41,040
something was seen but they

01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:43,760
want to inspect it further so um

01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:45,760
this is a slide that i stole from their

01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:48,000
presentation to me

01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:49,520
uh and right now it's all it's all

01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:51,920
pretty manual this is not

01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:53,679
uh some autonomous system right now the

01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:56,239
you know these drones aren't autonomous

01:11:53,679 --> 01:11:57,040
so someone a pilot who has to be faa

01:11:56,239 --> 01:11:58,960
licensed

01:11:57,040 --> 01:12:00,400
goes and flies the drone if they spot

01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:01,360
anything because they're watching the

01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:03,600
footage

01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:04,960
uh for the watching the camera from the

01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:08,000
drone they send

01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:09,920
a text message to a group of people like

01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:11,199
lifeguards people who live near the

01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:13,520
beach and

01:12:11,199 --> 01:12:14,400
surf schools if they spotted any sharks

01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:17,520
so that is also

01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:19,040
like done manually right now then they

01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:20,800
download the footage and put into these

01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:24,800
algorithms

01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:26,159
that go in and then further uh you know

01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:27,280
they're spotting they're spotting the

01:12:26,159 --> 01:12:28,000
same sharks and then they're also

01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:30,400
creating this

01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:33,760
uh data archive that they can start to

01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:33,760
build predictions off of

01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:39,600
so this is um what the what the

01:12:38,159 --> 01:12:40,320
algorithm looks like when it's spotting

01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:44,239
a shark

01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:44,719
um um this area of california doesn't

01:12:44,239 --> 01:12:46,480
have

01:12:44,719 --> 01:12:47,840
a lot of other big sharks like a bull

01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:49,679
shark or um

01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:51,360
tiger shark that could confuse his

01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:54,159
system so it's actually

01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:56,239
uh pretty good at you know spotting a

01:12:54,159 --> 01:12:56,719
shark it's it's up it's usually a shark

01:12:56,239 --> 01:12:58,800
things

01:12:56,719 --> 01:12:59,840
that they told me have confused are

01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:01,199
manta rays if they're

01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:03,120
if they're swimming too close together

01:13:01,199 --> 01:13:05,360
maybe i'll have like the general shape

01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:07,199
of a shark but otherwise there's not a

01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:09,360
lot to confuse the system about whether

01:13:07,199 --> 01:13:12,800
it's a great white shark or not

01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:14,719
um but um you know that the previous

01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:17,600
photo was like ideal conditions

01:13:14,719 --> 01:13:19,040
but sometimes you know the water can be

01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:20,800
murkier the shark can be a little bit

01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:24,000
further down in the water

01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:26,080
um or you know it can be cloudy or

01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:28,080
if you're flying around noon the glare

01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:28,400
can be really bad so here is also it's

01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:30,239
still

01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:32,080
pretty good where it can detect you know

01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:34,320
this blob in the water that it was a

01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:36,640
great white shark

01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:38,159
and here's a little footage of uh like

01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:39,520
the actual footage and how it's

01:13:38,159 --> 01:13:41,760
detecting it so you can see that you

01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:44,880
know that looks like a shark but um

01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:48,080
it's not as clear as some of these

01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:49,440
um you know how it's working under

01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:52,640
conditions that aren't always

01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:55,840
as easy to see for for humans so it's

01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:58,080
it's pretty powerful tool that they are

01:13:55,840 --> 01:14:00,159
hoping they're going to keep open source

01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:02,560
so they can um

01:14:00,159 --> 01:14:03,760
give it to other lifeguards or groups

01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:04,719
that are interested in doing something

01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:06,719
similar

01:14:04,719 --> 01:14:08,000
um you know one day this could be really

01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:10,159
automated where this

01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:11,520
the camera could be detecting the sharks

01:14:10,159 --> 01:14:14,560
um you know on a chip

01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:16,080
within the drone and sending uh alerts

01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:17,760
they're in real time there could

01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:19,280
eventually be a shark report that goes

01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:20,000
next to a surf report because they have

01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:21,520
enough data

01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,320
to make predictions about where sharks

01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:24,080
are going to be and when they're going

01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:25,120
to be so this you know this tool has

01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:26,880
only been running

01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:28,960
two or three summers so it's still

01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:30,480
really early days and these sharks still

01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:32,159
aren't seen in numbers where it's going

01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:33,920
to be really easy to make predictions

01:14:32,159 --> 01:14:35,280
but this is the kind of tool where we

01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:37,040
can start to learn about sharks

01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:39,040
help get their numbers up while

01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:40,480
protecting people who are using beaches

01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:41,360
at rates that we haven't you know seen

01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:43,120
before

01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:44,800
um that makes me really helpful

01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:46,640
especially the um

01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:47,920
shark report so you know next time i go

01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:50,400
surfing i don't have to

01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:52,560
worry about sharks so much so um if

01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:53,520
anyone's interested here's a qr code and

01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:55,199
a bitly

01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:57,600
for the story it was in the new york

01:14:55,199 --> 01:14:59,760
times uh in november

01:14:57,600 --> 01:15:00,800
so um that that is just some of the

01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:02,960
reporting

01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:05,440
um that i get to do and stories that

01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:05,440
interest me

01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:11,520
uh thanks jackie there was already one

01:15:09,199 --> 01:15:13,199
let me just find it out uh just question

01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:15,760
maybe for clarification

01:15:13,199 --> 01:15:18,640
uh they will eventually customize the

01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:20,159
drones i guess to automate things

01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:21,760
yeah i think that's the hope you know

01:15:20,159 --> 01:15:23,760
there's a lot

01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:25,679
you know that has to fall in line like

01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:27,280
the faa is going to have to allow it and

01:15:25,679 --> 01:15:29,120
have to have rules around like when you

01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:31,199
can have autonomous drones

01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:32,480
um you know there's already uh on

01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:34,320
beaches that aren't doing

01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:35,760
this project i've been surfing and

01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:37,600
there's like drones that are flying out

01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:38,960
to you know take photos there's

01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:40,480
you know other projects that are doing

01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:41,520
this so there's gonna have to be rules

01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:43,520
around

01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:45,040
uh that from the faa that have nothing

01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:47,520
to do with sharks

01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:49,520
um and you know that technology could be

01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:50,159
pretty expensive to do that autonomously

01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:53,199
but

01:15:50,159 --> 01:15:56,400
uh you know this project has

01:15:53,199 --> 01:15:58,400
uh mark benioff behind it so that is

01:15:56,400 --> 01:16:00,159
a lot of money so maybe you know if not

01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:02,480
everyone gets to do it there could be

01:16:00,159 --> 01:16:04,400
some projects that do get to um have

01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:06,800
really fancy drones flying around

01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:07,679
maybe you know uh individuals could have

01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:10,239
these drones

01:16:07,679 --> 01:16:12,400
tracking their surf uh to you know

01:16:10,239 --> 01:16:14,159
protect people individually so

01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:16,640
there there is a lot of opportunity this

01:16:14,159 --> 01:16:19,679
is very early days

01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:22,800
amazing thanks jackie uh we'll go to

01:16:19,679 --> 01:16:24,960
our uh third panelist carrie johnson

01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:26,560
who's a senior staff writer adventure

01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:28,239
beats covering ai

01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:30,239
he writes stories at the intersection of

01:16:28,239 --> 01:16:32,000
ai ethics and policy

01:16:30,239 --> 01:16:34,320
and writes stories about climate change

01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:37,440
so the floor is yours

01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:40,960
um yeah

01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:44,000
thanks for having me um you know um

01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:44,960
yeah so adventure beat i write a lot of

01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:47,600
stories

01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:48,400
primarily we focus on um you know

01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:51,520
business

01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:52,719
reporting but um i

01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:54,800
write a lot of stories at the

01:16:52,719 --> 01:16:57,760
intersection of ethics and

01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:58,239
policy and you know of course uh climate

01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:01,600
change

01:16:58,239 --> 01:17:04,080
is is a big part of that so um

01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:05,199
i'll just share a couple of links in the

01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:07,600
chat to

01:17:05,199 --> 01:17:08,480
recent stories and just kind of walk

01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:11,760
everyone through

01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:14,560
each of these things uh bit by bit

01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:16,080
uh this first one is actually not my

01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:19,120
story but it's one

01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:19,600
story related to a story that i wrote

01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:21,520
and

01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:23,040
um you know what i would call attention

01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:26,159
to is

01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:29,040
uh just the image up top and

01:17:26,159 --> 01:17:30,880
you know this is a machine learning

01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:31,600
admissions calculator that was developed

01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:34,320
by

01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:35,120
universities in canada i believe mila in

01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:37,920
montreal

01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:39,199
i don't recall right now but you can put

01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:41,120
in your cloud region

01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:42,880
the amount of time you use machine

01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:45,679
learning hardware

01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:47,360
and um you know the cloud provider and

01:17:45,679 --> 01:17:50,560
get some sort of

01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:54,000
number around um

01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:56,640
you know carbon emissions for a

01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:57,520
uh you know what it took to train an ai

01:17:56,640 --> 01:18:00,960
model

01:17:57,520 --> 01:18:03,760
and this was released in uh december

01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:03,760
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:08,000
during narips which is the largest air

01:18:06,239 --> 01:18:12,080
research conference in the world

01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:15,600
and so it was at a time when

01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:17,280
they were considering adding i believe

01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:19,520
or there were conversations among

01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:20,960
organizers of this conference of adding

01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:24,960
carbon emissions

01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:28,080
um uh involved with training a model

01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:29,760
um uh requiring some form of that i

01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:32,800
believe in research papers

01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:34,960
maybe um which would

01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:36,000
i think change sort of the attitudes

01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:37,920
about the entire

01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:39,280
space and what makes an effort what

01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:41,120
makes a good ai

01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:43,440
you know what makes a good model you

01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:45,600
know knowing that efficiency is

01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:47,199
things to do with business and you know

01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:49,440
money but

01:18:47,199 --> 01:18:50,400
certainly the carbon emissions related

01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:52,640
to

01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:54,800
um you know training models and

01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:56,400
deploying them can be can be extensive i

01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:56,719
think there was this analysis that found

01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:58,800
that

01:18:56,719 --> 01:19:01,040
what is it like two percent of uh carbon

01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:05,199
emissions in the world are data centers

01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:08,719
um so in any ca but that's the first one

01:19:05,199 --> 01:19:10,239
uh the second story i would point to

01:19:08,719 --> 01:19:13,040
and these are all within roughly the

01:19:10,239 --> 01:19:16,640
last year of of coverage

01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:20,800
um was a workshop that took place

01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:22,560
at uh nowhere eps with

01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:25,120
a lot of people who were influential in

01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:26,000
the ai machine machine learning research

01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:29,120
space

01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:30,400
uh including uh yoshua bingio who uh in

01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:33,600
his work

01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:36,719
uh he uh is one of the

01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:40,159
i believe most cited

01:19:36,719 --> 01:19:43,760
researchers on the planet um like

01:19:40,159 --> 01:19:47,520
in anything and he's uh

01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:47,520
he's been pretty uh adamant about

01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:51,360
particularly reducing the amount of

01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:54,239
travel involved with

01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:55,280
going to machine learning conferences

01:19:54,239 --> 01:19:58,560
and so

01:19:55,280 --> 01:20:01,840
um part of the push that

01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:03,840
had happened before covid to make

01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:05,040
more virtual conferences and machine

01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:08,960
learning had to do

01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:10,239
with um reducing the carbon emissions of

01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:10,960
flying around the world to these

01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:14,480
conferences

01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:15,840
all year and so um a lot it'll it'll be

01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:17,280
interesting to see what happens after

01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:20,880
this

01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:24,400
with uh covet and everything um if

01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:28,880
the community continues to go virtual um

01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:31,600
in order to to reduce its emissions um

01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:32,000
but you'll you know this this particular

01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:34,000
article

01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:35,600
is on a panel of a lot of people who are

01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:37,360
influential in the ai space

01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:39,360
um as part of the tackling climate

01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:40,239
change group which holds workshop at

01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:43,199
major

01:20:40,239 --> 01:20:43,679
machine learning research conferences um

01:20:43,199 --> 01:20:45,840
and

01:20:43,679 --> 01:20:47,520
you know it's there are people who you

01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:48,639
know there are grand challenges in

01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:51,840
machine learning

01:20:48,639 --> 01:20:54,639
of uh beating uh the

01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:55,600
world's best chess player or autonomous

01:20:54,639 --> 01:20:57,840
vehicles

01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:59,120
but there are groups like tackling

01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:03,199
climate change

01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:07,440
and like oceania ai

01:21:03,199 --> 01:21:10,000
who believe that

01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:11,199
climate change in solving big problems

01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:13,600
like that

01:21:11,199 --> 01:21:16,080
can serve as grand challenges for the

01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:19,360
machine learning research community

01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:22,639
um and so uh

01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:26,480
that's i mentioned oceania oceania

01:21:22,639 --> 01:21:28,480
uh the first details of

01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:29,600
what oceania has been doing which is a

01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:33,280
project between

01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:35,520
um chile and um

01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:37,280
the france i believe at least

01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:39,120
universities and organizations between

01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:40,800
the two i don't know

01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:42,400
you know for the funding and everything

01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:45,600
uh to study

01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:48,639
uh phytoplankton species and to

01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:49,520
create um ai systems that can identify

01:21:48,639 --> 01:21:52,639
particular

01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:56,320
um phytoplankton species and give

01:21:52,639 --> 01:22:00,320
some understanding of

01:21:56,320 --> 01:22:01,440
changes in uh the populations around the

01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:04,560
world because

01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:06,320
similar to like the rainforest the

01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:09,360
cycles related to phytoplankton

01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:12,880
populations have a lot to do with

01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:15,120
carbon capture i believe or

01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:16,400
oxygen i'm not a scientist but it's

01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:19,920
important

01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:21,199
um but yeah so these are um some of the

01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:23,280
more recent stories that i've covered in

01:22:21,199 --> 01:22:24,400
the last year related to climate change

01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:26,639
in ai

01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:26,639
um

01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:34,080
amazing uh thanks um

01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:36,320
so i have some questions for our

01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:37,679
panelists but in the meantime if any of

01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:38,960
the people in the room have any

01:22:37,679 --> 01:22:40,800
questions

01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:42,960
please raise your hand or put them in

01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:44,480
the chat and i'll try to monitor it

01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:47,040
also if the panelists have questions for

01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:50,159
each other it's more than welcome

01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:52,400
um i'll kick start with a question for

01:22:50,159 --> 01:22:54,159
each of you so i'll start with

01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:55,760
uh when we're looking at sort of

01:22:54,159 --> 01:22:58,080
predicting of wildlife

01:22:55,760 --> 01:23:00,000
life patterns there's of course also or

01:22:58,080 --> 01:23:02,000
poacher patterns there's a risk

01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:03,760
like when uh tourists first started

01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:06,639
taking pictures of wildlife

01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:08,239
um with their mobile phones uh it turned

01:23:06,639 --> 01:23:10,880
out that the geolocation actually

01:23:08,239 --> 01:23:13,199
led to more poaching actually than uh so

01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:15,360
there's a lot of unexpected consequences

01:23:13,199 --> 01:23:16,880
to some of the things we do and i was

01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:18,880
wondering while you were emerging

01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:20,000
yourself within the wildlife parks and

01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:22,239
also with the rangers

01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:24,800
patrolling these wildlife parks if there

01:23:22,239 --> 01:23:25,920
were any discussions about for sort of

01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:29,679
possible risks

01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:31,679
within these predictions um

01:23:29,679 --> 01:23:33,760
related to poaching and how you would

01:23:31,679 --> 01:23:37,440
address

01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:39,920
okay so uh so i guess uh

01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:41,760
i mean we didn't specifically discuss

01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:43,280
whether the predictions themselves are

01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:45,679
risky or not uh

01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:47,679
of course if the predictions leak out uh

01:23:45,679 --> 01:23:49,360
in some sense to the coaches that that's

01:23:47,679 --> 01:23:53,199
that's a big risk

01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:55,679
uh but but but the coaches are also

01:23:53,199 --> 01:23:57,840
uh quite intelligent i mean they they

01:23:55,679 --> 01:24:01,679
are they're uh

01:23:57,840 --> 01:24:02,960
they are also they they they do some

01:24:01,679 --> 01:24:05,440
sort of a

01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:06,239
surveillance of where the rangers are

01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:09,280
actually go

01:24:06,239 --> 01:24:11,440
patrolling uh so uh so

01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:12,639
and they build up some sense of uh okay

01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:14,880
the rangers

01:24:12,639 --> 01:24:16,880
visit this part of the park more this

01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:20,159
part of the park less sense

01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:23,120
and and based on that

01:24:20,159 --> 01:24:25,280
we we do need some intelligence uh in in

01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:26,719
in the latter part on on where we petrol

01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:28,719
uh

01:24:26,719 --> 01:24:30,560
and that's what i was referring to

01:24:28,719 --> 01:24:32,560
earlier uh is uh

01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:34,159
we don't we don't we use a somewhat

01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:37,199
sophisticated uh

01:24:34,159 --> 01:24:37,520
technology behind petroleum it's uh we

01:24:37,199 --> 01:24:40,639
use

01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:44,560
concepts from this topic of game theory

01:24:40,639 --> 01:24:48,080
uh where we are trying to treat the

01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:50,880
the poachers as an as an adversary

01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:51,199
and trying to play a game with them uh

01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:54,080
and

01:24:51,199 --> 01:24:55,360
and and and if you model it that way

01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:59,120
then you can actually

01:24:55,360 --> 01:25:00,880
uh do uh more intelligent petrol that

01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:04,159
that that is able to

01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:06,320
kind of bypass this uh coaches

01:25:04,159 --> 01:25:07,360
anticipation of what you are going to do

01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:10,560
uh or or

01:25:07,360 --> 01:25:13,600
or even if the project poacher can

01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:17,760
somehow uh uh

01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:20,719
see what your patrolling patterns are

01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:23,120
even then the poacher might not be able

01:25:20,719 --> 01:25:23,120
to gain

01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:28,800
as much out of his coaching activity as

01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:30,800
possible now uh

01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:32,159
of course this is all uh subject to a

01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:35,120
lot of constraints

01:25:32,159 --> 01:25:35,760
in the sense that uh the number of

01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:38,320
rangers

01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:39,760
i think are in the range of like tens or

01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:42,960
something like like

01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:46,880
40 60 something like that over an

01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:50,000
area of about 4 000 square kilometers

01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:53,120
ah so so so the the coverage of

01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:56,719
the rangers is very very limited

01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:59,520
so uh i i think uh while our predicting

01:25:56,719 --> 01:26:00,239
and patrolling patterns help what could

01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:02,480
also help

01:26:00,239 --> 01:26:05,600
more if there were more rangers in the

01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:09,840
first place uh unfortunately that's uh

01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:09,840
not there so

01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:15,199
yeah i think i don't know if that

01:26:13,199 --> 01:26:18,239
answers the question but uh

01:26:15,199 --> 01:26:20,080
yeah thanks uh yeah uh

01:26:18,239 --> 01:26:21,520
it's often with these cases that maybe

01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:23,120
like the

01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:24,880
the obvious solution is not the one

01:26:23,120 --> 01:26:25,120
that's possible like increased in size

01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:27,280
of

01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:29,920
the number of ranges for instance uh to

01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:33,280
stop the patrolling but thanks for

01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:35,199
yes um jackie

01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:36,480
when we were having a discussion uh

01:26:35,199 --> 01:26:39,360
earlier like

01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:41,040
uh well actually last week i was really

01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:43,440
struck by something you said and i

01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:44,480
wanted to ask you to sort of elaborate

01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:46,239
on it for

01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:48,400
the rest of the people in the room is

01:26:46,239 --> 01:26:49,600
that you said there was something unique

01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:52,159
about the intersection

01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:52,800
between ai and conservationism that you

01:26:52,159 --> 01:26:55,199
don't see

01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:56,960
in other types of sort of ai and sort of

01:26:55,199 --> 01:26:58,080
environment discussions

01:26:56,960 --> 01:27:00,719
and i was wondering if you could

01:26:58,080 --> 01:27:04,320
elaborate on that

01:27:00,719 --> 01:27:05,120
yeah um i think aranesh started to talk

01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:08,000
about it where

01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:09,520
he mentioned you know he has to really

01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:13,120
get in there and get in the weeds

01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:15,280
about the um the the problems

01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:16,960
that conservation is facing and just

01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:17,600
really getting to know it knowing what

01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:20,159
the

01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:21,199
rangers uh what their days look like

01:27:20,159 --> 01:27:22,880
what the

01:27:21,199 --> 01:27:24,719
area what the you know paths that they

01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:27,600
go on look like and

01:27:24,719 --> 01:27:28,560
having that domain expertise uh is

01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:31,280
something that

01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:33,199
in some areas of ai i can see ignored

01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:35,760
where these are researchers who think

01:27:33,199 --> 01:27:37,760
you know uh they are you know machine

01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:40,639
learning gods and can figure out

01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:42,400
this whole range of you know expertise

01:27:40,639 --> 01:27:45,440
outside of their what they've studied

01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:49,120
um you know with minimal

01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:51,040
insight so um there's some areas where

01:27:49,120 --> 01:27:52,719
you know i see some efforts like i think

01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:54,560
in medicine there's an awareness that

01:27:52,719 --> 01:27:56,320
people go to medical school and get phds

01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:57,920
that take a long time so maybe these

01:27:56,320 --> 01:28:00,239
um some of these researchers who are

01:27:57,920 --> 01:28:02,239
working in the computer space

01:28:00,239 --> 01:28:04,560
recognize that or you know there's even

01:28:02,239 --> 01:28:05,920
laws that are forcing them to like

01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:07,760
understand that they don't have all the

01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:10,080
answers uh but

01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:10,800
i've noticed within conservation there

01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:14,000
seems to be

01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:17,440
like a respect and they're coming to

01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:19,040
this problem with um

01:28:17,440 --> 01:28:20,639
you know whether it's the researchers

01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:21,120
who are self-selecting into this area

01:28:20,639 --> 01:28:22,560
but

01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:24,000
there is a respect that they don't

01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:24,880
understand everything and they need to

01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:27,360
work with

01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:29,120
people on the ground stakeholders uh

01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:31,199
conservationists who are on the ground

01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:34,400
who have studied these issues for years

01:28:31,199 --> 01:28:36,800
that uh you know that we don't see in

01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:38,080
every realm and this also might be me

01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:39,120
self selecting the stories that i want

01:28:38,080 --> 01:28:42,400
to report but

01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:44,719
i have never spoken to

01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:46,960
uh someone in this field who is not

01:28:44,719 --> 01:28:48,719
talking to the experts who is who is not

01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:50,880
trying to find out what the community is

01:28:48,719 --> 01:28:53,040
interested in what the community knows

01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:55,520
and that gives me a lot of hope that um

01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:56,960
some of the mistakes around conservation

01:28:55,520 --> 01:28:59,520
that we've seen in the past where it's

01:28:56,960 --> 01:29:00,719
you know a white savior

01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:02,719
or like coming to other countries

01:29:00,719 --> 01:29:05,199
thinking you can fix things um

01:29:02,719 --> 01:29:10,000
i'm not seeing those exact same mistakes

01:29:05,199 --> 01:29:13,679
made again right now

01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:15,760
amazing uh thanks um

01:29:13,679 --> 01:29:17,760
i think some of the the examples that i

01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:18,880
unless jackie that you shared i was also

01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:21,920
quite

01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:23,840
positively surprised about this so uh

01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:26,159
only seeing it from a glimpse i see sort

01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:27,920
of similar trends

01:29:26,159 --> 01:29:29,920
and there is two specific questions for

01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:30,800
the shark story but i'll come back to

01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:32,480
that later

01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:34,560
i first have also have a question from

01:29:32,480 --> 01:29:35,280
kari and maybe jackie you want to then

01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:37,920
add to this

01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:38,960
because both of you cover broad areas

01:29:37,920 --> 01:29:41,280
sort of ai

01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:42,239
and environment and sort of could you

01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:44,800
maybe uh

01:29:42,239 --> 01:29:46,400
address some of the opportunities and

01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:47,280
concerns you have around sort of this

01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:50,400
field

01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:53,280
um because when you think talk about

01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:55,280
sort of ai either people go into doom

01:29:53,280 --> 01:29:58,639
scenarios or very positive scenarios

01:29:55,280 --> 01:30:00,159
uh maybe you can tiptoe maybe some

01:29:58,639 --> 01:30:02,239
some of the things that you find quite

01:30:00,159 --> 01:30:04,159
important for the discussion

01:30:02,239 --> 01:30:05,520
well i think something you know that

01:30:04,159 --> 01:30:07,440
what you mentioned before about

01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:08,719
you know unintended consequences is

01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:12,320
always something that

01:30:08,719 --> 01:30:15,920
people have to have the um

01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:18,840
humility for um but i think the

01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:20,320
uh one thing as it relates to

01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:23,040
opportunities

01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:24,320
um well two things one on the

01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:26,239
opportunity one on the

01:30:24,320 --> 01:30:28,000
the potential you know thing to be

01:30:26,239 --> 01:30:30,080
concerned with the opportunity

01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:31,520
the climate change working group that i

01:30:30,080 --> 01:30:34,880
mentioned previously

01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:36,400
um put out a paper with i want to say

01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:39,920
approximately 100 different

01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:42,639
use cases of um

01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:43,120
machine learning applied to climate

01:30:42,639 --> 01:30:46,480
change

01:30:43,120 --> 01:30:47,120
and it's it was really intriguing to me

01:30:46,480 --> 01:30:49,600
because of

01:30:47,120 --> 01:30:51,360
the amount of people who were signed on

01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:52,960
to that and some of the

01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:54,480
different you know influential people i

01:30:52,960 --> 01:30:58,800
mentioned before but

01:30:54,480 --> 01:31:00,960
um it's a collection of things ranging

01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:01,600
from like public policy in cities of

01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:04,960
course

01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:09,040
and how efficiencies there could change

01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:11,240
you know the climate change math quickly

01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:12,719
quickest quicker than anywhere else

01:31:11,240 --> 01:31:16,320
[Music]

01:31:12,719 --> 01:31:19,440
to you know weather predictions and

01:31:16,320 --> 01:31:22,560
and things around that but it it's

01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:23,840
that particular paper i feel like if

01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:26,159
there's anything

01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:27,600
um intriguing that i've come across it's

01:31:26,159 --> 01:31:28,960
worth reading it's probably not one

01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:32,080
because it just has this

01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:34,000
lush of options

01:31:32,080 --> 01:31:35,600
angles that could be taken that that

01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:39,040
that it could be done effectively

01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:40,719
the you know not having hubris and

01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:42,239
dealing with how how these things could

01:31:40,719 --> 01:31:45,280
be done in

01:31:42,239 --> 01:31:45,679
um in productive ways that that you know

01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:49,840
help

01:31:45,679 --> 01:31:53,679
people i think um is is just a matter of

01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:55,280
investments and and you know

01:31:53,679 --> 01:31:57,360
setting the sorts of goals that you need

01:31:55,280 --> 01:32:00,480
for um

01:31:57,360 --> 01:32:01,280
for uh research uh things to move

01:32:00,480 --> 01:32:03,120
forward

01:32:01,280 --> 01:32:05,040
um there was a report that came out last

01:32:03,120 --> 01:32:06,639
week uh called the ai

01:32:05,040 --> 01:32:08,480
index and it goes through all these

01:32:06,639 --> 01:32:13,040
different things of

01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:14,880
ai's impact on on people and um

01:32:13,040 --> 01:32:16,400
uh and you know performance standards

01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:19,360
and all this other stuff but

01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:20,560
uh in in talking with one of the

01:32:19,360 --> 01:32:22,960
steering community

01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:23,920
members and writers of the report uh you

01:32:22,960 --> 01:32:26,639
know

01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:28,159
he was saying i really wish that we

01:32:26,639 --> 01:32:29,760
could come up with better benchmarks

01:32:28,159 --> 01:32:31,600
that you know give us

01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:32,960
goals that are reflections of our values

01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:35,280
you know a

01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:37,280
a machine learning grand challenge

01:32:35,280 --> 01:32:40,080
around deforestation

01:32:37,280 --> 01:32:41,360
the entire community decided to do that

01:32:40,080 --> 01:32:44,960
that could

01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:45,440
uh benefit the planet greatly all of us

01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:48,880
you know

01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:51,679
um so i think there is opportunity there

01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:53,920
on the wrist side the concern that i

01:32:51,679 --> 01:32:54,320
have is that compute demands are growing

01:32:53,920 --> 01:32:58,480
um

01:32:54,320 --> 01:33:03,440
steadily and the amount that is

01:32:58,480 --> 01:33:06,719
dedicated to this is is going up so

01:33:03,440 --> 01:33:09,199
the toward that end of goals

01:33:06,719 --> 01:33:11,120
it would seem like using something like

01:33:09,199 --> 01:33:16,000
the compute or the um

01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:18,159
emissions related to a particular model

01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:19,440
is something potentially worth

01:33:18,159 --> 01:33:21,040
highlighting

01:33:19,440 --> 01:33:23,360
because if we can get to a place where

01:33:21,040 --> 01:33:23,679
that's the standard and that's what you

01:33:23,360 --> 01:33:27,280
know

01:33:23,679 --> 01:33:29,920
it's not efficiency for um accuracy

01:33:27,280 --> 01:33:30,639
or you know or at least measured with

01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:32,560
all these other

01:33:30,639 --> 01:33:37,840
factors that that fact you know that

01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:37,840
come in you know um

01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:43,280
uh great things and and sort of just uh

01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:45,199
also to add to the sort of this

01:33:43,280 --> 01:33:46,800
emissions to a model i think it's quite

01:33:45,199 --> 01:33:48,800
important we have a discussion on sort

01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:50,400
of emissions of ai models

01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:52,080
and we tend to focus on sort of like

01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:52,719
what are the emissions of building the

01:33:52,080 --> 01:33:54,480
model

01:33:52,719 --> 01:33:56,080
whereas if we see it's like these bigger

01:33:54,480 --> 01:33:56,480
models of these bigger companies that

01:33:56,080 --> 01:33:59,120
can

01:33:56,480 --> 01:34:00,719
get retrained every day or every so many

01:33:59,120 --> 01:34:02,639
other days and sort of what does that

01:34:00,719 --> 01:34:05,760
cost in terms of emission

01:34:02,639 --> 01:34:06,880
um and also yeah there's many questions

01:34:05,760 --> 01:34:07,840
around the mission so thanks for

01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:10,400
bringing that up

01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:12,239
jackie do you want to add to this um and

01:34:10,400 --> 01:34:13,760
then as a follow-up i also see two

01:34:12,239 --> 01:34:14,560
questions for you in the chat which i

01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:16,719
can

01:34:14,560 --> 01:34:18,560
read up if you don't know where you can

01:34:16,719 --> 01:34:22,239
know where you can find them

01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:24,639
okay i i think i can find them but um

01:34:22,239 --> 01:34:25,679
you know i just want to echo that paper

01:34:24,639 --> 01:34:28,000
that kari mentioned

01:34:25,679 --> 01:34:28,960
is really good it's really accessible um

01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,719
i would recommend

01:34:28,960 --> 01:34:32,639
anyone who's interested checking it out

01:34:30,719 --> 01:34:34,960
it's really long but there's

01:34:32,639 --> 01:34:36,080
everything from like uh someone with the

01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:38,400
idea of like creating

01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:39,840
using ai to create uh you know a photo

01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:43,040
of what your house would look like with

01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:45,520
a foot of sea a sea level rise to taking

01:34:43,040 --> 01:34:46,800
all the most complex weather models

01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:48,719
which are already like the most complex

01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:50,400
models we have and combining them all

01:34:48,719 --> 01:34:52,239
into one you know one

01:34:50,400 --> 01:34:54,320
weather model to rule them all so it's

01:34:52,239 --> 01:34:55,520
from like these really basic ideas to

01:34:54,320 --> 01:34:57,600
you know things that are like creating

01:34:55,520 --> 01:34:58,159
new fields to study so it's it's really

01:34:57,600 --> 01:34:59,760
interesting

01:34:58,159 --> 01:35:01,199
the researchers on that are like the top

01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:03,679
of the field and it's

01:35:01,199 --> 01:35:06,080
very hopeful seeing um that paper with

01:35:03,679 --> 01:35:09,679
all the best minds in ai who are

01:35:06,080 --> 01:35:10,159
doing this so um i i like that paper a

01:35:09,679 --> 01:35:13,520
lot

01:35:10,159 --> 01:35:15,040
um has shock i've been tested with

01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:16,000
drones that can track an individual

01:35:15,040 --> 01:35:19,280
person

01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:22,639
no it's uh sharks

01:35:19,280 --> 01:35:24,320
um i'm not sure i understand that

01:35:22,639 --> 01:35:26,480
question

01:35:24,320 --> 01:35:28,560
kari was that you yeah i guess the

01:35:26,480 --> 01:35:30,080
question was like to your point of being

01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:30,719
concerned that you're going to be near

01:35:30,080 --> 01:35:33,360
the shark

01:35:30,719 --> 01:35:33,920
like if you're out in your like early

01:35:33,360 --> 01:35:36,880
morning

01:35:33,920 --> 01:35:39,199
surfing for example and you wanted to

01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:40,880
bring like skydio r2 i think is the

01:35:39,199 --> 01:35:42,080
company they have like a tracker and

01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:44,080
drone that can fly over

01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:46,320
water i don't know how long it can

01:35:44,080 --> 01:35:48,719
actually stay in the air but like

01:35:46,320 --> 01:35:51,119
you know if an individual wanted to use

01:35:48,719 --> 01:35:54,639
that as opposed to

01:35:51,119 --> 01:35:57,920
you know public authority doing that

01:35:54,639 --> 01:36:00,880
uh i that's a really good question um

01:35:57,920 --> 01:36:01,920
i i they have not done that as far as i

01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:05,040
know but that's um

01:36:01,920 --> 01:36:07,280
a really great use case that i think um

01:36:05,040 --> 01:36:08,320
i would have asked them about if i had

01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:10,400
thought of that drone

01:36:08,320 --> 01:36:12,320
um possibility when i was doing this

01:36:10,400 --> 01:36:13,760
story uh but you know i know that it's

01:36:12,320 --> 01:36:15,360
like it's still very early days i'm not

01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:17,840
sure if they're ready to release it but

01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:18,880
um that's that is a great use case that

01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:22,320
i would 100

01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:24,960
invest in if it was a possibility

01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:25,920
um okay does the ai recognize based on

01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:28,000
image or the

01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:29,920
also shark behavioral signatures it can

01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:31,040
recognize that is a great question that

01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:32,239
i was also

01:36:31,040 --> 01:36:34,080
just thinking about when i was putting

01:36:32,239 --> 01:36:36,080
these slides together um

01:36:34,080 --> 01:36:38,480
they as far as i know it's not

01:36:36,080 --> 01:36:40,960
behavioral signatures it's all about

01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:43,440
um the the shape and the size not

01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:46,480
necessarily how the sharks are moving

01:36:43,440 --> 01:36:48,239
um i know of other um computer vision

01:36:46,480 --> 01:36:48,880
algorithms that are detecting by like

01:36:48,239 --> 01:36:50,880
the way

01:36:48,880 --> 01:36:52,000
uh microbes move they can recognize like

01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:53,920
oh that's you know this one

01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:56,159
that's another one uh but this one

01:36:53,920 --> 01:36:57,040
because uh great whites have like such a

01:36:56,159 --> 01:36:58,560
certain

01:36:57,040 --> 01:37:00,960
shape and size to them especially the

01:36:58,560 --> 01:37:03,280
younger ones um it's it's just

01:37:00,960 --> 01:37:04,960
size and i know they're trying to also

01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:06,400
train it to be able to determine

01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:09,360
the size of the shark so you can get

01:37:06,400 --> 01:37:09,360
these very uh

01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:14,000
specific alerts because baby great

01:37:12,400 --> 01:37:15,119
whites don't have the right teeth to

01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:18,159
really mess up humans

01:37:15,119 --> 01:37:20,800
uh there was someone who'd got bit

01:37:18,159 --> 01:37:22,159
during this last summer um when they

01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:24,000
weren't out because of covid

01:37:22,159 --> 01:37:25,520
that but it was just you know not to

01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,480
compare it to a dog was like an ankle

01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:27,840
biter type

01:37:26,480 --> 01:37:30,159
attack on the foot but their their

01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:31,840
mouths aren't in the right shape to

01:37:30,159 --> 01:37:33,760
to really hurt humans they're just built

01:37:31,840 --> 01:37:35,040
for fish so that would even be better

01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:36,320
where you're like okay yeah there's baby

01:37:35,040 --> 01:37:37,840
great whites

01:37:36,320 --> 01:37:39,520
not an issue because they can't really

01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:41,040
hurt humans meanwhile

01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:42,800
if they can detect that it's a 12-foot

01:37:41,040 --> 01:37:44,000
shark that's no longer a baby and you

01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:47,040
need to be considered uh

01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:50,719
concerned about that but um it's

01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:50,719
it's not uh signatures right now

01:37:52,239 --> 01:37:55,520
oh i'm still on youtube great uh thanks

01:37:54,800 --> 01:37:57,520
jackie for

01:37:55,520 --> 01:37:59,199
uh answering the questions the questions

01:37:57,520 --> 01:37:59,600
about the sharks keep on rolling in i'll

01:37:59,199 --> 01:38:00,960
just

01:37:59,600 --> 01:38:02,400
maybe you can read it already in the

01:38:00,960 --> 01:38:03,199
chat jackie and i'll give it to you in a

01:38:02,400 --> 01:38:05,600
second

01:38:03,199 --> 01:38:06,639
um i just want to ask arunesh the same

01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:08,719
question i asked

01:38:06,639 --> 01:38:10,080
kyrie but then from sort of more your

01:38:08,719 --> 01:38:12,239
machine learning point of view

01:38:10,080 --> 01:38:14,639
and then working across also topics from

01:38:12,239 --> 01:38:16,159
sort of conservationalism but then also

01:38:14,639 --> 01:38:16,719
you said the medical field and there's

01:38:16,159 --> 01:38:18,560
like

01:38:16,719 --> 01:38:20,320
different things where do you sort of

01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:22,320
see maybe the opportunities and the

01:38:20,320 --> 01:38:25,520
challenges when we think about ai

01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:29,199
related to the environment uh

01:38:25,520 --> 01:38:30,960
opportunities so outside i believe

01:38:29,199 --> 01:38:33,280
there are many opportunities i mean uh

01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:34,880
some of them actually uh

01:38:33,280 --> 01:38:36,320
put this link here which i was just

01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:38,800
seeing right now uh

01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:39,679
i mean it seems like a great list of

01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:43,119
things uh

01:38:39,679 --> 01:38:44,480
on which uh uh researchers could work on

01:38:43,119 --> 01:38:47,520
uh

01:38:44,480 --> 01:38:50,560
so i mean the opportunities are immense

01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:52,960
uh but uh as as a

01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:54,400
and then even in healthcare so i i work

01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:55,360
on like community healthcare like

01:38:54,400 --> 01:38:59,360
improving

01:38:55,360 --> 01:39:02,560
situation for rural health in india

01:38:59,360 --> 01:39:04,960
even there the opportunities are immense

01:39:02,560 --> 01:39:06,400
but for any of these things to be really

01:39:04,960 --> 01:39:09,760
successful

01:39:06,400 --> 01:39:12,320
we really need people to be

01:39:09,760 --> 01:39:14,320
involved with the problem as well as

01:39:12,320 --> 01:39:16,960
have some patience uh like

01:39:14,320 --> 01:39:18,639
these things don't just solve out like

01:39:16,960 --> 01:39:22,560
in one or two months

01:39:18,639 --> 01:39:25,520
it uh it takes a lot of uh

01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:26,400
effort into building the right kind of

01:39:25,520 --> 01:39:29,040
model

01:39:26,400 --> 01:39:31,199
it's iterative process and sometimes

01:39:29,040 --> 01:39:35,040
that takes years

01:39:31,199 --> 01:39:37,760
but if there are

01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:38,639
there are a lot of opportunities it

01:39:37,760 --> 01:39:42,080
requires

01:39:38,639 --> 01:39:44,639
a little bit of patience as well as

01:39:42,080 --> 01:39:46,320
as well as some innovation in tackling

01:39:44,639 --> 01:39:48,560
some of the unique things that show

01:39:46,320 --> 01:39:50,480
in many of these problems actually there

01:39:48,560 --> 01:39:51,840
are a lot of unique things that show up

01:39:50,480 --> 01:39:54,880
in many of these problems

01:39:51,840 --> 01:39:59,280
and and i believe that uh

01:39:54,880 --> 01:40:02,320
uh they they can all be uh

01:39:59,280 --> 01:40:05,360
addressed of course there are uh

01:40:02,320 --> 01:40:08,080
there's also like uh uh

01:40:05,360 --> 01:40:09,760
might be too much work compared to the

01:40:08,080 --> 01:40:10,560
number of people who are working on this

01:40:09,760 --> 01:40:12,239
topic but

01:40:10,560 --> 01:40:13,840
if more people get interested that's

01:40:12,239 --> 01:40:17,119
that's even better

01:40:13,840 --> 01:40:20,560
so uh but uh there is no dearth

01:40:17,119 --> 01:40:23,360
of uh topics as such i mean even in

01:40:20,560 --> 01:40:24,960
uh like for climate change uh uh there's

01:40:23,360 --> 01:40:26,800
a few i know

01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:28,880
from some of my colleagues like they

01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:31,440
work on trying to change

01:40:28,880 --> 01:40:33,760
behavioral patterns of uh of people in

01:40:31,440 --> 01:40:34,639
the consumption of electricity or gas or

01:40:33,760 --> 01:40:37,760
water

01:40:34,639 --> 01:40:40,639
and these are a few things i can

01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:42,800
say off of the knowledge i have but i

01:40:40,639 --> 01:40:44,400
think the list that khari has is quite

01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:46,960
comprehensive and that's uh

01:40:44,400 --> 01:40:48,080
that lists a number of topics which can

01:40:46,960 --> 01:40:50,560
be explored

01:40:48,080 --> 01:40:52,400
and this is true for many other topics

01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:53,199
also like even in community healthcare

01:40:52,400 --> 01:40:55,119
there are a

01:40:53,199 --> 01:40:57,600
wide variety of things that could be

01:40:55,119 --> 01:41:00,800
worked on

01:40:57,600 --> 01:41:02,239
amazing uh thanks and so again if

01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:04,159
there's any questions from people you

01:41:02,239 --> 01:41:06,000
want to know something you want to

01:41:04,159 --> 01:41:08,639
share something feel free to sort of

01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:11,040
raise your hand or

01:41:08,639 --> 01:41:11,760
write it in the chat i see that there's

01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:13,440
uh

01:41:11,760 --> 01:41:15,440
jackie answered a question in the chat

01:41:13,440 --> 01:41:18,480
and she added a link as well

01:41:15,440 --> 01:41:21,760
um so maybe a question to carry

01:41:18,480 --> 01:41:24,159
and also jackie um

01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:25,600
if i like the one the the project uh

01:41:24,159 --> 01:41:27,920
avinesh is talking about

01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:29,679
is really from uh he's based within

01:41:27,920 --> 01:41:30,840
academia and he's working together with

01:41:29,679 --> 01:41:34,560
sort of

01:41:30,840 --> 01:41:35,840
um sort of ranges within uganda in this

01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:38,960
example to

01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:40,480
predict poacher patterns and of course

01:41:38,960 --> 01:41:42,639
there's a very different

01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:44,159
incentive for academic academia to work

01:41:42,639 --> 01:41:46,560
on these type of issues than it is for

01:41:44,159 --> 01:41:49,440
business for instance

01:41:46,560 --> 01:41:51,440
do we see sort of this distinction where

01:41:49,440 --> 01:41:53,280
maybe certain projects

01:41:51,440 --> 01:41:55,119
uh are aimed to optimize for different

01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:57,199
purposes when they come from more

01:41:55,119 --> 01:41:59,119
academic surrounding i'm not sure who

01:41:57,199 --> 01:42:00,960
did the shark spotter one jackie in your

01:41:59,119 --> 01:42:04,239
case if that was like a business

01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:06,239
incentive business or academia

01:42:04,239 --> 01:42:07,840
um because of course there is a

01:42:06,239 --> 01:42:10,239
different tension of what in the end do

01:42:07,840 --> 01:42:13,920
we optimize for or for what purpose

01:42:10,239 --> 01:42:14,800
um maybe kyrie been evolved sort of in

01:42:13,920 --> 01:42:17,679
the silicon valley

01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:18,320
uh reporting on silicon valley you have

01:42:17,679 --> 01:42:21,760
an

01:42:18,320 --> 01:42:24,400
opinion about this uh i mean the only

01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:27,199
thing that comes to mind immediately not

01:42:24,400 --> 01:42:29,840
that it immediately speaks to the

01:42:27,199 --> 01:42:30,560
veracity of the research if it's from

01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:33,600
india

01:42:30,560 --> 01:42:37,840
excuse me academia or

01:42:33,600 --> 01:42:37,840
industry um but

01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:46,719
there are um

01:42:43,600 --> 01:42:49,920
i would say people whose opinion is

01:42:46,719 --> 01:42:50,639
that uh when when big tech companies

01:42:49,920 --> 01:42:52,880
take on

01:42:50,639 --> 01:42:54,639
support of let's say conservation

01:42:52,880 --> 01:42:58,159
efforts that it's like uh

01:42:54,639 --> 01:42:59,280
ethics watching operation um that one

01:42:58,159 --> 01:43:01,679
hand is doing

01:42:59,280 --> 01:43:02,320
not great things and another you know is

01:43:01,679 --> 01:43:05,440
not

01:43:02,320 --> 01:43:07,199
it's my understanding um you know though

01:43:05,440 --> 01:43:10,080
that

01:43:07,199 --> 01:43:10,639
there are groups putting pressure on

01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:14,239
like

01:43:10,639 --> 01:43:16,000
larger tech companies to um

01:43:14,239 --> 01:43:17,760
you know uh take stands on certain

01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:19,280
things it's my understanding

01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:21,760
i don't have the information in front of

01:43:19,280 --> 01:43:24,880
me sorry if this isn't totally accurate

01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:26,639
google would don't tweet this but

01:43:24,880 --> 01:43:28,000
um it's my understanding i think it was

01:43:26,639 --> 01:43:31,440
like google uh

01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:32,800
it does not accept money for or

01:43:31,440 --> 01:43:34,560
you know work on machine learning for

01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:38,960
like oil drilling you know

01:43:34,560 --> 01:43:42,639
and so there's the um there are

01:43:38,960 --> 01:43:44,960
definitely um uh

01:43:42,639 --> 01:43:45,679
projects around conservation that are

01:43:44,960 --> 01:43:48,719
popular

01:43:45,679 --> 01:43:52,400
in lots of spaces um that

01:43:48,719 --> 01:43:55,840
runs the gamut between academia and

01:43:52,400 --> 01:43:58,400
um let's say nonprofits that um are

01:43:55,840 --> 01:43:59,199
um really want to center in on ai for

01:43:58,400 --> 01:44:02,080
good

01:43:59,199 --> 01:44:03,199
and on the other side of you know people

01:44:02,080 --> 01:44:06,320
who

01:44:03,199 --> 01:44:09,600
want to claim that that that

01:44:06,320 --> 01:44:13,280
activity is

01:44:09,600 --> 01:44:15,040
intended to uh

01:44:13,280 --> 01:44:17,040
shape public perceptions about the

01:44:15,040 --> 01:44:21,920
company uh which are the

01:44:17,040 --> 01:44:25,360
largest on the planet wealthiest

01:44:21,920 --> 01:44:27,520
these days um so it does play into that

01:44:25,360 --> 01:44:29,840
sort of power dynamic i think

01:44:27,520 --> 01:44:31,040
um but i i don't i wouldn't say that

01:44:29,840 --> 01:44:34,320
i've seen

01:44:31,040 --> 01:44:34,719
uh any evidence of um the groups that

01:44:34,320 --> 01:44:36,159
i've

01:44:34,719 --> 01:44:37,920
that for example i think it was

01:44:36,159 --> 01:44:41,199
microsoft um

01:44:37,920 --> 01:44:44,159
supported some uh conservation efforts

01:44:41,199 --> 01:44:44,639
um that i i believe that they went and

01:44:44,159 --> 01:44:46,560
found

01:44:44,639 --> 01:44:48,560
nonprofits that were working on things

01:44:46,560 --> 01:44:51,600
and provided support

01:44:48,560 --> 01:44:54,560
to them rather than it being some

01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:55,840
bootstrap microsoft thing you know so i

01:44:54,560 --> 01:44:57,840
i would

01:44:55,840 --> 01:44:58,960
perhaps to that credit you know there

01:44:57,840 --> 01:45:01,199
are um

01:44:58,960 --> 01:45:03,040
very interesting projects and in that

01:45:01,199 --> 01:45:05,679
end as well

01:45:03,040 --> 01:45:07,600
the google.org team did a bunch of

01:45:05,679 --> 01:45:10,880
various

01:45:07,600 --> 01:45:15,360
uh ai uh supported uh

01:45:10,880 --> 01:45:18,480
projects um but again it does

01:45:15,360 --> 01:45:21,119
sit in that conversation around uh

01:45:18,480 --> 01:45:22,560
power uh that these companies have

01:45:21,119 --> 01:45:25,920
masked which is

01:45:22,560 --> 01:45:29,119
unprecedented so i

01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:32,800
i want to add on one thing to that

01:45:29,119 --> 01:45:35,440
uh is i mean just uh uh he said that uh

01:45:32,800 --> 01:45:37,520
like uh it's easier to do these things

01:45:35,440 --> 01:45:38,719
in academia i i won't completely agree

01:45:37,520 --> 01:45:42,159
with that

01:45:38,719 --> 01:45:42,159
but in academia

01:45:42,639 --> 01:45:46,239
there is a pressure to publish you know

01:45:44,480 --> 01:45:48,639
and publish in short cycles like

01:45:46,239 --> 01:45:50,719
six months one year publisher paper uh

01:45:48,639 --> 01:45:53,199
and as i said that the cycle for these

01:45:50,719 --> 01:45:56,719
projects is not short

01:45:53,199 --> 01:45:59,280
and and so so

01:45:56,719 --> 01:46:00,080
getting into these projects especially

01:45:59,280 --> 01:46:01,840
for ai

01:46:00,080 --> 01:46:03,360
and machine learning researchers who

01:46:01,840 --> 01:46:05,679
like

01:46:03,360 --> 01:46:07,360
publish all the time in multiple

01:46:05,679 --> 01:46:11,119
conferences every year

01:46:07,360 --> 01:46:12,960
uh is not the incentives are not

01:46:11,119 --> 01:46:15,280
very much aligned with such kind of

01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:16,719
projects

01:46:15,280 --> 01:46:18,960
but but there are there is a growing

01:46:16,719 --> 01:46:22,560
community of this ai for good people

01:46:18,960 --> 01:46:24,400
um and uh and and i i believe that uh

01:46:22,560 --> 01:46:25,679
as the community grows maybe uh this

01:46:24,400 --> 01:46:29,280
kind of work will

01:46:25,679 --> 01:46:32,719
be more accepted and be publicized more

01:46:29,280 --> 01:46:33,760
uh uh and also uh khari mentioned

01:46:32,719 --> 01:46:36,000
google.

01:46:33,760 --> 01:46:37,440
so so actually the healthcare project

01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:39,280
that i work on right now is

01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:42,159
is actually uh in collaboration with

01:46:39,280 --> 01:46:45,920
google. so uh so i believe uh

01:46:42,159 --> 01:46:49,199
um the industry can also uh uh like

01:46:45,920 --> 01:46:50,239
some support system that google.org

01:46:49,199 --> 01:46:52,880
provides is actually

01:46:50,239 --> 01:46:54,560
tremendously useful for uh academics

01:46:52,880 --> 01:46:57,600
like me also

01:46:54,560 --> 01:46:58,960
yeah and to your point on um uh the

01:46:57,600 --> 01:47:01,440
pressure to publish

01:46:58,960 --> 01:47:02,239
um in the link that i mentioned for the

01:47:01,440 --> 01:47:04,159
tackling

01:47:02,239 --> 01:47:05,360
machine learning workshop yoshi bingio

01:47:04,159 --> 01:47:06,400
the site exciting machine learning

01:47:05,360 --> 01:47:10,000
researcher who's

01:47:06,400 --> 01:47:12,800
you know he's uh focused

01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:13,600
in on in the climate change workshop

01:47:12,800 --> 01:47:16,159
that culture

01:47:13,600 --> 01:47:17,040
to publish and where you're the culture

01:47:16,159 --> 01:47:19,280
of where

01:47:17,040 --> 01:47:20,400
research searches are prioritizing

01:47:19,280 --> 01:47:22,960
themselves

01:47:20,400 --> 01:47:24,639
and that pressure to publish that you're

01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:26,000
talking about was what he was saying is

01:47:24,639 --> 01:47:27,840
something that's vital that needs to

01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:31,280
change in order for a metric

01:47:27,840 --> 01:47:33,840
like uh emission standards for your mock

01:47:31,280 --> 01:47:34,960
or you know mission you know uh you know

01:47:33,840 --> 01:47:37,920
what what your model

01:47:34,960 --> 01:47:38,639
emits you know uh being some sort of

01:47:37,920 --> 01:47:40,719
better

01:47:38,639 --> 01:47:43,840
number or metric for people to follow

01:47:40,719 --> 01:47:47,119
for the common goals that we have

01:47:43,840 --> 01:47:49,600
great jackie yeah i just thought you

01:47:47,119 --> 01:47:50,840
know i'd add a microsoft ai for earth

01:47:49,600 --> 01:47:53,679
has

01:47:50,840 --> 01:47:54,400
125 million uh dollars that they're

01:47:53,679 --> 01:47:55,920
giving to

01:47:54,400 --> 01:47:57,760
you know conservation projects and when

01:47:55,920 --> 01:47:58,880
you ask the guy who's in charge who is

01:47:57,760 --> 01:48:01,600
the you know ceo

01:47:58,880 --> 01:48:02,639
chief environmental officer you know how

01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:04,480
do you explain this to your

01:48:02,639 --> 01:48:05,679
shareholders you know he makes this good

01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:08,080
point where if

01:48:05,679 --> 01:48:10,320
uh this technology that they're um

01:48:08,080 --> 01:48:12,480
offering up can work in the field

01:48:10,320 --> 01:48:13,840
uh which you know not in office like

01:48:12,480 --> 01:48:15,920
that is stress testing

01:48:13,840 --> 01:48:17,600
their technology so i mean this is not

01:48:15,920 --> 01:48:19,040
just all of the kindness of their heart

01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:21,760
there are benefits

01:48:19,040 --> 01:48:23,040
to them uh probably tech stuff that i

01:48:21,760 --> 01:48:24,159
don't understand where they're able to

01:48:23,040 --> 01:48:25,199
write off a lot of this

01:48:24,159 --> 01:48:26,800
and there's definitely like the

01:48:25,199 --> 01:48:27,760
opportunity to like you know to

01:48:26,800 --> 01:48:29,280
greenwash it

01:48:27,760 --> 01:48:31,360
but they're also you know conservation

01:48:29,280 --> 01:48:33,119
has all these issues that you know

01:48:31,360 --> 01:48:35,119
they don't have as much data as people

01:48:33,119 --> 01:48:35,840
who are working um with on you know

01:48:35,119 --> 01:48:38,320
online

01:48:35,840 --> 01:48:39,600
social media uh data they have to go put

01:48:38,320 --> 01:48:41,119
their technology

01:48:39,600 --> 01:48:42,880
you know out in the arctic or out in

01:48:41,119 --> 01:48:44,880
these rainforests so if

01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:46,320
if uh conservationists create tools that

01:48:44,880 --> 01:48:49,679
can work with less data

01:48:46,320 --> 01:48:51,440
or hardware that can survive uh you know

01:48:49,679 --> 01:48:53,440
stressful situations that's going to

01:48:51,440 --> 01:48:56,800
benefit the non-uh

01:48:53,440 --> 01:48:58,880
conservation tools so um i think there's

01:48:56,800 --> 01:49:00,239
you know a lot of benefit here for these

01:48:58,880 --> 01:49:02,400
big guys to get involved

01:49:00,239 --> 01:49:04,239
in this space uh and especially if

01:49:02,400 --> 01:49:06,719
they're just you know handing over

01:49:04,239 --> 01:49:08,320
you know cloud computing time or

01:49:06,719 --> 01:49:08,880
hardware or software that they already

01:49:08,320 --> 01:49:11,199
developed

01:49:08,880 --> 01:49:13,679
it's it seems like a very obvious thing

01:49:11,199 --> 01:49:16,320
for them to do

01:49:13,679 --> 01:49:16,880
great thanks um i just have been told

01:49:16,320 --> 01:49:18,639
that

01:49:16,880 --> 01:49:20,000
i can ask one more question because we

01:49:18,639 --> 01:49:24,159
have to have a hard cut off

01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:26,000
in uh five minutes so i'm just gonna um

01:49:24,159 --> 01:49:28,080
my question is just a closing question

01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,560
to all of you about the title of this

01:49:28,080 --> 01:49:31,199
panel

01:49:28,560 --> 01:49:32,239
panel ai and environment friend or foe

01:49:31,199 --> 01:49:34,239
question mark

01:49:32,239 --> 01:49:36,400
and maybe you can give a max one minute

01:49:34,239 --> 01:49:39,040
response uh so that we are

01:49:36,400 --> 01:49:41,360
finished right on time and uh i'll start

01:49:39,040 --> 01:49:43,040
jackie maybe you want to kick it off

01:49:41,360 --> 01:49:44,960
yeah sure so i've been thinking about

01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:47,280
this and i don't think uh ai

01:49:44,960 --> 01:49:49,040
is a friend or foe for conservation yet

01:49:47,280 --> 01:49:51,280
i think it's maybe an acquaintance

01:49:49,040 --> 01:49:52,960
uh where it's still too early to decide

01:49:51,280 --> 01:49:55,280
which way it's going to go

01:49:52,960 --> 01:49:56,159
um i'm pretty hopeful but that might

01:49:55,280 --> 01:49:58,159
just be because

01:49:56,159 --> 01:50:00,000
so many other ai uses have gone so off

01:49:58,159 --> 01:50:00,960
the rails or have such a potential to go

01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:04,080
off the rails

01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:06,080
where i'm seeing uh you know such

01:50:04,080 --> 01:50:08,880
major issues within the conservation

01:50:06,080 --> 01:50:10,719
space uh that i have to be hopeful that

01:50:08,880 --> 01:50:12,080
there is going to be something and that

01:50:10,719 --> 01:50:14,960
ai can be part

01:50:12,080 --> 01:50:15,360
of the solution to uh saving the planet

01:50:14,960 --> 01:50:17,840
but

01:50:15,360 --> 01:50:19,760
uh it's yet to be seen if it's going to

01:50:17,840 --> 01:50:22,400
actually do that

01:50:19,760 --> 01:50:24,080
amazing thank you arunach your next

01:50:22,400 --> 01:50:26,080
friend or foe

01:50:24,080 --> 01:50:28,639
ah okay so i'm also going to take the

01:50:26,080 --> 01:50:28,639
middle pack

01:50:31,920 --> 01:50:36,400
like like any other like powerful tool

01:50:34,239 --> 01:50:38,320
it's very powerful and unlike like any

01:50:36,400 --> 01:50:41,599
other uh

01:50:38,320 --> 01:50:42,400
power it has two sides now now with the

01:50:41,599 --> 01:50:45,599
acknowledgement

01:50:42,400 --> 01:50:47,199
that there is an harmful side and we uh

01:50:45,599 --> 01:50:49,119
and those things are very well known i

01:50:47,199 --> 01:50:52,560
mean all the negative news

01:50:49,119 --> 01:50:54,239
spreads faster so uh with that

01:50:52,560 --> 01:50:56,480
acknowledgement i also want to emphasize

01:50:54,239 --> 01:50:58,320
is there is a friendly side of ai

01:50:56,480 --> 01:50:59,840
and some aspects of that we have

01:50:58,320 --> 01:51:01,119
discussed today we have seen some

01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:05,040
projects that have

01:51:01,119 --> 01:51:07,520
caused that have been very beneficial

01:51:05,040 --> 01:51:09,440
and and i i believe that as a society we

01:51:07,520 --> 01:51:12,560
should we should encourage such

01:51:09,440 --> 01:51:14,960
ai for good work more uh and uh

01:51:12,560 --> 01:51:15,760
and possibly publicize this uh even more

01:51:14,960 --> 01:51:19,360
uh

01:51:15,760 --> 01:51:22,960
so i'm very hopeful that uh ai can be

01:51:19,360 --> 01:51:26,239
friendly uh if we as a society encourage

01:51:22,960 --> 01:51:29,599
such working future uh

01:51:26,239 --> 01:51:31,840
thanks aganesh kari same question to you

01:51:29,599 --> 01:51:35,679
as a roundup

01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:39,599
yeah um i i would say

01:51:35,679 --> 01:51:42,000
friend info um you know i think

01:51:39,599 --> 01:51:43,199
there are some really good uh

01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:46,840
applications

01:51:43,199 --> 01:51:49,760
where uh just basic stuff like

01:51:46,840 --> 01:51:52,880
identifying rooftops

01:51:49,760 --> 01:51:55,199
that could support a solar panel

01:51:52,880 --> 01:51:56,400
are like we should all be doing that why

01:51:55,199 --> 01:51:59,040
isn't that everywhere

01:51:56,400 --> 01:51:59,840
you know are these seem like good things

01:51:59,040 --> 01:52:02,320
you know

01:51:59,840 --> 01:52:03,040
um and perhaps business opportunities as

01:52:02,320 --> 01:52:05,840
well

01:52:03,040 --> 01:52:07,679
um to you know move in and and to get

01:52:05,840 --> 01:52:08,560
more of those panels on on tops of

01:52:07,679 --> 01:52:12,400
houses

01:52:08,560 --> 01:52:14,320
um but i think uh part of what rnesh was

01:52:12,400 --> 01:52:15,520
talking about and i what i tried to get

01:52:14,320 --> 01:52:19,040
to in some of

01:52:15,520 --> 01:52:21,679
my comments today uh were

01:52:19,040 --> 01:52:23,520
conversations about a culture change

01:52:21,679 --> 01:52:24,159
within the machine learning community

01:52:23,520 --> 01:52:27,599
itself

01:52:24,159 --> 01:52:28,800
to put a focus on us what are our

01:52:27,599 --> 01:52:32,159
priorities

01:52:28,800 --> 01:52:35,920
and moving past purely a

01:52:32,159 --> 01:52:39,199
performance metric of let's say accuracy

01:52:35,920 --> 01:52:43,119
to being the the only number that

01:52:39,199 --> 01:52:46,400
is respected and considered

01:52:43,119 --> 01:52:49,599
not just uh uh

01:52:46,400 --> 01:52:53,040
uh beneficial for people uh but

01:52:49,599 --> 01:52:57,599
innovative um when you talk about um

01:52:53,040 --> 01:53:00,480
you know uh more robust models

01:52:57,599 --> 01:53:00,880
or more efficient models you're talking

01:53:00,480 --> 01:53:02,960
about

01:53:00,880 --> 01:53:05,440
innovation you know the same way that we

01:53:02,960 --> 01:53:07,199
might talk about bias

01:53:05,440 --> 01:53:08,639
machine learning that is not biased

01:53:07,199 --> 01:53:11,440
towards people is

01:53:08,639 --> 01:53:12,320
better machine learning it's not just

01:53:11,440 --> 01:53:14,880
not racist

01:53:12,320 --> 01:53:16,080
it's not just not sexist it's better

01:53:14,880 --> 01:53:19,920
machine learning

01:53:16,080 --> 01:53:22,320
so you know uh i think there are uh

01:53:19,920 --> 01:53:24,000
plenty of ways that it's that it's a foe

01:53:22,320 --> 01:53:25,280
um on the energy

01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:27,440
consumption side that we need to pay

01:53:25,280 --> 01:53:29,679
attention in trends of compute demand

01:53:27,440 --> 01:53:30,960
but there are a lot of opportunities and

01:53:29,679 --> 01:53:34,560
um one of them

01:53:30,960 --> 01:53:35,040
being a culture change on the values put

01:53:34,560 --> 01:53:39,119
on

01:53:35,040 --> 01:53:40,080
metrics amazing so the verdict is still

01:53:39,119 --> 01:53:42,400
out it's a friend

01:53:40,080 --> 01:53:44,239
nfo and it's an acquaintance at the same

01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:47,040
time i want to thank jackie

01:53:44,239 --> 01:53:47,840
agunes and kyrie for joining me in this

01:53:47,040 --> 01:53:50,560
first panel

01:53:47,840 --> 01:53:51,760
i think on moss fest this year about ai

01:53:50,560 --> 01:53:53,360
and the environment

01:53:51,760 --> 01:53:55,440
and i want to thank john and sarah

01:53:53,360 --> 01:53:57,840
michelle

01:53:55,440 --> 01:53:59,679
mozilla for putting this together and i

01:53:57,840 --> 01:54:01,920
know there's a lot more exciting panels

01:53:59,679 --> 01:54:04,080
on ai and environment coming in the next

01:54:01,920 --> 01:54:07,360
two weeks so have a look at the schedule

01:54:04,080 --> 01:54:09,840
and thanks everybody for coming

01:54:07,360 --> 01:54:09,840
