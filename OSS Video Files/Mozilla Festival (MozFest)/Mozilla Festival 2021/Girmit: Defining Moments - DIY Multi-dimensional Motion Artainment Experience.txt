Title: Girmit: Defining Moments - DIY Multi-dimensional Motion Artainment Experience
Publication date: 2021-03-11
Playlist: Mozilla Festival 2021
Description: 
	Girmit - Be Careful What You Sign Up For? Girmit, a corruption of the word agreement, is a global story of progress and change, with its routes in London. We exist in an age of agreements, with consent boxes on every portal and screen imaginable, our data being harvested like sugarcane. Over 150 years ago a sophisticated system of agreements followed the abolition of slavery. 2021 marks the centenary of the abolition of Girmit, also known as indentured labour. In an age of isolation, when oral histories become our heirlooms, Girmit approaches a complex history with empathy and sensitivity. This session will bring together a range of international voices; artists, academics, educators and technologists to talk broadly about the way in which agreements govern our lives. Followed by the world premiere of the Girmit 360 Immersive Experience on youtube.
