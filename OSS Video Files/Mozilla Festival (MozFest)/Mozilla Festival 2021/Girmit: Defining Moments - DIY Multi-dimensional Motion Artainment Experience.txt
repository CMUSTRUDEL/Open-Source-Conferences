Title: Girmit: Defining Moments - DIY Multi-dimensional Motion Artainment Experience
Publication date: 2021-03-11
Playlist: Mozilla Festival 2021
Description: 
	Girmit - Be Careful What You Sign Up For? Girmit, a corruption of the word agreement, is a global story of progress and change, with its routes in London. We exist in an age of agreements, with consent boxes on every portal and screen imaginable, our data being harvested like sugarcane. Over 150 years ago a sophisticated system of agreements followed the abolition of slavery. 2021 marks the centenary of the abolition of Girmit, also known as indentured labour. In an age of isolation, when oral histories become our heirlooms, Girmit approaches a complex history with empathy and sensitivity. This session will bring together a range of international voices; artists, academics, educators and technologists to talk broadly about the way in which agreements govern our lives. Followed by the world premiere of the Girmit 360 Immersive Experience on youtube.

um create this

00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:44,400
this this project this this and we

00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,639
this project could only have happened as

00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:50,000
a result of the pandemic

00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,960
it was um we had planned to do the

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,479
project

00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:57,680
uh from the

00:07:54,479 --> 00:08:01,360
summer of 2017

00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:04,400
so projects of this nature that we nukka

00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,639
nakka is the company that i i am a

00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,000
co-artistic director and founder of a

00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,960
nutcut in hindi means

00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,080
mischievous or mischief we imbue that

00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,120
kind of mischief

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:17,759
and that childlike sense of fun and joy

00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,120
in all of our work even in the dark work

00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,919
even in this in the work

00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,639
that is that is difficult to swallow or

00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:26,000
comprehend

00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:30,000
for younger audiences um in this

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,000
particular case nutka is the third

00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,519
and final part of the trilogy of work

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,959
called defining moments

00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,519
of the 20th century it started with a

00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:41,279
project

00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:43,279
called dr blighty in 2016 that marked

00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,000
the centenary of the contribution made

00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:47,120
by

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,920
soldiers from the empire who fought in

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,000
the great wall

00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,399
they were invisible they they didn't

00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,720
seem to have any narrative or any voice

00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,399
and it was through the discovery of

00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,120
hundreds of letters at the british

00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,040
library

00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,959
that we discovered that these soldiers

00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,360
had written

00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:05,200
and and were being sent back to villages

00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,320
that we discovered that this this story

00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,320
needs to come alive

00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,920
in 2018 we did a project called never

00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,480
set eyes which was about

00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,040
the greatest mass migration in history

00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,760
again

00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,120
a story that is not often told is not

00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,959
told in our history books

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,120
or in our schools and you have to dig

00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,959
quite hard to find it

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,720
that's the partition of india india and

00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:25,519
pakistan the splitting of this great

00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,680
nation

00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,279
15 million people displaced or walked

00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,600
from one side of the border

00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,720
to another uh incredible that hasn't

00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,480
been superseded

00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,080
as yet in history despite all the

00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,320
changes that that

00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,920
are going on on this planet at this very

00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,160
moment and this third

00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,839
and final part of the trilogy is gyramid

00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:47,040
means it comes from the word

00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:50,320
agreement the english word agreement

00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:52,720
and and it particularly focuses on

00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,920
the hidden history or the unknown

00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:57,120
history i guess

00:09:53,920 --> 00:10:00,160
of uh indentured labor in the 19th

00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,720
and 20th century my connection

00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,680
is i have a very personal connection

00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,040
with partition

00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:09,200
my father was a young man in

00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,360
what was the what was called the quit

00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,240
india movement or the congress party

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,279
that then became the congress party in

00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,320
the

00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,839
mid 1940s and my family moved from

00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:23,120
pakistan to india so that

00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:26,000
was a very personal journey for me

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:28,160
gyramid is a deeply personal journey for

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,160
me

00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,800
my mother's family are from fiji fijian

00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,000
is my great grandfather

00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,519
was an indentured labourer who grew up

00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,640
in a village

00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:44,240
in central india and as a result of

00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:45,920
the the development of the sugarcane

00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:49,120
industry

00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:51,360
found his way to fiji

00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,360
as an indentured labourer on a contract

00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,200
to cut sugarcane for five years

00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,920
the rest is history and the rest is sort

00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,600
of imbued in our project

00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,760
just before i introduce my colleagues i

00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:05,760
just wanted to sort of say to you that

00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:07,440
this pandemic has affected all of us

00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,959
every single one of us that is staring

00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,200
at our screen at the moment

00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:13,440
and everyone behind us and everyone

00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,560
behind those people that we know

00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,959
in some shape or form whether

00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,079
directly or indirectly through a friend

00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:22,480
through a neighbor

00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,360
through somebody personal my mother was

00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:27,279
from fiji

00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:30,480
and just over a year ago

00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:33,600
this month uh she died as a result

00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,120
of covid she died in the first wave of

00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,240
the pandemic

00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:41,279
i wasn't i wasn't uh i had no

00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:44,480
uh qualms about and

00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:49,040
ensuring that this project will

00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:51,440
be a project that we make in her name

00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,079
not just for my mom but for my mother's

00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,760
mother

00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:55,360
for my mother's mother's mother and in

00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,600
this week of

00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,360
international women's week it just gives

00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:07,680
the door

00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,160
and just ensure that the truth of who we

00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,680
are

00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:14,639
and and what we represent is always told

00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,639
we don't hold back on any aspect of our

00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:20,000
life because when we grow

00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,800
our truth we grow together as difficult

00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:53,040
i was playing zx spectrum for those of

00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:55,680
you know what a zx spectrum is

00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:58,800
when i was playing badly playing zx

00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:01,440
spectrum games in 1981

00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,000
jen was not only acing those games but

00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,920
he was

00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,680
opening them up and rebuilding the

00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,839
technology that goes into it

00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,680
so to me to meet a person like that you

00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:12,560
know is a great honor for me

00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:14,480

her experience and knowledge of oral

00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:25,519
history is incredible

00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,160
and storytelling is what binds us

00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:30,160
together

00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:33,360
and and sarah's gentle calm

00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:54,320
her beautiful voice and her ability to

00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:54,320

00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:27,279
in london and has given us access to

00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:29,440
documents that we would never uh as

00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:32,959
artists have had access to

00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:36,800

perfectly um and i think it would be a

00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:56,320
great moment to

00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:58,720
play the first sort of installment

00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,880
and the the making of the first three

00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:03,279
minutes of our making on film which

00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,240
will just give you a bit of a flavor of

00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,559
what we've been doing

00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,439
over the past what are we doing what are

00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:10,400
we saying now

00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:12,079
six six months i think maybe longer

00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:15,839
eight months nine months

00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:19,039
so um when you're ready uh alex

00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:19,039
go go go for

00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,760
2020 marks the 50th anniversary of fiji

00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,840
independence

00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,200
and the centenary of the abolition of

00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,760
indentured labour

00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,760
our story starts with sugarcane here at

00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:42,799
the royal botanical gardens in queue

00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,520
in london seedlings were transported all

00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:45,520
around the world

00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,760
for most of the 19th century q's

00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,640
principal purpose was economic botany in

00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,039
other words

00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,679
understanding plants that were of value

00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:54,720
rubber

00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:55,200
cinchona sugar and much of our work was

00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,720
around

00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,480
distributing these plants around the

00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,000
world for the british empire

00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,600
so accused had a long history in

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,280
economic botany and we continue to do

00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,440
that in the contemporary sense

00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,960
but telling the full story of our

00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,799
history in the 19th

00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,160
and 20th centuries is a really important

00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:12,240
challenge for us now

00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,160
as the great grandson of an indentured

00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,720
labourer who traveled from a small

00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,280
village

00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,559
in central india to the island of fiji

00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,280
in the south pacific

00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:23,039
over a century ago i brought together a

00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:26,160
collective of artists

00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:28,640
academics educators and technologists to

00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,559
create a multi-dimensional arts project

00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,679
that re-tells the human story of

00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:34,480
indentured labour

00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,280
by bringing together the past into the

00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,520
present

00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,919
in order to reshape the future from pen

00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,919
to paper we start with one dimension a

00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,039
graphic novel a story through the eyes

00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:45,840
of a ten-year-old

00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:47,840
of our indentured superheroes by

00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,679
recording the sound of plants we listen

00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,240
to and feel the sonics of the sugarcane

00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,480
plant

00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,600
by connecting back to the source of

00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,080
indentured labour

00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:58,080
the sugarcane plant itself through

00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,240
virtual reality we immerse ourselves

00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,200
into the 360 degree world of the

00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,280
giramittiya

00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,120
what underpins our project is the oral

00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,840
histories we hear first-hand accounts

00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,559
from men

00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:10,240
women and children the ancestors of our

00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:13,440
indentured labourers

00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:15,520
so these are the stories of men

00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,679
women and children they are individual

00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:20,880
stories of people who traveled from

00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,440
india across continents and we need to

00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,799
see them

00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,919
as people as individuals not as nameless

00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,919
groups of labourers

00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:29,919
girmet through the lens of art and

00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:32,240
heritage tells the story of

00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:39,840
change of connectivity and the

00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:39,840
complexity of the human spirit

00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:50,080
so ladies and gentlemen that's the first

00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,240
two minutes

00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,600
of a of a film that we we describe as

00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:58,000
the making of film

00:19:53,600 --> 00:20:01,280
it's um 11 and a half or so minutes long

00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,320
and it's a collection of voices you on

00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,200
the on screen you

00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,799
you just saw maria on some of the other

00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:10,559
films we have lorna

00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:12,240
sarah uh and jen and

00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:13,840
and also it was really important for us

00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,880
to connect

00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:18,480
directly with the um the leaders of

00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,200
those institutions

00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,480
the national archives in queue there's a

00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:26,159
there's a thirst

00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:28,320
for change it's happening

00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:29,919
and it's happening slowly and that

00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,960
change is that one word

00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:35,600
of truth and this isn't about

00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,480
changing history this is just about

00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,600
shining a

00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:42,960
torch on areas that may have

00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:45,200
uh being not not

00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,240
spoken about in the past for all sorts

00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,280
of reasons

00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,080
you know and i think our duty i think as

00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:53,280
a collective

00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:56,480
was to really really dig deep

00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:59,919
um and on that note i just want to

00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:03,120
uh introduce maria uh

00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:06,400
and maria perhaps you could

00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:09,200
just give us a sense of what

00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,400
what why what what has given me the

00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,600
approach that we've taken

00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:16,880
how has it been different for you and

00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:18,960
what aspects have been missing from

00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,880
the sort of gyramid story in the past

00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:24,320
and how are we

00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:27,360
planning to change that i guess

00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:30,559
um you know what i think i think that

00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:34,960
for a very long time there has been

00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:38,080
a divide between people who

00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:41,679
work in academic institutions

00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:42,720
um working as researchers as historians

00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:45,919
as sociologists

00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:49,120
on the history of indentured labor

00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:51,520
and people whose

00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,640
um people who are the descendants of

00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,159
indentured labourers and that's

00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,240
something very much

00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:59,360
i am against as an academic i think that

00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:02,880
the history belongs to the community

00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:04,960
um descended um descended from

00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,720
indentured labourers and i i think

00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,480
there's something that is very beautiful

00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,320
about this project is that it is

00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,520
interested in what we refer to in the

00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,280
academy

00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,440
but should just be a matter of practice

00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,720
for everyone is is public and community

00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:20,159
engagement this

00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:21,679
project is driven by everybody's desire

00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:24,159
to take this history

00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:25,360
outside and to show it's not just a

00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:28,320
history

00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,360
um ajay of people like you and i who are

00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,840
descendants of

00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:33,200
of indentured labor this is a history of

00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,679
the british empire

00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,520
it is british history and it needs to be

00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:39,200
seen as such our ancestors were

00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:42,080
transported

00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,640
as labourers under the british empire

00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,960
and

00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,400
the places that our our great

00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:50,000
grandparents came from

00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:51,600
were british colonies and in kind of you

00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,200
you mentioned in the introduction that

00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,360
this was a hidden history and it

00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:58,480
absolutely is a hidden history

00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:03,039
um historians have tended to focus

00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:05,679
on the abolition of slavery

00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:06,840
as the history of the british and 19th

00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:10,480
century

00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:12,640
plantation um in the representation of

00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,640
19th century plantation history

00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,799
and what they have neglected

00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,440
traditionally is the system that came

00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:21,200
after it

00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:23,520
of indenture and we know you and i know

00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:26,960
that within our communities there are

00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:28,400
um there are very precious very personal

00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,480
stories

00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,240
um and i think that the drive behind

00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,440
this project is to take those stories

00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,480
through the work we've done

00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:39,600
on oral histories and put them

00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:41,679
um put them on a wider um

00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,720
stage and make them accessible make them

00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:44,320
accessible to

00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,240
um so they're not just sitting in a in

00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,480
an archive they're not sitting on the

00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:50,240
on a shelf that holds thesis in the

00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:53,760
library they are actually out there in

00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,760
the world for people to access

00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,799
oops sorry uh thank you maria um unmuted

00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,919
myself

00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:12,080
um we need to be reminded

00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:13,919
we as the we as the people who are

00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,400
involved in that project and i think it

00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:17,279
just

00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,480
you know i find that knowing more about

00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:20,960
our

00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,600
history knowing more about our

00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,120
neighbours

00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:26,799
knowing more about our nation nations

00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,880
and knowing a little about nation

00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:32,240
building it makes us

00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,120
it gives us that broader more detailed

00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,320
perspective

00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:38,000
uh jim i just wanted to um

00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,840
come to you just just pulling back

00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,760
pulling on on maria's perspective

00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:46,000
on that kind of academic broader field

00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:47,360
just you know i said this earlier in

00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,840
your introduction

00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,360
you you have been a breath of fresh air

00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:54,559
for me

00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:56,880
uh in in you know i you know

00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:57,919
i i will i will confess that there are

00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:01,200
many things that

00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:02,400
gem the jargon that jen uses he knows

00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,679
what he's talking about

00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:07,279
it just takes me a lot longer uh i kind

00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:09,600
of get there in the end but jen just

00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:11,039
just give us a little bit about how

00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,120
you've seen the project or the journey

00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:16,080
that you've been on

00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,960
yeah i think uh touching on what you um

00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,039
maria said

00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,720
uh you know the sensitivity from that

00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:22,720
first zoom meeting

00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:25,200
uh you know and now we're doing a zoom

00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:27,440
world premiere at mozilla fest it was

00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:30,080
like understanding you know the

00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:33,120
sensitivities to this subject

00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:34,640
um and somebody could come in and i

00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,559
could come in and say yeah let's do this

00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,559
wowie wizzy thing but and the thing was

00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:40,080
to actually do something

00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:41,679
like maria touched on something that was

00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,520
accessible

00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:45,840
but something that used technologies

00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:49,200
that i started experimenting with about

00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:51,120
five years ago uh that now have become

00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,200
uh more accessible because of

00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:56,159
smartphones being smarter

00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,279
and youtube having a of two billion

00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:59,120
people so

00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:00,799
the whole idea was to kind of tinker

00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,760
with this multi-dimensional elements and

00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:05,039
also

00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:07,360
go finding uh tui and fiji who was a

00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:09,279
amazing graphic artist and looking into

00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:11,360
different angles and then

00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:13,840
lorna who is an amazing environment

00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:15,760
kaleidoscopic

00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,960
tilt brush artist which you could use to

00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,720
make

00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,320
heirlooms and this this is what i mean

00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,080
now i mean lorna's artwork

00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:25,200
multi-dimensionally i'm actually

00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:27,120
4d transcending space and time

00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,440
within the artwork that we've created

00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,120
and so there's a lot of elements that

00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:33,200
you're only going to explore when you go

00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:36,000
to the garmin world portal

00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,200
uh and yeah and also this thing mozilla

00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,799
you know you're going to search and

00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,799
you're going to find the truth

00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:42,320
uh that has been hidden for such a long

00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:44,480
time so yeah i mean it's been

00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:46,080
as we know an emotional project it's

00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,159
been a personal project

00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:50,320
you know for you aj and so yeah i think

00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:52,559
a lot of you know above and beyond

00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,159
diy ethos you know as you've picked up

00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:56,559
on as well has gone into this

00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:58,000
and i think yeah it's i think it's a

00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:00,240
project for the now

00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,080
and hopefully a piece of art that that

00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,880
will kind of stand

00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,880
the test of time

00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,720
thank you jim that's fantastic look i'm

00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:11,600
i'm conscious

00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:13,679
of you know an hour is is it goes like

00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:16,080
that you know we've we've just finished

00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:17,200
20 minutes and and we're only just just

00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:20,320
kicking off

00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:22,159
um but you know

00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:24,000
you know this is it's really important

00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:25,039
to hear those of you that have taken

00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,679
time out are they

00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:29,919
do any does anybody have any any

00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:33,440
questions on what they've heard so far

00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:36,080
or anything that's puzzling them or or

00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,559
any contributions that any anybody on

00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:41,039
this

00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:43,760
on this call would like to make um

00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:44,559
we'll also allow time towards the end of

00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:47,279
the session so

00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:48,640
if there is anything that you feel you

00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:51,919
you'd wish to ask

00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:53,919
and also be on beyond this session to

00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:55,440
keep in touch with us through our our

00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:58,640
portal pyramid

00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:00,559
dot world gir mit dot world which we're

00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:04,000
slowly beginning to inhabit and

00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:07,520
as jen just reflected on um

00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,679
the idea of um this

00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,960
project building you know really you

00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,520
know we you know

00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:15,679
traditionally when we make artwork this

00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:17,760
would be this would be the kind of

00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:18,720
show night you know the opening night

00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:21,840
and then the project would

00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:24,880
slowly kind of disappear but i think

00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,840
with with the approach that we've taken

00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,559
this is only

00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:30,080
the beginning you know in the in the 10

00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:33,600
months that it's taken

00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:35,760
to make this project and make it visible

00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,919
and bring this talented group of

00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:40,080
artists together it just feels like

00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:43,200
we're scratching the surface

00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:44,640
of of this of this world um sarah i just

00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:48,000
wanted to bring you into this

00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:48,799
sarah lowry um our amazing oral

00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,919
historian

00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:53,600
amongst other things of course we we've

00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:56,880
talked about this before on many

00:28:53,600 --> 00:29:00,320
on many occasions sarah that that this

00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:03,919
is you know we're losing you know a

00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:07,440
a generation you know before us

00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:08,720
and and you know this project was always

00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:11,360
about capturing

00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,799
the stories and the narratives of that

00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:15,919
generation

00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:19,600
um so i just wanted to ask you

00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:22,320
just a little about your input

00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:23,520
in in ensuring that oral histories were

00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:27,679
the foundation

00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:30,320
of gyramid

00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:30,720
um yes of course um and just to say you

00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,039
know

00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,799
very thrilled to be part of the extended

00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:36,320
family and the sort of warmth of the

00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:39,200
organization which is

00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:40,000
is very real in my experience um i think

00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,760
it's very kind

00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,600
of you to call me an oral historian for

00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,679
this project because really

00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:47,520
the the thing i did was was provide the

00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:48,240
training for the people that did the

00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:51,600
interviewing

00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:53,520
um who were um wonderful and

00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:56,240
you know gave up a lot of their time to

00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:58,720
to come along and learn about how to do

00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,440
all history as as best as we possibly

00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:03,039
could do it

00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:06,159
to do justice to um the story

00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:07,600
that um what we wanted to tell

00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:09,120
through the project and the people that

00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:11,120
came forward to give their interviews so

00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,440
so that was that was my major input i

00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,000
think

00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,520
um and it was a real pleasure to meet

00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,760
all the volunteers and the

00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:20,559
um wider members of the government team

00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,559
as part of that

00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:26,159
thanks ever so much sarah pan jarvis

00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:28,159
welcome from brighton

00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:30,559
pam jarvis has been somebody that that

00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:32,480
has been a uh

00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:34,559
a member of the nutcup family and a

00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:38,480
friend for for many years

00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:41,600
and her experience is

00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:44,960
really heartwarming i have to say the

00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:48,240
pam's approach

00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,960
and her input on many of the projects

00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,919
that we've done

00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,880
in the recent past has been so helpful

00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:54,960
so pam

00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:57,120
thank you and welcome pam can you

00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:00,000
continue such kind words

00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:01,760
much appreciated lovely i'm really

00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,279
pleased to be on this project it so

00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:05,120
excites me that

00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:07,679
because what is so interesting about

00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:09,679
these untold stories these lost

00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:11,760
histories and it brings it to light in

00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:15,360
such an interesting way

00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:15,360
such a communicable way

00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,760
thank you pam and pam's role in in in

00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:23,600
garabek currently is

00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:25,840
uh is uh to evaluate the project

00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:27,200
to reflect on the journey that this

00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:29,120
project is going on

00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,799
and how it fits in the kind of wider

00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,159
heritage world and i think

00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:33,840
what the conversations that we've been

00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:36,320
having with pam is how

00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:37,519
brilliant the opportunity to use the

00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:40,480
digital space

00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:41,679
has been um and to exploit that digital

00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,320
space so thank you

00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:45,039
um i just wanted to reflect back on uh

00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,679
the

00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:49,039
the the the starting point of the story

00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:51,840
kew gardens

00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:53,679
you know in the 19th century you know

00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:56,320
botanists were recruited

00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:57,039
in in victorian london in victorian

00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:00,559
england

00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:04,799
and queue was a place of propagating

00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:07,840
those plants to see if they could grow

00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:11,519
under different climates and when

00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:13,200
those botanists in hue realized that

00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:14,799
this could be an opportunity to take

00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:18,159
some of those saplings

00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:20,880
onto a ship at the

00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:21,360
at the docks in in east london off they

00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,000
went

00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:25,279
they went to the indian ocean the

00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,159
caribbean

00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:28,640
the south pacific and experimented with

00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:30,880
these

00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,840
with these seeds and saplings and as

00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,640
richard deveral

00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:36,799
the the director of queue talks about

00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:39,440
this wasn't just a pretty garden

00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:39,919
this wasn't just uh somewhere to visit

00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,080
on a

00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:43,440
on a sunday afternoon to see the

00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:46,320
wonderful crocuses

00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:48,080
as they are at this very moment in time

00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:50,320
this was a place where

00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,600
it was about nation building you know

00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:54,960
it's about

00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:57,919
looking at how the spread

00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,559
of uh the nation the british empire at

00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:01,279
the time

00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:01,679
could grow um so i think it's important

00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:03,440
to

00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:05,679
to reflect on that and we were very

00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:08,240
fortunate to connect with richard

00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:10,080
who connected us to his colleagues and

00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:13,200
in the palm house uh

00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:16,159
there are sugar cane plants uh

00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,799
which uh we had the fortune with with

00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:19,440
jen's

00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:20,000
facilitation and determination to work

00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,480
with

00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,720
another collaborator called snooks who

00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:28,159
has created something called subpac

00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:31,360
um to really listen to the sonics of

00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:32,799
that uh plant and we've

00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,720
we're beginning to think about extending

00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:36,159
that and what what is the sound of

00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,000
what is the sound of plant i mean once

00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:40,799
upon a time if i'd said that

00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:43,279
you know in the in in uh in public you

00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:46,000
know you you would get laughed at right

00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:47,039
uh and we all must have um recognized

00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,720
experiences of that

00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:50,880
but now there was a really there was a

00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:54,000
serious interest

00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,200
and a necessary need and i think for us

00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,600
our next thing we what we're

00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,039
keen to look at is turmeric we're going

00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:01,120
to take turmeric which is

00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:03,360
in hindi it's called haldi and it has

00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:06,000
all sorts of medicinal properties

00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:07,120
it has all sorts of you know properties

00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,040
in food and

00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:10,240
and all of that so that's something else

00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:14,399
that we're going to start to

00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:15,919
unpick the story of um

00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:17,520
i i don't know if there's anybody else

00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:20,639
that wants to wants to come in

00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:23,040
from mites from our team um

00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:24,879
who wishes to sort of contribute to that

00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:28,399
first half of this session

00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:30,560
um i'm doing my best to

00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:31,599
keep an eye on time we sort of said the

00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:34,720
first half an hour

00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:38,399
would be about the sort of overview

00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:41,440
um with with with a bit of the film and

00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:43,520
and some of us uh sharing our our

00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:45,520
thoughts and wisdom

00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:48,000
but if there if there isn't any more any

00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:51,440
more on that i think it might be useful

00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,320
to move towards the second part of the

00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:55,119
session

00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:57,040
is how and that is how we've used

00:34:55,119 --> 00:35:00,560
technology

00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:03,280
to tell this story of a community

00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,839
this story as maria says of individuals

00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,800
you know

00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:08,560
who have largely for a century or more

00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:12,000
um

00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:14,240
are nameless you know are are invisible

00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,280
and what is it that this pandemic has

00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:18,400
has done

00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:19,440
you know for many artists and arts

00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:23,040
organization

00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:26,400
it's been an opportunity to step back

00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:28,960
and reflect uh and self-reflect i think

00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,880
that wasn't an option for us for for all

00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:33,119
of those reasons i described

00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,400
at the beginning i think the opportunity

00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:36,480
was for us was

00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,520
when you come out that first phase of

00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,640
morning

00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:42,240
you you start to think what is our

00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:44,560
purpose

00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,599
what how do we now tell this story to a

00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:48,000
wider world

00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:49,520
and how do we build a community in

00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:53,839
sharing that story

00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:56,960
so i think technology has has um

00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:59,200
you know propelled us to this point

00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:01,280
it would not have looked like this were

00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:03,760
it not for the pandemic

00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:07,040
pyramid would have been a a live

00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:10,400
installation in a festival

00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:12,640
so could we louise show the show the vr

00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:15,520
film so this is the vr film created by

00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,520
lorna inman

00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:27,839
i will show you

00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:41,839
the gifts of the kirmityas

00:36:49,560 --> 00:37:01,050
[Music]

00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:22,420
he gave us the gift of a journey we made

00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:48,839
us friends

00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:51,839
[Music]

00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:51,839
hey

00:37:53,280 --> 00:38:05,839
shared sacrificed blessed and died

00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:05,839
in blood bondage your fate was tied

00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:47,839
[Music]

00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:47,839
oh

00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:53,680
in a single step a silent knot

00:38:54,720 --> 00:39:10,110
you bound our lives to so many

00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:10,110
[Music]

00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:15,839
so

00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:25,920
thank you louise thank you um we've

00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:29,040
obviously just

00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:31,280
cut that that short

00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:34,640
but i'm gonna now introduce you to the

00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:39,200
wonderful lorna inman

00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:39,200
welcome lorna hello hi

00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:45,920
what you were just viewing there was was

00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:49,280
a a journey between when an

00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:51,440
idea comes in one's head and

00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:52,480
there is some factual information and

00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:57,440
then we as

00:39:52,480 --> 00:40:00,960
artists have to fill in the gaps

00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:01,520
lorna it's been a pretty interesting

00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,880
journey

00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:07,760
right yeah um

00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:08,160
what a journey it's been the project has

00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,599
just

00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:11,680
evolved and evolved and when we didn't

00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:14,640
think it was going to evolve anymore

00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:16,000
we were all surprised as it did and it

00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:18,880
just kept on growing

00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:21,839
and i'm pretty proud of what we've

00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,839
accomplished now

00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,400
then tell us tell us when you if you can

00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:29,040
just reflect back on those

00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:30,480
really early conversations that we that

00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:33,119
we were having

00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:34,880
and and and then if you could just

00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:37,040
reflect on where we're at now

00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:38,720
just you know has that change did that

00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:40,640
change much

00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:42,640
or has it has it remained the same i

00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:44,400
mean i think i know some of the answer

00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:46,880
to that

00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,640
um yeah so i guess to begin with i

00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:51,680
actually recently found

00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:52,880
an image of my first draft of the

00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:56,000
project

00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:57,520
and i create all of i create everything

00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,319
you can see in a program called tilt

00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:00,160
brush

00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:02,640
which allows me to literally paint

00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:05,359
around myself in in 3d virtual space

00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:06,240
inside a vr headset and from within

00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:08,560
there i can take

00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:10,079
images of what i've created and the very

00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:13,359
first thing that we created

00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:16,640
was um three separate scenes

00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:19,200
but all together in one tilt brush file

00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,760
um and just for comparison to now it's

00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:23,440
now

00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:25,920
five separate world-sized sketches

00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:27,440
um and then on top of that we had

00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,920
between 20 and 30

00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:31,839
separate smaller sketches with assets

00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:34,880
that were inserted into the

00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:38,400
huge scenes because the scenes nearly

00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:41,760
broke the limits of the file limits um

00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:45,040
so we had to uh kind of cleverly

00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:48,480
find ways to insert more into it

00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:50,240
so just as a kind of um

00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:52,400
just to say how much it's grown i think

00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:54,640
that's probably the best example i could

00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,640
give

00:41:55,760 --> 00:42:00,640
i mean it you know i you know this

00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,800
i was just saying this in the

00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:05,119
introduction it just you know

00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,960
i'm sure for all of you on this on this

00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:10,000
zoom call many of you

00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:11,040
you know you know just we've all

00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,079
accelerated

00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:14,880
our ability to understand technology in

00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:16,400
a way

00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:18,720
in a year in which we would never have

00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:20,400
done before perhaps the year in which

00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:22,640
this year in our understanding of

00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,680
technology connecting with our family

00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:26,160
and friends

00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:27,520
in different parts of our city or our

00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:29,119
country or the world

00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:30,720
has accelerated you know what we've

00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:32,880
learned in 10 months or 11 months

00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:34,079
is probably what might take some people

00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:36,560
or some communities

00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:39,040
a decade to learn you know and and

00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:42,480
sometimes that forced nature of change

00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:44,800
is really important so so you know i i

00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:47,119
say all of that because lorna's

00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:48,880
you know sort of approach i think the

00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:49,520
approach is really important you know

00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:53,119
kind of

00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:57,520
it's it's a lonely job i guess being

00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:57,520
an artist you know with your headset on

00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:00,480
what does that feel like because i mean

00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:02,480
you know you're you know in a way that

00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,520
responsibility is quite great isn't it

00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:06,319
you know there's a

00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:07,680
great responsibility for the first time

00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:10,960
in human history

00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:13,040
with this technology to take this story

00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:14,480
and put it into a different space for a

00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:16,960
new generation

00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:18,000
and a younger audience or a family

00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:20,720
audience

00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:23,280
uh how does that feel i mean a sense of

00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:26,240
responsibility um

00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:27,359
so i guess to begin with it i i'm

00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:30,720
creating in vr

00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:34,720
and in this setting and the process

00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:35,119
um has been really great because it's

00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,560
given

00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:38,800
as well it's given me kind of somewhere

00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:42,800
to go every day um

00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:45,200
somewhere different um and

00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,839
in terms of having the responsibility of

00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:49,280
doing it

00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:51,920
of drawing it um as you know aj but

00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:53,599
um others won't i've just always wanted

00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:57,359
to make sure that we're

00:43:53,599 --> 00:44:01,119
telling the story in the right way um

00:43:57,359 --> 00:44:04,640
and with any kind of art i feel like

00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:05,440
with vr in particular it kind of brings

00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:07,760
you a little bit

00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:09,520
closer to the messages of the art that

00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:12,240
the art is trying to tell

00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:13,520
um so we were always thinking of ways

00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:15,440
that we could do that

00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:16,800
and immersing someone into these

00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:19,920
environments

00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:21,839
um gives them an opportunity to kind of

00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:23,040
feel something different in a in a

00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:26,160
different way to

00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:29,119
reading about the information online or

00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:31,359
um what even just watching a video or

00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:33,359
watching someone talk about it

00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:35,040
putting them into an environment and

00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:37,040
especially with children as well as

00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:40,240
we'll be sharing this with schools

00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:40,640
um gives the opportunity to to learn

00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:43,440
about

00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:44,880
it or want to delve into it deeper to

00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:49,200
learn about it more

00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:50,720
and i guess we hope that the environment

00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:52,319
kind of with the atmosphere that they

00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:55,520
have just

00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:57,440
encourages people to do that and

00:44:55,520 --> 00:45:00,160
and to yeah take the initiative to learn

00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:00,160
more about it

00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:04,079
thank you lorna unconscious is there

00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:07,599

touched upon i think

00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:45,920
and not only that just perhaps that you

00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:47,280
could you could also tie that in a

00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:49,680
little with your

00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:50,960
uh professional practice both you as an

00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:54,319
artist and as a

00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:56,560
scientist academic etc just something

00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:57,520
you know that you know we've only just

00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:00,000
met summer

00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:01,280
and um you know things are supposed to

00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:05,040
happen for good reasons

00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:08,400
and and and lending your your voice

00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:09,760
uh to the project uh to bring those

00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:11,920
words alive has been

00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:12,880
has been really important for us so

00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:15,040
please

00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:16,880
yeah i mean i'm absolutely delighted to

00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:18,079
have been put in touch with all of you

00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:19,760
and invited by gem

00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:21,359
actually so this whole story starts to

00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:24,560
jam again

00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:26,560
um and um i was fortunate enough to meet

00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:27,440
him during the release of my second

00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:30,240
album

00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:31,520
uh truth be told in which he brought in

00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:35,520
some 360

00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:38,800
uh magic and um it was

00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:40,160
an album that also included spoken word

00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:43,280
and storytelling

00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:44,880
and music obviously um and

00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:47,200
um we were trying to bring it all

00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:49,839
together with technology as well uh

00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:50,800
specifically wearable tech um which

00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:53,280
allowed me to

00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:55,280
also influence um the sound and the

00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:57,359
visuals at the same time as interacting

00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:59,440
with choreographers and dancers so

00:46:57,359 --> 00:47:01,920
the idea of multi-dimensional

00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:04,319
storytelling totally appealed to me

00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:05,119
um and i've often used it in my own sort

00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:09,119
of um

00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:12,560
science art crossovers so currently um

00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:14,720
i am the ceo of neurocreate where i'm

00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:16,560
productizing some of my phd findings

00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:18,480
we're building ai-powered

00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:20,319
creative collaborators um it's really

00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:21,280
cool to be here at mozfest on that part

00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:24,079
so it's very

00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:25,760
um ethical um and the idea is for us to

00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:26,720
get people into the flow state using

00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:29,520
sensors

00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:30,800
um including visualizations of your of

00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:33,280
their flow state as well

00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:34,720
and sonifications so one of the cool

00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,599
things that i was really attracted to

00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:38,720
was was the whole

00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:39,599
um uh you know the personification of

00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:41,440
the bamboo

00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:43,359
here which is really interesting as well

00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:44,559
and obviously being able to to lend my

00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:48,720
voice um

00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:50,319
to to the wonderful uh lorna's 360 video

00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:52,319
and of course working with jack and and

00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:55,359
how beautiful you've integrated it all

00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:56,319
um and um yeah so this is really really

00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:58,720
interesting for me

00:47:56,319 --> 00:47:59,920
i'm particularly interested in nature

00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:01,760
sounds as well um

00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:03,520
and i think you know my next thing

00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:06,400
hopefully will be to incorporate

00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:07,839
uh some of this sort of um sensory based

00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:10,960
sound sonification

00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:13,920
angles um from a trip to antarctica um

00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:14,400
also bringing to light this idea of um

00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:18,400
yeah

00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:20,079
um i suppose empathy you know

00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:21,920
through everything through through music

00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:24,160
um and um

00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:25,280
through different bodily sensations such

00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:27,040
as you know you guys mentioned the

00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:29,359
subpac and everything like that so

00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:31,040
very much about embodied um

00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:31,920
multi-dimensional ways of experiencing

00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:34,559
things very much

00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:35,599
um yeah attracted me to the whole the

00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:37,520
whole thing um

00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:39,760
obviously as well i'm from um asian

00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:42,559
descent as you can probably see

00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:44,000
um and you know there's um you know

00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:46,240
migration has been a big part of my

00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:49,040
family i'm from bangladesh originally

00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:50,160
um and i was born in uae my parents were

00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:52,559
also you know part

00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:54,400
um have had lived through i think three

00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:57,520
of these wars

00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:58,160
as well um and so so i think there is a

00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:59,760
certain

00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:02,240
i know when we talked about it jay's

00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:04,880
like how to actually maybe bring in

00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:06,400
i don't know this this internationality

00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:09,359
or this migration

00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:10,240
sort of tone of voice to the reading i

00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:12,960
guess um

00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:14,480
it's just something that um i've lived

00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:17,200
and experienced so

00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:18,640
i think there was definitely a yeah a

00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:21,839
more emotional connection from that

00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:21,839
perspective as well so

00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,760
great summer yeah and you know i think

00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:28,480
this this idea of

00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:30,079
um you know this international

00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:33,200
perspective is really important

00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:35,359
i mean i mean i guess for us

00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:37,680
in a way when i say i'm talking about

00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:39,520
collective arts it's a kind of normal

00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:42,319
you know it's not it's not you know my

00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:44,800
mother's from fiji my dad's from india

00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:45,680
my parents made london home you know

00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,680
british

00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:48,960
through you know through the core you

00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:51,599
know and

00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:52,480
every one of those distinct

00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:54,800
interventions

00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:56,319
there's a great pride you know whether

00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:59,359
it's through cuisine

00:49:56,319 --> 00:50:00,000
or language or culture or politics or

00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:02,079
history

00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,200
whatever you know they can all exist

00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:06,240
symbiotically

00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:09,280
you know uh and co-exist with each other

00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:09,839
and i think that that then you know

00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:13,040
you're

00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:14,400
drawn and attracted to artists and

00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:17,040
collaborators who

00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:18,319
also one doesn't have to have all of

00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:20,240
those layers

00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:21,560
you know i think one has to have that

00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:23,520
empathetic

00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:25,119
[Music]

00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,720
you know openness to be able to kind of

00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:28,720
go i get this

00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:30,640
oh my mother's not from fiji my dad's

00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:32,079
not from india i wasn't born in london

00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:35,200
but i get this that's

00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:36,480
absolutely acceptable um it's just the

00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,440
understanding the collective

00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:39,040
understanding so

00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:41,440
i think i think part of the project it

00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:44,079
was important for us all to

00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:45,280
share the same values you know have had

00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:47,119
the same

00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:48,480
you know do you know invest in the same

00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:50,319
mission you know

00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:51,839
um and just check in with each other i

00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:54,960
think i think the other thing to

00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:58,319
to share with you all is that

00:50:54,960 --> 00:51:00,319
we made it our commitment when we press

00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:02,240
the start button on this project

00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:03,440
in the first lockdown in the uk and

00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:06,720
those of you who

00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:08,400
who are not in the uk may

00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:11,040
be slightly unfamiliar with you know

00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:13,440
we've had three lockdowns i believe and

00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:15,760
and that first one was like an extended

00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:17,680
summer holiday for for many of us

00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:19,040
you know this is the birds you know the

00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:20,960
birds you know the birds

00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:22,800
came back to the gardens the streets

00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:24,000
were empty it was hot

00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:25,920
you know there were there were a number

00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,359
of you know you know people were using

00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:28,640
outdoor spaces more

00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:31,200
you know there was a suddenly there was

00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:33,200
a kind of a zest for life

00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:35,040
you know in that in that first lockdown

00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:38,880
so when we press the button

00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:41,359
to start this project we

00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:43,200
committed ourselves to meeting every

00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:45,200
week on a thursday for one hour

00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:47,359
we did our best i think we did quite

00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:50,559
well not to not for it to go over

00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:52,000
10 am so we started at nine and then we

00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:54,800
finished at 10 a.m

00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,520
and so it was almost like for many of us

00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:57,440
it was a kind of

00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:58,880
a start to the week you know it gave us

00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:00,400
that that structure

00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:01,760
and then we extended it at six months

00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:03,119
down the line we extended it to each

00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:04,000
fortnight so i think i think there's

00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:06,559
something important

00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,440
to share with you all of you who've

00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:09,599
taken

00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:11,359
you know your time to give us an hour of

00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:14,240
your precious time

00:52:11,359 --> 00:52:14,559
to share with you the structure that we

00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:17,359
we

00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:19,119
created for ourselves as individuals

00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:20,880
because we've all

00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:23,440
in many you know i said we were saying

00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:26,400
this at the beginning been affected

00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:28,480
had change in our lives in some ways i

00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:31,520
just want to briefly just uh introduce

00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:34,720
jack jack if if uh if you can hear me

00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:37,359
um jack has created a really

00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:38,400
uh what i would describe as a as a

00:52:37,359 --> 00:52:41,280
filmscape

00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:42,240
you know uh and and maybe some of you

00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:45,119
may have heard that in

00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:45,599
in the music so jack again you know

00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:47,520
you're

00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:48,960
you're you're not as new into the

00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:51,280
project as sharma but

00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:53,119
nevertheless you you you were not far

00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:55,680
you know shaman's not far behind you

00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:56,240
and so thank you for coming on board and

00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:59,359
and

00:52:56,240 --> 00:53:01,920
and being patient with us uh

00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:02,400
you know no it's it's been a pleasure

00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:05,280
yeah

00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:06,559
um i think you know it's like you say

00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:09,440
it's a question of

00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:11,359
similar to lorna of like trying to tell

00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:11,839
the story as well as possible with you

00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:14,880
know

00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:16,800
in my case with the medium of sound so

00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:18,480
and just really complementing the

00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:21,520
visuals as much as possible

00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:23,040
um and yeah filling out you know

00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:24,640
filling out the space was really

00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:28,319
important and

00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:30,000
kind of yeah it became like a

00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:31,520
film you know you're right yeah like a

00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,640
film escape kind of that's definitely

00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:35,680
how i approached it

00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:37,200
and uh i spent quite a long time like

00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:40,319
gathering materials

00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:43,760
sort of that i thought were you know

00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:45,200
would achieve that so um obviously we

00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:48,079
had the we have the like

00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:49,839
raw recordings from kew gardens which

00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:53,280
are in the sugarcane scene

00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:56,400
um and then

00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:58,079
yeah i it was just a case of i mean it

00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,119
is difficult as well because it you know

00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:02,640
obviously it's like

00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:03,599
19 20th century so sound wise you know

00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:05,760
you

00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:08,079
you want it to kind of sound like from

00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:12,079
that time but you know

00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:13,920
it's very difficult to do that um

00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:16,480
one of the things that we've realized is

00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:19,920
when you set on this journey

00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:20,640
you you you throw yourself in at the

00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:21,680
deep end

00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:24,079
you know you're we're dealing with

00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:26,480
subject matter and material that

00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:27,599
may not be familiar there may not be an

00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:30,319
archive for it

00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:31,359
there may not be the voices of that

00:54:30,319 --> 00:54:34,559
generation

00:54:31,359 --> 00:54:34,880
who can speak uh about that period that

00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:38,079
is

00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:38,720
clearly the case um but i think you and

00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:40,480
then you

00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:42,799
you know the the truth is in making the

00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:43,520
work making doing something you know so

00:54:42,799 --> 00:54:46,880
at the moment

00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:50,079
this project has uh a 360 film

00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:53,680
which i hope you'll all um

00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:55,200
view um and uh and please do share your

00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:58,240
feedback with us

00:54:55,200 --> 00:55:01,680
um we uh

00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:03,150
then have a uh an oral history book

00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:04,720
which maria is

00:55:03,150 --> 00:55:08,640
[Music]

00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:11,520
leading on uh and uh of oral histories

00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:12,000
of of that of of the voices of those of

00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:15,119
those

00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,920
of that period we have a graphic novel a

00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:19,359
comic book

00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:21,680
that we've created uh by our um

00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:23,359
fijian artist and then we have an

00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:26,319
education pack by ellie

00:55:23,359 --> 00:55:27,599
who's our education specialist so there

00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:29,119
are just different so

00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:31,839
you know we could have just had this as

00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:33,839
an installation in a festival

00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:35,599
uh that would have toured it would have

00:55:33,839 --> 00:55:36,559
been ephemeral it would have rocked up

00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:37,520
it would have been a temporary

00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:40,000
exhibition

00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:41,760
you know people ourselves would have

00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,799
visited that exhibition taking a few

00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:45,599
selfies

00:55:42,799 --> 00:55:47,040
put it on instagram walked away with a

00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:50,880
memory

00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:52,720
this actually has been i think

00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:55,040
uh it's it's been a departure from how

00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:58,079
we normally work but it's been

00:55:55,040 --> 00:56:01,119
uh absolutely unique

00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:04,480
on so many levels because now

00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:05,440
in in in a normal period whatever that

00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:08,319
means

00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:09,920
we would make a show and then we would

00:56:08,319 --> 00:56:12,240
move on to the next

00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:13,839
and the memory of that show you as the

00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:16,640
audience would come and see

00:56:13,839 --> 00:56:18,240
and you would leave with that memory

00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:21,920
this is completely different

00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:24,720
we've created this portal giramit.world

00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:25,599
where all of the assets of the project

00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:28,000
will exist

00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:30,240
free to public that's why it was

00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:33,280
important for us to

00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:34,000
connect with mozilla it was really

00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:36,160
important

00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,920
that we were looking for a partner where

00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:40,240
we wanted to launch

00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:42,559
this piece of work so it was finding

00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:45,119
those ethical

00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:45,760
open you know partners so so i'd like to

00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:49,200
think

00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:52,559
um at some point mozilla and the

00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:53,520
team surrounded you know become an even

00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:58,160
greater part of the

00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:59,760
extended uh family um

00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:01,599
i'm just conscious of time we've got

00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:02,319
we've got 10 minutes left and there's so

00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:06,160
much

00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:09,119
to talk about and so little time um

00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:10,880
and i'm i'm really grateful you know to

00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:13,040

00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:19,040
just taken time to you know have virtual

00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:20,160
uh fire blowing things blowing in your

00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:23,839
background

time you know um

00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:35,040
to to come to this space you could be

00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:36,400
doing something else is there is there

00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:38,240
is there anything i mean this is really

00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:42,400
an open call now

00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:45,280
you know um you know to share

00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:46,400
share with you with us anything that

00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:49,920
that you feel

00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:52,000
um has been perhaps missing

00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:53,040
perhaps you're not sure about you're

00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:56,880
you're slightly

00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:59,200
confused about um or

00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:00,400
or you want more clarity on is there

00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:02,960
anything is there anyone

00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:05,119
uh i have a i have an inquiry to just

00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:08,240
put out to the collective here

00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:10,799
um i've been exploring

00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:12,640
uh metaverse media and the media created

00:58:10,799 --> 00:58:13,520
from these virtual experiences and i've

00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:15,680
produced about

00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:17,839
500 hours of virtual events in the last

00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:18,400
year i've been doing this for about 15

00:58:17,839 --> 00:58:21,440
years

00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:24,480
but uh what i've seen is this sort of

00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:27,040
a cumulative effect of

00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:29,440
network building and yet no public

00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:31,520
comments for the media to thrive in and

00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:33,280
that's the events and that's also the

00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:35,359
experiences like all the things you've

00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:36,160
seen in my my backgrounds from different

00:58:35,359 --> 00:58:38,559
events that i've

00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:39,520
i've produced and so i'm beginning to

00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:42,240
think about

00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:43,040
the structure of platform cooperatives

00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:45,920
and

00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:47,440
the public commons and metaverse media

00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:51,359
and how we align

00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:55,040
how does that work effectively so um

00:58:51,359 --> 00:58:58,160
i guess the question is how do we uh

00:58:55,040 --> 00:59:00,319
continue to weave our efforts together

00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:02,480
and and build something that helps all

00:59:00,319 --> 00:59:03,280
of these ships rise and and reach new

00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:05,280
people

00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:07,760
uh so that they don't just sort of die

00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:08,319
in little open web corners of the place

00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:11,839
and never

00:59:08,319 --> 00:59:15,040
find their their true uh audience

00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:17,040
so uh platform cooperatives and and

00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:19,119
where where do we come together around

00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:21,040
the the future of this

00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:23,280
eva i think that's a brilliant question

00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:23,599
and um and you have entertained us with

00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:25,280
your

00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:27,119
with your background so thank you thank

00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:27,440
you for that it hasn't distracted me at

00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:29,440
all

00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:30,480
but but it's always nice to have have

00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:33,280
somebody um

00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:35,920
you know playing with their keyboard um

00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:39,359
evo i think that's an excellent question

00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:39,920
um i think what we would be really happy

00:59:39,359 --> 00:59:42,799
to do

00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:44,559
is perhaps pick this conversation up

00:59:42,799 --> 00:59:48,160
with you offline

00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:51,440
and i think that's a question that we

00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:55,040
can we have normally in

00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:57,440
in our previous live previous lives

00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:58,799
been able to answer because we're you

00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:02,240
know our thing

00:59:58,799 --> 01:00:05,839
is to present our sort of raison d'etre

01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:09,680
is is to tell stories free to public

01:00:05,839 --> 01:00:11,920
in any way we can whether it's on film

01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:12,960
whether it's on a podcast whether it's

01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:14,559
in a festival

01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:16,079
whether it's in a shopping center or a

01:00:14,559 --> 01:00:19,200
town square you know

01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:22,240
that's always been our our mission

01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:23,520
uh and our desire and our need and what

01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:27,280
we get from that

01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:29,760
is immediate um uh feedback

01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:31,280
because you're there you're there in the

01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:33,520
in the town square you know

01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:34,480
if somebody doesn't like your work they

01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:37,520
walk away

01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:39,920
you know if somebody is busy shopping

01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:40,799
you know and they stumble upon you the

01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:43,599
connection is

01:00:40,799 --> 01:00:44,079
is is really really powerful and strong

01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:46,160
and i

01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:47,520
totally agree that's currently missing

01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:49,280
in the virtual space

01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:51,200
but i don't think it's missing for long

01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:53,760
because i've i've heard this question

01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:54,480
come up a number of times even within

01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:56,160
our group

01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:58,160
you know our group we're invested in

01:00:56,160 --> 01:01:01,680
thinking how do we

01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:03,359
how do we uh get get feedback

01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:05,440
you know from from what we've done is

01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:07,839
our is our work good bad or indifferent

01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:08,720
tell us you know we want to know you

01:01:07,839 --> 01:01:10,799
know if

01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:12,079
if it isn't working for you then say

01:01:10,799 --> 01:01:14,000
isn't working

01:01:12,079 --> 01:01:15,280
if it isn't working and you know why

01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,559
then say that too

01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:19,680
you know so there's a there is

01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:23,280
definitely i think a virtual openness

01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:25,359
about uh and responsibility um

01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:27,040
i'm just gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna uh

01:01:25,359 --> 01:01:29,359
ask uh on that note

01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:30,720
uh because there's an opportunity here

01:01:29,359 --> 01:01:34,319
of feedback

01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:35,119
with talking about hubs uh and mozilla

01:01:34,319 --> 01:01:36,640
hubs

01:01:35,119 --> 01:01:38,799
can i bring you into that uh

01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:40,720
conversation chairman

01:01:38,799 --> 01:01:42,319
yeah i think with um i think i'm

01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:45,280
connected to evo on

01:01:42,319 --> 01:01:47,040
linkedin and um it's one of the things

01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:48,880
over the last five years with

01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:50,799
play labs that we've noticed this kind

01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:52,640
of change

01:01:50,799 --> 01:01:55,119
and convergence between people that

01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:56,160
would traditionally make films and games

01:01:55,119 --> 01:01:58,400
and that's kind of

01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:59,839
how you know we really approached this

01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:01,599
experience and it was

01:01:59,839 --> 01:02:04,079
it was going to be an experience and

01:02:01,599 --> 01:02:06,640
we're using software like unity

01:02:04,079 --> 01:02:08,160
and tilt brush uh and the reason to go

01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:09,920
to mozilla was because

01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:12,240
there are a lot of wall gardens in

01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:14,960
technology when it comes to platforms

01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:16,640
and mozilla has always been about an

01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:18,160
open and fair way but i've collaborated

01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:20,880
over the last five years with them

01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:22,480
and that's why we wanted to tinker a

01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:24,319
little bit within the portal setting up

01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:26,480
a mozilla hub and so

01:02:24,319 --> 01:02:27,440
that's going to be a space where with

01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:30,880
lorna's

01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:33,520
artwork 360 video the heirlooms

01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:35,440
so originally when aj first approached

01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:37,280
me this was going to be for the fiji

01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:40,400
50th anniversary and there was a

01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:44,079
family heirloom that's in the museum

01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:46,000
uh in fiji uh of a kind of corn grinder

01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:47,760
and one of the things was was to kind of

01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:50,160
get lorna to develop that and this

01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:52,640
object kind of transcends from the

01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:54,000
the comic book story which has even more

01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:56,079
detail into the

01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:58,240
the story of indenture and the the

01:02:56,079 --> 01:02:59,200
personal story of aj's family which then

01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:01,280
transcends

01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:02,400
from this object that can come into the

01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:04,880
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:07,440
and virtual world which one day it could

01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:10,880
also be a projection mapped installation

01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:13,520
we could 3d print the heirlooms that um

01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:13,920
lorna's hand drawn and another thing as

01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:15,440
well

01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:17,280
there's a lot of people that are not

01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:18,960
here as well they've gone into the

01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:20,799
the behind the scenes of this so the

01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:22,880
people that i'm sure you're working as

01:03:20,799 --> 01:03:26,400
well that craft the technology side

01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:28,000
and unity um and and and

01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:30,000
and also what the thing i mean now

01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,680
geniumo which is an open platform where

01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:34,640
you can spatial cast

01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:35,680
into any 3d environment with it within

01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:36,720
unity so

01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:38,799
a lot of the stuff we're doing you

01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:40,880
couldn't do five years ago it would cost

01:03:38,799 --> 01:03:42,799
you know like this this would cost maybe

01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:45,280
15 000 pounds if you

01:03:42,799 --> 01:03:47,359
a minute if you used a unity uh

01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:49,440
microsoft studio to do this

01:03:47,359 --> 01:03:50,640
kind of work so a lot of this is

01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:52,240
experimental

01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:53,920
if some of it has been around for a

01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:56,640
while and some of it is yeah

01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:58,000
blending of the art form so definitely

01:03:56,640 --> 01:04:00,720
be a conversation

01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:02,880
we'd love to to continue and how do we

01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:03,920
have the metaverse that's open and free

01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:08,000
and fair

01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:08,400
i think thank you jim that's great and

01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,480

01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:13,119
that

01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:14,559
subject matter up that's really

01:04:13,119 --> 01:04:15,839
important to us and i'd like to make

01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:19,200

let's not drop that that that

conversation

01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:28,720
um i just wanted to reflect um on

01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:29,680
mark's comment in the uh session yes

did i hear collective virtual

01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:58,079
international ah

01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:24,799
absolute um pleasure for us to be able

justice to the chat

01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:43,920
um there is so much to share with you

01:05:42,799 --> 01:05:47,520
but i think

01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:52,240
we all have inside of us a personal

01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:54,960
story and we all have the responsibility

01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:56,240
at some point in our lives to share that

01:05:54,960 --> 01:06:00,160
personal story

01:05:56,240 --> 01:06:03,280
either with a partner or a neighbor

01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:05,599
or a family member or in this case

01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:06,559
to take that giant leap and share it

01:06:05,599 --> 01:06:09,680
with the world

01:06:06,559 --> 01:06:10,240
and it's so liberating once on on many

01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:13,440
ways

01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:15,039
and and it's so exciting on on many

01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:17,599
other ways

01:06:15,039 --> 01:06:18,559
