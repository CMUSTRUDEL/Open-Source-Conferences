hi

00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,399
everyone thanks for recording in

00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,639
progress

00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:11,360
um i'm becca rix a researcher here at

00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:13,200
mozilla and your host for today's panel

00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,280
uh we have an amazing discussion plan

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,320
for today as part of our mozfest

00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,080
dialogues and debate series which today

00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,039
will be focused on the intersections of

00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,960
labor justice

00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:27,439
ai and tech so internet platforms have

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,240
created this new ecosystem of on-demand

00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,599
services

00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,640
managed by app uber and lyft drivers are

00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,280
managed by apps

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,719
on-demand translation services door dash

00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,239
deliveries

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,640
and what's more companies that are

00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:42,640
building ai rely on a vast network of

00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,680
on-demand workers to clean and label

00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,399
data sets

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,680
train and improve models um and some of

00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,000
these on-demand workers like

00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,000
mechanical turk are used to perform

00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,680
different short hacks

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,600
this has resulted in work that's

00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,440
precarious temporary unstable and

00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,239
workers aren't always protected by

00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,079
traditional labor rights and during the

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,840
global pandemic as more people are

00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,119
turning to gig work to make ends meet

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,159
these issues have become

00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:09,040
even more urgent i'm delighted to be

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,479
joined by

00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:15,200
three amazing panelists we have

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,159
dr lilly irani a professor at uc san

00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,240
diego

00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,880
dr irani investigates the cultural

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,880
politics of high-tech work practices

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,799
with a focus on how actors produce

00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:28,159
innovation cultures

00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:30,159
we also have rida quadri a phd candidate

00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,640
in urban information systems at

00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,880
massachusetts institute of technology

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,520
rita studies the experiences of platform

00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,520
work within non-western spaces

00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,880
and finally we have sherry stanley who

00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,280
is a lead organizer

00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,439
at turk opticon an organization that

00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,560
enables amazon turk workers to talk to

00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,880
one another

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,200
um turkopticon helps the people in the

00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:54,560
crowd of crowdsourcing watch out for one

00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,719
another because nobody else seems to be

00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,040
one last thing before we start uh we are

00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,520
taking questions for this panel in real

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,840
time

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,960
so if you're on twitter tweet those

00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:08,080
questions at mozilla with the hashtag

00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:10,479
dialogues and uh

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,000
and with that i think uh i'm ready to

00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,840
get started

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,200
um i wanted to start with a little bit

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,560
of of framing

00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,239
um so the gig economy we know emerged

00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,239
historically at a time when the global

00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,760
labor market was becoming more flexible

00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,160
and companies decided it would be

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,920
cheaper to transition from working with

00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,599
full-time employees to short-term

00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,599
contractors

00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:33,760
but the experience now of on-demand gig

00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:36,400
workers has changed over the past

00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,519
few years with new advances in tech and

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,440
ai

00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,120
um so i wanted to start with you lily

00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,400
can can you tell us a little bit more

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,040
about what new types

00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,519
of labor cultural work or knowledge work

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,239
you're seeing emerge

00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,440
yeah so when we think about ai we're

00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,519
kind of taught to

00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,040
hope that there's going to be these

00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,800
magical technologies that are going to

00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,239
have general intelligence or are going

00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,560
to be able to

00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,400
make associations between concepts based

00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,440
on you know all the data crunching that

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,280
google is going to do

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,720
on all the texts we produce on the

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,319
internet but actually

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,760
ai needs a lot of help so specifically

00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,000
there's something called supervised

00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,560
machine learning where an algorithm

00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,280
learns based on data sets that are

00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,800
already kind of pre-classified

00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,319
so for example if you're trying to make

00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,519
a machine learning algorithm that was

00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,080
going to classify

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,879
um actually people have examples of this

00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,799
in your life like

00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,879
you're trying to log into a website and

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:33,360
you get those recaptcha

00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:35,440
things that are like please click all

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,280
the bridges or please click where all

00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,519
the traffic signs are

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,200
you are actually doing this new form of

00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,879
labor because you are

00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,319
helping an algorithm learn the

00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,400
difference between a picture that has a

00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:48,239
bridge in it and a picture that doesn't

00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,480
um it's not only images though there's

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:53,439
also audio transcription you know so

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,799
uh algorithms that can kind of pick

00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:56,480
words out or

00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,640
do things with human voice they need

00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,720
workers to actually listen to the audio

00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,840
and then go segment the audio

00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,360
uh into chunks um there's also work

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,599
that's about bridging

00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,519
the algorithm out into the real world so

00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,280
sometimes on amazon mechanical turk i

00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,959
i've heard of tasks where workers are

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,799
asked to go out to like a grocery store

00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,799
and take pictures of products

00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,239
and take pictures from different angles

00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:19,759
so that the computer can better

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:21,280
learn you know how somebody who's

00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,079
shopping in a store later using this

00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,600
algorithm will

00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,880
also take pictures from different angles

00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,759
and the computer needs to understand

00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,800
that

00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,759
um but i think a lot of the conversation

00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,000
in the last decade

00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,800
of this has been a lot about the both

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,680
like what

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,440
mary gray is called um the kind of last

00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,000
mile of artificial intelligence and then

00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,080
specifically focusing on platforms

00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,320
but it's also useful to think about this

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,320
as like complex data supply chains

00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,080
um one example that came up in

00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,600
conversations i was having with some

00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,720
folk sherry knows

00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:55,199
it was um rev.com rev.com

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,720
is a site where people can get their

00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,240
audio transcribed so

00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,479
rev has their own platform where they

00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:03,600
have audio transcription workers

00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:04,800
and then also rev will then take those

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,039
audio transcriptions

00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,479
and an audio file and chunk them into

00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,680
little bits and send them to amazon

00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:12,000
mechanical turk

00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,680
where crystal an organizer with

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,560
tricopticon that i know had actually had

00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:19,919
the job of evaluating those transcripts

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,400
so this cut so this this is not just

00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,600
about

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,360
um the labor that powers ai

00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,880
although there's tons of that it's also

00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,639
about the labor that kind of gets

00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,440
treated like ai

00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:33,360
um and gets organized in ways that make

00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,960
it hard for workers to work together to

00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,720
know who their boss is or they're giving

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,120
up a lot of fees to platforms who take

00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,759
chunks of their wages

00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,960
and you know that's the situation where

00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,759
we're looking at changing

00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,720
um just to give one last example

00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,440
crowdflower

00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,400
is a crowdsourcing company that hired

00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,039
workers

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,680
on platforms like mechanical turk to

00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,800
actually

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,400
look at drone video footage and to

00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,800
look at the drone footage and say like

00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:03,120
is that a truck is that an suv like

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,840
segmented into human meaningful objects

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,720
so that

00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,919
so this you know this labor is also

00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,120
going into

00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:12,639
you know like technologies of war and

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,080
killing

00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,080
which is a big part of the economy

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,039
thank you um one of the reasons i'm

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,560
really excited about

00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,400
bringing the three of you together in

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,960
conversation in particular is because

00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,199
all of you

00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,400
are involved in either studying or

00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:33,680
actively building

00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:36,400
sort of labor resistance for gig workers

00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,039
um so i wanted to talk a little bit

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,240
about

00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:42,319
resistance networks uh and

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,400
you know why why are resistance networks

00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,360
so critical to a healthy functioning

00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,199
society

00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,199
and i think if you want to kick us off

00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:52,880
with that

00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:55,039
yeah um so i think it's important to

00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,120
recognize that of course power is not

00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,960
equally distributed and nowhere is that

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,280
more clear than in

00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,560
tech development where a select few are

00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,319
sort of able to design

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,319
tools and you know center their needs

00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,400
and assumptions into the algorithmic

00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,240
um into the algorithmic mainstream and

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,919
shift the risks of algorithmic failures

00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,680
disproportionately on

00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:15,520
to workers who's now livelihoods you

00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,120
know lily was i was talking about

00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,039
and shari will talk about whose

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,039
livelihoods depend on these on these

00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:23,280
systems working so i think it's

00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:25,919
absolutely critical to figure out ways

00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,440
how to redistribute um this power how to

00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,639
confront it how to transform it and

00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,479
that's where

00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,840
resistance networks come in but i think

00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:34,160
there's

00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,440
two questions that come up when we talk

00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,160
about resistance

00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,560
networks um one what kind of resistance

00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,360
is

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,360
truly transformative i think um so a lot

00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:46,000
of my work has been in

00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,479
in jakarta looking at platform drivers

00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,720
uh

00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,759
you know resistance networks in jakarta

00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,000
and i think um

00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:54,240
they sort of proven that since their

00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,360
behavior is part of the feedback loop of

00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,520
the algorithmic systems

00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,599
that learn from them they can actually

00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,960
transform the systems in very particular

00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:03,599
ways as lily was saying you know

00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,240
it's their labor that underpins the the

00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:07,440
system

00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,960
um and the drivers in jakarta for

00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,879
example you know have resisted the

00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,479
spatial dynamism of the platform by

00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,319
creating um

00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:16,000
spatially anchored stations that sort of

00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,919
mimic the traditional offline markets

00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,639
and have forced the platform to adapt

00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,440
um that into their into their business

00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,599
models um

00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,479
and this also goes to so to speak to the

00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:27,280
earlier question

00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,400
of um what you know you're asking about

00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,199
different types of

00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,440
of work and tech work i think it's also

00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,880
important to consider how the type of

00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,560
to think about resistance we have to

00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,479
think about how the type of

00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,080
tech mediated work changes across

00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:43,120
different geographic contexts

00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,720
so platforms actually do adopt very

00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,480
different practices and business models

00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,720
in different areas sometimes

00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,240
to skirt regulation but sometimes it's

00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,959
just a response to local market

00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,959
conditions

00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:55,440
um and practices and consumption

00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:57,440
patterns and so in jakarta for example

00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,360
we've now seen as a result of

00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,640
both resistance from drivers but the

00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,959
local um like

00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,959
algorithmic failures in the local market

00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,720
um the launch of something called grab

00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:08,080
now which is basically offline matching

00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,880
it's you know like a street healing

00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,360
model

00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,279
um so at grab now shelters drivers will

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,200
wait in a queue there's a dispatcher who

00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,839
manually assigns drivers to riders so

00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,800
it's the exact

00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:20,800
opposite of what we assume the life of a

00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,560
ride-hailing driver would look like

00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,480
and also the opposite of what platforms

00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,600
promised to deliver to us right they

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,040
promised they'd free us from the

00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,560
inefficiencies of anchored

00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,200
taxi stations but they've really gone

00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:33,839
back to the same that old model

00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,200
in jakarta and i think that's important

00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,440
to look at because the form

00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,480
that the resistance networks will take

00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,240
will depend

00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,519
on the um the existing institutional

00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,680
context and the

00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,120
context of work so i think um james

00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,800
scott has this wonderful phrase that's

00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,480
like form of resistance is

00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,959
also shaped by the institutions of

00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,080
repression and often workers choose

00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,839
resistance network

00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,360
forms which are able to respond better

00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,160
to their conditions and the trade-offs

00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,760
they're willing

00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,279
to make so you know resistance networks

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,560
won't look the same anywhere

00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,399
everywhere and the reason i bring that

00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:07,360
up is because often

00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:09,120
the resistance of the subaltern or

00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,240
particular segments of the world have

00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,519
been dismissed

00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,600
because it does you know it doesn't

00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,680
match certain standards of the right way

00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,880
to resist or what we have seen

00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,640
we have been trained to see as as

00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:23,760
resistance i think those kinds of

00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:27,200
both the forms and the reasons

00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,720
of resistance are important to

00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,200
consider when we think about resistance

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,200
networks

00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,120
yeah and i'd love to think a little bit

00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,120
too around um

00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,040
and talk a little bit about turkopticon

00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,920
which is i know a project sherry that

00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,360
you work on

00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:45,920
um and it's a tool to help gig workers

00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,000
and workers amazon turk workers uh

00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,959
collectively organize and talk to one

00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,560
another

00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,399
um so sherry i'd love to learn a little

00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,560
bit more from you about you know

00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,720
how was the platform initially developed

00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,000
what problems were you seeing and what

00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,720
are some of the things you've learned

00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,000
along the way in this project

00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,320
um first i would like to go about you

00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,680
know

00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:11,040
turk opticon started as a review site

00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,839
it started with lily irani and six

00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,279
silverman

00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,760
and they were students when they

00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:18,399
actually started it um

00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,160
and lily had been reading about some

00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:23,360
mturk stuff and she was like

00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:25,680
hey six this is messed up

00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,959
these people ain't getting paid why

00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,440
ain't they getting paid

00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:31,360
why ain't nobody stopping it and they

00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,760
had sent out a

00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,440
couple of hits which is we call that's

00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,279
what we call our work as hits and that's

00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:41,360
human intelligence task

00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:44,640
it's everything that a computer can't do

00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,040
so lily had sent out a few she had sent

00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,120
out

00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,680
and her first task that she sent out to

00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:52,720
turkers was to write a hawku

00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:54,079
and it had came back her results came

00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,880
back and it was just like

00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:57,760
please pay me um please don't reject my

00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:01,680
work

00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:03,920
uh that's where it started out at and um

00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:06,240
then that's when they went ahead and

00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:09,440
they they made the review site

00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:12,480
and they ran it for over 10 years

00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:15,680
um and let us vent

00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,279
scream what it you know we had you know

00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,959
we had some guidelines but

00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,399
you know it was the one place at the

00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:23,120
time that

00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,639
turkeys could come and say hey we're not

00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:28,959
getting treated fairly

00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:32,959
you know and that's how we got

00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:36,000
to and but it's that's what led to now

00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:37,440
though is it never really changed we

00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,200
could go there and

00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:43,440
scream to the mountains and it was like

00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,200
okay who are you screaming at who's

00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,760
gonna ever do anything

00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,880
um machine learning wouldn't be possible

00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,920
without us

00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,880
we're the hidden labor that allows you

00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:56,079
know

00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:57,279
researchers like uh jeff bingham chris

00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:59,680
kallus and birch

00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:01,040
they take you know all this money from

00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,320
these grants and things

00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,399
and they say that they're helping

00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:07,360
turkers or they're building this

00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:08,240
but we don't need nothing built no more

00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,839
like

00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,839
the building that's

00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:21,600
when you build something so much

00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:24,639
that all it is is an outsource

00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,959
it's not like really solid a solution to

00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:30,480
the problem

00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:32,959
then that's when lily had put out a call

00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,560
she said you know some things about you

00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:36,880
know she wanted to shut her copticon

00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,639
down because it really wasn't you know

00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,240
they wasn't doing the she wasn't doing

00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:41,040
the change she thought that she wanted

00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,480
to

00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:46,399
and then that's yeah we started out

00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,800
with a few turkers and we was like and

00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:53,839
lily was like you know

00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:53,839
stand up that's the only way and

00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,720
yeah no it's really interesting kind of

00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,720
what you say around

00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,320
you know we build this tool hoping that

00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,760
it will do something and then you

00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,360
realize it requires

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,839
a lot more work a lot more thick

00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,560
networks a lot more sort of organizing

00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:14,800
around that work and it's a journey

00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,000
um i know we're going to be talking a

00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:19,279
little bit later around

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,760
this idea of of scale um

00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:22,880
but i wanted to talk to you rita a

00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,120
little bit about

00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,240
your research on gig workers in the

00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,320
global south

00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,440
um and i know specifically you mentioned

00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,680
your research

00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,279
is around mobility platform workers so

00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,600
folks like uber and lyft

00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:37,680
drivers um you know we just talked about

00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,320
some of the challenges that end turkers

00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,240
face

00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,760
um i would love to hear a little bit

00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,399
more about you know what are some of the

00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:46,399
distinct challenges that drivers face

00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,839
and specifically how are they going

00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:51,760
about building

00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:53,360
um digital labor collectives right

00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,959
yeah it's interesting to hear sherry

00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,519
talk because in some ways there was a

00:14:54,959 --> 00:15:01,279
lot of very similar experiences

00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,920
that drivers in jakarta had um so on one

00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,440
hand

00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,959
there were a lot of algorithmic failures

00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,160
that they were facing because

00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:08,639
a lot of the assumptions that

00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,639
underpinned the platform um sort of blew

00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,880
apart when the platforms were introduced

00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,880
in in jakarta you know there were

00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,920
problems of maps not working very well

00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,120
roots being

00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,040
you know completely wrong there's a lot

00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,279
of traffic um

00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:23,519
and at the same time platforms were

00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:24,639
disrupting some very powerful incumbents

00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,680
and the existing

00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:29,920
um mobility space so specifically um

00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,279
what they call offline motorbike taxi

00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,120
drivers so you know

00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:34,880
drivers were really the face of that

00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,639
disruption and they were at the

00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,560
receiving end of the violence and you

00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:39,920
know not being able to enter certain

00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,920
areas

00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:44,079
and at the same time technology was also

00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:46,480
changing the spatial scale of

00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:47,839
work so whereas earlier a lot of the

00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,440
motorbike taxi work

00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,440
was organized around the neighborhood

00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,160
that was this was no longer true

00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,839
um so a driver from west jakarta could

00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,920
be completing orders in areas of east

00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,279
jakarta that they knew nothing about

00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,800
and so they recognized that you know

00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:02,480
they were the face of disruption they're

00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,120
facing an unfamiliar system and they

00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,399
really

00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:08,880
need help but to

00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:10,079
understand how drivers responded um we

00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,680
need to understand i think two

00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:13,920
important things and this goes back to

00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,360
my point about resistance networks also

00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:18,880
being deeply contextual

00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:20,480
um one in jakarta as with a lot of other

00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,800
cities in the global south there is a

00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,639
deep culture of mutual aid

00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:27,120
because your survival especially in

00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,639
particular classes is tied to networks

00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:32,160
and reciprocal relationships

00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:33,920
these drivers recognized

00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,000
that you know as with many other cities

00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,560
in the in the south formal systems

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,120
don't work for what drivers call

00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,120
children

00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,720
off the street you know this idea that

00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,920
as sherry said no one is going to save

00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,680
us but us

00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,959
um so this started resolving a lot of

00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,320
these problems through mutual aid and

00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:50,959
volunteerism

00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,639
and what started as groups of drivers

00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:55,360
meeting at public spaces while waiting

00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:57,120
for orders has now spawned into these

00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,880
thousands of interlinked communities

00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,880
across jakarta that have an ambulance

00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,399
system and an emergency response system

00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:05,199
and thousands of whatsapp groups

00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,000
and very fast moving information um

00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,079
networks

00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,439
but the form that this response also

00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:12,319
took so there's you know this kind of

00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,799
very kind of radical idea of volunteer

00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,280
based

00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:16,000
mutual aid that is underpinned by

00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,000
language of

00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,199
deep solidarity and kinship so drivers

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,559
college are the brothers on the road

00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,919
they say we sort of we might not be

00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:25,520
family but we're thicker

00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:26,959
than blood um and we have um

00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:29,280
you know this is a car this is sort of

00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:29,679
our our soul calling this is the purpose

00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,840
of our

00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,960
our for life is to help each other out

00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,600
um

00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,280
but also the form that they took um the

00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,039
former association actually came

00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,160
directly from the existing motorbike

00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:42,080
taxi market

00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,520
um where most of the drivers were

00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,960
initially working um

00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,039
and they were organized around spatial

00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,600
stations and so they've carried this

00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:51,760
form of kind of spatial meeting spots

00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,600
and transformed them into what they call

00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,440
base camps that have really become

00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,919
these are these diy shelters where

00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,080
drivers meet together and hang out and

00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:02,240
create information um so all these these

00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,000
relationships are not just online

00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,360
and these base camps have really become

00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,160
anchor nodes in this

00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,760
web of relationships um that covers the

00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:14,000
entire entire city

00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:16,720
really now and um these base camps both

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
are spaces of you know organizing but

00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,679
are also spaces

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,320
of just chilling out and kind of like a

00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,760
clubhouse

00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,280
um getting to know each other and i

00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,720
think that kind of has a wrestle that

00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,520
has like a circular

00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,640
um it kind of feeds back into the the

00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,320
the desire to

00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,840
help each other out because both you

00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,000
kind of you know it has a

00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,520
practical purpose of giving you rest and

00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,960
letting you charge your phone but also

00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,520
like a very deep organized

00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,559
organizing um purpose which is something

00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,039
that i think

00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,799
is not necessarily uh present in a lot

00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:48,559
of organizing networks

00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:50,640
of uh right-hand drivers because it's

00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:52,160
sort of so spatially

00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,919
um especially it's supposed to be so

00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,679
spatially dispersed so drivers in

00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:56,799
jakarta have really resisted that

00:18:55,679 --> 00:19:01,520
spatial dispersion

00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:01,520
spatial dispersal of their own networks

00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,520
rita when you're talking about that

00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:14,880
that's like

00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:18,240
we have the exact opposite though

00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:21,120
because we have to organize in public

00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,080
if our form forms or anything our

00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,799
reviews

00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:26,559
they're public you know anybody can come

00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:29,039
and see when we're complaining

00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,799
and things are like that and that's

00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,760
where we come into issues there too

00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:33,919
because then

00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,840
you know if you leave a bad review then

00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:39,200
you've got a requester saying

00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:42,160
oh you can't do that

00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:44,160
you know that's yeah and it seems that

00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:49,120
and we're all over the world

00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:52,240
so it's so hard to so we use our forums

00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:54,640
to try to get that solidarity and

00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,240
build on it but it's so hard because

00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:59,520
it's everywhere

00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:02,559
and that's yeah like you was saying it's

00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,679
you know we do we join up we talk about

00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:05,520
you know the work we do

00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:08,000
we talk about the bad requesters you

00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:10,080
know all of that but it's so hard when

00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,280
our forums are open

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:15,200
and we don't get any privacy because

00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,000
requesters will come in and they'll go

00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:20,080
back

00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:23,120
and say oh this turker said this

00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:26,400
is so horrible but i mean

00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,960
honestly turq work ain't that bad i mean

00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,520
it's

00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:31,600
bad but i raised three kids on it i

00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:34,720
wanted to be sure to point that out

00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:36,400
i've done this for six years you know i

00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,720
really love to turk

00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,640
because it did like you guys say it did

00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,360
give me the flexibility you know i got

00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,360
to go

00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,960
if i you know my kids had something to

00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,480
do at two o'clock in the day i didn't

00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,000
have to say oh i have to call off work

00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,480
to come see you you

00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,600
know i had that flexibility but then the

00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,240
trade-off

00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:56,240
like becca was saying earlier about

00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:59,919
trade-offs the trade-off was

00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:01,679
sometimes at 2 a.m i was woken up

00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,440
because the work was there and you had

00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:05,039
to get up and do it

00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,960
i mean and a lot of people's like oh you

00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:10,240
didn't have to

00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,039
maybe i didn't but you know um feeding

00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:15,200
my kids

00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:17,280
i kind of had to do so i just wanted to

00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,280
point that out that yeah the forums is

00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:23,280
that like us for us but

00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:26,480
it's so hard because of the privacy

00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:29,600
of people just jumping on and being like

00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:33,039
oh because it's public we can use it and

00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:35,280
no no please that's that's all we

00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:35,280
thought

00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,880
yeah if i i just want to add one thing

00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,280
oh

00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,480
does um in terms of what your cocktaicon

00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,960
was before

00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,320
um you know like chirokoticon is this

00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,640
website where people could write reviews

00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:52,000
it was kind of built on this idea that

00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,720
um of mutual aid like you know we i'd

00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,480
actually put up

00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,919
uh after the haiku that sherry talked

00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,919
about i had put up um a

00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,039
you know a task on the platform that was

00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:00,799
like what would you want to be a

00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:02,880
trucker's bill of rights

00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:03,919
and wage theft was one of the one of the

00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,520
things that like there are a lot of

00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:07,120
things jerkers did not agree on but one

00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,880
of the things that they agreed on was

00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,159
you know people could just like not pay

00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,919
for my work and

00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:13,679
you know keep it and that's actually

00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:14,480
still a problem today to sherry's point

00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:17,440
that like

00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,640
the platform the plot like being able to

00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,480
share that information with other

00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,159
workers kind of help some workers

00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,520
avoid what had happened to some worker

00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:25,120
out there but that first worker who

00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,440
wrote that review and said this guy took

00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:29,200
my wages like that worker still got hurt

00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,120
and like that's what we need to change

00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,600
um but

00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,559
there are all these forums where jerkers

00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,200
were

00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:37,760
mutual aid and chatting and chilling and

00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,360
that's what

00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,520
those descriptions so reminded me of

00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,440
that um but then

00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,600
and we'd hoped that the website could be

00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:48,000
a place where people across those forums

00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,760
could help each other out and to some

00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,960
extent they did but what's become really

00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,000
clear to me in the last year watching

00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,760
how sherry

00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,200
and the other turk workers who have

00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:58,559
turned trekopticon into

00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:00,480
an organizing kind of organization

00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:02,000
is like that has to be done through

00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,280
human relationships you're taking the

00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,559
time to build trust and build

00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,880
conversations across

00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:07,600
um and that's the kind of thing that ai

00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,960
will never

00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:13,039
do like an ai is a you know a brutal

00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,000
piece of computer code that's optimized

00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:15,600
for some

00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,360
patterns of text or image that we

00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:20,400
produce but you can't

00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:21,280
hold an ai accountable you can you can't

00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,960
hold

00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,480
it seems clear that we can't barely hold

00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,919
the companies and the institutions that

00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,520
use the ais accountable

00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,440
but you can hold the person-to-person

00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:31,919
relationship accountable and that's

00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,480
how people take risks together to change

00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:35,440
things

00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:37,520
um so that's why what sherry and others

00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,440
have been doing is so important

00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,559
a mutual aid can be like the first space

00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,880
for you know

00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:44,400
building that accountability and

00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:48,480
surviving

00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:50,240
yes which is not nothing yeah i

00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,640
i feel like um what's interesting about

00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,880
this conversation is we're bringing

00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,400
some of these different forms of

00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,400
organizing or different forms of

00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,320
resistance and dialogue with one another

00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,679
so i know you just mentioned like mutual

00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,279
aid networks

00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:06,320
um i know one of the things we've been

00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:08,640
talking about is sort of at what scale

00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,400
are these networks operating at you know

00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,159
mutual aid networks for example a lot of

00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,799
them are necessarily local and they're

00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,120
very much

00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:16,159
tied to a very specific place or

00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,880
community or

00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:19,679
job roles um and so i'd kind of love to

00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,240
hear from you

00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:24,720
about how you think about scale in the

00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,320
work or the networks that you work with

00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,000
and what some of the advantages are of

00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:30,320
working small but also

00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,400
how do we then build collective

00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:34,799
movements that reach the scale

00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,640
that is needed to effectively you know

00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:39,919
confront companies or confront

00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,919
different labor practices

00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:45,600
yeah i mean i can i can start with um

00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,120
with this question um so i think there

00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,799
are in jakarta right

00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,400
neighbors have thought about scale in in

00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:52,960
two ways one

00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,480
is or expanding in the organization

00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,559
system in a way that you're sort of

00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,559
creating a more centralized system and

00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:59,840
subsuming local chapters

00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:01,840
under different hierarchies and i think

00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:04,000
that's sort of the traditional way of

00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,520
thinking about about scale but there's

00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,720
another very interesting way to think

00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,720
about scale is

00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,159
replicating similar structures in

00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,279
different places and joining them

00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:13,600
together in a more

00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:15,679
horizontal relationships so they

00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,200
recognize that small neighborhood groups

00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,000
are important you know becca as you just

00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,600
said

00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,360
because you want to respond to local

00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,799
emergencies um

00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,720
you need to respond to neighborhood

00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:26,159
dynamics enter into relationships with

00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,159
local shopkeepers and

00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:29,279
and the sort of surrounding open fabric

00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:30,640
and as lily was saying

00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:32,400
build these kind of deep human

00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,559
relationships that do require

00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,320
a smaller scale i think to start with in

00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:38,480
that in-person meeting

00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,360
component but at the same time drivers

00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,880
recognize that

00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,400
it was important to scale across the

00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,320
city and cover it in a

00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,080
in this network of mutual aid and

00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,679
interconnectivity because as drivers are

00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,320
circulating in the city they could need

00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,640
help

00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,840
anywhere right so on one hand we think

00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,640
about um

00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,679
ride healing or platform workers sort of

00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,919
without

00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:59,600
not spatial but it is in this case very

00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:01,200
special because drivers are going from

00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,799
one end of the city to the

00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,640
to the other and they could have an

00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:06,320
emergency anywhere and so they need to

00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,640
be able to go to that node and

00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:10,480
require help from or have someone to

00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:13,679
call to in any part of

00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:16,080
the city so i think um

00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:17,679
dave drivers have used both a

00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:20,000
franchise-based

00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:21,600
model to achieve that where they have

00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,360
attached themselves

00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,960
to larger associations take their names

00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,840
help with resources

00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,200
and then you have sort of a central

00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,400
committee and a representative for the

00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,200
central committee and you know a more

00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,120
coordinated

00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,320
response and you could have that across

00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:35,120
across the city

00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:36,960
um but another interesting i think way

00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:39,279
of scaling has been to create these

00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:41,360
friendship associations between

00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:42,880
the communities of different uh

00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,440
neighborhoods which mean you kind of

00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,960
like

00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,559
kind of you know your friends you help

00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,520
out each other um but there's no

00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:49,840
impact on on decision making and you

00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,960
help

00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:54,880
other drivers set up

00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:57,200
base camps and communities in different

00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,720
parts of

00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,559
the city because they recognize of

00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,679
course effective for effective response

00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:04,000
to be mounted you need

00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:05,520
you need scale and in terms of

00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,520
confronting the platforms

00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:09,039
these communities because now uh they

00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,159
have thousands of members and they're so

00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:12,559
interconnected

00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:14,080
hold a lot of latent political power and

00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:16,000
they have been able to get the

00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,120
attention of the platform um and we can

00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,840
maybe talk about that

00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:21,600
later um and platforms have done a lot

00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,880
of outreach to communities and there's a

00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,960
lot of

00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,080
i want a lot of but a lot more open

00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,720
communication

00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,919
or lines of communication between the

00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,640
driver communities

00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:34,159
and um the platforms in a way that i

00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,880
definitely have not seen

00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:38,240
like uber or lyft have with their um

00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,240
with their driver communities but i

00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:43,039
think that scale was very

00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,640
recognizing creating that scale without

00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:45,679
diluting the identity and power of the

00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,840
neighborhood level

00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:50,640
group is very important to creating that

00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,640
political power

00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:56,640
i could jump in next i mean i i think

00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:59,679
one of the

00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:02,640
one of the everything said like that

00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:03,360
you know that is really beautifully

00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,640
explains

00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,399
you know the challenges of having those

00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,760
rich personal connections but also being

00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:09,200
able to kind of confront

00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,440
the platform or confront like being able

00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:14,240
to help a worker anywhere in the city

00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:16,000
another example that i think about when

00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:18,159
i think about this scale problem

00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,720
is um you know we were trying to figure

00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:21,760
out how to sustain trek opticon as a

00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,760
project

00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,520
um you know trick optic on this review

00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:29,600
website

00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:32,320
we first thought well maybe

00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:33,039
basically tech solidarity between tech

00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,880
workers

00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:36,320
in different parts of the industry with

00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,000
turkers um

00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:40,000
has been a really important part of our

00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,679
organizing strategy as it's come up

00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,279
um you know one of the reasons is that

00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:45,360
you know we were trying to teach

00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:47,440
you know some front-end coding you know

00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:49,279
so to empower workers to

00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,279
check workers to autonomously maintain

00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:54,480
the website make their own decisions

00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:56,080
and i came to realize that people who

00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:59,279
know how to code and maintain

00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,840
a full stack website they've had so many

00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:03,039
years

00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:05,279
of educational resources and time

00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:07,200
made available to them and we live in a

00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:07,840
society where that investment of kind of

00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:11,760
coding

00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:13,440
education is really expensive to get and

00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,240
only you know jane margulis has written

00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,000
about only how

00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,840
wealthier public schools even have that

00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,279
as an option um

00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:21,039
so you know like at one point there's

00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:24,240
kind of like the scale of a society

00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:27,120
and what kinds of capacities people um

00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,720
have the time to develop and you know

00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,399
where do you get those capacities when

00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,000
you need them to organize a movement so

00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:34,240
part of that was for us to think about

00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,880
okay let's think about tech workers

00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,679
as a movement and how tech workers who

00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:41,120
are working

00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:42,640
at engineering jobs who want turkers to

00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,000
be treated better how can they engage in

00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,799
solidarity work

00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,240
um so we kind of had to like scale up in

00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:49,279
some sense how we were thinking about it

00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:53,440
or

00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:56,640
today uh sherry has a donate here link

00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:58,720
on her background and um

00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,679
you know we you know we're trying to

00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,880
fundraise

00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:04,320
to pay for to pay for the time and the

00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,000
resources that the truckers need to

00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:08,159
organize for themselves and to develop

00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,679
you know their own networks to be able

00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:11,279
to you know articulate

00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:13,840
what they need but we're launching this

00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:16,080
as a campaign where we're trying to get

00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,360
other tech workers in solidarity to

00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:20,080
donate resources

00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,640
and the idea is you know ai is this huge

00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,559
huge

00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,880
is it industry that's where some people

00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:26,240
are making seven figure salaries

00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,919
and then some people who are absolutely

00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:30,000
essential to the production ai

00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:31,919
production of air are getting a very

00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,480
small proportion of that and so

00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:36,000
um part of you know scaling up lets us

00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,279
see an argument about how

00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,360
the value that's being created in this

00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:40,399
industry is not being distributed fairly

00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,760
at all and then

00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:43,440
kind of this fundraising campaign is a

00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,039
way to remediate that so i think

00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:48,960
sometimes scale also lets

00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:51,039
us um you know like see

00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:53,120
selective ways where it makes sense to

00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:54,240
reach out and find the connections that

00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:56,240
our group that

00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:58,720
something change has to other people who

00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:02,000
also maybe want to see something changed

00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:03,840
or are benefiting from

00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,159
are benefiting from the oppression of

00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:08,480
others in the system but maybe you know

00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:09,519
are willing to kind of act against that

00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,600
um

00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:12,880
yeah so those are the scale thing is

00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,960
really abstract

00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,559
but um those are some examples that kind

00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,320
of got me thinking about from

00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:20,320
the organizing that we've i've been part

00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:22,159
of

00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,919
yeah it's i'm glad you bring that up

00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:24,960
because i think one of the things i've

00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:27,440
been thinking about too

00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,159
is sort of the ways in which we tend to

00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,840
center

00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:32,399
the technology or the tool or the

00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,760
platform um

00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:35,760
and i think one of the lessons i'm

00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:37,679
hearing from you around turkopticon

00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,360
is that you know it's one thing to build

00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:40,960
the platform but unless

00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:43,120
it's really organized by workers

00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,480
themselves and they're really actively

00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,440
involved in the creation of these

00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:48,080
networks

00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:49,120
you know it's just the technology um so

00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:51,760
i'd love to hear from

00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:53,760
from both of you around you know why is

00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:55,760
it important that these tools or these

00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,720
networks are organized by workers

00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,559
themselves

00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:00,799
and what are the limitations when you

00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:01,360
know technologists or tech companies

00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:04,720
kind of

00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:07,120
try to create them um or try to create

00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,120
tools

00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:14,960
sure i feel like this is like i know

00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:19,120
you're bursting with so many things

00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:22,320
oh when you talk about tools researchers

00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:24,799
and academics and

00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:27,120
pet companies they're all like oh we're

00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:28,480
building this we're gonna make it great

00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:31,919
and you're gonna love it

00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:34,960
and just come join us and

00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:35,919
you get all you know all involved in it

00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:40,880
and then you're like

00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:40,880
then guess what their project's over

00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,399
and then you know what we're left with

00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,399
nothing

00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:47,600
they're like oh we've got some money see

00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:49,760
you later

00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:51,200
we've got our papers we've got our

00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,919
technology

00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,440
you know we've made our alexas we've

00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:57,919
made our google home

00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,120
you know we don't ever get you know

00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:03,200
because i've said

00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:03,919
and this is no joke i've set for days

00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:07,600
before

00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:11,200
and recorded myself saying

00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:15,919
hey google or hey alexa

00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:15,919
or any of them and it was just like

00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:22,559
crazy how

00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,880
that i built all this or i helped build

00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:26,240
it

00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:29,519
we build it and you never

00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:33,200
hear about us like never and

00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:38,960
it's crazy to think

00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:42,000
that when i sit back

00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:45,120
and i'm like tag them them

00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,320
you know devices cause big bucks and

00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:49,440
they can't even pay me

00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:51,760
more than five cents because that's how

00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:54,240
much you get paid per task

00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:56,960
or that was the pay then yeah i mean you

00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:59,279
could make pretty

00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:01,279
you could make money i would say that

00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:04,080
they did pay

00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:05,360
but i can remember sitting for hours and

00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:09,520
hours and hours

00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:12,399
on end and it never ever been like

00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:15,200
hey you know mechanical turk workers

00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:18,480
yeah some do but

00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:21,040
not very many people know us

00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:23,040
can i also jump in with like uh some on

00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:25,760
the academics i'm a pr i'm an academic

00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:27,359
and so maybe i can do some gentle

00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,960
calling in on my people

00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:30,560
um because one thing that sherry and i

00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:34,079
have talked a lot about is

00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:35,599
um you know projects where academics

00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:37,200
come in and say like oh we want to build

00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:39,440
a tool to make jerking better

00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,960
to upskill turkers so that they can

00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,560
build a career and get to a higher

00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:45,119
paying job

00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:46,800
or here's a tool that will make them

00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:48,399
make it easier to find

00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,159
you know find jobs that you know pay

00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:52,480
them more or something and

00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:53,760
the pattern that ends up happening is

00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,359
that you know because they have money

00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,200
from this grant like some trickers will

00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:59,920
work with them and help them out

00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:01,040
but one like the grant runs out and

00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:03,119
there's no money like

00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:05,119
we don't we don't have like a public

00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:06,640
funding strategy to fund technology that

00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:08,160
people actually need like

00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,440
for some reason at some point in our

00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,440
country we decided that paying for

00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,200
libraries to keep the lights on and have

00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,839
toilets and be full of books and desks

00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,520
was like an

00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:17,359
investment we were gonna make but we

00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:19,040
don't have any kind of ethos of that for

00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:20,720
really public kind of computational

00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:22,160
technology and so it's all on

00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:24,160
you know get the grant to make the

00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:25,520
innovative idea and then it peters out

00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,240
and then like who's left holding the

00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,520
code

00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,040
you know for like the investments

00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:30,480
workers have made and like they're kind

00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:32,079
of putting their times and aspirations

00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:34,160
and to say that like academic

00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:35,680
project or that short-lived activist

00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:37,440
project um

00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:39,440
like another problem is that because

00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:42,800
like workers will get pulled into these

00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:44,400
like one-off projects um like they'll

00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,000
get you know they'll get kind of held up

00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,599
as like look we're talking to workers

00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,400
but actually like the broader base of

00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:51,280
workers

00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,720
like are you haven't been consulted like

00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,480
there isn't a sense that

00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:56,240
you know this is something that a lot of

00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,920
people want or addresses like

00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:00,320
a lot of different people's needs like

00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:02,240
there's such diversity among turkers

00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,920
diversity and political where they

00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:06,240
politically identify

00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:08,079
diversity in terms of like people with

00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,359
all kinds of different like abilities

00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:11,680
and disabilities

00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:12,720
like life experiences you know careers

00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,079
that they've had and knowledge that

00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,680
they're bringing in like there's nurses

00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:18,240
there's teachers like there's

00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:19,920
all kinds of people doing this work um

00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,280
but you know like those technologies

00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,480
aren't usually coming

00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:26,240
are not an expression of a coalition

00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:28,480
that can then like get together to kind

00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:29,839
of maintain the technology and to like

00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,839
make sure it's doing the things they

00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:32,480
needed to do or to advocate to like find

00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:34,640
resources

00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,240
to sustain it so those are some of the

00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,680
problems somebody who like built a thing

00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:39,599
for 10 years and did not know

00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:41,599
anything about organizing and went

00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:45,040
through all the cycles of kind of

00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:46,560
you know burnout and frustration like uh

00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,480
i think that a lot of how we build

00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:51,680
technology for people

00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:53,599
um mostly makes people into kind of

00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:55,119
sources of information to inform the

00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:56,480
tech design but we don't build

00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:58,079
technologies that can actually be

00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,440
sustained by people

00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:01,760
for people and kind of like all their

00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,960
diversity of kind of needs and

00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,520
viewpoints

00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,960
um and the valuable kind of

00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:10,320
contributions they make to like making

00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,320
that technology mean anything

00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:15,280
i don't know if that made sense like i

00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:18,640
kind of went up

00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:20,560
yeah um i know one thing

00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,760
as well that we've kind of talked about

00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:25,040
a little bit offline

00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:27,680
is this idea of algorithmic failures

00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:29,040
so this idea that um you know as

00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:31,040
complicated as

00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:32,240
tech companies might claim their ai

00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,320
systems are

00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:35,280
the reality is that often technology is

00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:38,400
just really bad

00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:40,720
at like understanding and approximating

00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:42,400
knowledge and is actually like a very

00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:44,560
poor replacement as you were saying

00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,520
for for local knowledge and ways of

00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,880
knowing

00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,880
um so i kind of want to put it out to

00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:52,240
each of you you know what is it that

00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:55,680
computers can't sense or can't do and

00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:55,680
what happens when they try to

00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:02,480
sherry i feel like you might have a

00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,480
story

00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:08,960
um a computer can't feel

00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,480
that's what i keep thinking about is

00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:13,839
like we do a lot of

00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:15,680
emotional picture labeling and things

00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:17,280
um does it make you feel happy does it

00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,000
make you feel sad does it make you feel

00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,440
this do you

00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,839
does it make you feel bad and then

00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:25,599
that's where we come into a lot of

00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:28,560
algorithmic failures because

00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:29,119
researchers use or companies use you

00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:31,760
know

00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:34,079
if you fall behind this threshold of how

00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:37,520
much you agree with this picture

00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:41,200
then we reject you

00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:46,400
so that i think about you know

00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:49,920
computers can't tell you how you feel

00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:53,359
um and i think about uh

00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:56,560
a computer can't a i can't you know

00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:59,520
um break down

00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:00,400
words to tweets to tell the you know how

00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:04,079
they

00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:08,000
how they're profiled um

00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:11,760
because we we read tweets

00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,839
and we tell you know if they're racist

00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:16,160
or

00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:19,280
political or i mean we've done all of it

00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:20,000
and computers can't do that i mean we

00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,800
already know

00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,640
computers get that wrong a lot and

00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,320
that's where the humans have to come in

00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:28,000
and that's where we you know we have to

00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:30,320
stay you know

00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,839
we're turkers and we've got to stand up

00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,960
i mean somebody's got to see us

00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:35,280
eventually

00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:37,200
i mean we've been hitting all these

00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:39,920
years but

00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:41,119
i know it's amazon but when's the time

00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:44,560
to say enough's enough

00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:47,040
and we all deserve to be treated equally

00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,040
humans

00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:50,720
um i can also like add to this i think

00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:53,839
in

00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:55,440
from the context of um

00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:57,119
you know cities around the world i think

00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,079
something that i think about often is of

00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:59,760
course there's sort of all these

00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:01,280
algorithmic failures that's cherry

00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,960
i was talking about in blind spots of

00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,520
technology but i also think about blind

00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,720
spots

00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:09,200
of the tech designers so

00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:12,160
in the in the global south sort of a lot

00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:14,640
of these a lot of homegrown startups are

00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:16,319
and you know they get a legitimacy

00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,280
because the founders are from you know

00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:18,960
the countries

00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,560
where the startup is going to be

00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,680
launched and where the platform is going

00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:23,200
to be launched um

00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:25,440
unfortunately a lot of these homecoming

00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,880
startups are trying to replicate this

00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:29,760
ethos of silicon valley

00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:31,520
for people from a very particular class

00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:34,000
and education background and

00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:35,760
gender can envision something in a

00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,440
boardroom and apply it across the world

00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:39,920
without any frictions

00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:41,520
without really even investigating uh

00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,400
whether they're responding to actual

00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,000
pain points

00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,680
or they're responding to just kind of

00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,240
their narrow ideas of what

00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:49,920
um what pain points are and so if you

00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:51,440
look at even the kinds of technology and

00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,040
startups that are being funded in the

00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:56,640
global sales right now a lot of them

00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:59,200
are these kinds of startups to

00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,920
create more convenient on-demand

00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,920
consumption

00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:03,839
um very similar to where i think even

00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:06,640
like silicon valley was a couple of

00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:09,200
years ago and so we're kind of seeing

00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:10,560
the replication of a lot of those

00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:13,040
eyeshare that we're going to see in our

00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:15,839
application of a lot of those

00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:16,400
societal implications um of trying to

00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:19,520
insert

00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:20,000
technology into everything without fear

00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:22,560
without

00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,920
care of uh of consequence and whether

00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,680
the the

00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:27,839
solution that is being presented is even

00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:29,040
appropriate in you know a city like

00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:32,800
jakarta or lahore

00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:35,119
um versus a city like boston

00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:36,720
yeah what you're saying kind of makes

00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:40,240
makes you think about how

00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:41,280
a lot of technology companies that

00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:43,920
pretend

00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:45,599
that their secret sauce is about the ai

00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:47,200
or like their amazing price surge

00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:49,040
algorithm like it's really just about

00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:50,880
automating a middleman

00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:52,319
and then branding the middleman with an

00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:55,200
experience like

00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:55,920
uber you know uber wasn't even the first

00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,839
kind of you know

00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:59,440
i think like uber wasn't even the first

00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:01,200
kind of like app based dispatch i think

00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:03,040
taxi drivers in san francisco actually

00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:04,560
had an app for dispatch but

00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:06,079
i think what people what i remember when

00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:07,440
uber was first starting in san francisco

00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:09,200
was a lot of middle class people saying

00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,640
like oh i feel so awkward about tipping

00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,520
and uber is great because i never have

00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:14,560
to tip

00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:16,079
like um you know or an uber sort of for

00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:18,400
that kind of

00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:19,760
way that it regulates the experience and

00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:22,400
it puts its brand on it and then it

00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:24,960
takes a huge cut out of what drivers do

00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:26,000
um so i think sometimes we need to kind

00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:28,160
of

00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,200
take the emphasis and even artificial

00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:31,440
intelligence

00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:33,200
i really liked also how you said like

00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,720
put in starting this technology in our

00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,440
relationships because i think a lot of

00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:37,119
times

00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:38,560
that's what artificial intelligence is

00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:40,720
actually about it's about

00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:42,160
automating some kind of intermediary

00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:43,599
relationship whether it's your

00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:45,599
relationship with your doctor

00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:46,800
whether it's your relationship with the

00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:49,440
caseworker or

00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:50,480
relationship with the police and those

00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,160
relationships are

00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:54,400
deeply problematic in ways that

00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:56,319
movements have been talking to us about

00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:58,400
and putting the algorithm in there kind

00:42:56,319 --> 00:43:00,480
of makes the it takes

00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:02,480
it takes the agency of like where you

00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,520
would kind of confront and resist maybe

00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,920
as a person

00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:07,520
away from like you and the police

00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:09,680
officer or you and the caseworker and it

00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:11,280
puts it out into a call center

00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:13,200
or out where the algorithm is like in

00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:14,800
some centralized like company where you

00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,839
know they don't have a customer support

00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,760
line like at all

00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:19,440
um virginia eubank strikes a lot about

00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:21,200
that and automating inequality it's like

00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:23,920
moving you know algorithms are just

00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:25,520
moving the mistakes into an ibm call

00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:27,040
center that's much harder for people to

00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,400
fight or like think about like getting

00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:29,599
your insurance claims denied because

00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,280
you've been tagged

00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:32,800
as potentially fraudulent like what you

00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:36,000
have to go through for that

00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:38,400
um so it's not so much about what ai

00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,240
is like in some ways what ai can't do is

00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:42,319
like kind of by design

00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:44,240
like companies like that ai can't get

00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:46,480
all that context they like that

00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:48,720
it won't cave as much if somebody pushes

00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:51,280
back and says no this is wrong

00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:52,079
and that's kind of part of the point and

00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:54,640
that it sort of

00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:56,400
makes invisible those frictions by

00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:58,800
shifting those frictions onto

00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:01,040
on someone else or somewhere else as you

00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,040
said

00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,599
yeah i think the term virginia eubanks

00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:07,520
uses in that book is empathy

00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:09,440
override it's this idea that like it

00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,480
doesn't matter how

00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,920
you know at the end of the day they

00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,880
might not care how accurate the

00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,960
algorithm is

00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:17,680
but if you've sort of offloaded decision

00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:20,160
making and responsibility to a machine

00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:22,480
like then you yourself aren't really

00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:26,079
responsible for it um

00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:28,240
so yeah it's super interesting um

00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:29,520
i i wanted to ask one last question

00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:31,760
before we get into

00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:32,560
a little bit more of a discussion and

00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:34,400
hopefully

00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:36,319
if you know some questions come in from

00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:38,319
twitter um

00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:39,920
you know in the past few years there's

00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:41,440
been a

00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:43,920
lot written about this and people are

00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:45,760
starting to talk about this a lot more

00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:47,040
and there's some really bright spots so

00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:49,680
we've seen movements like

00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:50,240
the tech worker coalition with a lot of

00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,880
big tech

00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:53,520
companies as a tool for organizing um

00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,280
tools like

00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:57,520
park opticon as you've been talking

00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:59,599
about um we've seen sort of these new

00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:01,839
forms for organizing emerging

00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:04,160
so i'd love to hear from each of you uh

00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:05,760
you know what trends or movements or

00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:09,920
things are you seeing today that

00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:09,920
that give you hope for this movement

00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,280
rita would you want to start with that

00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:16,880
um

00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:18,319
yeah sure um i think the increasing

00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:21,839
recognition

00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:25,520
um that there are these diverse forms of

00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:27,359
resistance that exist to the

00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:29,440
technology and platforms and that

00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:30,480
platform or technological outcomes are

00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:33,760
not given

00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:36,000
um you know um that there is uh

00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:38,800
that the kind of apocalyptic world of

00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,720
the of the technology is not necessarily

00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,680
a future that is you know it's a future

00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:43,280
we're constructing it's sort of

00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:44,720
happening it's not sort of already

00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:47,280
pre-ordained

00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:49,200
um and that worker power and mutual aid

00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,680
can be radical and transformative even

00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:52,319
at

00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:54,720
at smaller scales but something that i i

00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:58,240
hope to see a little bit more about

00:45:54,720 --> 00:46:00,560
in this discussion is more of a

00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:01,680
recognition that solutions to mediating

00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:03,839
precarity of

00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:05,920
workers need to be more inclusive as

00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:06,720
sherry said of the worker experiences

00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:10,319
themselves

00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:12,400
um and of diverse regular regulatory

00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:14,560
contexts um particularly you know sort

00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:18,240
of experiences

00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:20,160
in spaces where the labor regime and

00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:22,160
work experiences of work and

00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,960
institutions of repression as i said are

00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:26,400
not the same

00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:26,960
as they are in the u.s so i just i hope

00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:30,000
that we

00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:32,800
are able to kind of think more broadly

00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,480
about some of these solutions and sort

00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:35,680
of shed some of the universalist

00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:38,000
trappings that i think

00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:40,160
a lot of discourse at least in the u.s

00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,599
falls into by virtue of the fact that of

00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,319
course like so much of the technology is

00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:43,760
being

00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:45,520
developed here but you know as sherry

00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:48,640
said turkers are exist

00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:50,960
all over the world so any solution um

00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:51,839
or any organizing or any advice that's

00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,839
given to them

00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:56,240
um or their forms of resistance that are

00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:59,440
recognized need to recognize their

00:46:56,240 --> 00:47:00,079
individual contexts from you know from

00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:02,880
all over

00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:02,880
all over the globe

00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:10,160
can i add to that when you talk about

00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:12,880
that

00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:14,720
that just brings me back to where i

00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:18,160
first started with all of

00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:20,160
the organizing with turkopticon um

00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:21,520
we have international workers on our

00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:26,079
committees

00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:29,119
that are doing this work with us um

00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:31,119
i don't want nobody to feel like

00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:33,440
you know because it is all of us all

00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:35,760
over the world it's not just u.s workers

00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:38,960
and i know that gets a lot of

00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:42,800
but yeah there's a lot of issues

00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:45,359
that that i was like

00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:46,559
okay it's got to be all of us it can't

00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:49,440
just be

00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:51,119
because they're getting you know the

00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:54,319
same treatment we are

00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:57,760
you can't stand up by yourself

00:47:54,319 --> 00:48:01,119
you have to stand up in solidarity

00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:02,400
um so yeah

00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:04,240
when you're talking about that i was

00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:06,400
like yeah we you got to have the

00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:09,920
international you've got to think of it

00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:12,640
broad picture not just here at home

00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:14,240
it's got to be especially when we're all

00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:15,440
working on the same platform together

00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:17,200
even though we're not in the office

00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:18,880
together

00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:20,480
and we're not you know we don't see each

00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:22,800
other every day because

00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:24,640
i there's hundreds of thousands of

00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:26,559
co-workers that i've still not got

00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:27,920
you know and i'd love for them to reach

00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:30,480
out like

00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:31,760
seriously anybody that wants to reach

00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:34,800
out i'm open

00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:35,760
my emails open we'll get on the phone

00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:38,400
whatever

00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:38,960
because i do not want i want all turkers

00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:42,480
to be

00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:42,480
represented for sure

00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:47,599
yeah i guess one um one point of

00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:49,760
inspiration for me and

00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:51,119
you you mentioned a like there i have

00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,160
many points of inspiration like

00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:54,079
turkopticon

00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:56,000
and like sherry's work and crystal and

00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:58,160
alex and phil all these folks

00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,319
like they inspire me like tech worker

00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:02,240
coalition inspires me um but the example

00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:04,800
i wanted to give was um

00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:05,440
the farmer's protest in india where

00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:08,640
you've got

00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:10,640
like half a million people who for over

00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:12,800
i think a month or a couple of months

00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:14,000
now have been protesting at the around

00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,760
the perimeter of delhi

00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,200
protesting government policies that

00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:20,319
would subject

00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:21,839
workers to basically a lot of market

00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:23,599
volatility in the price that they would

00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:25,440
get for their crops

00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:27,520
and then an agricultural economy where

00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:30,319
they already are kind of dealing with

00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:32,000
being burdened by loans for you know

00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:32,559
fertilizers and seeds and things like

00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,480
that

00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:36,240
um and the reason why it's inspiring to

00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:38,960
me is because

00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:40,720
i mean like one i think there's like 300

00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:42,240
different farmers organizations that

00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:44,640
have come together

00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:45,440
to like that have these daily meetings

00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:47,119
to

00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:48,800
figure out how they're gonna you know

00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:50,000
they speak different languages or from

00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,359
different regions

00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,720
um and then they're coming together and

00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:54,000
figuring out like how they're gonna

00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:55,200
adapt their tactics to what the

00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,960
government is doing

00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:59,359
another reason why it inspires me is i

00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:01,200
actually have a friend in india who is

00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:03,520
organizes with the communist party there

00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:04,400
um which is a major party that wins

00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:07,040
elections in

00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:08,880
places like west bengal and um kerala

00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:10,960
and the communist party is also

00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:12,319
you know involved in the organizing but

00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:14,079
they're not the cause like

00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:15,680
it's a it's such a huge movement that

00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:17,839
like it shows that

00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:19,200
lots of different kinds of people with

00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:21,200
different kinds of say political

00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:24,240
ideologies can come together

00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:25,760
with force to kind of analyze a

00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:27,760
situation and target something that they

00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:31,359
want to respond to and change

00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:32,079
um and then the last and the last thing

00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:34,960
that um

00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:35,760
kind of my friend had uh viktor krishna

00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:37,200
my friend

00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:39,040
the last thing my friend had kind of

00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,680
shared with me was that you know like a

00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:41,359
lot of the

00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:43,040
marxists and that communist party when

00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:44,720
they would do their analysis of who is

00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,440
going to be in solidarity with who they

00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:48,800
had seen

00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:51,599
um small land holder farmers

00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:53,520
as kind of the class enemy to the

00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:55,599
workers who are working on

00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:57,599
the farms actually doing the picking but

00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:59,200
in this movement those small landowners

00:50:57,599 --> 00:50:59,599
and the day laborers and people from

00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,440
like

00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:03,040
the cast like have actually come

00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:06,079
together so

00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:06,480
like as so like zooming out to tech like

00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:08,640
i

00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:10,160
wrote a paper you know six years ago

00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:12,240
called difference independence among

00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:13,839
the digital workers and i was like look

00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:15,680
you have tech workers who are

00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:17,040
programmers and they're making ai and

00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:18,960
they actually benefit from the

00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:20,000
exploitation of amazon mechanical turk

00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:21,839
workers so

00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,520
we shouldn't assume that you know

00:51:21,839 --> 00:51:25,599
knowledge workers will in some way like

00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:27,440
be in solidarity or flexible knowledge

00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:29,920
workers will be in solidarity but

00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:31,599
i think that diff but that that was

00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:33,119
wrong but not because you can't assume

00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:33,760
that they will be in solidarity but

00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:35,359
because

00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:36,800
around certain issues and with certain

00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:38,400
kinds of organizing

00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:40,079
and with certain kinds of reframing to

00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:42,240
change how we understand like

00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:43,839
our common conditions they can be

00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:45,280
brought into solidarity and that's why

00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:46,079
you know you have tech workers for tech

00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:48,880
workers

00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:49,760
helping fundraise for copticon because

00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:51,520
you know like

00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:52,960
jacob von d he an organizer from san

00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:55,200
diego said you know

00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:57,440
like mit is trying to automate the work

00:51:55,200 --> 00:52:00,160
that i do as a coder also

00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:01,599
and so you know this automation that's

00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:03,440
gonna try to like

00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:04,800
divide our jobs into tiny little chunks

00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:06,240
that are convenient for the automator

00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:07,359
like that's a process that's coming for

00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:10,480
all of us

00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:11,440
so that gives me a lot of hope too can i

00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:13,359
just quickly say

00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:14,960
um just jumping off what lily said about

00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:15,920
you know this kind of process coming for

00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:17,839
all of us i think

00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:19,839
this is also why it's so important to

00:52:17,839 --> 00:52:21,280
look at the experiences of

00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:23,119
and have a deeper engagement with

00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:24,480
conditions in the global south

00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:26,480
not just because the global title sort

00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:27,920
of like this world that's out there but

00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:29,839
a lot of the

00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:32,400
employment relationships that are now

00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:33,280
that have been experimented with in the

00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,960
global south

00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:37,359
uh are now being pushed into the

00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:39,359
mainstream in the developed world and i

00:52:37,359 --> 00:52:42,400
think there is a lot to be learned

00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:43,520
because of that um of from solidarity

00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:45,599
practices

00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:46,640
and resistance networks in a context of

00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:49,119
fishering and from

00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:50,480
informal informality and

00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:53,280
characterization

00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:54,880
um so as lily said you know sort of the

00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:56,000
we always think about a lot of these

00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:59,920
experiences as as

00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,880
separate but these these changes are

00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:03,359
experimented

00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:03,920
on it with one population and then it's

00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:06,160
sort of

00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:08,000
uh exported to other populations so i

00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:12,079
think that's why these kinds of

00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:14,960
cross geographical and cross class

00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:15,359
and cross industry solidarity experience

00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:18,559
um

00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:18,559
networks are so important

00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:23,920
yeah what can you talk about okay sorry

00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:26,559
oh go for it

00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:27,280
i was just gonna say when retta talks

00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:29,599
about

00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:31,599
that and then i think about you know

00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:35,119
we're going up against the mammoth

00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:39,040
amazon so when you say

00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:41,280
amazon it's like everybody's like

00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:42,160
so that's where the solidarity has to

00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:45,520
come from

00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:48,160
for us is because you know we are

00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:49,680
scared that's what took me so long to be

00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:51,839
able to speak up

00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:53,040
about the conditions was because the

00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:56,319
fear is real

00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:57,839
like 100 um because

00:53:56,319 --> 00:53:59,760
amazon can ask you and they don't have

00:53:57,839 --> 00:54:03,599
to get tell you any reason

00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:06,960
like they it's all privacy policy

00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:09,040
blah blah blah i thought yeah my

00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:10,240
teenage kids give me better answers

00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:13,280
sorry um

00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:14,400
yeah it's they they don't answer very

00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:16,160
very little

00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:18,079
the least minimal that they have to

00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:20,640
answer is what they answer

00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:21,839
and i just wanted to be sure to you know

00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:25,040
put that out there that

00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:26,720
yeah it's it's got when you think about

00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:30,160
it it's

00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:33,040
it's got to be a whole nice you know

00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:34,079
we got to get in solidarity to go up

00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:36,079
against companies

00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:37,280
that big when you think about you know

00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:39,680
basis what's he made

00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:40,799
what is it four million a second or

00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:42,960
something like that they

00:54:40,799 --> 00:54:44,160
was advertising i heard i know it's

00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:45,839
probably not the correct

00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:47,359
and please don't quote me on that or

00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:50,079
anything but yeah

00:54:47,359 --> 00:54:51,040
i know he makes millions and millions

00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:54,559
yeah

00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:56,240
millions and turkeys

00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:58,000
we don't see we don't see nothing of

00:54:56,240 --> 00:55:01,680
that i promise so

00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:03,280
okay sorry a little fire we do have

00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:04,799
so we do actually have a question that

00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:05,280
came in from twitter that i'm going to

00:55:04,799 --> 00:55:07,920
ask

00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:08,640
um so it's a question specifically

00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:11,119
around

00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:12,799
the global pandemic um and they were

00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:15,040
talking about how

00:55:12,799 --> 00:55:17,520
um a lot of people now are relying on

00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:19,920
sort of ai powered services like maybe

00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:20,559
door dash or delivery and so they frame

00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:22,640
it as

00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:23,920
um with the pandemic some of these

00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:25,839
platforms that use ai

00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:27,200
have been very useful for us so what is

00:55:25,839 --> 00:55:31,839
the balance between

00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:31,839
protecting workers and also customers

00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:35,760
i i'll just jump in i see sherry you're

00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:37,839
like

00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:39,280
okay i'm gonna say one thing like um i

00:55:37,839 --> 00:55:39,920
don't think those are ai powered

00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:41,680
services

00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:43,119
you know like when i lived in delhi like

00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:45,280
i could walk out to the corner and

00:55:43,119 --> 00:55:47,599
there'd be a taxi stand and then i could

00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:48,960
find a taxi thing like this is just a

00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:51,119
website that like

00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:52,880
substitutes for the taxi stand these are

00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:54,799
human powered services i think that's

00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:58,559
the thing that we learned with kovid

00:55:54,799 --> 00:55:59,920
that you know some people are

00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:01,520
i don't know like i was reading

00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:02,480
something the other day there oh there's

00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:05,520
just an amazing

00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:06,720
um article um it was about somebody who

00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:08,160
was working in a grocery store during

00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:09,520
the pandemic and they were just talking

00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:11,359
about the ways that like we have chosen

00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:11,920
to organize our society in the us is

00:56:11,359 --> 00:56:14,559
like

00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:16,000
the people who have to do the essential

00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:19,520
work for a living

00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:21,839
get to take on all the disease risks

00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:23,200
um they're you know like we can imagine

00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:25,359
organizing a society where

00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:27,040
we cooperate in shifts to do essential

00:56:25,359 --> 00:56:28,400
deliveries like i'm in a mutual aid

00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:30,000
network in san diego

00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:31,520
and for people who can't go out because

00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,160
they're immunocompromised or they don't

00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:35,040
have a car

00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:36,400
they need food whatever like we organize

00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:37,760
it in shifts like it's not the person

00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:39,440
who needs the money the most

00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:40,720
that goes out to deliver the groceries

00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:41,760
it's like everyone has a shared

00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:43,839
obligation

00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:45,119
so i think it's not about balancing the

00:56:43,839 --> 00:56:46,640
needs between the worker and the

00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:48,160
customer it's about everybody taking

00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:50,160
more shared responsibility and more

00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:52,799
shared vulnerability for the

00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:54,240
care that we know we have to have as a

00:56:52,799 --> 00:56:59,200
society in order to survive

00:56:54,240 --> 00:57:02,079
sorry that was a little ranty but sherry

00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:03,440
and then you're going right into me miss

00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:06,160
wordy over here

00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:06,799
uh yeah when i think about that i'm like

00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:10,240
okay

00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:13,440
um if you're having to use us

00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:14,960
for your ai is it really like lily was

00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:18,319
saying like

00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:20,880
okay i understand you know

00:57:18,319 --> 00:57:22,640
we're the ones powering your ai that's

00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:25,920
but when you think about how to protect

00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:26,640
us it's all about that you got to make

00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:29,599
sure

00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:31,040
that you pay and you pay fairly and you

00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:33,200
treat the workers with respect

00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:35,520
treat us as humans don't think of us

00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:37,920
like as you plug in some numbers in

00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:38,400
amazon and they're spitting some back at

00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:39,920
you

00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:41,599
because there's some humans are running

00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:44,240
around in there that's

00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:44,720
you know spitting that back to you it's

00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:47,200
not

00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:48,880
just some computer spinning it back to

00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:51,599
you i promise it's

00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:52,160
not you might think it is but it's not

00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:55,760
and

00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:58,240
uh when like that

00:57:55,760 --> 00:58:00,640
rita and lily has been talking about

00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:03,440
it's about that mutual aid

00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:04,559
if you're going to you know support

00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:07,359
turkers and

00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:09,200
you're making a profit off of us then

00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:12,640
you know give back to it

00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:14,960
yeah donate do do your part

00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:15,760
don't don't sit and talk about it if

00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:18,640
you're not going to

00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:19,839

organized

00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:40,319

because it's very

00:59:09,839 --> 00:59:13,200

workers are organizing for better

00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:27,680
conditions like for example with cova

00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:29,760
