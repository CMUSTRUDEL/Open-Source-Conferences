Title: Making Sustainability Mainstream
Publication date: 2021-03-11
Playlist: Mozilla Festival 2021
Description: 
	The workshop will ask how, at a time when we need to address climate change and the ecological crises urgently, we can work together as a community to make sustainability a core value of our industry globally. Facilitated by Tom Greenwood (UK) and Gauthier Roussilhe (France), we will ask people to share experiences of how sustainability is currently considered in the digital sector in their country, what has been successful in pushing it on the top of the agenda and what the key barriers have been. Together as a group, we will compare experiences from around the world and form a shared understanding of how to move forward, with a set of practical solutions to suggest to the wider web community. The highlights of the discussion and suggested solutions will then be published following the event for others to learn from and build on.
