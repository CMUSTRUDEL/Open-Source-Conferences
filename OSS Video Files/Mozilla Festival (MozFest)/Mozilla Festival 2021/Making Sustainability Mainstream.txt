Title: Making Sustainability Mainstream
Publication date: 2021-03-11
Playlist: Mozilla Festival 2021
Description: 
	The workshop will ask how, at a time when we need to address climate change and the ecological crises urgently, we can work together as a community to make sustainability a core value of our industry globally. Facilitated by Tom Greenwood (UK) and Gauthier Roussilhe (France), we will ask people to share experiences of how sustainability is currently considered in the digital sector in their country, what has been successful in pushing it on the top of the agenda and what the key barriers have been. Together as a group, we will compare experiences from around the world and form a shared understanding of how to move forward, with a set of practical solutions to suggest to the wider web community. The highlights of the discussion and suggested solutions will then be published following the event for others to learn from and build on.

00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:10,160
great well uh welcome everybody to this

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,040
session on making sustainability

00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,519
mainstream

00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,240
and um i'm just gonna share my screen

00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,760

flight deck uh and um and we will get

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,240
cracking

00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:28,160

and what it is that you do why you're

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,680
interested in this session

00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,600
help us all get to know each other a

00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,120
little bit and then we'll have 15

00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,280
minutes talking about go to

00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,640
i will talk about the problem that we're

00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,680
facing and why we've created this

00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,440
session

00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,039
and then i'll introduce some questions

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,879
and then we'll move into breakout rooms

00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,640
where we'll have about 20 minutes in

00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,239
breakout rooms to discuss

00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,480
the topic of making sustainability

00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:00,239
mainstream and then we'll come back

00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,399
share a summary of what we discussed in

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,879
our breakout rooms and

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,000
um and and next steps on how we can take

00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,000
this forward to actually

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,520
make sustainability mainstream in the

00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,799
industry

00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:15,280
so quick introductions um introduction

00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:17,840
from myself so i'm tom greenwood i

00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,600
run a digital agency in the uk called

00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,240
whole grain digital which

00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,159
is a design and development agency that

00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,880
focuses on wordpress and has a kind of

00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,200
strong

00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,799
ethos in terms of sustainability both in

00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:32,240
terms of our

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:35,600
business operations but also in terms of

00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:37,280
promoting uh greening of the digital

00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,880
sector and we've been involved in a

00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,880
number of projects

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,240
um we created a website carbon

00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,280
calculator

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:48,000
um a website carbon.com we were involved

00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,799
in writing the sustainable web manifesto

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,960
and we recently worked with another

00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,799
agency called mighty bytes to

00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,680
create the new version of sustainable

00:01:54,799 --> 00:02:01,280
web design.org which is a resource for

00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,799
um sustainability sort of actions that

00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,040
you can take in web projects

00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,960
and most recently i wrote a book for a

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,119
book apart called sustainable

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,399
web design and it goes here would you

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,200
like to introduce yourself

00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:15,760
yeah sure hello everyone so i'm good

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,200
here i'm from france

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,800
i've been working on the field of

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,520
digital sustainability for

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,400
two to three years with two different

00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,840
perspectives

00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:28,800
the first one is that i'm being uh i'm a

00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,080
digital designer so i've been working in

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,519
design for a while now

00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:37,040
and i was starting to do research from

00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,760
through a phd on how the individual

00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,000
crisis

00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,599
is modifying the way we are designing

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,840
digital systems

00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:45,200
so it includes infrastructures and

00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,239
services

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,120
and uh right now i'm working a lot in

00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,560
france

00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,400
around digital accessibility which is a

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,519
big topic now in france

00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:59,040
and um i'm working i'm coach

00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:02,159
coaching coaching uh digital teams

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,000
to include sustainability in the project

00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:06,159
and how do we actually

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,040
through a project especially a state

00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:10,319
statewide

00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:12,080
project um we can implement suggested

00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:15,680
abilities so i'm doing that from

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:18,159
for national services

00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,480
especially for the national agency for

00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:23,760
ecological transition in france

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:27,120
and also for other

00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:30,319
public institutions so far

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,519
great thank you to you so what are we

00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:36,959
here to discuss

00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:39,040
um sustainability is a topic that has

00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,080
obviously been an important topic for

00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,000
society for

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,280
many many decades and it's increasingly

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,879
been gaining

00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,799
uh you know some

00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,799
some real attention in terms of the need

00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:53,040
to move towards

00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,319
um solutions to the climate crisis and

00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,239
the ecological crisis

00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,760
in all sorts of industries but the

00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,480
digital sector has been

00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,760
rather quiet on sustainability and its

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,840
impact in general

00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,280
um primarily talking about its positive

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,200
impact but very rarely talking about

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,280
what its actual kind of potential

00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,040
negative impacts on the environment are

00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,560
and so we want to make it more of a

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,360
mainstream part of the conversation in

00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,160
the digital sector so today we're hoping

00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,680
that

00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,959
as a group we'll have a variety of

00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,400
different perspectives from different

00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,959
backgrounds different places in the

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,320
world

00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:27,759
where we can actually share ideas of

00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:29,280
what has worked to actually make um

00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,680
sustainability more of a mainstream

00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,440
topic

00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,040
in different in different areas within

00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,440
our industry that we can learn from each

00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,759
other

00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,199
and also perhaps things that have worked

00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,360
to get other topics like

00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,800
um like accessibility and privacy for

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,400
example make them

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,320
more mainstream and could we take some

00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,600
of those approaches and those ideas

00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,600
and apply them to the topic of

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,080
sustainability to help make it part of

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,000
the

00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,520
mainstream conversation within our

00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,840
industry

00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,240
so that's the that's the main topic for

00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,320
today

00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,840
the problem many of you may be familiar

00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,440
with this if you're in this session but

00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,800
you may not be so i will give a quick

00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,919
introduction

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:08,320
so if we just look at

00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:10,960
um if we just look at carbon emissions

00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:13,120
the internet although it appears to be

00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,039
clean we don't see exhaust emissions

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,759
coming out of our computers or our

00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,440
phones

00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,600
um the internet if you take it as a

00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,400
global machine actually has

00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,080
very large emissions similar in in

00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,759
volume to germany which is the seventh

00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,560
largest polluter in the world

00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,320
and and now actually overtaking aviation

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,400
as a as a global industry

00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,919
and we obviously most of us would think

00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,800
of aviation it's quite a polluting

00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:37,840
industry

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,800
um but actually injustice under carbon

00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,280
emissions

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,960
the digital sector is actually has

00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:46,000
probably already overtaken it

00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,440
so this is a really serious thing and

00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,680
we need to take it seriously as an

00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,639
industry and not kind of brush it under

00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,919
the carpet

00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,840
saying that well digital is like

00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:55,759
fundamentally good

00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,120
and doesn't have any side effects we

00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,319
need to actually make sure that we

00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,319
embrace the good

00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,479
but actually also try to address the

00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,840
potential downsides of digital on the

00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:08,479
environment

00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:09,440
so the the carbon emissions are coming

00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,080
from two places

00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:14,400
um that sorry not from two places from

00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,080
the manufacturing and the operations

00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,840
of the whole system and that's data

00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,520
centers it's also transmission networks

00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,360
and it's also end-user devices

00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,680
and everything that goes in between but

00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,960
it's manufacturing and operations energy

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,240
of all of those things

00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,520
and it adds up to a lot but one of the

00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,280
reasons that goatee and i got talking

00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,160
about this is that sort of where i am in

00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,080
the uk

00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,240
with sort of we seem to focus almost

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,080
primarily on carbon emissions as like

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,080
the impact the environmental impact of

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,520
digital um

00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,720
and actually there's more to it than

00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,400
just in carbon emissions so gautier

00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,560
um do you want to sort of introduce some

00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:52,000
of the broader impacts

00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:54,400
yeah so in france we kind of

00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,680
we're gonna have a different strategy to

00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,880
approach uh

00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:02,080
sustainability in the digital sector uh

00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,840
we tend not to look only at energy

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,599
and then the resulting greenhouse

00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,400
greenhouse gas emissions

00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:10,240
we also try to look at the depletion of

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:13,440
resources

00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:15,039
like mineral resources and also the

00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,120
consumption of water so what is the

00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:19,039
water footprints of

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,039
of digital sector which is quite

00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:23,199
important for us

00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:24,240
because you can have a lot of pollution

00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,880
transfer or

00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,840
impact transfer from energy to water for

00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,319
example

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,280
and you can use less energy for example

00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,840
for cooling down

00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,599
uh data centers because you don't you

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,720
will not use ac anymore but then

00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:40,000
you start using water to uh to cool it

00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,440
down so

00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,599
there are shifts that you need to

00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,879
observe and at the same time more

00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:48,240
efficient

00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:50,720
equipment during the use phase can be

00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,400
much more impactful in manufacturing to

00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,360
get this efficiency

00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,840
so in france we we tend to use what we

00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,879
call a

00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,400
life cycle assessment perspective

00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,400
so in the digital sector it means that

00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,280
we are looking like tom was saying at

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,639
manufacturing

00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:09,360
and user operations uh

00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,000
on the three on the three parts of the

00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,400
digital

00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,440
digital sector so and use equipment or

00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,520
end user devices

00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,720
networks and data center and then we

00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,960
look at four

00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:24,560
different uh criteria so energy gig

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:27,039
resources water and as you can see

00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,639
um from the from kind of the point of

00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:32,159
view that we have in france

00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:35,519
um we we are focusing mainly on

00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:38,560
end user devices not because they are

00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:40,719
more impactful

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,320
just for per unit but just because there

00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,800
is a lot of them

00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,160
so we estimate that the the number that

00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,720
we normally use in friends

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:51,440
is uh to to say that right now there is

00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:54,320
uh 34 billion

00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,200
uh equipment digital equipment in the

00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,800
world

00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:01,839
and most of them are end user devices

00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:04,320
and these include iot so

00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,120
it's because there is so much equipment

00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,080
that there

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,800
that most of the footprints uh is

00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,839
located in

00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,279
user devices and then we also have to be

00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:16,720
very careful that the manufacture

00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:16,720
manufacturing manufacturing

00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:22,640
phase is really impactful

00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,240
especially on user devices so you can

00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:27,839
you cannot really see it but

00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,519
like for a smartphone um 80 to 90

00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,000
percent of the energy

00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,360
will be used for manufacturing so 10

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,680
percent left

00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,480
will just be operational using

00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,680
electricity

00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,440
to recharge your phone but yet if you

00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,120
look at networks and data centers

00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,800
the use phase will be much more energy

00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,040
intensive so

00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:49,440
it is very important in from the french

00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:52,480
perspective to have a more global

00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,200
view of all the different impacts but

00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,680
it's also

00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,440
deeply linked to the french net to the

00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,839
french landscape so

00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,040
we tend to have an energy that is less

00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,839
carbonated

00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,959
because of nuclear power that we want it

00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,880
or not

00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:08,240
so we cannot only we cannot only focus

00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,480
on jhg emission

00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,320
that's why we're including all of that

00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,480
and also to be more careful

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,519
to the fact that resources are being

00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,760
depleted

00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,640
and most most of the time they are being

00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,959
depleted

00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,680
in countries that very far away from

00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:24,399
where they

00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,040
the end user devices are being used and

00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,959
also it's

00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,240
more global perspective of what this

00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,640
digital sector and

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:33,680
is impact worldwide outside of what we

00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:37,680
can see

00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:41,839
right should i get the next slide yeah

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:44,000
and um i wanted also to emphasize that

00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,200
when we think of digital sector just one

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,839
sector

00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,320
between many others but all of them need

00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,800
to be

00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,560
need to transform themselves if we are

00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,760
looking at the paris agreement

00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,839
we need to change every sector

00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,360
and the digital sector might be around

00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:02,480
three to four percent of

00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,920
global emissions it's not a lot

00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,240
it's definitely not a lot if you compare

00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:10,160
to agriculture transport

00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:13,040
industry or energy transformation yet

00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,480
we have to divide its footprint by four

00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,160
if we want to stabilize

00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,079
at the end of the century at plus two

00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:21,120
degrees and

00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:23,839
there is some intermediary targets and

00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,800
one of them the one i'm kind of focusing

00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,279
on my work

00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,519
right now is to try to understand what

00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:32,800
does digital sector look like

00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:35,760
when we only have 1.7 tons

00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,160
equivalency or two per year per person

00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,480
which

00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,920
is what we should aim for according to

00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,040
the police agreement

00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:45,279
and at the moment the digital sector

00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,959
does not fit into these targets like all

00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,839
the other sectors

00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:50,800
so we need to understand how does it

00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,880
what will what

00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,320
it will look like if we try to enter

00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:57,440
that by 20

00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,920
by 2050 and that's not a relative value

00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,519
it's an

00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,279
absolute value and so we cannot reach it

00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,440
on it so

00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:05,200
we that's something it's really

00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,200
important to keep in mind that

00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,959
we have these targets and we need to do

00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,880
our best to reach it

00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:14,000
not just to postpone it or to say it

00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,000
would get better by itself

00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,519
yeah thank you and i think it's really

00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,560
important just to sort of on that

00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,920
emphasize the fact that digital is one

00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,760
of the fastest growing

00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,200
sources of energy consumption and

00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,760
emissions and

00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,440
resource consumption so although

00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,399
although there are efficiency gains

00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,320
happening

00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,160
all the time in terms of the efficiency

00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,120
by the operational efficiency of

00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,320
networks and

00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,839
of um of computing power

00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,920
the actual energy and emissions of the

00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:44,320
industry as a whole are

00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,279
are accelerating fast and so that means

00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,360
that

00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:48,480
in the context of us needing to

00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,880
radically reduce

00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,240
the emissions per person globally of

00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,279
everything that we do

00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,800
um we can't let digital be the thing

00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:59,680
that kind of gets in the way of that

00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:01,279
by by constantly increasing over the

00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:04,399
next couple of decades

00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:06,320
and the fact is that in all estimates

00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,680
that have been provided today by the

00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:11,680
research community

00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:14,720
all of them uh um

00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:16,880
all of them uh are estimating that

00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,639
the energy consumption of sodium sector

00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,560
will rise anyway

00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:22,079
so right now the future sector is set on

00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,560
a set on a path

00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:25,920
of increasing an energy consumption when

00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,720
we should actually

00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:30,720
radically decrease it because just using

00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,000
more renewables will not do it

00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,920
we also need to reduce energy

00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,680
consumption and that's not the path that

00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:38,800
digital sector is

00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:41,519
is following right now yeah

00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,079
exactly so that's what we're here to

00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,959
discuss

00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,839
as a group um we've got some questions

00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:49,440
that we've laid out

00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:50,880
and we've got a a myro board so

00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,959
sorry about all the text on this slide

00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:55,920
but it'll be um

00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:58,320
much simpler in the my report and but

00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,440
just to quickly run you through

00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,040
these are the questions that we thought

00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,880
would be interesting to discuss in our

00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,360
breakout rooms so

00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:07,040
number one where you talk about digital

00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:10,240
environmental impact in education

00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:12,160
and and do you think that making the

00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,160
environmental conversation of digital

00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,839
part of the education system could be

00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,959
beneficial to

00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:21,120
solving this sustainability problem

00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:22,000
is question number two is digital

00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,440
sustainability

00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,920
part of the conversation in the place

00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:28,480
where you work and if so

00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,920
what actions do you think helped make

00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,199
that part of the conversation that

00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,519
others might be able to take to their

00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:35,519
workplaces

00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,199
question number three is what do you

00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,760
expect from the public and private

00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,480
sectors

00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:42,079
on this issue and and which do you think

00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,000
is a better stepping stone so do you

00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:45,760
think that this is a thing that the

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,040
public sector should be leading on in

00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,639
terms of like government

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,560
action or do you think that this is

00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,240
something that should be led uh by the

00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,920
private sector or perhaps both

00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,720
that's a really interesting discussion

00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,399
point question number four

00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,160
how to have issues like privacy and

00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,880
accessibility become more mainstream in

00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,360
the digital

00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,399
sector um you know some key ethical

00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:08,079
issues

00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,639
that perhaps originally were kind of on

00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:11,600
the fringe

00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:14,000
and very much considered you know

00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:16,399
secondary to commercial concerns

00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,680
and gradually have become more and more

00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:19,279
part of the conversation

00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,120
how have they achieved that and could we

00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:23,839
learn from them

00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,720
question number five which actors do you

00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,040
think would be

00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,880
the best entry point to promote digital

00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,839
sustainability so which types of people

00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,360
within the industry

00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:34,079
do you think are best positioned to

00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,240
actually promote this message

00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:37,839
and perhaps your personal experiences of

00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,880
that

00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:43,040
and then question number six

00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,399
do you have new ideas maybe it's not

00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,600
just things that you've seen and have

00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,160
been tried before but maybe you've got

00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:50,320
new ideas on how

00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,199
we could take action as a community or

00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,199
as individuals

00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:56,160
to make sustainability more of a

00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:58,480
priority within the digital sector

00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,720
so with that in mind what i'm going to

00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,839
do is i'm going to exit my

00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:06,880
slide deck and

00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:08,320
we will share a link to a myro board in

00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,920
the chat

00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,839
and my report if you haven't used it

00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,880
before myro is like an online

00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,040
whiteboarding

00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,720
um software so you'll be able to click

00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,079
the link in the chat

00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,440
and go through to that and there'll be

00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:21,120
two groups and what i'll do is i'll

00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,440
create two breakout groups

00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,560
and there's a on the myra board there's

00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:28,320
group one and group two

00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,320
the same questions and

00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,839
goatee and i will each facilitate a

00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,639
group and we'll have a discussion

00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,279
together

00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:37,040
and there's sticky notes at the top of

00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:38,240
those boards where you can grab a sticky

00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,440
note you don't have to ask anyone's

00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,959
permission you can just grab a sticky

00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,720
note and write your ideas and put them

00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:46,560
in the relevant place but also

00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:48,000
contribute to the verbal conversation so

00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,000
hopefully that will become clear once

00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,680
we're in the mirror board but cozy and i

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
will be there in the

00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,959
uh breakout rooms to explain how it will

00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,079
work

00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:58,079
so um

00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,040
good here are you able to share the

00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:06,959
mirror link yeah

00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,959
okay um i mean i think i can

00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,120
okay all right hopefully you should all

00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,439
have that

00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,880
um and what we'll do is i will generate

00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:19,839
the breakout rooms now

00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,839
and we will see you in there

00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:33,840
okay so i'm going room two

00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:48,640
okay i think we're good can you

00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,000
can you hear me is this right yeah okay

00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,520
perfect

00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:56,960
okay so we are taking the group two

00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:59,280
part of the board and i guess i mean

00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,640
i think we can open likes if we want and

00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:03,280
so we can also

00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,280
we can chat

00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,600
and uh at the same time we can discuss

00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,679
about

00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:14,240
each part of the each each section so

00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:16,240
on the first on the first question um it

00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:19,760
would be also interesting to um

00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:21,520
just to to say from what kind of

00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,039
education background you come from if

00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:26,160
you are from a

00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:29,840
designer developer engineer

00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:32,160
political sciences i don't know uh

00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:35,120
just to to know from where you are

00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:38,240
speaking of regarding the education

00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,240
uh question

00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,200
yeah i'm happy to go first um definitely

00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:47,360
didn't

00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:50,720
learn about environmental impacts on

00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:52,240
um for digital industry or even

00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,919
business economics so i studied business

00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:57,280
economics and engineering

00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:58,559
uh mechanical engineering um

00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:01,039
and none of this was a part of the

00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:05,919
curriculum this was also

00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:08,480
just for context 2005 2000 okay

00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:10,880
yeah sustainability wasn't mainstream

00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,039
but not even you know

00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,400
all the other sectors it was well

00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:17,360
sustainability was a

00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,720
so like a cradle to cradle was the book

00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,240
right but like that's

00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:23,360
specifically talking about physical

00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,799
products as opposed to anything

00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,480
related to physical products like the

00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:28,640
commercialization of physical products

00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:31,679
the organizations that launch it

00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,320
um yeah now the websites you've got sell

00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:34,240
it

00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,440
that wasn't part of the conversation

00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,440
okay and

00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,960
now you are you are working in the

00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:42,000
digital sector right

00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:44,080
correct okay and

00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,919
so but we'll we'll talk about it in

00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:49,679
other questions but uh

00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:53,360
feel free to to use uh the sticky notes

00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:57,200
to to enter your uh to enter your

00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,200
uh your answer

00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,360
is there someone someone else would like

00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:01,360
to tweak

00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:08,080
to chat yeah i can oh

00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:11,120
sorry n needs shell you go first

00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:14,559
are you sure okay uh

00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:17,440
so uh national here uh i work in a city

00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:20,880
uh local government in california i am a

00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:24,000
data analytics manager here a couple of

00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:26,880
super high level thoughts uh i think

00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,120
while it is important that the impact of

00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,679
each industry and each sector assessed

00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:34,880
and evaluated and constantly monitored

00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:38,320
i do think that there is a there is a

00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,200
need to ensure that we don't fall into

00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,559
the trap

00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:44,880
of uh accountability that

00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:46,000
is typically passed down from the

00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,559
industry

00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,360
on to the end consumers uh and

00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:53,440
especially uh in terms of the sector so

00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:55,120
going back to the original these slides

00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,039
where we were talking about the impact

00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:59,280
of the digital sector being

00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:00,240
uh equivalent to that of aviation

00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,679
industry

00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:05,919
uh it is also important to realize that

00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,840
i think the best estimates are that

00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,880
about five percent of the world

00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:12,159
population has

00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:15,520
ever flown in an airplane and

00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:17,840
the internet is touched upon by at least

00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,280
60 to 70 percent of the world's

00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,600
population so

00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:23,520
uh there is an absolute uh you know

00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:26,559
impact in terms of emission

00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:30,240
but it's also like what what gains

00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:33,039
are made in per unit uh per capita

00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,720
or per unit interaction or transaction

00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:37,760
how much is the impact

00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,799
so i think we have to be thoughtful

00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:42,159
about

00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:44,720
how much we beat upon ourselves for

00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,520
being in a digital ecosystem and kind of

00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,200
considering us

00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:51,760
equivalent of other industry when the uh

00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,120
if you look at the the the benefits of

00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,840
the services

00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:57,600
and you know per unit interaction sort

00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,080
of cost we might be operating in a very

00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,159
very

00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:02,480
different level plane so just wanted to

00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:06,080
highlight that particular point

00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:08,720
okay thank you uh

00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:10,960
so maybe you can get i mean we touch up

00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:14,000
we touch on this question a bit later

00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:17,520
so maybe it will be also interesting to

00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:21,039
um to go to go just to finish with the

00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:23,360
education part so just feel free to grab

00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:24,960
stickiness on the mirror board and just

00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:28,080
to uh

00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:31,919
to write your perspective on that

00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:33,039
and uh s but i can i will get back it

00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:36,720
later on this point

00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:39,120
um so i think my group is not

00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:41,280
we are not really i don't know if i'm

00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:44,400
just really bad at

00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:46,400
managing a a room or a workshop room

00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,559
but it feels like nobody is using sticky

00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,440
notes in my group so i feel like a bit

00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:52,960
ashamed

00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:55,280
compared to the other group

00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,840
so just feel free to interact with the

00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,840
mirror board

00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,200
i also feel like no offense to the faces

00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,320
that i can see

00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,679
we all went to school a while ago so

00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,360
maybe

00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:15,440
we can move on to a question about

00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:17,200
sustainability at work

00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,640
okay wait interesting to see all your

00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,760
faces actually because i cannot see

00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:23,360
everybody

00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:26,240
okay oh yeah that's better okay

00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:28,080
so i did i did go back to university

00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:32,159
just a few years ago

00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:34,400
okay i'm not sure if that's showing off

00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:37,280
really

00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,880
um no but also that i saw a in the

00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:42,240
second masters i studied

00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:44,000
um behavioral sciences um and and

00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,919
not heard anything about uh

00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,559
sustainability of anything we did there

00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:49,679
it's just

00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:50,320
not a topic um but yes also in the

00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:51,919
previous

00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,840
uh my previous studies before that

00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:56,240
biomedical engineering that's just not

00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,240
addressed

00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:03,360
and i think it would be really good okay

00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:04,320
just a quick note on the education bit i

00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,240
think part of

00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,919
i think you know edu this education

00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,679
conversation is important one because

00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,400
the conversation of sustainability so

00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:13,360
far

00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,799
has been siloed into either like an

00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:18,320
operations facilities

00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:18,880
role in organizations more recently it's

00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,960
been

00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,400
taken under the umbrella of finance and

00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,799
accounting because

00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,520
you can you know accommodate for the

00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:29,360
investments

00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:32,880
into your esg program um

00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:36,640
and you know it's good csr uh

00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:38,320
corporate social responsibility um

00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,400
and so yeah it stems back to like what

00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:42,400
we think our sphere of influence is

00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,799
in our in our company around

00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:48,159
sustainability

00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:49,600
like who ultimately at work it's

00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:52,000
how will you be evaluated on your

00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,120
performance um how does this contribute

00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,400
to the role that you have if you're

00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,080
doing any additional work outside of

00:24:54,400 --> 00:25:00,480
that it's really difficult

00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:02,000
to either push forward an agenda or

00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,600
be recognized for the work that you're

00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,799
doing

00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:10,400
yeah which then people back into

00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:13,919
their like specific role

00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:16,799
yeah um for example if i take it from a

00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:19,520
more designer point of view um i went

00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:22,320
back to this also a few years ago

00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:23,840
and for designers for example especially

00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,960
digital designers

00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:28,880
there is no link between the digital

00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,600
service that you are designing

00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,880
and the material constraints that you

00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:36,400
are

00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:38,880
look that you are allocating

00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,679
to your project you don't know how

00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,000
energy

00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:42,880
carbon emission water resources you will

00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,080
actually need

00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,919
for your project to be built and you

00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,120
don't know its impact it's never been

00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,400
part of the design education of the

00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:51,360
digital

00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,840
digital design education for example and

00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,320
so

00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,600
even in books or methods like mainstream

00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,919
methodologies

00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,600
you think nothing in ux ui or stuff like

00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:01,440
that that's quite interesting there is

00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:05,440
big knowledge caps

00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,440
just for this digital design at least

00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:10,400
i'm curious to hear in speaking about

00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,120
like design constraints

00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,640
i'm curious to hear what incentive like

00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:17,520
incentive models

00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:19,039
are in each of our in each of the places

00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:22,159
that we work

00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:25,600
and what incentives support

00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:28,240
or hinder a sustainability conversation

00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,440
for me this is like where most of the

00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,679
challenge comes in

00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:33,039
in executing a sustainable a sustainable

00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:34,640
idea

00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:36,799
yeah is when there's tension with the

00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:39,520
incentive models so

00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:40,000
i'm so maybe we can jump on the second

00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,840
question

00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,360
and hopefully some people did some

00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:47,919
people already did that

00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:49,520
so just to so to see if you can say that

00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:53,279
if digital certificates have already

00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:55,440
been part of where you are working

00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:58,400
and so far it's been a little bit and

00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,400
now and no

00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:11,760
can i talk yeah hi

00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:14,640
hi all uh i'm nicola uh

00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,440
um i'm a web developer from italy i

00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:19,039
found uh

00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:22,159
in 2015 a web agency here in italy

00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:25,360
and we learned about the

00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:29,840
environmental impact of our digital

00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:34,000
world about in 2018

00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:37,760
so briefly we learned about this this

00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:41,520
kind of problem uh by reading some news

00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:45,120
uh on the on our business

00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:48,640
uh but this is not a real a real problem

00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:51,120
uh in italy uh there is no

00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,480
knowledge about this this kind of

00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:55,520
problem here

00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:59,919
and so we try to

00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:02,080
to get into the to this kind of

00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:03,279
problem and try to talk about our

00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:06,480
customers

00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:09,600
and also with our partners

00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:13,120
in the cyber farms

00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:17,840
and try to and better understand how to

00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:21,760
to improve in our business

00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:25,840
in order to uh less carbon emissions

00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:29,120
and and a better world

00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:30,399
so uh regarding the question is digital

00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:33,520
sustainability

00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:37,440
part of the cons of the conversation

00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:40,799
work uh briefly yes because

00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:44,290
we are trying to make this

00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:45,440
information wide as possible

00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:49,600
[Music]

00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:53,440
briefly our our customers did not

00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:57,200
are not aware about this kind of problem

00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:59,679
they are interested in to improve their

00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:02,960
digital sustainability

00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:08,320
but by now they are uh mainly focused

00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:10,640
uh into the standards priorities like uh

00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:13,279
you know where web agencies so the

00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:16,360
standards could be

00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:18,880
the fast website

00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:22,000
[Music]

00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:26,399
show high resolution images

00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:30,240
to high resolution videos and

00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:34,000
get inbounds

00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:38,480
sell products and so the sustainable

00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:42,080
task goes on the bottom of the list

00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:44,640
most of all but if we uh try to

00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,760
explain the problem to our customers i

00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,799
can

00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:49,440
i i can see that they are sensible to

00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:52,960
this

00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:56,720
kind of problem and

00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:59,279
we try to insist about this

00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,919
we see this there's an answer from from

00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:03,039
them

00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:06,320
so it's it's kind of a good

00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:09,200
a good idea to to go forward

00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:10,159
yeah um i don't know i i mean i would

00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,559
like to

00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:13,360
to interact more but i i don't know if

00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:15,120
we need to jump on

00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:17,679
the question but just a quick um

00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:20,320
perspective from my experience in france

00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:21,360
um i've been working with mostly public

00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:24,559
actors

00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:26,000
for the french state mostly and for

00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:29,600
national agencies

00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:32,080
in which i'm asked to so to coach

00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:34,320
to do the coaching of digital teams for

00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,320
that

00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:41,360
and knowing that like the

00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:43,840
energy gag water resources uh

00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:46,240
distribution of impacts

00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:48,000
for me the starting point of traditional

00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,720
sustainability will be that we need to

00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,720
reduce

00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,760
the instrumental footprints of the

00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,880
service

00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:56,480
whether it's digital or not because we

00:30:54,880 --> 00:31:00,320
need to reach the targets that is

00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:03,120
quite hard the second one is we need to

00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:04,159
to answer effectively to needs expressed

00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,480
by users

00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:08,000
so that's the starting point that's easy

00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,320
everybody's doing that now

00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,080
i mean we don't need to disability to do

00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:15,360
that anyway

00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:18,000
uh and then when i put it into actions

00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:19,279
you know into a methodology the first

00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,640
thing is

00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:23,600
the service should not decrease the

00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,840
lifespan

00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,799
of end user devices that's the first

00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,480
thing for us

00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:30,000
because we know that most of the impact

00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,039
is on manufacturing and any other

00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,720
devices

00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:37,600
so if my service can add

00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:39,279
six months more to the lifespan of the

00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:42,080
smartphone of the laptop

00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:43,440
being used by by a citizen it's great

00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:46,159
it's fantastic

00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,600
we are actually influencing on where the

00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:49,279
impacts are

00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,960
the second thing is we are also looking

00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:54,480
for maintainability

00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:58,080
so my kpi for that is we are looking for

00:31:54,480 --> 00:32:01,600
plus here 10 years plus

00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:03,919
so this life lifespan services

00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,720
in terms of technical maintainability

00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:08,159
and also

00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:11,120
um use um pertinence like

00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:12,840
uh we need ten years later we need to

00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:15,760
answer

00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:17,200
uh i don't want to say that in english

00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:20,240
or if um

00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:23,360
well yeah we have to be useful basically

00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,919
ten years later um the second the third

00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,159
thing

00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:28,880
is that we um we need to reduce the

00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:31,440
overall consumption of resources anyway

00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:33,440
the third thing the fourth thing is that

00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,880
sustainability is just disability just

00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:38,159
another entry point

00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:41,120
to get accessibility to get privacy

00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:43,039
to get open data it all goes together

00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:45,600
there is no there is no mean to

00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:48,320
to change it to to just make it as a

00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:52,080
other stack that you are piling up on

00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:52,080
uh already very complex

00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:56,000
project and especially for performance i

00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:58,320
mean

00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,919
make api are quite rough especially for

00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:03,039
public services

00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:04,559
on average a page for me needs to wait

00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:08,159
between like

00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:11,360
150 kilobytes to 200 kilobytes

00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:14,640
so because it has to be loaded

00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:15,840
in less than three seconds on 3g on bad

00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,440
3g

00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:19,360
so it's also a question of technical

00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:22,000
accessibility

00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,720
um especially if i'm working on a public

00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,919
service

00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:29,200
for a job seeker you don't need

00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:31,600
like a 100 1000

00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:33,519
smartphone to access a service to

00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:36,640
actually look for a job

00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:38,960
yeah he has to work on a very bad with

00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:40,799
a smartphone and laptop with various

00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:43,840
memory and a little

00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:45,200
power calculation power and then so

00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:47,039
there's lots of principles that i'm

00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:49,279
advocating in the public services

00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:50,799
and but based on the impacts that we

00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:53,600
have right now

00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:55,760
and yeah so normally when i do websites

00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:57,760
they are quite performant

00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:59,840
because it's really easy to to be

00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:05,039
performed when you when your website

00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:05,039
the average page weight is 200 kilobytes

00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:09,360
so that's how we i approach it in france

00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:09,360
at least

00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:15,040
i have a i have a question for

00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,919
i mean i guess for everyone but also you

00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,560
you know like

00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:20,879
in increasing with the increase of like

00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:22,639
digital services especially

00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:24,399
you know a year into covid i can only

00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:27,359
imagine that a

00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:28,720
mixed physical and digital service

00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:31,520
offering will continue

00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:32,879
over the next couple of years um how do

00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:36,800
you

00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:38,560
um how do you explore exam and make a

00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,480
decision on the trade-offs between like

00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:44,240
a higher data footprint

00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:45,839
or an organization service product and

00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:48,320
the carbon footprint that's attached to

00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:49,520
that is there any you know

00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,679
how how have you navigated that

00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,560
conversation with clients for instance

00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:56,000
have you

00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:56,639
okay uh so for me uh i have an agnostic

00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,839
position

00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:00,480
on digitization uh which is i don't know

00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:03,040
if it would be

00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:04,640
it's not not well not always really well

00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:08,480
understood or well received

00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:10,880
but which is to say digital is something

00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:13,119
digital digitalizing something is not

00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:15,280
always better

00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:16,880
and uh we need to assess if we're

00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:20,480
digitizing or not

00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:22,000
and to assess if the digitization makes

00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:24,320
sense

00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,400
regarding stable issues i have a

00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:29,520
methodology to assess that

00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:31,280
but i'm blocking on something is that i

00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:33,040
need to have another assessment

00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,480
of the service i would like to

00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:37,680
digitalize

00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:40,960
and in 99.99 percent of all cases

00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:44,640
you never have a

00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:47,760
assessment of your service uh which is

00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:49,680
quite a quite a block point for

00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:51,440
like a pain point for now at the same

00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:54,640
time

00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:57,040
i also want my clients to understand

00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:59,280
what they will not be able to digitalize

00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:02,720
even once they're digitizing something

00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:03,680
um for example when we are taking out a

00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:06,079
post office

00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:07,119
in a village in in a rural place in

00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:10,160
france

00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:11,359
you are not the post office it's not

00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,320
only a place where you are sending

00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:15,520
receiving letters

00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:18,000
or persons it's also a place of

00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:19,200
socialization of people meeting part of

00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,200
the local life

00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:23,280
and we just need to be aware that when

00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:24,640
we are digitizing that

00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,480
and that this place disappear in the

00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,599
village there is things that we are

00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,760
losing

00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:31,839
and we just need to be aware of what we

00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:34,240
cannot do with digital technologies

00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:35,599
and what we can do but it's there is

00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:37,280
always trade-offs and

00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:38,800
the fact is some i feel like most of the

00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,800
time we are not really

00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,839
well trained to express the trade-off

00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,640
that comes with

00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:46,240
digitalization and especially but i take

00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,119
it from perspective i've been working

00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:51,119
more

00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:54,720
with with rural areas at the moment

00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:55,200
so i see a really different perspective

00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:58,079
so

00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,800
i also have like a very territory based

00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:02,079
at the moment

00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:04,000
perspective at the moment but i

00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:06,480
i can be i can be heard at the state

00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,480
level but

00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:11,599
um let me i'd love to add something to

00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:13,440
it uh hey everybody uh gautier

00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:14,960
um because i think this is a really

00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:17,520
important point as this

00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,400
uh the the digitalization and

00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:21,280
understanding the

00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:23,839
impact as it relates to carbon evolves

00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,839
in our education

00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,200
replacement i think is a critical

00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,320
question uh because it's the classic

00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,079
question of

00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:32,640
natural gas you know it's a partial

00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:35,200
replacement but really understanding

00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:36,160
the benefits that digitization is doing

00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,560
to replace

00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:40,079
maybe alternative ways that are

00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,920
producing carbon emissions

00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:43,520
but it's a much more effective way even

00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:46,640
if it has its own issues

00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:49,839
um it may be reducing if it's an option

00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:51,359
that replaces um

00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:53,440
like and we've clearly seen that in the

00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:54,800
pandemic the the upside the pandemic

00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,160
clearly we've all seen the pictures of

00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,760
italy and all the rest

00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,839
where uh emissions have dropped

00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:01,760
dramatically with

00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:03,280
indirectly indigenization right of the

00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:06,560
use of remote so

00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:08,480
it would be great to get understand

00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:09,839
the impact of the replacement the trade

00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:12,160
off as we said

00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:13,760
of what digization is doing i mean i

00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:16,079
think every organization in

00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,440
ours ourselves we're doing an evaluation

00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:19,680
of self-analysis

00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,560
on what do we produce and how can we do

00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,480
it better

00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:23,920
that's just a basic exercise that i

00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,480
think all organizations should be

00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,880
thoughtful

00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:29,440
in going through and then what can you

00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:31,200
do to improve your own carbon footprint

00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,640
but the separate note on digitization i

00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:34,000
think it's really important to try to

00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,760
get a hold of the data and i i don't

00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,200
know where i haven't seen that data

00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,119
as to what's the benefits that

00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:40,640
digitization is doing notwithstanding

00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:41,680
the issues that have been raised which

00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,880
is fair

00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,320
but it's really important to understand

00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,839
what's one of the benefits because the

00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:47,200
trade-off

00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:49,200
you want to be able to focus on the

00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:51,119
areas that really matter um

00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,160
in addition to just doing what we can to

00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:53,520
do it better because you don't want to

00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,240
spend all this money and investment on

00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,320
an area

00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:58,000
if the trade-off is pretty positive so

00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:59,920
anyway yeah

00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,200
all right if you want uh i can add

00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,320
something on that because i just read

00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:06,000
the report

00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:07,359
um assessing uh i mean it's an analysis

00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,000
of how we assess

00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:11,119
uh positive impact of digital sector on

00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,680
climate

00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:14,480
um but it's a take on two claims that

00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,800
have been

00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,599
around for a while which is one from

00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,599
gsma

00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:21,599
so the global global system

00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:24,800
communication association

00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:27,280
saying that one gram of co2 emitted in

00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:30,400
the jaw sector

00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:32,400
allow us to avoid 10 grams um

00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:35,119
emitted in other sectors so there is a

00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:37,040
trade-off of one gram for 10 avoided

00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:38,800
and there is another claim from giza so

00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:40,000
global sustainability initiative saying

00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:42,560
that

00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,160
the digital sector can help us reduce uh

00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:47,680
jj emission worldwide by

00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:48,560
20 percent so basically i've looked at

00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,800
all the data

00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,680
all the hypotheses have been behind that

00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:55,599
and i've

00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:58,240
um and i've looked at data

00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:59,040
world data on gha mission on where

00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:02,480
they're claiming

00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:06,160
avoidance on european data national data

00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:09,440
sexual data and so far

00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:11,920
i haven't seen any of the claims they

00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:13,119
they've been they've been saying around

00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:16,079
for a while

00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:17,200
so i so far my position on that is we

00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:19,040
don't really know

00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,480
how to assess positive impacts of

00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:23,520
digital industry

00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:25,920
and i think we cannot also just base our

00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:28,000
opinion on what the industry is

00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:30,000
producing as data

00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,079
because the methodologies are using are

00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,319
quite flawed to be fair

00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:36,160
but nobody's really looking at it so far

00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:36,640
because we we like to we like to think

00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,880
that

00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:40,079
it will be obviously positive but yet we

00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,960
don't know how

00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:43,920
and so i have no i have a mixed opinion

00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,000
about that

00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:47,920
but i think we we are still lacking a

00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,839
lot of methodology to

00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:52,240
actually effectively assess positive

00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:55,200
impacts

00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:56,640
and the fact is not in most cases it

00:40:55,200 --> 00:41:00,079
doesn't replace something

00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:01,200
it's just piling up or if it's replacing

00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:03,440
something it's adding

00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:04,560
something else elsewhere for example i

00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:06,240
was visiting uh

00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:08,319
i'm sorry i'm talking too much i should

00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:09,440
not do that we are doing a workshop and

00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:12,240
uh

00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:12,960
uh well we are very bad students sorry

00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:15,280
but um

00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,400
for example i was visiting a recycling

00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:19,760
facility center

00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:21,680
a waste waste recycling center

00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:22,880
and obviously like the waste stream

00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:26,000
coming from papers

00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:26,880
journal printed media have decreased a

00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,119
lot

00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:30,720
a lot lots but at the same time all the

00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:33,440
degrees on

00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:34,960
this stream have been overly compensated

00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,160
by the stream of waste coming from

00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:39,280
online shopping

00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:41,440
the box system online shopping so

00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:43,599
is is why i mean for now i don't have

00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:45,760
that much perspective on global issues

00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:47,040
i can only do on the field and do my

00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:49,920
research as a ph

00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:51,760
for my phd but we need to i think to

00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:55,119
have a very

00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:57,520
field based view on that just one other

00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:58,880
quick i mean i i guarantee i completely

00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:01,359
understand what you're saying i mean i

00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:03,520
think but it's really important for the

00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:05,119
this particular sector to frame the

00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,480
arguments right we got to be able to

00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:08,480
frame

00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,760
you need to get data right to support

00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:11,200
some of the positions because in order

00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,560
to ultimately convince the private

00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,920
sector even with the public sector

00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:16,640
initiatives

00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:18,079
we need we we need date you know today

00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:20,880
to be able to frame the argument

00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:22,880
so that it can resonate with both

00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:24,560
leadership in the private sector

00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:26,400
as well as the public sector for that

00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:27,599
matter so it's great that we're talking

00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,599
about it but i think with the

00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:31,359
you know getting a hold of this the data

00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:32,800
to support it to your points

00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:34,079
is really really important because i

00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,920
think that's the only way you ultimately

00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:38,880
uh start convincing

00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:40,319
so the data is in french so far and it's

00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,880
translated but the report has

00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:44,000
been put online today so and there's a

00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,680
summary in english

00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,400
but that's the best i can do for now

00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:52,079
before translation and all the data

00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:54,960
and all sectors and countries are being

00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:56,720
analyzed in this report so it's a good

00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:58,720
point to start at least

00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:59,920
so sorry i need we need to focus on toot

00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:01,920
chatty it's uh

00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:03,119
i'm really bad i'm really bad at doing

00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:06,800
workshops

00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:09,920
i know so uh let's

00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:12,720
maybe if we can think of

00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:13,280
like for example we with tom we spoke

00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:15,359
about the

00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:16,880
private and public sectors like which

00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:18,000
one is the best stepping stone a

00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:20,960
stepping stone

00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,240
because for example in france the state

00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:24,160
regulation

00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:25,280
is really helping us go forward with

00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:27,280
this issue

00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:28,400
the digital sustainability is a big

00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,920
topic right now

00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:32,000
you know for mps and the french

00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:33,599
teammates and there is a bill being

00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,680
passed

00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:37,520
that will be passed soon and we are

00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:40,640
working with mps in french to

00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:44,240
in france to make it better

00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:47,440
but yet it's very frenchy approach

00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:48,480
to go through the state regulation and i

00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:50,800
know it's not working

00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:53,040
like that in all countries so i would i

00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:54,560
was also also curious to see

00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:58,800
from your own perspective in your own

00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:58,800
country how you how do you approach it

00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:07,599
and you can use here the american eu

00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:10,160
divide on this

00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:10,160
is there one

00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:22,319
but you can use you can use sticky notes

00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:25,280
you can

00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:26,079
if you if you uh if you want to stop me

00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:28,319
to toss me

00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:30,400
to stop to something bubbling and

00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:32,319
chatting none all the time

00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:34,079
well i was going to mention a couple of

00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:37,040
um

00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:37,920
one is a you know a launch private

00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,680
company called

00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:42,000
uh provenance i don't know if you've

00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:45,200
heard of it it's um

00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:47,440
based in london but they

00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:48,720
do like supply chain verification for

00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:52,640
consumer brands

00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:57,040
so for instance um cult b

00:44:52,640 --> 00:45:00,319
here in the uk prides itself on its

00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:03,200
clean beauty products and so what's

00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:03,200
providence does

00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:06,720
using blockchain which is energy

00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:10,000
inefficient

00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:13,119
um creates this verify this

00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:16,480
immutable log of the supply chain

00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:18,960
uh claims of different brands and then

00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:20,079
creates a cms so that those stories of

00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:23,040
sustainability

00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:24,160
can be surfaced onto product pages on

00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:28,000
cult beauty

00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:30,400
so if a customer is on a

00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,480
product site you can see that like okay

00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:33,839
this fair trade claim this product has a

00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:35,200
fair trade claim and this is how we

00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:40,000
evaluated this

00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:42,560
and so it closes the loop for brands to

00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,319
do that accountability measure of doing

00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:46,880
their supply chain analysis

00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:48,160
and sharing results but then linking it

00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:50,720
to the consumer

00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:52,319
conversation too which i think is a

00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:54,640
really hard part of the

00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:56,319
puzzle um is taking what you've done

00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:57,920
internally at the organization to figure

00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:59,680
out what your emissions are

00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:01,359
and then link it into what the consumer

00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:04,800
knows and the messaging

00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:08,720
and then another company that's stells

00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:11,359
um a successfully exited

00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:12,960
startup founder has started a new

00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:15,440
company focusing on

00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:17,040
how businesses who to your point are the

00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:19,359
biggest emitters of

00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:21,280
carbon um can begin to take

00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:22,800
responsibility and accountability for

00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:24,440
their carbon emissions so it's sort of

00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:25,760
like provenance which has a

00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:29,599
consumer-facing

00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:33,040
narrative and moves it into

00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:34,480
a b2b space so holding for instance a

00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:36,880
l'oreal accountable

00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:38,720
um and what would that look like within

00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:41,359
industry

00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:42,160
okay could you add it to the sticky

00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:45,280
notes

00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:47,359
absolutely thank you very much

00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:49,119
but there is there is one point that is

00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:50,000
really like critical

00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:52,880
when you are looking at digital

00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,880
sustainability its at every con

00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:57,200
every point of your analysis you are

00:46:54,880 --> 00:47:02,000
struggling to get data

00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:04,400
that's it's actually quite ironic

00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,280
that in a sector that is producing that

00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:08,160
much data

00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:09,680
it's really hard to get data but

00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:12,480
material impact

00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:13,440
energy intensity and so on and uh that's

00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,640
been one of the

00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:16,560
big issues that we have so far

00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:17,599
especially when we are doing life cycle

00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:21,359
assessments

00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:24,400
you are it's really a fight to get data

00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:25,200
and it's one of the major issues that we

00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:28,240
have right now

00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:31,599
right now well if if

00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:33,440
data is such a problem then we might

00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:34,880
have to address the one thing that's not

00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:37,920
so sensitive to data

00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:41,520
and that is emotion and then you might

00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:41,520
have to play it through public opinion

00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:49,440
yeah but for for the for when you are

00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:52,880
at the um at the

00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:56,480
states or public policy logo

00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:59,520
they are really uh epidemic

00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:00,800
evident-based evidence-based data

00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:04,400
and if you don't produce that it's

00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:08,079
really hard to convince barely everybody

00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:11,280
but then at the more for

00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:12,319
with private clients or people that are

00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:14,319
going to use your service

00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:16,319
you have you can have a much more

00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:17,680
interesting approach regarding regarding

00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:20,960
that

00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:24,960
so got here our question uh

00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:26,160
what is the key problem you're trying to

00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:30,160
address for which

00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:34,079
you are looking for data

00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:36,640
um i'm looking basically for

00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:38,240
the three uh the four uh impacts that

00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:41,359
you that you saw earlier

00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:44,400
so which is the resources stipulation

00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:46,480
um i mean basically all the resources

00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:48,240
used in a product

00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:50,720
all the water consumption regarding this

00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:53,280
product energy and gig

00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:54,000
and so far it's really really hard to

00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:57,119
get because

00:48:54,000 --> 00:49:00,400
most of the lifecycle assessments are

00:48:57,119 --> 00:49:03,359
private or under mdas so

00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:04,640
there is no public database for that so

00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:07,119
that's a whether that's

00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:08,240
actually in france where right now we're

00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:11,520
trying to advocate

00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:14,720
for open database regarding that

00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:17,680
that we can actually help us have a

00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:18,720
way better assessment of the impact of

00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:21,839
digital industry

00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:22,960
but specifically in france because the

00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:26,240
issue is to have

00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:29,599
a national national wide database

00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:32,000
on the global database you got too much

00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:33,040
it's too broad you really right now my

00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,920
my focus is

00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:36,559
to work on national database to make it

00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:39,760
better

00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:40,559
because it's easier to come to to get

00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:43,280
good data

00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:44,319
on that level and um and then when you

00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:46,319
when we got that we can

00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:47,760
it means that we can standardize the way

00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:50,319
we're doing lifecycle assessments

00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:51,440
for digital products and then we will

00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:55,280
have a much better

00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:58,160
uh handle on accessing for the

00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:58,640
digital development and at the moment uh

00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:00,880
we

00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:02,240
we passed a bill recently so it became a

00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:05,599
law that

00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:08,400
so on every um client's uh

00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:09,599
invoice for data plan you will have the

00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:12,960
amount of traffic

00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:16,079
of of that that mostly that are used

00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:18,559
and and co2 equivalents

00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:19,599
regarding the data that have been used

00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:23,040
and it took us

00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:26,480
one year and a half to get to the number

00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:29,920
to translate that data traffic

00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:32,800
to carbonic equivalency

00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:33,520
so yeah it takes it takes a long time

00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:35,520
yeah

00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:37,440
so i was wondering in the absence of

00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:40,079
that sort of uh

00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:41,599
industry specific granular data maybe

00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:45,040
there is merit in looking at

00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:47,200
uh macro inputs uh

00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:49,440
like basic things like hey uh have we

00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:51,680
seen an a change in the

00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:54,079
in the fuel emission or fuel consumption

00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:57,200
across the planet or across the nation

00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:58,079
or uh you know what's the deforestation

00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:00,400
looking like

00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:02,480
and and trying to correlate sort of like

00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:03,200
the internet traffic or digital traffic

00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:05,760
data

00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:07,760
with that with that macro i can totally

00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:08,079
also imagine it being just a noise in

00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:11,119
that

00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:14,240
entire set of spectrum but uh

00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:15,520
i i wonder if somebody has approached

00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:18,079
this not from

00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:19,280
a very industry specific transaction

00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:22,480
oriented

00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:24,240
life cycle mission versus finding sort

00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:27,680
of a signal in macro

00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:27,680
macro trends yeah

00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:36,319
recording in progress okay

00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:36,800
okay so just to answer to answer to

00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:39,280
before

00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:40,480
we like we were cut off so yes there is

00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:42,079
macros to this

00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:43,920
and uh in front i can send you most of

00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:47,119
the scientific literature

00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:47,119
on global estimates

00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:51,359
okay okay i can we've been a very bad

00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:54,000
group

00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:55,520
in my workshop we've not we're not

00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:59,040
really used post-it notes i think i'm

00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:59,040
really bad at making workshops

00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:07,599
post-it notes are not there beyond

00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:09,680
i take full responsibility

00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:11,839
okay you did good i think we had a

00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:13,520
pretty robust conversation and got some

00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:14,640
really good comments in and

00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:16,160
at the end of the day it's the

00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:18,319
communication that matters not

00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:21,599
necessarily how we do it so

00:52:18,319 --> 00:52:22,880
you did exactly yeah do you go to

00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:24,880
do you want to do you want to briefly

00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:27,440
sum up some of the some of the ideas

00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:30,960
that were shared in your group

00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:32,720
well okay

00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:34,480
let me back on the mainly post-it note

00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:37,920
that we we got there

00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:40,720
so i think we have like

00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:41,680
uh broad consensus that not that much

00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:44,800
people

00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:47,359
are what thought about sustainability

00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:49,599
where does it come from and also

00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:52,000
apparently in my group we're a bit older

00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:52,640
so specifically digital sustainability

00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,920
not yeah i

00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:55,440
think there was a lot of consensus

00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:58,160
around sustainability yeah digital

00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:58,160
stability sorry

00:52:58,839 --> 00:53:03,520
so so far not that

00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:07,200
we might and that we might uh claim that

00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:09,920
there there might be knowledge gaps

00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:11,200
um then from so i've been babbling a lot

00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:13,280
and i mean i've been talking a lot in my

00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:16,319
group so

00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:16,880
i was talking basically that in france

00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:20,240
we

00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:20,880
tend to have more of a state-based

00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:23,680
approach

00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:26,400
trying to fight for regulation that will

00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:28,400
influence the markets and industries

00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:30,400
rather than going through in companies

00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:33,680
to change the

00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:36,640
the regulation um and

00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:38,000
um we talk about supply chains and how

00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:41,520
can we ensure that we got

00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:43,760
the data about the

00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:44,720
of products that we are using and then

00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:46,880
how to manage

00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:47,839
to get the data about the supply chain

00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:49,119
and then

00:53:47,839 --> 00:53:51,760
we talked about that the fact that

00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:55,200
getting data about the teacher sector

00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:58,559
about the environmental impact of the

00:53:55,200 --> 00:54:00,800
digital sector is really really really

00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:03,040
hard as we both know

00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:04,720
yeah yeah we discussed that as well yeah

00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:05,599
we are you're always fighting to get

00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:08,319
data together

00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:09,520
but energy consumption batteries use

00:54:08,319 --> 00:54:11,760
water consumption it's

00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:13,119
really really hard to get so we were

00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:14,800
talking that

00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:17,040
global about what are the global

00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:19,520
estimates

00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:21,359
but so there is so there are scientific

00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:22,720
scientific papers i can give on that

00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:25,119
and also i can give you the limits on

00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:28,800
that and

00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:29,520
then also sorry i've been talking a lot

00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:31,839
but there is a lot

00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:32,720
we had i think a pleasant conversation

00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:34,640
um

00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:35,760
that's from my perspective when i'm

00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:38,319
working on

00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:39,280
with digital teams there is one point

00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:42,160
that is critical

00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:43,359
is that to say that we do we need to

00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:46,480
digitalize

00:54:43,359 --> 00:54:49,040
and if we digitalize will that will

00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:50,160
will it be more impactful to stay in

00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:52,319
business

00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:54,960
than just keeping the service as it is

00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:56,240
and how do we assess that

00:54:54,960 --> 00:55:00,400
and if someone in the group would like

00:54:56,240 --> 00:55:00,400
to add something feel free

00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:06,400
great i think ethan had a a good point

00:55:04,839 --> 00:55:08,559
around

00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:10,640
when we when we look at the impact of

00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:11,760
digitization we shouldn't just look at

00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:14,960
it from the

00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:15,920
uh just the outcomes from a digitization

00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:19,520
perspective but

00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:20,160
rather also what it replaced and sort of

00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:23,119
find that

00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:25,520
close loop delta between what

00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:28,160
transformed versus what new emerge

00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:28,720
uh i i hope ethan and i i captured your

00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:31,839
essence

00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:34,400
uh reasonably uh

00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:36,240
over there yeah so looking at the really

00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:39,119
looking at the full picture

00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:39,119
yeah you did

00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:44,400
great thank you um shall i just

00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:46,240
sum up we've got just a few minutes left

00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:47,359
before before this session closes

00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:49,280
should i just sum a few of the

00:55:47,359 --> 00:55:52,559
additional things that our group

00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:54,160
touched on so

00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:58,000
i mean there was a sort of resounding

00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:59,920
now in terms of has anybody ever

00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:02,400
learned about digital sustainability in

00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:04,319
the education system so i think there's

00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:07,440
definitely a hole to be filled there

00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:11,520
um in terms of like

00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:13,200
companies actually talking about it um

00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:14,799
somebody said that just like people who

00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:16,160
are passionate giving talks like company

00:56:14,799 --> 00:56:17,359
stand-ups and so on is a good way of

00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:20,960
getting it out there

00:56:17,359 --> 00:56:22,000
um also like design and development

00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:25,200
teams really like

00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:26,640
interesting challenges so and you know

00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:27,440
and a lot of their work can actually be

00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:29,760
fairly routine

00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:30,960
so giving them sustainability as

00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:31,839
something for them to get their teeth

00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:34,799
sucked into and

00:56:31,839 --> 00:56:36,400
and as an excuse to try new things um

00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:37,839
can be can be quite powerful in getting

00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:39,599
that there by him

00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:41,040
um and somebody also mentioned that it

00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:42,960
helped kind of it could potentially help

00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:45,359
with things like grant applications

00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:46,720
if um for non-profits where you're

00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:48,000
showing that you're really kind of going

00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:48,559
to the next level in terms of looking at

00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:52,720
your

00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:54,319
your your environmental footprint um

00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:55,760
we talked about open source projects and

00:56:54,319 --> 00:56:58,319
how they could really play a role

00:56:55,760 --> 00:57:00,079
um particularly kind of large open

00:56:58,319 --> 00:57:01,680
source projects if they can get

00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:02,880
some sort of backing whether it's

00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:04,480
whether it's grant funding or whether

00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:06,640
it's commercial backing to actually

00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:09,119
embed sustainability into their

00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:10,720
um projects like has pattern did some

00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:12,400
open source projects with

00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:14,319
sustain accessibility teams that they

00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:17,040
can have teams as well

00:57:14,319 --> 00:57:18,160
that could be really powerful um

00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:21,040
legislation

00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:22,880
such as carbon reporting or carbon taxes

00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:24,720
and forcing open data

00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:26,400
energy consumption from data centers

00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:29,680
particularly with something that was

00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:31,839
talked about um

00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:33,280
gdpr was brought up as an example and so

00:57:31,839 --> 00:57:36,079
is the european ally act as

00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:36,640
kind of legislation that helped get more

00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:38,400
people

00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:40,000
looking seriously at accessibility and

00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:41,760
privacy and

00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,040
so you know there's potential down the

00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:44,640
line for

00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:46,160
some sort of government legislation

00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:49,680
could get people talking

00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:53,119
but that was also um suggested that

00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:54,559
having an organization like w3

00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:55,920
kind of leading the charge on that

00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:56,720
behind the scenes in terms of actually

00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:58,799
setting

00:57:56,720 --> 00:58:00,799
some guidelines of like what our best

00:57:58,799 --> 00:58:02,640
practices might actually provide a

00:58:00,799 --> 00:58:04,000
foundation that then can be used by

00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:06,799
government

00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,599
to design some sort of legislation um

00:58:06,799 --> 00:58:09,200
and also

00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:11,280
kind of probably push further than the

00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:12,000
legislation itself would be able to do

00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:13,839
so

00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:16,319
and then other general ideas were that

00:58:13,839 --> 00:58:17,760
google could make it a factor in search

00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:19,200
rankings that would probably

00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:20,799
have a massive impact in terms of

00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:23,680
getting people motivated

00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:24,079
um netflix could make documentary on her

00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:28,640
um

00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:28,640
if they if they could be honest about it

00:58:28,799 --> 00:58:32,559
um and and we also heard from eric about

00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:35,680
kind of

00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:37,599
just the general issue of like um as

00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:39,760
more and more people

00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:41,040
get access to the internet so that

00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:41,520
that's going to have a big impact on the

00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:42,880
internet

00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:45,040
on the environmental impact of the

00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:45,760
internet but actually in those places

00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:47,839
where

00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:49,520
digital adoption is sort of still

00:58:47,839 --> 00:58:52,640
happening where you've got

00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:53,680
and what we don't want is like repeating

00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:55,680
the same mistakes

00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:57,520
so more kind of cross-pollination

00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:59,520
between countries where

00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:00,960
uh countries with low digital adoption

00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:02,799
can go to countries

00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:04,319
that high digital options say okay what

00:59:02,799 --> 00:59:05,599
worked what didn't work in terms of

00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:08,000
reducing the impact

00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:09,920
are there ways that we can like help our

00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,040
country adopt it in a more efficient

00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:15,119
more eco-friendly way

00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:18,480
would be really really valuable um

00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:21,040
i think that's all we've got time for

00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:22,400
um we are gonna i'm gonna see if there's

00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:23,359
a way hopefully the mozilla team will

00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:26,400
help me

00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:28,319
share the um share some information

00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:31,599
afterwards probably next week

00:59:28,319 --> 00:59:33,599
um with some notes uh

00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:35,280
go to uni somehow between us we'll work

00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:36,880
out about writing it like an article

00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:38,000
summary that we'll put online and share

00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:40,640
with you guys

00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:42,160
um and we'll also um you've got the link

00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:43,040
to the myra board which you can refer

00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:45,280
back to

00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:46,720
i think that will stay online so i think

00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:49,280
it's public so you should be able to

00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:50,480
kind of look at that and refer to it and

00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:51,920
um

00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:53,200
and then we'll also share the slide deck

00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:54,880
which has some additional resources at

00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:56,240
the end which we didn't talk through

00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:59,200
but you'll be able to look at those um

00:59:56,240 --> 01:00:02,880
in case they're in case they're useful

00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:04,799

scientific publication scientific papers

01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:36,480
but one specific topic about digital

01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:40,559
stability you can reach me you can

01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:41,920
reach to me i have a pretty thorough

uh also in the good news regarding

01:00:49,359 --> 01:00:54,400
digital stability in france we

01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:55,280
recently introduced the repairability

01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:58,000
score

01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:59,200
so every electronic products are most

01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,240
extreme producers but including

01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:03,280
smartphones

01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:04,880
will now have a republic reparability

01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:07,359
score based on the is

01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:09,359
there is to be open to be repaired to

01:01:07,359 --> 01:01:10,799
have open documentation standard tools

01:01:09,359 --> 01:01:13,520
standard screws

01:01:10,799 --> 01:01:14,559
and it's been a big victory for us and

01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:16,240
especially

01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:19,280
it will go further in europe with the

01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:21,200
right to reaper movement

01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:22,559
that's fantastic that's exciting news

01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:25,359
and definitely something i hope other

01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:28,079
countries will will follow on

01:01:25,359 --> 01:01:30,640
can you both drop your emails uh in the

01:01:28,079 --> 01:01:30,640

01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:39,920
so what i think we'll do is we'll

little bit longer so that you can copy
