00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,640
hi

00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,640
i'm brianna from the interledger

00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,120
foundation where i am the executive

00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,120
director

00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,600
and hi i'm harriet kingerby i'm co-chair

00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,760
of the conscious advertising network

00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,600
um and we're here today to talk about

00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,360
alternatives to digital advertising

00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,120
so whether there ever can be mainstream

00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,600
alternatives to some of the invasive

00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:46,480
techniques we see today

00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,760
um so brianna i'd love to kick off our

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,360
discussion today

00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,360
um by asking you a little bit about

00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,440
interledger and how it works

00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:56,080
and really kind of why you got involved

00:17:53,440 --> 00:18:00,160
and what made you so passionate about it

00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:03,280
uh yeah so interledger is an open source

00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:06,640
interoperable payment network that sends

00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:08,720
payments across different ledgers so

00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:11,120
those ledgers can originate from

00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:14,799
anything from a regular bank account

00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:16,799
to a blockchain account and

00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:18,960
the reason why this is important is

00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:21,120
because right now

00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,760
the way financial systems are set up

00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:26,400
it's very silos so it makes moving

00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,600
money between them very clunky and

00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,520
cumbersome

00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,960
and then once you get on the subject of

00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:34,400
trying to

00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:38,400
do cross-border payments it becomes even

00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:41,440
more problematic so the interledger

00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,960
protocol solves this problem the goal of

00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,520
interledger is to

00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,919
move money as fast and as cheap as it is

00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:49,919
to move data across the internet

00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,679
and someone said this and i keep

00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:53,600
sticking to the saying

00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,720
it's like the swiss army knife of

00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,600
payments

00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,799
um it just has the capabilities to do a

00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,360
multitude of things

00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:02,480
and to help enrich people's lives and so

00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:05,520
that is what

00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:08,840
really attracted me uh to

00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:10,720
to this project and to um working at the

00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:14,080
foundation i'm a

00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:18,000
newbie to the world of payments um

00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:20,720
but i am very passionate about

00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,520
every role that i'm in that it's making

00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:26,640
a difference in people's lives and

00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:28,480
interledger just has the the capacity to

00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,360
do that and so i was really excited

00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,280
about it

00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:34,640
when i learned about it and so i said i

00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:38,000
have to be involved in this in some way

00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,640
um so harriet you just completed a

00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,679
fellowship

00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:43,600
at mozilla can you share

00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,880
your experience with the program and how

00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,200
it relates to the work

00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:49,120
that you're doing at the um conscious

00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,440
advertising network

00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,559
yeah absolutely so and the conscious

00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,679
advertising network

00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:58,960
is an organization that co-founded

00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:01,200
um about three years ago and we've got a

00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,240
mission to ensure the ethics catches up

00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,520
with the technology of modern

00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,559
advertising

00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:08,960
and basically um the

00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:10,960
we look at six different areas and they

00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,919
include things you'd expect from

00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:16,080
advertising so you know is it are the

00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:18,400
advertising techniques complying with

00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,840
data protection legislation but we also

00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,480
look at things like

00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:24,240
defunding hate speech and disinformation

00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,960
we look at insuring children's welfare

00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,120
online

00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,280
and we look at how advertising can

00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,799
promote diversity and inclusion in a

00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:34,240
meaningful way

00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:37,120
and and you know you'd think that

00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:39,039
uh these these these principles these

00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,960
techniques they're enshrined within the

00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,080
um human rights uh you know the u.n

00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,600
declaration of human rights

00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,720
you think they'd be uh you know kind of

00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,559
core business practices but

00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:49,919
unfortunately they're not

00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:52,000
and um what we see is that the

00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,039
current technologies that have been that

00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,240
have been used to buy and sell

00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,679
advertising online

00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,520
a little bit like an online auction

00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,760
every time we surf the web

00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:02,000
um they sound really uh they sound

00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,360
really kind of straightforward and we

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,559
attract around the web

00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:08,159
and advertising is targeted to us and

00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:10,159
the processes behind it make sure that

00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:10,799
the advertising is genuinely targeted to

00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:12,159
us

00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:14,000
but unfortunately that's causing all

00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,520
sorts of issues

00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,120
and like you said around the human

00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,480
elephant element there's a huge human

00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,159
and environmental impact some of the

00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:23,360
decisions that are being made

00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:26,080
so um my work with mozilla was very much

00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:27,280
looking at what happens when you add ai

00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,039
into the mixture

00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,640
so we've got these current algorithmic

00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:32,400
based technologies

00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,320
and what happens suddenly if you've got

00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,320
machine learning in the mix

00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,919
or if you've got an emotional facial

00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:40,080
recognition in the mix

00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:42,080
and what we found perhaps unsurprisingly

00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,039
is actually when you start to add those

00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,679
technologies in

00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:46,640
is that it increases the possibility of

00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,640
harm

00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,559
and so the work that i was doing was

00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,679
looking at those harms looking at things

00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,280
like

00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:55,280
emotional recognition being used to

00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,200
target advertising for example

00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:59,520
and just what that means and with big

00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,520
call to action to the industry really to

00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,760
to get ahead of this and to do something

00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:06,080
about it

00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,039
yeah that that that's really interesting

00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:10,159
and i think i

00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:13,600
brought up before about how the race

00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:14,400
um the the facial recognition doesn't

00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,200
even

00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:19,280
recognize people of color um sometimes

00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:22,159
so that that's a huge problem

00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:23,200
so um how are you working with

00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:26,640
advertisers to

00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:28,000
address this absolutely so when yeah

00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,679
when you start to

00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,120
use technologies with the bias that's

00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:33,440
already you know

00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,799
enshrined within them it creates you

00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:37,679
know it has these huge

00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:39,280
huge ripple effects and impacts so with

00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:41,520
can what we've tried to do

00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,960
is we've we've looked at we see

00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,880
advertising as

00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,679
advertising money as a resource really

00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:51,919
like 330 billion dollars each year

00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:52,480
is is spent online and that funds things

00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:54,960
from

00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,840
fabulous journalism it funds things from

00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,000
you know

00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,280
stupid creators on youtube but it also

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,280
funds the really bad stuff

00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,559
so it funds things like hate speech

00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,400
preachers um

00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:06,400
you know hate speech and disinformation

00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,320
in fact have a funding model

00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,480
through online advertising and that is

00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,320
just not not okay

00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,080
so what we try and do is we've created

00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:16,000
these six we call them manifestos but

00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:19,120
they're basically roadmaps

00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,840
and what we try and do is point

00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,320
advertisers at initiatives that they can

00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,880
join

00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:26,159
use whatever embeds and that will stop

00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:29,679
them from doing things like fun

00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:30,559
uh defunding um particular community

00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:34,159
media

00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:37,280
like 73 of lgbtq plus

00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:37,919
online content is rendered unmonetizable

00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,080
because

00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:41,760
advertising um because advertisers are

00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,279
really risk-averse and they have these

00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:46,559
terrible block lists

00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:48,720
which include words like um lesbian so

00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:50,400
loads of you know media for that

00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,760
community is defunded

00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,000
so what we try and do is we try and

00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:56,159
highlight these issues and we try and

00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,240
create use the manifestos to create road

00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:00,480
maps so advertisers can use this

00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,679
and they can they can create new systems

00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,039
that stop this from happening or they

00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,000
can at least question the systems that

00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:06,320
they've already

00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,279
already got and we've been doing that

00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,440
for about three years

00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,960
and um we're seeing we're seeing changes

00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,720
but there's still an awful lot to be

00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,360
done

00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,880
and which brings me to the you know that

00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:19,600
i'm really interested

00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:21,520
um about how new web monetization

00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,919
techniques like like interledger

00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,120
can help um consumers and curators kind

00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,640
of address this kind of wealth

00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,400
distribution issue

00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,480
because one of the issues that obviously

00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:33,360
we see is that advertisers are

00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,320
defunding huge bits of um huge parts of

00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,039
the internet

00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,480
um we had issues where um advertising

00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:40,720
money wasn't even reaching

00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,760
um kind of good journalism because

00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:45,279
advertisers were

00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:46,960
defunding uh coronavirus news

00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:48,559
and we've got the issue where on the

00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,480
platforms huge

00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:52,320
amounts of revenue are kind of taken

00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,000
away from creators by the platforms

00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,720
themselves so we've got this huge issue

00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,640
with with

00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,919
the distribution of wealth i know you're

00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,440
really passionate about it i'd love to

00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:02,720
hear more

00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:05,600
yeah so as you were saying like 70

00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:07,919
of advertising dollars go to two to

00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,200
three of the biggest platforms that are

00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:12,320
out there and so

00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:14,159
that's billions of dollars going to two

00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:17,360
or three companies while leaving

00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:20,000
smaller creators out in the cold and

00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:21,600
unable to make a meaningful profit off

00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,240
of the work

00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,440
in addition to that they also sell their

00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,480
users information

00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:30,400
so there's no privacy and for me as a

00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,159
consumer like i don't like that idea i

00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,080
don't like if i google something and i

00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:35,600
go to another platform and the exact

00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:39,840
same thing that i googled

00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:42,400
is there um so one of the capabilities

00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:44,640
of interledger is to stream

00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,640
micropayments from one account to

00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:50,240
another so a micropayment

00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:52,880
could be a fraction of a cent and so

00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,000
how that works with web monetization it

00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:57,039
allows you

00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,960
as a creator um to receive

00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:00,559
micro payments for every second that

00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:04,000
someone spends

00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:07,760
on your site and so for me

00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,159
as a consumer i in turn get to support

00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,960
my

00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:11,440
favorite blog or my my cooking channel

00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,919
or

00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,480
my you know favorite photographer while

00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:18,080
also

00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:19,760
maintaining my privacy um and so

00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,679
the more users that we get on the

00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,600
platform that are more interested in

00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:24,080
this the more money it allows the small

00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,679
creator

00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:31,039
to make so just imagine someone who is

00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:33,520
like in a small remote area

00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:34,720
that is able to make money off of the

00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,840
content they create

00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:41,039
so it gives them more space to

00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:44,159
be creative and make more content

00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:47,360
um so yeah that's how

00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:50,000
web monetization works and they have

00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:52,000
they have coil that is a web

00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:56,000
monetization provider right now

00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:58,960
um cinnamon video which is kind of like

00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:02,159
a web monetized version of youtube

00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:03,039
and uh puma browser which is just

00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:06,000
basically has

00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:08,640
web monetization built into the browser

00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,640
natively

00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:15,520
so that's that's basically how it works

00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,720
and so as we're talking how this

00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:20,240
advertising is

00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,880
uh failing creators in a way and leaving

00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,080
so many

00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:26,080
people out in the cold you know

00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:28,080
makes you think about like what what can

00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:31,200
be done about this how can we

00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,559
how can we address this issue and how

00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,600
are you working to

00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:36,960
address that issue i can

00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,480
yeah that's a really good that's a

00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,480
really good point because like you said

00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:43,919
we can reform advertising

00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:46,000
um but advertising is still you know

00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:47,360
you can reform advertising and that is

00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,480
still a kind of capitalist way of

00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,559
funding the internet

00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,159
i am still assumed to be a consumer all

00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:54,640
the time when i'm online

00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:55,279
um even though actually in my daily life

00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,000
i am

00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:59,520
only a consumer some of the time so you

00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,600
know if i go for a walk

00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:03,120
i go for a walk in the park um during

00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,039
you know in the park i'm not a consumer

00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:08,399
unless i'm looking at my phone and

00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:09,919
engaging with a shopping site so

00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:12,080
for me there's this really problematic

00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:15,440
thing of we can reform advertising

00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:16,080
but um you know that will never fix the

00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,600
problem

00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:21,600
of all these commercial imperatives that

00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,720
uh kind of advertising brings and those

00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,320
commercial um

00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,320
those commercial kind of imperatives and

00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,640
lenses are actually shaping the internet

00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:30,640
in

00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:33,679
some kind of quite scary ways so

00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:36,720
for example you know as journalists and

00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:39,200
and newspapers struggle for revenue

00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,720
they try and uh change the way they

00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,399
present information change the way they

00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,320
write headlines

00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:46,799
the ordering of information in an

00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:48,480
article in order to a get people to

00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:50,080
click on those headlines so you see the

00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:53,039
click bait that we see

00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,679
um and b also to kind of keep them on a

00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:56,399
page

00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:58,000
so um you know there's recipe sites that

00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:00,159
you see that's a whole story about how

00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,760
someone first ate this cookie 20 years

00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:02,880
ago at their grandma's and the recipe's

00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,159
right at the bottom

00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,320
and of course that's to show you more

00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:08,080
ads on the page and this isn't

00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,840
this is you know this it's it's

00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,520
dangerous when it gets to journalism

00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:14,159
because journalism is what

00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:16,240
you know speaks truth to power in theory

00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:18,799
um and it's also

00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,919
it's also really not great for us as us

00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:22,320
as users

00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:24,159
um because the internet is being shaped

00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:27,360
these commercial imperatives in mind

00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:28,320
so i think there is what we do at can is

00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,240
very much around

00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,840
trying to get advertisers to as i said

00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,440
think about this resource

00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:35,120
think really carefully about where

00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,720
they're spending it um

00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,720
and making sure that they're not

00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:41,039
spending it in places whether

00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,720
the hate speech the disinformation the

00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:46,080
real junk is

00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:47,600
yeah um but even if we even if we fixed

00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,559
that we wouldn't fix the problem

00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,200
you know some of the problems that

00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:54,399
you've described um you know another

00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,720
and another side effect of advertising

00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:56,640
this

00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,960
this kind of trying to always generate

00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:01,039
advertising revenue for example

00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,720
is that you have creators in some parts

00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:04,240
of the world who are creating content

00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,039
not in their native language but in

00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,120
english

00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:08,799
because it'll have a bigger market and

00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:11,520
so you're impacting

00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:13,200
entire cultures who just can't um you

00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,080
know just just can't make money out of

00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,840
this model

00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:17,520
so i'm really excited by things like the

00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,480
web monetization and

00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,399
you know kind of techniques you've

00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,760
described and it's great that there's

00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:23,679
you know there's an easy way in because

00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:25,600
i'm not a technical person so

00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:28,399
when we start to talk about micro paints

00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,399
i'm like oh gosh

00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:32,559
um so it's wicked to hear that that's

00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,919
that actually that's that's being made

00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:36,080
simple and there's like these these

00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:38,880
simple processes in place

00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:40,080
yeah i mean but yeah what you spoke to

00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,919
it's it's censorship

00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:44,320
it's really censorship and they're

00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:48,080
guiding what we're able to see

00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:50,320
and what we're able to consume and

00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,440
i think that a lot of people are sick of

00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:55,039
it so

00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:58,640
hence the reason why 25 to 30

00:30:55,039 --> 00:31:02,000
of people now use ad blockers um

00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:04,960
so that just shows you that yes

00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,600
people are ready for a change in the

00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,640
system

00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:11,840
and i believe that some

00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:15,760
a new model would definitely be able to

00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:20,320
uh go mainstream if when it's introduced

00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:24,399
so especially with what monetization um

00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:27,120
so let's see

00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:28,559
i lost my train of thought when i was

00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:32,720
getting ready to

00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:34,000
ask you um i was just thinking about

00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,120
what you said about you know that

00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,200
censorship thing

00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,960
and um you know there's been the i don't

00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,640
know if you have similar debates in the

00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:42,000
states at the moment but here in the uk

00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:45,519
there's this huge debate

00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:48,159
around um you know whether advertisers

00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:50,880
should be should have a say in what

00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:52,720
happens on news channels in particular

00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,840
because we have a new um a new news

00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,039
channel that's going to be started up

00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:57,760
into being billed as being like

00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:59,600
fox and there's a big um one of the

00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:02,240
campaign groups over here has

00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:03,360
has tried to raise awareness so there's

00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:05,519
a big debate

00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,799
um you know i have well-formed opinions

00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:10,080
on on that but

00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:11,519
we have this this kind of concern that

00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:13,120
um you know kind of risk-averse

00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:15,760
advertisers could be

00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:17,279
um influencing editorial kind of policy

00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:19,200
in some way

00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:21,120
and like what you said around censorship

00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:24,159
like the last thing that i want is for

00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,880
risk-averse advertisers to be you know

00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:26,480
kind of

00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,080
censoring the voices out there and i

00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,519
think that's a really massive just you

00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,640
know that's a massive discussion and

00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:32,640
that's why

00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:34,960
as well as reforming advertising we need

00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:37,200
this we need something new

00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,799
to to kind of to change the funding the

00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,880
funding model of the internet

00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:42,000
um but that being said obviously you

00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,760
know i still feel that

00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,799
strongly that advertisers should never

00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:47,360
be funding hate speech and

00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:50,720
disinformation and that's a red line

00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:51,039
not at all and and i'm i'm going to put

00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,559
this

00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:54,320
out there harry i don't know how you

00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:54,720
feel about this i believe if you had

00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,200
less

00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,559
advertisement for me i would spend less

00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,279
money as well

00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:02,880
because if i see something you know on

00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:05,039
the side like oh this catches my

00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:07,120
attention and it takes away from what i

00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:10,799
was doing as well so

00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:14,240
um yeah i i just think it's crazy

00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:17,679
so um one thing i wanted to talk about

00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:20,000
was how easy it is to engage

00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:21,519
with a web monetization implement the

00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,840
tech on a site

00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:26,080
so a lot of people like you said i'm not

00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:29,200
really technical how do i do this as

00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:29,919
as you know a blogger but it the way

00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,320
that

00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:33,840
coil makes it it's really easy all you

00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:37,279
have to do is go on

00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:39,919
and embed a code into your site

00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:41,519
and for me as a consumer all you have to

00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:43,840
do is go in and

00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:45,679
put in your like credit card information

00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:47,519
for five dollars a month you don't even

00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:48,640
have to use like both your first and

00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:50,559
last name

00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,480
so it makes it really easy makes it

00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:56,320
really private and

00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:58,000
you get a really seamless

00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:59,360
experience when you're going on a site

00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:03,039
so if you

00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:06,320
install coil the coil extension

00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:08,240
any site that is also on coil

00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:10,000
it just automatically will start

00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:11,040
streaming the payments based on how long

00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,520
you're on the site so

00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,879
it's a really seamless um and easy way

00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:18,399
to

00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:18,399
start using web monetization

00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,919
that's that's really great i mean i

00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:24,800
think

00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:26,320
so with this i mean i think the the

00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,399
technology the interface

00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,520
it's just it makes a lot of it makes so

00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:31,520
much sense

00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:33,119
and it feels like that's that's me

00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:35,040
making a choice around

00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:36,320
um you know ensure again you know kind

00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:39,280
of making sure that

00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:41,359
the creators that i love get the get get

00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:43,599
what they need from it

00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:44,639
um what's been your what's been your

00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:47,440
journey through this

00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:48,639
um through this topic um have you um you

00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,839
know kind of how have you how have you

00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:52,879
got here from

00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:54,320
from previous work um how have i got

00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:57,359
here from previous work

00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:59,680
so and all of the work that i've done

00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:00,400
like i said it's really important for me

00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,720
to be

00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,680
involved in something that i care about

00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,680
um just

00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:08,000
working for just a large corporation

00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:09,119
that me and my personality it just

00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,800
wouldn't work

00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:16,480
and so when i was introduced to

00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:19,040
interledger um i didn't know what it was

00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:20,079
and so i had to go and do a lot of

00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:22,400
research about

00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:24,560
what exactly is this and how is it

00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,960
helpful and the more i saw it i was like

00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,760
this

00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:28,640
this just makes sense this really uh

00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:31,520
makes sense

00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:32,079
and why isn't everyone like on board

00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:35,119
with this

00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:36,880
and i'm very passionate about it to the

00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:38,720
point where like i don't even care if

00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,359
i'm working with the organization i

00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:42,560
still

00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:44,079
want to be able to let people know about

00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:46,160
it everyone that i tell about

00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:48,000
web monetization and interledger and how

00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,800
it works with the open payments they're

00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,560
like okay

00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,839
this is great why haven't i heard about

00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:54,720
it um

00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:55,280
so that that's really my journey and how

00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:59,200
i

00:35:55,280 --> 00:36:01,599
came involved with it um

00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:03,280
so what about you and and can how did

00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:05,200
you become involved with can

00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:08,160
and um with the work that you're doing

00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:11,040
right now around the climate

00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:12,560
yeah yeah i'm not supposed to i was

00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,839
never supposed to work in advertising i

00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,800
always wanted to work in kind of climate

00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:16,720
change

00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:18,800
kind of campaigning and communications

00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:20,480
and the way that um

00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,520
what started happening was i started

00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,480
working on more and more digital

00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:26,079
campaigns

00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:27,680
and i started to see um we started to

00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:30,960
just hit walls basically

00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:34,079
so either we um you know actually

00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:36,720
money talks online so if i've got

00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:38,640
a ten a ten thousand pound media budget

00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:40,400
i can reach certain people if i've got

00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:42,320
a million million-pound media budget i

00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,920
can reach a lot of people

00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:46,720
and unfortunately when you look at the

00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:48,640
money going into some of these systems

00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:50,480
you can see that there's a lot of money

00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:52,800
um kind of going into some of the

00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,520
denial spaces so i got more and more

00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,280
interested

00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,560
in um you know technology and the

00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,119
structure of

00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:00,560
the internet and how um you know and how

00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:03,839
that works

00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:06,640
um and from a you know from a kind of

00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:07,440
um from that perspective as well and

00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:10,640
there are

00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:14,079
dark ways you can use advertising um to

00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:15,040
divert conversations to disrupt um and

00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:17,920
all sorts of stuff

00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:19,200
so actually i came to cam through that

00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:22,560
slightly odd journey

00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:24,160
and having worked in branding and

00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,680
by proxy advertising from a kind of

00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:28,160
content perspective

00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:29,440
um and got really interested and ended

00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:31,599
up doing the mozilla fellowship

00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:33,200
so it was it was that that route when i

00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:35,440
started to kind of actually

00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,720
be impacted by some of the monetized

00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:39,520
disinformation online

00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:41,040
will be impacted by some of the the the

00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:44,079
fallout from some of these

00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:45,200
um from some of these issues um

00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:48,160
and i think what makes me super

00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:50,800
passionate about about about can is that

00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:52,800
if we can if we can divert a little bit

00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:56,560
of 330 billion dollars

00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:58,560
to something better to organizations to

00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:01,680
creators to journalists

00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:02,160
to uh you know just great the great

00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,920
stuff

00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:06,000
that is on the internet if we can just

00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:09,440
divert a bit of that money

00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,800
um then i you know i will be happy

00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,480
and i think that we will have a much

00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,079
healthier internet

00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,920
and like i said i don't think it's going

00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:16,400
to fix all the problems i think that we

00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,240
have to

00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:20,079
reform the old and we have to build the

00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:22,720
new at the same time

00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:24,000
um and but if we do that the interim

00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,640
internet is going to be a healthier

00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,400
place

00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:28,640
and a more inclusive place and a more

00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,640
accessible place um

00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:32,880
yeah and thinking and thinking about

00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:34,880
that like how you know how is

00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:36,560
um intellectual kind of working towards

00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:40,160
building a more inclusive

00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:43,119
web yeah so

00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:44,160
um one of the ways that interledger is

00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:47,200
working to

00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:49,280
spread the word of web monetization um

00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,240
we created a program called grant for

00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:53,040
the web

00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:54,400
which is giving away a hundred million

00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:57,359
dollars in grant funds

00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:58,320
to to build start building on web

00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:01,520
monetization

00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:03,280
start building on creating more users in

00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:08,240
this ecosystem

00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:11,920
and part of that is we look at

00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:15,920
the space and how can we reach people

00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:17,920
who typically are left outside because

00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:20,240
sometimes it's hard to find a lot of

00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:23,040
diversity especially in tech

00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:24,800
um and so that is something that we're

00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,839
very very focused on especially this

00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,960
year

00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:30,720
um and we have given

00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:32,480
money away to some some really great

00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:36,320
projects just recently

00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:38,000
um the idga foundation we

00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:40,480
partnered with them to create the

00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:44,160
diverse game developers fund

00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:45,839
where it's giving away uh 500 000

00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:47,440
to game developers and students

00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:50,720
worldwide

00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:54,160
um another one is um

00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:57,280
ushahidi and that is web minus design

00:39:54,160 --> 00:40:00,560
web monetizing um deployments

00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:03,280
on a crowdsourcing platform so

00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:04,640
in kenya that's been used for like

00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:07,520
crisis response

00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:09,680
human rights protections um so we're

00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:12,560
really trying to get into

00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:13,920
areas that have been previously

00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:16,560
marginalized

00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:19,200
and so try to get people in the

00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:23,440
ecosystem who

00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:26,480
have not been able to participate before

00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:30,400
um so speaking of that how you're saying

00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:33,200
advertising advertisers are conservative

00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,680
um how are you working with them to be

00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:38,240
more

00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:41,839
inclusive in the work that they're doing

00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:43,520
so from a funding perspective um what we

00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:46,160
what we kind of advocate is having

00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:48,400
things like we call them inclusion lists

00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:49,599
so there is if you think about the

00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,359
internet like there

00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:53,599
there is there's gardens there's your

00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:54,720
you know your googles and your facebooks

00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:57,680
and then there's the open

00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:59,119
the open web is huge and most people

00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,839
spend a lot of their time in the wall

00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:01,359
gardens

00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:02,960
they you know they log on to twitter or

00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:04,319
to facebook or to youtube when they use

00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,720
the web

00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:08,560
but the open web is huge um and there

00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:09,520
are fantastic sites on there there's you

00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,280
know

00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,720
the new york times is on there there's

00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:16,000
you know kind of there's all sorts of

00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:19,040
brilliant stuff but there is a lot of

00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:21,119
rubbish on there as well and um i think

00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:23,119
a lot of

00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:25,119
a lot a lot of what we we ask

00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:25,680
organizations to do is to really think

00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:27,359
about

00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:29,520
carefully about the open web and say

00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:33,119
well what do we actually want to fund

00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:35,280
what and add those to inclusion lists so

00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:36,640
that um and those inclusions are helpful

00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,200
as well because we've talked about block

00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:39,920
listing

00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:40,640
if you've got a blanket word like um you

00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,839
know like

00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:43,920
lesbian was one of the ones that was

00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:45,680
most most frequently used um

00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:47,359
you know in a study that vice did a

00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:50,319
couple of years ago

00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:50,800
um then those inclusion lists help get

00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:52,400
around

00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,000
that problem because you can then say

00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,560
okay well well this is this is good

00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,480
quality

00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:58,480
and you know lgbtq plus media for

00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:01,520
example we can add those

00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:02,079
so and there's our members we've got an

00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,240
organization

00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:06,240
called brand advance whose whole reason

00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,960
of being is to help advertising money

00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,520
reach

00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:11,119
community media and so we work with

00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:13,520
organizations like that

00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:14,240
to really raise awareness and to and

00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,800
point them to

00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,839
the right you know the right solutions

00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:20,000
um

00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:20,880
in terms of um in terms of diversity and

00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,880
inclusion

00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:24,560
we look at um we look at diversity

00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,200
including as i said in the media span

00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:28,240
but also

00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:31,440
in the organization itself because

00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:35,520
um you know diverse

00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:38,480
creatives create better work um

00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,880
and it's you know and and you and it's

00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,400
just

00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,480
much better for the quality of the

00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:45,280
advertising for the entire world

00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,920
basically and so again we work with

00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:48,160
partners

00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:49,680
who focus on diversity and inclusion we

00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:52,960
work with an organization called

00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:55,200
advertising who do a lot around lgbtq

00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:56,640
plus representation in advertising we

00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:58,000
work with an organization called

00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:00,720
creative equals

00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,280
who offer training who um conduct

00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,760
research

00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:06,000
were brilliant in this space so we try

00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:07,040
and be as partner oriented as possible

00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,119
because

00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:10,400
i don't know if you've ever sat on an in

00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:12,960
on an ad tech talk

00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:15,040
but there are so many acronyms there is

00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:18,000
so it's such a complicated technical

00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:19,119
area and like nobody can understand all

00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,119
of it

00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:22,720
that was that was a big that was a big

00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:24,880
learning when i when i started

00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:26,000
in the space of just being able to go i

00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:29,040
have no idea what they're talking

00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,040
about and that is okay

00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:33,440
um but we do realize that you know

00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:36,319
actually we're stronger as a coalition

00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:37,119
so we always make sure our membership is

00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:39,760
um

00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:41,680
partially advertised as party agencies

00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,079
but lots of civil society members as

00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:45,520
well

00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:47,200
to hold us to account so for example we

00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:48,400
have our hate speech manifesto was

00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:51,520
written by

00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:54,400
a conglomerate of advertisers

00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:55,839
agencies anti-hate charities um

00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:58,800
organizations that represent

00:43:55,839 --> 00:44:00,800
affected communities like the works and

00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:02,960
because we believe that if you get the

00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:05,119
right people around the table

00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:06,000
you have better problem definition and

00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:09,599
better you know

00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:11,520
solutions can be created and

00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:12,960
from you know from my perspective if

00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:14,800
you've got advertisers

00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:16,000
talking to advertisers about a problem

00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,240
that affects me

00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,440
i kind of want to be in on that

00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:22,960
conversation exactly

00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:23,680
exactly um this is it's really great

00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:26,240
work that

00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:28,160
you're doing harriet and i'm so i'm so

00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,880
glad that you've taken the time to talk

00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,880
with me

00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:32,640
um not just today but the other day

00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:34,000
about what the work that you're doing

00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:36,880
and i think that

00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,920
um with us all working together to try

00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:40,160
to solve this issue

00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:41,839
that soon we should have a viable

00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:46,000
solution to

00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:48,319
um that we face today so

00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,839
i totally agree rihanna it's been so

00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:50,720
good it's been so good to talk to you

00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:52,640
about all of this

00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:54,160
and to think through like these

00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,880
different positions i just think we're

00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:56,960
gonna

00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:58,160
if there is a big movement behind this

00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,520
and i think that with this

00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:01,359
with all the stuff that you're doing

00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:04,079
interledger it's going to things are

00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:19,839
going to change

00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:19,839
thank you i think that's it

00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,640
