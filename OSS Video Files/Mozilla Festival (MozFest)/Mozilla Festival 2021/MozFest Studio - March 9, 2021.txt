this is the place where you can hang out

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,959

um so how do you check it out well you

00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,599
go to the mosfest plaza

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,400
and click on social on the left side of

00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,560
the page

00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,519
then you scroll down to common spaces

00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,440
and click on

00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,599
let's hang out then you just create your

00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,239
avatar and the party can begin

00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,800
so make sure you do that moving on to

00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,599
something

00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,560
very exciting we've got a little present

00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:47,599
for you

00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,160
yeah um if you want to celebrate in

00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,800
style

00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,840
by adding uh some mosfest flair to your

00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,920
zoom background

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,840
we've created a few cool looking

00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,680
backgrounds which you can download and

00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:01,680
customize the way you like it

00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:04,800
so for me it would look something like

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,599
this nicer so

00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,000
um yeah uh if you'd like that it's

00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:12,320
available through

00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:16,080
musel.la backgrounds

00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:17,840
[Music]

00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,920
so i'm sure you would like to know what

00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,480
happened since we saw you last

00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,319
so let me highlight one of the many

00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,040
sessions that happened in the last few

00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,920
hours

00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,760
the mozilla session add transparency and

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,000
access for researchers

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,000
what are platforms hiding brought

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,319
together those interested in discussing

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,400
how

00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,519
online advertisements can be made more

00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,000
transparent

00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:42,000
um and now in the zoom call we have

00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,480
backgrounds looking very

00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:05,680
very sharp today um can you say

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,680
uh for me one time intelligently

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:14,879
intellectually nice very nice

00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,879
and you

00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:22,240
[Music]

00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:24,000
very nicely done hey um pip you guided

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,000
your participants through the creation

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
and recording of a new story using

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,320
prompts and frames in the ai

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,440
wellness space were you pleased with the

00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,639
story endings that

00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,639
came out of your session

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,560
definitely it's always really exciting

00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,240
to

00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,560
lead a collaborative digital

00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,479
storytelling um session

00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,120
and it was really interesting to see

00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,960
what ideas people had at one point we

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,759
came up with the idea of an ai

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:54,160
president so it was really useful to to

00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:57,680
increase those ideas using we use things

00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:00,479
like story cubes and visual metaphors

00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,800
and multimodal prompts and we also used

00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:05,759
a really interesting ai tool called

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,400
the ai nice yeah because i've read that

00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,560
the main

00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,520
the main character in the story is an ai

00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,680
character

00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,800
so could you tell us a little bit like

00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,600
what is its name

00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,639
what happens with it or or should we for

00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,800
that have to join the session

00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,320
oh no no definitely you can um you can

00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,960
contribute outside in

00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,160
a single so the main character was

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,759
called pendra

00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,199
and i actually borrowed the main

00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,320
character idea from

00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:36,000
brave new world and pindra was an ai

00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:39,759
system that uh led a dystopian society

00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,080
and so we kind of um talked about uh

00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,440
her world and what she did and what she

00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,080
did for work and

00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,160
how what what what a home was like and

00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,759
what work was like in the year 3000 so

00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,240
it was really exciting to kind of

00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:54,639
ideate and iterate together to kind of

00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,120
build this world of an ai character and

00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,639
what

00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,960
what kind of rights she had it was

00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,800
really exciting yeah yeah it sounds like

00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,759
it's a good basis for interesting

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,960
stories

00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:06,960
um fernanda you talked with your

00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,680
participants about creativity in the

00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:12,160
brain in the neurodiversity space

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,600
um neuroscience sounds a bit like a

00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,919
complicated topic

00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,000
were the participants able to demystify

00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:21,520
uh brain science in the session today

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,440
because that was one of the goals

00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,360
yeah well i hope they did we would have

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,800
to ask participants i think that

00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,520
there was a lot of engagement the

00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:32,240
discussion became very interesting

00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:34,000
i was uh very glad to see like very

00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,960
diverse faces we i

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,720
even had like uh three girls that i

00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:42,160
think they were around 10 years old

00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,520
wow joining us from nepal so i i was

00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,000
kind of nervous because

00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,600
i i i do science communication but

00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,080
sometimes i would use terms you know

00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,000
like

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,199
cognitive neuroscience and like what

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,080
does a 10 year old know

00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,800
10 year old but i mean we tried to go

00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,560
back

00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,680
to the basics you know explain what is

00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,759
neuroscience what is it that

00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,440
neuroscientists do

00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,520
and and like everything like what's a

00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:06,160
neuron it's a cell and it has

00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,199
wires and biological wires connects to

00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,759
other neurons so

00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,479
i think that at least they they learned

00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,880
something

00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:14,160
and and they were excited about it

00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,800
because they were asking a lot of

00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,599
questions

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,400
and engaging a lot in the discussion so

00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,759
nice

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,440
well it sounds like it sounds like it

00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:24,000
was great and pip

00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,199
do you think ai could learn to be as

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,400
creative as

00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,400
the human brain can be

00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,560
oh that's a very difficult question well

00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,880
if picasso

00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,880
programmed a robot perhaps would get a

00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,599
very creative result

00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,520
yeah but so it's possible right but it's

00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,120
not something that ai is doing right now

00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:46,720
or is it already uh

00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:50,000
in the trenches i think we are doing

00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,800
um it depends how we define creativity

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,520
isn't it

00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,960
if creativity is something original can

00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,479
ai

00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,000
simply just repeat something that's

00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,080
already been created all create

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,319
something new it depends how we sort of

00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,879
define creativity and how we understand

00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,919
it

00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:07,440
naturally um

00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,039
what do you think about that is it

00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,840
something that you think

00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:13,919
the robots can can beat us on or are the

00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:16,240
humans the most creative

00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:18,720
well that's definitely a very polemic

00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:21,520
question uh as pip said sometimes

00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,960
some of the characteristics that we

00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:26,080
attribute to algorithms

00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:27,840
come like algorithms in the ai actually

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,479
come from the people that program them

00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,720
right

00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,399
uh so far we have some examples i have

00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,399
uh approached this kind of like

00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,279
creativity algorithm like kind of like

00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:39,519
the deep dream

00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:40,959
uh google algorithm where you like uh

00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,800
input the picture and using

00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,240
convolutional neural networks it goes

00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,399
through it and kind of projects some

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,360
images on top and it kind of looks like

00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,600
uh

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,959
like kind of uh hallucinogenic art you

00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,760
know like psychedelic art

00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:55,360
nice so it's happening already yeah i

00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,000
think that's been done by google since a

00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,279
couple

00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,120
couple years but there's a whole

00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:01,040
philosophical discussion of if that's

00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,800
really creative or it's just you know

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,120
repeating patterns that can be like

00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,200
aesthetically pleasing or aesthetically

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,880
interesting so as peeps said it depends

00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,920
a lot on how we

00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,519
define creativity nice well i think it's

00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,600
very interesting i could talk with you

00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,360
uh for hours about this but uh that's

00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,040
our time we have now

00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,360

00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,839
