Publication date: 2021-03-11
Playlist: Mozilla Festival 2021
Description: 
	The objective is to get people of different ages and regional and thematic backgrounds to deliberate on strategies for digital sustainability that take into account that the Internet affects our environment, our societies, our economies, and governance structures. All of these aspects interlink in order to be more digitally sustainable going forward. The basis of this exchange is going to be the recently drafted Youth4DigitalSustainability Recommendations (https://yigf.de/news/12-youth-recommendations-for-a-sustainable-internet/), that were developed by young experts from all world regions and presented to the Internet Governance Forum. In the methodologies of “guerilla writing” and open deliberative exchange, the workshop participants will be asked to share their perspectives on the recommendations, and together define points of action and concrete advocacy. The session will be based on speech and collaborative writing so that people with different abilities and different communication styles can actively contribute.
