00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,159
from the common space in spatial chat i

00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,759
move my way back here to the studio

00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,640
where i'm going to hang out with you

00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,880
guys

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,000
um can you believe that it's already the

00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,159
fifth day of

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,400
most fest time flies when you're having

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,119
fun um so with the weekend around the

00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,960
corner

00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:44,320
what better way to start it off than

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,840
with a

00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:50,159
bitter ball say what bitter ball yes

00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,840
it's a delicious dutch snack usually

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,600
made out of meat although the vegan

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,000
version is also amazing

00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,240
and um it's a favorite among duchies

00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,880
whenever we have something to celebrate

00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,840
therefore the dutch word of the day is

00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:06,840
bitter ball

00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:09,840
say it loud and proud people bitter ball

00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,840
go

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,640
first things first updates uh with the

00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,480
weekend coming up it's time to relax

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,959
so a bitter ball can help with that for

00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,120
sure but what better way to wind down

00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,360

[Music]

00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,120
yeah we have been seeing each other for

00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,879
over a couple of days now

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,959
and i really feel like i've been getting

00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,720
to know the mosfest community

00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,080
but to get to know each other even

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,319
better we have invited

00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,120
julia ruxo from germany who is a

00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:38,959
facilitator in the space neurodiversity

00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,720
and yesterday she had her session which

00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:44,159
was called drawing time

00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:46,640
and attention welcome julia

00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:48,319
lovely to see you here on the show um

00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,239
yeah in your workshop you discuss the

00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:52,000
attention economy and challenge the

00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,680
metrics of time spent

00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,840
firstly i would like to ask you what is

00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:59,280
the problem with using metric time to

00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,920
define our attention spans

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,920
hi so the problem with time spent is

00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,120
that doesn't really tell us much about

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,360
how we experienced

00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,879
it's an activity whether it depleted us

00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,920
or it energized us

00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:13,599
how long did that time feel and

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,200
it really turns harmful when we are

00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:17,919
trying to maximize time

00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,680
spent because if we elongate an

00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:21,919
experience that really costs

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,720
the depth of it and then we cannot

00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:27,600
attend to it fully

00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,639
and if we do this repeatedly over time

00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,800
that will

00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:33,199
show in our attentional capacity and

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,199
since we experience our entire life

00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,639
through our attentional capacities that

00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,960
will affect our

00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,000
life experience our emotions perceptions

00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,320
memories

00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,320
yeah no i get it that sounds very

00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,560
logical and you wanted to create an

00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,600
alternative for visualizing attention

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:52,880
what does that alternative look like

00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:55,199
so it's a very simple hand-drawn uh

00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,360
thing there's a diagram to guide you so

00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,120
the lines connect the object and the

00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,720
subject of attention

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,800
so if you're deeply focused there are

00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,720
more lines if you are calling these

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,240
lines are straight if you're excited or

00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,199
anxious and there are huge waves and

00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,039
spikes

00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,360
if you need a lot of self-control to

00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,320
keep it up then the corners are sharp

00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,120
and

00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,160
if it's effortless and it's all wavy and

00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,000
bubbly

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,280
it's much simpler than it sounds it's up

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,680
on my website as well

00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,600
yeah that's so cool i like right away

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,120
see it in front of me so it's already

00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,039
very visual

00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,720
and at some point in your session the

00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,080
participants had to visualize their

00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,960
mental states

00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,560
what kind of drawings came out of that

00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,800
amazing ones so

00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,720
the participants thought about yeah

00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,960
great ways to visualize their

00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,320
attentional states or how their mental

00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,320
energy

00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,600
moves when they are trying to focus so

00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,840
some drew it across

00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,320
a space so in one moment some jewish

00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,680
across time like one day

00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,520
but yeah they were all clear and

00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,400
understandable there was also one where

00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,280
it was one

00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,240
circular day so it shows that what could

00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,039
that mean

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,680
very interesting hey and julia you argue

00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,680
that

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,160
our attentional capacities are not

00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:10,000
linear so what are some activities that

00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:13,360
could increase our mental energy

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
so that's really an individual approach

00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,080
so

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,440
generally speaking anything that really

00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:21,120
keeps you active

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:23,280
and you enjoy it so what works for you

00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,639
focus on one thing at a time

00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:28,720
that also helps because then you don't

00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,000
have to waste your energy on keeping out

00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,039
distractions

00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,440
or if that there's no tension in your

00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:38,560
mind between competing goals that you

00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,919
are doing what you want to be doing yeah

00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,759
okay well thank you so much for

00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,720
informing us julia let's hope that this

00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,440
way of measuring

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,840
will become the norm in the future um

00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,840
and enjoy the rest of your mos

00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:52,639

passing through using the hashtag

00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,160
musfest

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,240
on twitter and on slack unfortunately we

00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,599
cannot go through all of them right now

00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:25,759
but here are some highlights

00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:27,360
ines for example is very happy about

00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,599
mozfest she said that

00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,759
here in case organic talk on the future

00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,080
of micropayments was very enlightening

00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,840
so

00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,720
good to hear that ines and elena is

00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,319

00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,080
for the thoughtful session that she had

00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:43,440
about changing government

00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:45,840
technologies then we have

00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,160
educating people on the process of web

00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,000
monetizations

00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,160
it seems like it would take forever but

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,560
she did it in one night so nice job

00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,560
phoebe

00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,720
and the modified community does not only

00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,440
consist of humans

00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,759
but cat fiasco also had a very fun day

00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,280
with her owner miso 411

00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,680
while attending mosfest in the

00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,240
communication channels so congrats on

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,000
your

00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:28,000
mosfest debuted fiasco

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,680
yeah and keep posting guys because we

00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,479
love seeing your comments and your

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,120
pictures pop

00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,959
up show us where you are working from

00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,599
perhaps post a selfie while you're

00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:38,640
watching

00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,760
mosfest studio um and you might see

00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,080
yourself in the

00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,919
monday's episode of mosfest studio and

00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,290
don't forget to use the hashtag

00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:49,360
mossfest

00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:51,600
[Music]

00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,120
now when it comes to sensors the things

00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,519
that come to my mind are

00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,640
doors opening automatically or turning

00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,959
green

00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,800
yellow and orange of traffic lights and

00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,640
of course there are many more situations

00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,959
where sensors play a huge part

00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,839
and that is why in this most fast logo

00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,760
we speak with

00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,880
kun berkman who talks about the

00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,839
interactive

00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:23,839
exhibition census of amsterdam on how

00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:23,839
sensors make amsterdam a smarter city

00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:32,560
in a world full of technology this is

00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,480
becoming the new future

00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,720
everything is being tracked in order to

00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,600
make life more safe and easier for

00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,080
citizens

00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,640
but what exactly is this data being used

00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,880
for

00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,160
the municipality of amsterdam wants to

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,440
show us

00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,519
why was it important for the

00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,480
municipality of amsterdam to host this

00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,399
exhibition

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,920
there's a constant development in the

00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,720
city of amsterdam of

00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:56,320
more sensors and more data collection in

00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,760
public space

00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:02,720
and as the city we are

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,600
working on digital rights privacy all

00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,480
this kind of thing

00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,440
so there's this combining tension

00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,880
between these

00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:13,200
developments and with this exhibition uh

00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:15,200
because it's a really complex subject

00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,560
and there's all these kind of factors

00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,720
we wanted to create something that's

00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,839
easy to understand for the average

00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,079
amsterdammer

00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,440
to understand what are we trying to

00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:28,240
sense in the city

00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,200
what kind of data we're collecting what

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,120
the goal is

00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,560
can the citizens give their opinion

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,640
about what the

00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,560
municipality is doing and what is being

00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,839
done with that information

00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:42,320
uh sure sure we we try to be as

00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,839
open as possible in in our development

00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,640
and especially when we're

00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:48,880
designing new solutions we try to do

00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:51,360
this with the citizens

00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,720
so we try to invite them in in design

00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,760
sessions but also

00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:58,320
we do interviews and

00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,959
talk with people on what they think on

00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,000
sensing

00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:03,680
and and the privacy issues involved

00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,200
and what kind of things they want to

00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,000
measure for for a

00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,760
more livable city but we're always open

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,279
for suggestions and

00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,959
and ideas of people so what are these

00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,720
devices used for

00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:18,399
this thing is is developed by the

00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,279
sensemakers which is a

00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,880
citizen collective of volunteers they

00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:26,399
developed a sensor

00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:28,240
which they could measure water quality

00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,480
what you could see over here what kind

00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,010
of different sensors you can all

00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,419
uh come across

00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:35,419
[Music]

00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,120
and you are a citizen of amsterdam

00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,519
yourself

00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,680
so what is your personal opinion about

00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:46,320
how we're being surveilled in this city

00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,839
i think amsterdam is is if you compare

00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,800
to other cities

00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:52,079
is is one of the front runners at least

00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,720
in this discussion

00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:56,160
but we could still better ourselves so

00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,240
give ourselves the

00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,760
the goals to look at the alternatives

00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,760
and look at

00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,880
different ways of measuring what we want

00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:06,240
to measure without

00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:07,760
invading people's privacy

00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,519
if you're ever finding yourself in

00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,399
amsterdam make sure you check out the

00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,639
exhibition

00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,399
and coming monday kun will be one of the

00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,639
facilitators of the session

00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,320
responsible sensing lab so look out for

00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:24,959
that one on the mosfet schedule

00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:26,639
it starts at 2 30 pm

00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,399
and if you're having some difficult

00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,560
difficulties with finding the time

00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,680
in between your sessions to look for new

00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,079
ones to attend

00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,519
we're here to help you with that um and

00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:37,600

what are the creative ai gems from the

00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,279
arts and media section

00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:09,920
that we absolutely have to check out

00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,920
this weekend

00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,800
sure yeah we're really excited about all

00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,639
the

00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,320
all the artworks that we have as part of

00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,920
creative ai

00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,880
there's two things that i really want to

00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:25,440
highlight um one is called latent riot

00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,279
by the moving target collective and this

00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:30,639
is a super interesting piece which

00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:32,720
um is not only using ai but it's also

00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,880
critically reflecting on ai

00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,800
and the way that we generally talk and

00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,720
discuss ai

00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:41,440
and it has trained an artificial neural

00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:44,480
network based on an archive of protest

00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,839
placards um to kind of like give see

00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,600
what what does an ai

00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,120
voice look like in the industry that is

00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,360
so cool

00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,959
nice and um yeah douglas any

00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,800
recommendation from you

00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:56,560
well tonight as a matter of fact uh

00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,560
there's going to be a session

00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,920
where the artist blair simmons talks

00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:03,199
about

00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:04,560
the work uh called print dialogue and

00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:06,800
print dialogue is really funny because

00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:10,000
what it does is it uses ai

00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,959
to generate short plays and the plays

00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,839
come back

00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:15,120
often really absurd really often really

00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,720
funny as well

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,560
i'm just reading one right now and it

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,880
says you should be eating

00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:22,480
buying a hamburger eating it should i

00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:25,519
consider buying a hamburger

00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:29,040
and can i have a heart attack please

00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:31,199
wow that's amazing okay um and

00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,800
uh yeah i was also browsing the arts and

00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:36,160
media section and i saw one

00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:38,639
called weather journals what is this one

00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,320
about well people love to talk about the

00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,959
weather and so what you do with weather

00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,600
journals

00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:44,560
is that you describe the weather where

00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,639
you are

00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,320
and then it adds that to a model and

00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,160
then it generates

00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,519
text based on what everybody else has

00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,240
put in and then

00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:55,199
uh generates that for you and so you get

00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,440
to see

00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,240
uh often some really random again really

00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,519
random things

00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:04,240
but uh it's just an indicator of

00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:05,839
where uh these types of systems are with

00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,399
understanding language

00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,680
and then doing something with it nice

00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,959
well thank you guys so much for your

00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,959
recommendations

00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:14,560
um yeah and be sure to check out these

00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:16,639
recommendations because these guys

00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,720
really know what they're talking about

00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,480
nice to see you thanks for coming on the

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,519
show
