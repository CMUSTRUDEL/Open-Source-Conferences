and i'm also your host for today's panel

00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,880
on open source and the pandemic

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,720
so we have a vital discussion plan for

00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,520
today as part of our mozilla

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,039
dialogue and debate series at mozfest

00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,760
are we going to unpack the intersection

00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,439
of the ongoing pandemic and open source

00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,760
and discuss how open source technology

00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,199
and principles have been a potent force

00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,160
in slowing the spread of this deadly

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,920
virus

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,360
so i'm really excited to introduce you

so we're taking them real time you can

00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,200
tweet them at mozilla with the hashtag

00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,640
dialogues and debates

00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,319

00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,879
screen so please ask us all your

00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,319
questions

00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:20,720
we'd love to hear them so let's

00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,560
dive right in so to start off i'd love

00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,800
to hear from each of you

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,879
just to describe how openness has been a

00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:30,000
part of your work this past year

00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,480
so starting with melissa how has open

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,160
source

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,760
helped you facilitate collaboration and

00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,519
combat misinformation during the

00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,560
pandemic

00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,120
thank you very much abigail so um i've

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,440
been

00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,239
you know really honored and pleased to

00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,000
really

00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,239
you know help coordinate a very large

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,200
community over of over 2000 people

00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,080
working together

00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,879
on health data in the united states and

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,920
one of the

00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:55,280
one of the great um kind of incentives i

00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,760
think in that context

00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,640
is that people are able to bring their

00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,400
own

00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,080
expertise and resources that they've

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,360
developed in the open source community

00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,440
together

00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,599
to sort of be a best-of-breed approach

00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:11,040
to analyzing those data so everything

00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,840
from knowledge artifacts to to code

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,840
workbooks

00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:17,280
to method you know ai methodologies

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,200
really kind of bringing those together

00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,280
with clinical experts who have the deep

00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,959
questions around how do we combat covet

00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,920
and help realize better care for

00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,400
patients

00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,080
um and so that that it's it's been a

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,840
very interesting um

00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,239
process uh in terms of really

00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,720
incentivized

00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,560
that sharing but also in the context of

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,280
public-private partnerships that really

00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,400
actually help

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,080
foster those types of sharing and so

00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,760
with the really sophisticated

00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,760
technologies that we've been able to

00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,760
leverage from the commercial side

00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,120
we've actually been able to foster more

00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,560
open science by having those

00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,599
public-private partnerships and so i

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,680
think that's been

00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,360
one of the biggest realizations for me

00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,959
during this time is that

00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,319
um that it really does take a village

00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,000
and it takes a village from all

00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,920
different kinds of sectors in order to

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,760
actually realize the goals of open

00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:07,200
science in such an expedient

00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,560
manner thank you so much melissa and

00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,480
that's amazing to hear

00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,239
how openness has really enabled that

00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,200
bridge that public-private bridge that's

00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:18,560
often

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:18,560
difficult to to yeah connect

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,919
well and uh ricardo i'd love to hear

00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,639
from you about how openness has uh

00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:28,400
really helped you this past year thank

00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,040
you it'll begin um

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,880
i think not only this past year you know

00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,919
but

00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,280
house is becoming more and more a softer

00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:39,600
and a hardware problem

00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,880
because it needs more digitalization

00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,960
everything you know

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,880
and maybe we should stop building an

00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:48,240
economy around the knowledge

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,199
that can save lives so open healthcare

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,880
makes healthcare

00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,639
available for people in councils like

00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,520
government cannot provide that great

00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,720
skeptic

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,880
you know so there are now thousands of

00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,840
open source designs related to health

00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,160
and care

00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,880
from objects to create video labs to

00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,600
open source

00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,600
config 19 test teaches processes

00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,560
supporting equipment for daily life and

00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,720
so on

00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,080
so open source healthcare is also

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,800
important to develop

00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,120
a small business around its products you

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,960
know

00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,120
no matter if it's dealing with data or

00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,919
hardware or whatever you can create

00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,800
as a small business in these different

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:26,639
countries that i told

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,199
what i think is quite especially this

00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:32,320
open source movement in the design

00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,520
in the health fields that these

00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,880
designers and

00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:39,039
biologists physicists and makers

00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,240
everyone involved in this are pushing

00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:43,680
for changes in

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,440
patents for medicines and for vaccines

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,680
and trying to bring me for example just

00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,440
like uh melissa said bringing health

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,360
data sets together

00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,280
and trying to launch then with open

00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:57,280
knowledge licenses you know

00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:59,520
and even promoting uh the united nations

00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,960
declaration on the right to open health

00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,680
care you know so

00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:08,080
i think it's quite fundamental for how

00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:10,160
to get the open source move there

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,759
yeah i definitely agree with you ricardo

00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,160
um i'd also love to hear a bit more

00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,160
about

00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,400
caribbels i know um you were awarded the

00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,160
mozilla open source support

00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,440
award for this work can you tell me a

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:24,080
bit more about that

00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:26,240
yes for sure caribous is um

00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,160
it's a project we develop in geek in the

00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:32,639
global innovation gathering

00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:35,840
that is how we can contribute with open

00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:39,360
source solutions for disabilities

00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:42,960
people with disabilities you know and

00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,759
we have now around 10 or 12 labs around

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,120
the globe

00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:49,520
nepal italy canada brazil that

00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,440
are supporting their communities

00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,720
developing this open source

00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:56,479
products you know we have now two years

00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:01,440
of experimentation with this

00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:04,160
program and we could reach a

00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,360
huge access because a hand pandemic

00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,919
arrived it looked like

00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,759
we've been training for it you know and

00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:12,479
i need to drive it we had

00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,520
a lot of labs in hand a lot of products

00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:17,120
and ways of

00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:20,000
working with open source house products

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,160
and then mozilla gave us support for the

00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,319
brazilian community too

00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,840
and with the support of mozilla we could

00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,720
reach i think

00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:30,240
10 000 face shields to be distributed in

00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,039
indigenous community

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,160
and traditional communities around the

00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:37,280
country

00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:40,720
and also we created a model of

00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:42,639
an aerosol box that is something

00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,080
you can you should use it during the

00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,160
incubation process

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,319
and the extubation process of patients

00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:51,440
because they used to cough

00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:53,919
and then it spreads a lot of

00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,560
things around you know so it was a kind

00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:57,599
of

00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:00,879
question from a doctor that was leading

00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:04,479
uh uh kofi the new

00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:07,120
intensive healthcare unit and he asked

00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:08,639
us for it to develop this model because

00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,919
the model in taiwan

00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,360
that was available was not that good and

00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:15,919
it was open source as well

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,720
and we get from the model from taiwan

00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:19,919
and developed

00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,720
this new model with a curled way to see

00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,919
it and

00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:26,319
so it came from the

00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:28,319
the doctor asking for a solution and we

00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,720
said look we need a solution we're

00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,520
asking for mozilla and mozilla yes let's

00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,279
support it

00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:36,959
so it was quite interesting

00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,880
thanks ricardo that's so great to hear

00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:40,719
how you already had this system in place

00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,560
or the infrastructure in place

00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,399
and then you're able to take an existing

00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,760
model from taiwan that was open source

00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,160
and then make it better

00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,480
and use your infrastructure to just

00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:55,760
distribute it around brazil so it's

00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:57,519
a great open source story yes thank you

00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,279
and then uh finally neta i'd love to

00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:01,279
hear about uh open source and your work

00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:04,560
with wikipedia

00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,920
yeah um yeah for me uh openness it's

00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,240
it's a way of life

00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,360
and i try to share as much of the work i

00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,600
do openly

00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,200
because i believe that there is someone

00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,959
in some corner of the world

00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,480
who benefits from the knowledge that i

00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:18,320
share i don't know who that

00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,040
is but there is someone who always

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,720
benefits from it so it's not only

00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,959
the medical data that i share on the

00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,080
internet but also my paintings my code

00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:28,480
and everything else

00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,680
that i've created during my lifetime so

00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,560
that is why i said

00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:34,000
uh that openness for me is a way of life

00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:37,279
secondly i believe that

00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,720
being open is essential for making a

00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,880
collaborative pro

00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,480
a collaborative project successful so if

00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,040
you're running a collaborative

00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,160
project surrounding knowledge then you

00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,880
need to be open

00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,959
for bringing in more participation and

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,120
and developing on the project

00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:55,040
and i volunteer with wikipedia which is

00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,959
the world's largest encyclopedia

00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,880
and the biggest collaborative open

00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,760
knowledge project that humanity has ever

00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,760
built

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,760
so uh this work of building up an

00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,360
encyclopedia together with like millions

00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,640
of people around the world speaking

00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,560
different languages

00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,320
it sounds very exciting to me and this

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,000
is why i keep volunteering to do this

00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,519
work

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,279
and on the other hand i am also a

00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,800
medical doctor and

00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,560
right now i work in a primary care

00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,680
center where i see a lot of

00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:23,440
covet patients among other people and

00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,279
i am particularly worried about the

00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,640
misinformation that is circulating on

00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:29,839
the internet

00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:32,480
and i when so when the pandemic started

00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:34,560
in february march last year i was

00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:37,200
particularly mood on reading the story

00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,839
of an indian family who ate a poisonous

00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,000
fruit

00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,079
thinking that eating that might help

00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,720
them prevent being infected with kobe

00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,160
19.

00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,240
so they were misinformed from the

00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,160
internet and they followed that fake

00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,880
information and they became seriously

00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,120
sick

00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:53,040
so it really moved me and it i wanted to

00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,880
do something in my capacity to be able

00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:58,000
to counter the misinformation

00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,920
that is circulating on the internet and

00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,760
in my profession as a doctor it was

00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,120
being hard for me because my patients

00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,880
were confused about

00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,160
what kind of practices are evidence

00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,920
based and what are not

00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,440
and their people had their own ideas

00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,880
about what might prevent them from

00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,120
getting kobit 19

00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,720
and what other and if they are affected

00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,839
with covet 19 what kind of medicines

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,040
help them from

00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,240
like um uh cure cure them of the disease

00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,440
and so forth

00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:26,079
so uh so i wanted to to do something for

00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,800
their sake as well and thirdly we live

00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,320
in times

00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,920
where even the past president of the

00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,560
united states of america

00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,600
shared fake news related to the pandemic

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,640
and now people are

00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:39,120
losing trust in our institutions and

00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,160
um and another phenomenon that i see now

00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,399
is that

00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,160
truth is behind paywalls but lies are

00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,839
free so if you want to have

00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:49,040
like trustworthy information you have to

00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:51,920
pay for it but you can see lies all over

00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,920
so this paywall content that is only

00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,320
accessible for the privileged

00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,680
and i wanted to make as much truth

00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,680
accessible for people

00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:02,399
for free which is why i write on

00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:04,320
wikipedia particularly about kobe 19.

00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,920
and this possibility of sharing free

00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,560
knowledge with millions of people around

00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,360
the world

00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,000
in languages that they speak is very

00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,680
exciting

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,519
and which is why i started contributing

00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,639
to wikipedia 10 years ago and i

00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:19,519
keep doing that even today yeah

00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,399
thank you so much nathan that's uh i

00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,240
love that that

00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,079
well i don't love it but that idea that

00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,920
like the truth is behind paywalls but

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:27,920
lies are free and just thank you so much

00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,279
for working hard to get that information

00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,680
out there for us

00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:33,040
um yeah as widely as possible so thank

00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,839
you for all your hard work for the past

00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,600
decade

00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:39,760
and especially this past year thank you

00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,120
and i think that's a nice segue into um

00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,880
my next question

00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,160
uh with groups like caribels and

00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,839
wikipedia

00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,160
it's really inspirational to see all

00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,240
these giant communities mobilized to do

00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,800
whatever they can for the pandemic

00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,639
um so starting with ricardo how is it

00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,279
possible for volunteer contributors to

00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:57,120
accomplish

00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:59,760
more than these traditional closed

00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,760
institutions

00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:09,920
well i was muted but

00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:12,000
look from my perspective diversity

00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,680
amplifies knowledge

00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,519
you know so when you bring together

00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:18,720
patients doctors

00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:21,839
designers makers biologists whatever

00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,920
to work together for the common good you

00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:26,160
boost the possibilities of finding

00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,760
excellent solutions to real faces

00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:31,360
problems you know

00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:33,440
so to reach this success but to reach

00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:36,240
the success in co-design

00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:38,160
you should rely on open source knowledge

00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,639
and to also release

00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,399
your design is their designs with open

00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:45,839
source license you know

00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:48,959
so in this way you

00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:52,639
just like the open software

00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:54,880
source open source software movement you

00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,920
you get an advance from the industry you

00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,680
know

00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,320
that that's the reason beginning to

00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:02,320
start going for free software

00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,320
because you got an advice you have the

00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,040
whole community of the roads to support

00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,440
you

00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,720
so the idea probably would be better

00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,760
than a small team of

00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:15,199
1000 people you know so

00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:18,320
i think in health related

00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:19,279
software and in many fields of life open

00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:24,079
source is

00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:24,079
important because it's the way we live

00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:31,120
that's great ricardo um nessa did you

00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:34,240
want to weigh in around wikipedia

00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,040
yeah definitely so when covet 19

00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,040
happened

00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,880
it took a while for everyone to make

00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,839
sense of what was happening and what was

00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,839
going on

00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,880
and traditional institutions they were

00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,519
struggling to

00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:47,519
reorganize their strategies and like

00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,680
cope up with the new normal

00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,519
and many institutions also had a tough

00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,440
time to make their employees work from

00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:55,040
home and collaborate digitally

00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,720
and they also had a very hard time

00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,639
combating misinformation

00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,000
and if they had done a good job of like

00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,279
preventing misinformation from

00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,560
circulating the internet

00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:05,680
we would have had much less

00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:07,680
misinformation on on the internet today

00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,800
so it was also difficult for many

00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,880
institutes uh

00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,800
to process the huge volume of research

00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:16,000
data related to covet 19

00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:18,560
and make sense out of it so wikimedia

00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,639
projects differing this perspective for

00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,480
open movements like wikimedia movement

00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:25,199
the infrastructure to deal with this

00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,880
kind of emergencies was already in place

00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:28,560
so we have hundreds of thousands of

00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:31,440
volunteers around the world

00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:33,519
who speak 300 plus languages and share

00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,480
information not only in the form of text

00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:37,040
but also as images videos code structure

00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,600
data

00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,480
and books just to name a few and the

00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,040
comedians

00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,240
previously have institutional memory of

00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,880
having dealt with japan

00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,480
having dealt with their emergency so

00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,560
wikimedians have previously

00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:53,360
like collaborated to share knowledge

00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:55,600
starting from the 911 attacks in 2001

00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,560
to the recent like farmers strike in

00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,480
india

00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,720
so this 20 years of institutional

00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,240
knowledge of collaborating online

00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,959
an army of several thousands of

00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,000
volunteers participation of experts and

00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:08,240
researchers

00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,759
and internal mechanisms to combat fake

00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,839
news and vandalism

00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:13,360
ability to quickly respond to changes

00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,519
and push out new updates

00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:17,199
in a matter of seconds so all these

00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,920
factors together contributed

00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:22,240
to wikipedia being responding to

00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,839
pandemic in such a fast way and it

00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,240
became the source for knowledge for

00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:28,079
millions of people and this kind of

00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,920
thing and this is a kind of thing that

00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:33,279
traditional closed institutions

00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:35,600
cannot do in in times like a pandemic or

00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:37,600
an emergency

00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,519
yeah thanks neta and going a little bit

00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,519
off script um

00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,040
it's interesting hearing from both you

00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,560
and ricardo how you already had this

00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,079
infrastructure wikipedia has this big

00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,440
infrastructure carabao's had this big

00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:49,519
infrastructure and you're ready to

00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,839
strike when the pandemic hit

00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:53,360
but melissa i think you had to build

00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:56,800
that infrastructure and that's a lot of

00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,800
what you've been doing this past year

00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,759
yeah and i think you know um you know

00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:04,480
one of the most exciting things is that

00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:07,360
you know so so in for in the u.s and i

00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,880
think this is true in in most countries

00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,640
you know health care data is very

00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,919
sensitive and private um for many

00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,199
different reasons and there are many

00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,520
different regulations

00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,480
to keep it that way um but there are

00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,160
also like

00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,319
private arrangements with commercial

00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,760
organizations to mine that data for drug

00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,120
companies and drug development and all

00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,120
kinds of different things

00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,959
but the open science research community

00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:30,000
has really had very poor access

00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:31,840
to those data and and and not only do

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,200
they have poor access to those data at

00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,640
any individual site

00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,799
there because there's poor access to

00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,039
those data across the nation

00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:40,960
there's there's no ability to to to

00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,760
really do research on those data as a

00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,840
whole

00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,039
right and so one of the one of the

00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,760
amazing things that happened

00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:48,960
in our national cohort collaborative or

00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,280
n3c

00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,440
is really that all the institutions um

00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:56,480
signed regulatory agreements

00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:59,120
to push all of their data into a shared

00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,880
secure infrastructure where we were

00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,960
fortunate enough to already have some

00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,120
infrastructure in place at nih

00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:07,200
um that allowed us to securely house

00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:10,000
those data and then because of our

00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:12,240
um our our smaller community's uh

00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,480
expertise and data harmonization

00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,559
we're able to work with each individual

00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,400
institution and we're up to 82

00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:19,760
institutions now in the us that have

00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,240
signed on to share

00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,760
their data as the unprecedented level of

00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,400
sensitive data sharing in the united

00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,160
states

00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,080
um and it and it really uh you know

00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,720
really has taken the village to to

00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,360
create that

00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:33,200
harmonization infrastructure and what

00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,160
what we've also realized in doing that

00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,480
is like the data that

00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,080
healthcare data is really like 1980s

00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,799
level informatics because

00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:42,480
it's been hiding um you know behind

00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:44,160
these firewalls for so long like we

00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,919
could be doing so much more

00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,160
if the research community actually had

00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:50,080
access to it um but cleaning it all up

00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,679
and making it useful for ai and machine

00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,480
learning types of applications has been

00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:55,280
a huge

00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:57,679
uh lift and a huge um kind of open

00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:59,520
science endeavor uh by the community and

00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:01,280
and i think you know one of the one of

00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,360
the challenges is you know we

00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,640
we've made it broadly accessible to the

00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,160
community for research

00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,919
assuming that you have human subjects

00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,520
training and your institution

00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,960
says you're not you know random bad

00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,640
player off the street you know there's

00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,000
definitely some regulatory

00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,080
hurdles but you know we even have high

00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,640
school students um working

00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,679
on these data together with machine

00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,919
learning experts from

00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:24,080
commercial you know venues so it's

00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:26,960
really very broad participation

00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,320
but this this sort of um tension between

00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,200
how do we make it broadly available with

00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,080
the right training and the right

00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,919
security

00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,679
but we also want to be able to share

00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,120
things out of that environment so being

00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:35,600
able to publish our code and our

00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,240
knowledge

00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:40,480
artifacts on github openly but

00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:43,360
recognizing that people cannot run that

00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,919
code without having to jump through all

00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,000
the right

00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,520
security and regulatory hoops in order

00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,679
to access the data and so

00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,679
i think that's where we're we're seeing

00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,600
the village in action but we also

00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:55,840
we're still sort of trying to maintain

00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,679
um you know privacy and security

00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:00,160
requirements both for legal reasons but

00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,840
also for for ethical ones

00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,440
and at the same time doing you know

00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,039
we're doing the work as openly as

00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,320
possible and the workflows between those

00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:09,679
two

00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:10,720
two arenas is as uncharted territory

00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,360
like how do you

00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,880
how do you push reproducible code out

00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,080
and know that it's reproducible if you

00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,760
can never reproduce it

00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,440
outside the environment of the clinical

00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,320
data so these are some of the

00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,159
interesting

00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:25,520
kind of open science uh tensions that

00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:27,280
we're running across in that context

00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,880
yeah that's amazing melissa and i didn't

00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,440
realize you had high school students

00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:33,440
accessing this data that's really

00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:36,400
exciting to see that it's that open and

00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,400
it's that accessible

00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:39,840
we don't let them see the row level data

00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,760
okay yeah

00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,240
don't see individual patients but they

00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,679
can access some of the

00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:46,400
synthetic data and some other artifacts

00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:47,679
so yeah

00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,840
it's it's a little more careful than

00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,840
just that okay

00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,520
it's still very exciting and that's a

00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,679
huge accomplishment getting that kind of

00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,039
infrastructure up and it's

00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,360
it's a little sad that it took a

00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:01,840
pandemic to get that going but i'm so

00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:05,919
glad it's there

00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:07,840
me too um

00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,360
yeah and for the next question actually

00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,960
on a personal note i think some of you

00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:14,240
know that i am a new mother there's

00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:15,919
a one month old in the next room being

00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,799
silent hopefully not going to be crying

00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:18,320
soon

00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:20,320
but i was pregnant for most this

00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,159
pandemic and

00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,440
it's really interesting as i was reading

00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:25,039
about your research and the work that

00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,799
you're doing to see

00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:29,360
how like natalia you were writing

00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:31,600
articles on covet 19 and pregnancy

00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,760
and n3c was really enabling a lot of

00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:36,640
pregnancy related research with covet 19

00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,760
along with other kinds of insights so my

00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,320
question i think

00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,960
i'll start with melissa again how do you

00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,720
ensure

00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,080
that the work you're doing benefits not

00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,000
just majority of the people

00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:49,200
but also the smaller and more vulnerable

00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,960
populations affected by covid

00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,480
yeah that's um that's a it's a really

00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,440
important question so

00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:57,120
you know the the n3c uh was launched

00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,039
originally by the centers for

00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,520
translational science award

00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:02,320
sites which are essentially in the us

00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,400
the

00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,960
kind of largest most significant

00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:10,640
academic medical centers

00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:12,559
and and those communities have a

00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,760
broad community outreach component to

00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:15,200
them so those they're

00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,880
one of their primary functions is

00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,919
actually to serve in their regional

00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:22,159
areas

00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:23,840
um you know partner organizations and um

00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:25,200
disadvantaged communities so that was

00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,679
part of it and then

00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,960
we also partnered with the idea state

00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:32,480
ctrs which are these

00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:34,400
smaller more rural rural health oriented

00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,159
clinical institutions around the nation

00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,080
as well as other rural healthcare

00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:39,919
organizations like um

00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,840
like ochin which basically just trying

00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:43,039
to find philanthropy and other funding

00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:46,159
to support

00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:46,480
the sort of non-academic kind of kinds

00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:50,720
of

00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:53,760
um clinical organizations to participate

00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,799
and so that that does two things it it

00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,799
makes sure that the

00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:58,480
cohort the people that we have in our

00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:00,400
data sets and we're up to

00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,480
um over three about three million

00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,720
patients now in the in the system

00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,559
um is representative of all americans

00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,880
that we that we necessarily

00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:10,640
um you know have good representation so

00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,400
we can look at things like

00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,760
you know environmental health factors or

00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,200
rural health factors or social

00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,960
determinants of health

00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,720
to really look at those patterns at a

00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,280
scale that we've not been able to look

00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,000
at

00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:23,600
in any of the individual regional kinds

00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,200
of initiatives where we are seeing a lot

00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,880
of

00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:28,480
disadvantaged populations being more

00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,960
severely impacted

00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,240
by covid but we can really validate some

00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,440
of those

00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:37,280
conclusions at a scale in the u.s that

00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,400
we've not been able to before in the in

00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,799
the us

00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,240
um the other thing that that that effort

00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:43,279
to sort of find philanthropy and other

00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,640
funding for all those kinds of

00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:47,200
organizations does

00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:49,039
is it also enables those organizations

00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,559
to participate in the data analytics so

00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:52,000
we give them training

00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:53,600
and join them up with other groups to

00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,960
help them learn how to use the data so

00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,720
they can answer the questions that are

00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,760
most relevant to those communities

00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,400
themselves

00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,919
so it's it's you know teaching to fish

00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,360
so to speak you know and and

00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,880
and that's been really wonderful too

00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,520
because the kinds of questions that

00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,360
those

00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:09,360
communities have are very different than

00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:11,840
the kinds of questions that a

00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,640
premier academic medical center you know

00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:16,000
clinician

00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:18,080
researcher might might have and so

00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,440
um you know again that that it takes a

00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,039
village to kind of really

00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,320
you know poke at these data from all

00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:23,679
these different different angles but

00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,480
getting people to work together to help

00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:26,320
each other

00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,000
to answer um those kinds of questions

00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,120
and so you know for example we might

00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,840
have one of the

00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:33,679
you know um more prestigious academic

00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,240
medical centers asking questions about

00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:37,279
their

00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:39,200
city population um in terms of

00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:40,480
demographics but those same kinds of

00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,120
methodologies

00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:45,039
can then be ported to looking at rural

00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:47,520
healthcare

00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:49,679
uh questions and so the people who have

00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:51,279
done those analyses on this on the urban

00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,760
areas can can then say well what do we

00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:54,080
need to

00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,600
adapt or or evaluate the same or

00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,520
differently in these other contexts so

00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:00,400
they're really learning from each other

00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:02,000
um from these different uh viewpoints

00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,000
and so i think the sort of

00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,279
you know the folks who are maybe a

00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,320
little bit more sophisticated on the

00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:08,720
informatics side

00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:10,559
um you know maybe don't have the the

00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,400
same kinds of questions that a rural

00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:13,840
health or disadvantaged population might

00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,640
have but they have the expertise to

00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,039
share

00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,640
and so that's really this sort of

00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:19,360
knowledge transfer that's that's been

00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,279
happening and

00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,480
and in both directions so that's been a

00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:24,480
really wonderful thing

00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,840
i finally i want to conclude with um

00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,080
just one thought about

00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:29,520
you know really being careful about our

00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:32,640
tribal um

00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:33,360
data content um and also just making

00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,559
sure that

00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,960
the you know that that's like there's a

00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:40,960
real

00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:42,480
balance between viewing that information

00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,159
about those kinds of sensitive

00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:47,600
demographics

00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:49,840
in a way that helps them versus

00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,440
actually stigmatizes them and so some of

00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,480
the decisions that we've had to make

00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,320
about

00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,480
whether we share that information or not

00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,919
whether we have even if we have it

00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,520
have really tilted towards being more

00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:01,600
protective of those

00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:03,279
types of information and really working

00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,640
with those communities to decide how

00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:05,279
they want to view that information and

00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,640
maybe

00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:08,320
coming up with some infrastructure

00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,240
strategies that allow them to look at it

00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:12,240
but not the whole world and so

00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,159
those are some other nuances that kind

00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:16,960
of are at the intersection of

00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:18,000
of ethics infrastructure and just sort

00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:21,120
of

00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,919
data access control that that can allow

00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:26,799
us to to configure things specifically

00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:28,559
for specific populations

00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:30,720
yeah that's super interesting and it's

00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:33,440
it's great how because the data is open

00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,799
these populations can learn to fish or

00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,440
can have access to it

00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:39,039
um even though there are yeah there's a

00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:43,279
lot of still data control issues

00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:44,000
involved um netflix did you want to talk

00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:46,320
a bit about

00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,600
um wikipedia's work in marginalized

00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:50,320
communities

00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:51,440
yes definitely so i think that in any

00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,919
part of the world

00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,679
the worst damage from crisis occurred to

00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:57,120
people who are left out from structures

00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:59,679
of power and privilege

00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:01,840
so this information is naturally mostly

00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:03,360
targeted at these vulnerable groups

00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,760
and they are more likely to believe in

00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:08,720
them because they have lack of access

00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:10,720
to institutions and trustworthy sources

00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,760
so on wikipedia for example there is an

00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,919
article titled

00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,799
misinformation related to the government

00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:17,279
pandemic

00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:18,640
and it is present in 37 languages and

00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:20,640
the main article about

00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,399
the kovit-19 pandemic it is available in

00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,159
more than 150 languages

00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:26,080
so i think that having information share

00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:28,080
in as many languages as possible

00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,200
is important because the most vulnerable

00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,120
people of the world

00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,320
don't necessarily speak or understand

00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:35,360
english

00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:36,000
on the other hand i also personally try

00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,480
to

00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,760
um when i write articles on wikipedia i

00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,679
personally try to

00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,960
see the perspectives of the vulnerable

00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:45,120
communities

00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,799
and i try as much as possible to include

00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,279
the perspectives of women people of

00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:49,200
color

00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:50,720
and people living in the global south in

00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,760
the articles that are right

00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:55,440
so for example i wrote about um mental

00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:58,399
health issues during covet 19

00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:00,159
about covenant and pregnancy and social

00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:01,279
stigma related to coping 19 and these

00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:03,679
are some of the articles

00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:06,559
that is started on wikipedia which could

00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:09,360
relate to the vulnerable populations

00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:11,440
and sometimes it's not not even enough

00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:13,279
to share this information online because

00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,559
the most vulnerable do not have access

00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:17,120
to the internet

00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:19,200
so several wikipedians are involved in

00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:22,080
bringing offline versions of wikipedia

00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:24,320
to countries affected by war poverty

00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:26,000
natural disasters and censorship

00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:28,720
so that they too can have access to

00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,159
knowledge even during times of crisis

00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,080
and another project the wikimedia

00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:33,840
foundation has been working on is

00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:36,000
uh like developing the mobile version of

00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,880
wikipedia because many people from the

00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,520
global south

00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,480
and many uh are coming to the internet

00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,559
right now

00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:44,320
and they are using their mobile devices

00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:45,279
as their primary source to interact with

00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:48,320
the internet

00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:50,320
so uh if they have to like have a good

00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,120
experience of interacting with wikipedia

00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,279
and learning

00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,480
new things from wikipedia we need to

00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:57,120
provide them a good

00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,000
interact good platform on on on their

00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,000
mobile phones

00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,440
and not just on their desktops so these

00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,760
are some of the things that

00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:06,000
the volunteers on wikimedia as well as

00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:08,320
the wikimedia foundation are considering

00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,720
when it comes to like thinking about

00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,799
people vulnerable populations

00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:15,200
thanks so much neda and i i've never

00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:17,760
heard of offline wikipedia before

00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,200
uh that's that's amazing and that would

00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:21,120
be huge

00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,480
yes we also have this project called

00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,640
wikipedia in a box

00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,159
so you basically get a sort of a usb

00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:28,320
drive and

00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:29,760
it can be shipped to your address and it

00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,919
and many schools

00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:33,679
and universities even universities in

00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:37,039
different parts of parts of the world

00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:39,679
they have this wikipedia in a box and

00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:42,159
they can use it offline yes that's

00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:42,159
really cool

00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:47,360
um and i know ricardo i didn't put your

00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,039
name under here but i know you care a

00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:51,120
lot about public power

00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:53,440
um in the global south did you have

00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:55,279
anything to add around

00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:58,159
yeah getting in for helping the more

00:29:55,279 --> 00:30:00,159
vulnerable populations

00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:02,559
first of all i love the idea of quick

00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:06,840
pattern usb driver you know

00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:10,000
whoa mind blowing and really important

00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:13,200
um i think we

00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:16,000
should always try to focus on the

00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:18,960
the last ones you know the last ones to

00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:22,240
take facts in the last one to get

00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:25,919
access to hospitals and things like this

00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:28,240
and the way we can do it

00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:28,960
now for example in the coffee 19

00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,000
pandemic

00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:33,200
is protection you know so this was

00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,200
something we

00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,840
had in mind when we were developing

00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:41,200
products in carryables

00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,200
brazil uh

00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,760
we i want to protect myself you know but

00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:48,159
in a fashion way

00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,679
so we developed for example the black

00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:52,240
leaf madness tool but

00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:54,480
so it was a turban where you can you

00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:56,559
have a face shield inside of it very

00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,039
beautiful with beautiful clothes on it

00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:00,559
and

00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:01,360
the textiles sorry and we also developed

00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:04,080
for example

00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:06,000
hats for rastafaris with some things

00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:08,799
like this and hats for children

00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,320
and things like this because we we need

00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:12,559
to support the last words

00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,559
you know

00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:18,559
how this just like melissa said how this

00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:22,399
data variable

00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:24,720
uh this that is she's dealing with a

00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:27,120
community united states but you can

00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,000
grab tons of data from nigeria for

00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,840
example and

00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,480
who is taking control of that you know

00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:35,679
so

00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:39,519
and i i believe the open source

00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:42,799
movement saying like that is key

00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:44,080
you know it's fundamental to protective

00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:46,880
rights

00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:48,559
because if it's if health is dealing in

00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,559
a proprietary way

00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:52,320
who will take care of that of that

00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:56,000
product of that data

00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:58,480
of that vaccine you know

00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,399
what do you have inside the black box

00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,360
inside the usb drive that i know there

00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:04,320
is wikipedia

00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:04,640
and they trust people there and every

00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,760
day

00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:09,039
i know someone that writes to wikipedia

00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:12,559
you know so

00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:13,919
very nice to meet you as well you know

00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:17,200
it's always good to know there are

00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:20,640
people behind internet

00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:23,519
but sometimes

00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:25,519
behind these big companies you have

00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:28,240
exploratory labor behind

00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:29,919
you have you know people are not walking

00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:33,519
by heart

00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:35,919
and things later is bad so yeah that was

00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:38,880
my point

00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:40,720
thanks so much ricardo and i think we've

00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:43,760
we've touched on this a little bit um

00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:46,000
as we've been just talking

00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:47,679
but ricardo going back to you again what

00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,440
would you say to people who think that

00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:52,799
health care is too high risk

00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,799
for open source development

00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,960
i would reply that health care is a too

00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:00,159
high risk

00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:02,720
for property development only you know

00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:04,960
because we should care about ourselves

00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,080
we should care about the ones we love we

00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,640
cannot

00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,519
give our help to other people to take

00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:12,640
care of it

00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:13,039
and you just and you just don't care you

00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,159
know

00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:16,799
you go there to your doctor okay back

00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:18,720
home

00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:20,960
and finally take this man we should care

00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:23,200
for ourselves and for the ones who love

00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,000
and so i trust more in my community for

00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,360
example

00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,399
developing a carrier product that fits

00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,880
my needs

00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:34,399
that is moment manufacture somewhere

00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:38,960
around the place with a cheap labor

00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:41,360
you know and and we also for melissa

00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,399
might blow immediately might glow in

00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,640
your job

00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:47,039
we should care about your healthy data

00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,440
protections from risks of monetization

00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:52,320
you know

00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:52,320
and control over this data i'm i'm

00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:02,640
how many people are dying what is

00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:04,320
happening where is the starter going to

00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,840
what the ministry of brazil is doing

00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:09,200
with this

00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:12,159
at the university john hopkins you know

00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:13,760
joe hopkins has all the data so we

00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:16,960
should care about that

00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:20,800
and when for example we share

00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:23,200
with our out of our designs or

00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:25,200
i would call militias work as a designer

00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,079
as a designer as well because you know

00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:28,480
it's

00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:34,079
but when you share these things of what

00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:38,079
you are working with

00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:39,599
you you create multiple platforms so

00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:43,839
people can communicate and

00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:46,879
understand the risks of keeping

00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:48,159
giving up your health to other person to

00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:51,440
take care you know

00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:52,800
so okay i play in brazil we have this

00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:55,359
kind of

00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,480
healthy security plans that you pay

00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:58,880
monthly

00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,760
and you pay that thing go once a week

00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:03,599
once a month

00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:05,680
once at six months and

00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:08,240
you don't make an exercise you don't use

00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:11,359
them you don't wash your hands you know

00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:13,599
you know we during convince we we

00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:14,880
we learned that we didn't know how to

00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:17,440
wash our hands

00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,960
our hands and we didn't know how to

00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:23,760
clean ourselves because

00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:26,640
we move it crazy to toilet papers gosh

00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:27,520
you know we don't know how to care of

00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:30,079
ourselves so

00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:31,520
i think this pandemic bring this

00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:33,920
knowledge to us

00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,800
and i think open source is the answer

00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:37,200
for that

00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:39,760
how to care of yourselves how how

00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,480
melissa's grandmother used to care of

00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,480
her

00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:44,720
sorry how many is his grand grandmother

00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:47,520
or how much a great grandmother used to

00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:49,200
care of her grandmother

00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,720
they shared knowledge you know they

00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,079
shared knowledge with neighbors they

00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:55,280
shared knowledge with everyone

00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:58,560
recited strong that we had of herbal

00:35:55,280 --> 00:36:01,040
medicine for thousands of years

00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:03,040
and even this these medicines the

00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:04,240
pharmaceutical industry is using this

00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:07,680
knowledge

00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:08,480
and it's it's get patents and create an

00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:11,599
economy

00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:16,560
over a knowledge that used to be public

00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:19,280
whoa also at least i think this

00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:21,440
maybe this open source movement how this

00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:24,079
we are doing now in the health sector

00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:26,720
with the open source can bring some

00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:28,960
glimpse of

00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:29,839
knowledge about ourselves to the whole

00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:33,280
world you know

00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:35,920
we should care about ourselves in

00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:37,599
in the in a greater scope you know we

00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:39,440
should care about your doubt about our

00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:44,079
neighbors about

00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:46,400
uh about everyone we are living

00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:48,480
straight up your mind relieving serious

00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:51,359
times

00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,359
thanks ricardo

00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:57,119
yeah go ahead son yeah yeah

00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:59,280
i just i just want to respond to ricardo

00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:00,640
i i think um there's a couple things you

00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:04,000
said that really just resonated

00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:06,720
so when when neetha said you know um

00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,040
the truth is behind pay walls but the

00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,119
lie

00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:10,240
but lies are free you know i think the

00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:11,680
same thing is saying

00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:13,520
you were speaking about the literature

00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:15,359
and and sort of social media

00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,800
but i think the same thing is true with

00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:18,480
healthcare data so

00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,240
we're able to sort of make these

00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,320
arrangements with commercial

00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,359
organizations to share that same health

00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:26,800
care data

00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:29,200
with them for them to discover how to

00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,000
find the drugs and find the patterns in

00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,839
the data but

00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,480
not with each other and with the pop and

00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:37,119
with with the with citizens right

00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:38,480
and so the same thing is true true there

00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:40,320
there as well

00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,599
and so the second thing i i guess i want

00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:44,720
to say is also

00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:47,200
as a patient you know i

00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:48,000
at least in the us i i'm very frustrated

00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,000
you know

00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,000
big brother knows everything about where

00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,200
i am from my phone they know about my

00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,800
credit history

00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,960
but when i go to the doctor and they say

00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,079
sign this form so that we won't share

00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,079
your health data

00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:01,359
and i say i'd like to sign the form that

00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:01,839
says you're going to share my health

00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:03,920
data

00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:06,079
they say we don't have that form like

00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,720
i'm not allowed to share my health data

00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:08,800
but

00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:10,960
all these other systems are in place to

00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:13,040
know everything else about me so

00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:15,200
so we really are are thinking about it

00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:17,520
um i think in the in the wrong

00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:19,920
wrong way and maybe maybe a lot of that

00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:21,520
has come about because of

00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,760
discrimination for pre-existing

00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:25,359
conditions and the way that we

00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,520
provide health care and insurance in the

00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:28,800
united states in particular

00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:31,119
and there are of course sensitive

00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,520
privacy issues that you you may wish to

00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:33,599
um

00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,880
to not have be revealed to the to the

00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:36,880
public sector

00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:38,400
but at the same time how can we live in

00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:40,160
this environment where we share

00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,760
everything about ourselves all the time

00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:44,000
as a constant data stream

00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:46,480
and yet have zero access to information

00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,560
about our health care our health

00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:50,320
data and so then the third point i

00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:52,320
wanted to make that that also really

00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,680
resonated with me with ricardo's

00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:56,240
comments is just

00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:56,960
the patient needs to own their data not

00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:59,040
other people

00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:01,280
and we need to tilt towards a world

00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,480
where the patient is in charge of who

00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:04,880
has access to which

00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:06,800
parts of their healthcare data and when

00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,599
we when we can tilt towards technology

00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,839
that support

00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:11,440
that that will enable all kinds of

00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:14,720
different things in both the public and

00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:18,079
the private sectors

00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:18,079
that's amazing melissa thank you

00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,440
and uh just a quick reminder before we

00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:23,200
move on to the next question that you

00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,960
can ask your audience questions for

00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,960
everyone watching using the dialogues

00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:30,720
and debates hashtag on twitter

00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:32,880
or in the comments in the youtube stream

00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,920
um so yeah i think i'll go on to our

00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:36,480
next question

00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:37,920
so with open resources like wikipedia

00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,400
and n3c

00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,839
how do you balance openness with so many

00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,200
conflicting views and harmful

00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:46,720
misinformation

00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,720
uh nasa do you want to kick us off

00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:52,960
yes um yeah so i touched upon some of

00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,400
the points earlier but i would like to

00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,320
emphasize on that

00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,240
so one of the things that we jokingly

00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:00,320
say about wikipedia is that

00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:03,119
it doesn't really work in theory but it

00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:05,920
somehow miraculously works in practice

00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:07,760
so if you like sit down together and

00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:09,359
brainstorm about an encyclopedia where

00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,960
anybody anybody can edit

00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:13,599
you might think that no it's not a good

00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:15,520
idea but it kind of somehow works and

00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:17,920
somehow works very well

00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:20,000
and how wikipedia works is because of

00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:22,400
its because of many reasons and one of

00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,520
them is its robust policies

00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,839
so the policies on wikipedia make sure

00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,280
that

00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:28,880
everyone has to back up their

00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,079
information with citations

00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,920
and if you do not have adequate

00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:34,240
citations that information might

00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:36,400
eventually get deleted from wikipedia

00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:38,560
and when it comes to medical articles

00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,599
only those information which the highest

00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,839
level of evidence

00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:43,760
is allowed to be presented on wikipedia

00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:44,720
so it's only the systematic reviews and

00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:47,119
meta-analysis

00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:48,480
that should ideally be on a medical

00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:52,560
article and not just

00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:53,520
junk science or like um um links from a

00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:57,440
news article

00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:59,040
or something else and like i mentioned

00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:01,280
earlier the wikimedia movement also

00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:03,440
thrives on its army of volunteers

00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:05,280
and it's quite hard to explain how like

00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:07,440
hundreds of thousands of volunteers

00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:09,760
contribute their like several productive

00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:11,200
hours to build up an encyclopedia

00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:13,359
i really do not know what motivates

00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:15,440
people to do that but then

00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:17,040
there are very many generous herded

00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,079
people who really contribute to

00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:20,160
wikipedia and

00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:21,599
make their article keep its articles

00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:23,599
updated

00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:24,640
and these volunteers are the main

00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:26,480
gatekeepers

00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:28,240
who watch the recent changes that is

00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:30,960
happening on the wikimedia

00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:32,160
and they revert the harmful changes so

00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:34,960
if somebody goes in

00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,599
and makes a bad edit in an article there

00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:38,240
would

00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:39,920
eventually be another good goodwill

00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:41,440
volunteer who comes back and reverts

00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:44,240
that edit

00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:45,520
another thing is that these volunteers

00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:49,040
are also helped by

00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:51,280
scripts called boards uh and these are

00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:52,720
uh these scripts are trained to detect

00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:54,560
light and vandalism

00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:56,160
like suspicious keywords and links to

00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:59,200
suspicious websites

00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:02,400
so uh these bots they will like notify

00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:05,599
or notify a volunteer or change

00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:07,599
um change the version if they see that

00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:08,960
something bad is going on so there is

00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:12,640
also some um

00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:14,240
like some support from the technical

00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:16,960
side to help volunteers to

00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:18,480
combat misinformation and there is

00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:20,640
finally there is also a process on

00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:22,400
wikipedia to protect or semi-protect

00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:24,880
some of the high profile pages

00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:27,119
from being edited by unregistered users

00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:28,880
or less experienced users

00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:30,880
so if it's an article about say the

00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,640
kovit 19 pandemic it cannot be edited by

00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:34,000
just about everyone you need to earn

00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:36,240
sufficient privileges

00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,920
or you need to have a registered account

00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:40,480
on wikipedia to be able to

00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:41,920
edit such high profile articles so i

00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,880
would say that it's the combination of

00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:45,920
volunteer work

00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:46,400
technology and robust policies that

00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,160
keeps

00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,760
most of the misinformation away from

00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:52,720
wikipedia

00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:54,319
yes thanks so much neta um and i know

00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,839
melissa with your work you're dealing a

00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:57,040
bit more with conflicting views rather

00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:59,599
than misinformation

00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:00,400
did you want to talk about that yeah i

00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:02,240
think you know

00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,760
um one of the and i kind of mentioned

00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,400
this a little bit earlier you know one

00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:06,480
of the

00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,599
the really nice advantages of having so

00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:10,400
much data is being

00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:11,839
able to look at studies that were done

00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:14,560
earlier with smaller amounts

00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:16,160
of data to see if we actually see the

00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:18,720
same kinds of results

00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:20,480
um you know and similarly like there

00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,839
were a number of really high profile

00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:24,640
scientific retrac

00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:26,160
retractions um that were made in in

00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:27,680
lancet and the new england journal of

00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:29,920
medicine where

00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:31,200
there really was no access to the data

00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:34,560
and though

00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:36,079
those retractions actually changed um

00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:38,400
you know clinical trials that were

00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:39,440
underway for you know important drugs

00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,839
and so

00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:44,240
i i think you know just having the full

00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:45,760
reproducibility and transparency of all

00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:47,839
of the data

00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:50,079
you know can really sort of say hey this

00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:52,079
is a justified study here's all the data

00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:55,440
that shows why it's justified

00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:57,200
before the studies begin um and then

00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:59,119
also for studies that have already been

00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,560
done on smaller populations

00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:02,000
being able to say how does how does this

00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:03,760
scale how does this relate to what we've

00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,359
learned from this much larger

00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:08,400
amount of data and you know in some

00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:10,160
cases we've actually seen

00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:12,800
you know some differences in some of

00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:15,280
those um from those smaller studies

00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:16,880
in other cases it's really reassuring to

00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:19,359
be able to justify

00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:21,200
uh those results so i think it's sort of

00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:24,400
the power of the of the size

00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:27,440
the power of the data to be able to

00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:29,520
justify and to validate results as they

00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:32,240
as they come out the other thing i would

00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:34,800
say too that's actually

00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:36,640
really interesting is that there's um

00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:39,040
you know there's really a lot of effort

00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:40,560
on the sort of computational biology

00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:42,880
side of the world

00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:44,640
to kind of look for drug candidates to

00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:48,000
target

00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:50,160
the stars v to virus

00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,079
proteins and to try to understand the

00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:54,000
mechanisms of action

00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:55,200
and one of the things we're really

00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,760
trying to do

00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:59,119
is to use those kinds of approaches

00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:00,079
together with the clinical data to

00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:02,240
validate

00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:04,319
um the trials so that we actually have

00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:06,240
more evidence of

00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:07,760
the potential impact on the clinical

00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:10,000
outcomes by using that

00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:12,000
computational biology approach together

00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:15,599
with the clinical informatics

00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:17,440
so instead of saying here's the top 25

00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:18,000
drug candidates we only have money for

00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:20,640
10 let's

00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,240
just you know um you know try to

00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:23,119
prioritize them actually using those

00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:25,040
data together

00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:26,880
to to also sort of validate approaches

00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:28,640
for designing trials so

00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:30,480
so i think it's more about validation

00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:34,319
and justification

00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:35,760
in our case then it is misinformation

00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:38,240
thank you melissa and it's good to know

00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:39,920
that these uh these systems are in place

00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:43,520
where we so we can trust the information

00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:45,200
that we're getting and move forward

00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:47,839
um so we did get a question come in on

00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:50,319
twitter from c rapunzel

00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:51,839
and i'll address this to neta has it

00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:52,800
occurred to anyone that an offline

00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:55,280
wikipedia

00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:57,760
already exists as encyclopedias how

00:45:55,280 --> 00:46:00,560
would you respond to that

00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:03,599
yeah that's right like once upon a time

00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:05,680
we did have like paper encyclopedias we

00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:06,640
really religiously had on our

00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,800
bookshelves

00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:10,560
but i don't think uh many people have

00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:13,119
that practice anymore

00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:14,240
and because of the entrance of wikipedia

00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:17,359
into

00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:20,319
the internet we do really have like

00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:21,920
um many of the encyclopedias which used

00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:24,480
to be in the paper format

00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:25,200
they do not have their print versions

00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:28,079
anymore

00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:29,359
now everything is going digital and like

00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:32,480
ricardo mentioned

00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:34,319
in another channel is uh that look now

00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:36,160
your encyclopedia doesn't have to be

00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:37,280
like a paper version it can also be a

00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:40,240
usb that

00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:42,079
sticks into your pocket perfectly and

00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:43,920
you don't need to carry such volume of

00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:45,520
big books which are quite expensive as

00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:47,920
well and

00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:49,760
um another thing another reason why i

00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:50,880
started contributing to wikipedia was

00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:53,040
also because

00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:54,160
these books were very expensive so when

00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,920
i went to

00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:57,680
my first year in medical school my

00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:58,720
textbooks were really prohibitively

00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:00,480
expensive and i had

00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:01,839
i had to go to a physical library to be

00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:04,400
able to access it

00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:05,839
so i decided at that time that the kind

00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:08,319
of knowledge i have

00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:10,079
i will be i want to be able to share it

00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:12,240
on the internet for everybody to

00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:13,839
see and that was how i started con

00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:16,160
contributing to wikipedia

00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:17,200
so yes i have nothing against the paper

00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:20,240
encyclopedias

00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:21,920
but um given its limitations i think

00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:24,319
that it's time that

00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:25,680
we invest more in digital platforms uh

00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:27,680
including collaborative projects like

00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:29,520
wikipedia

00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:31,359
thanks benta and if anyone else has

00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:33,200
questions about

00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:34,800
paper encyclopedias or anything else

00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:36,880
that we've discussed uh please use the

00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:40,480
dialogues and debates hashtag

00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:43,760
and i will be sure to answer that um

00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:45,760
but i think our next question um and

00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:47,599
i think this will apply more to melissa

00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:48,559
who did a lot of infrastructure setting

00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:50,000
up

00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:52,079
is that can the open source systems and

00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,720
community you've set up for coven 19

00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:55,680
pandemic

00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:56,800
help us be more open in the future

00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:59,599
absolutely i mean

00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:01,440
you know one of the um really exciting

00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:04,000
things about the work that we've done

00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:05,200
is you know we have this just incredible

00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,760
regulatory

00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:09,119
partnership between the institutions and

00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:11,760
our government agency the national

00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:16,000
institutes of of health

00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:18,960
and those regulatory arrangements to

00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,760
cover the transfer of these data you

00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:21,760
know we're designed

00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:23,760
solely for covid so you cannot use the

00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:25,359
data in the system unless you are

00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:27,680
studying covid so you cannot do

00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:29,920
alzheimer's research with these data

00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:31,520
um that said there's a lot of

00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:33,200
information in there that you know if

00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:34,559
you're studying the effects of covet on

00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:36,319
alzheimer's patients

00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:38,160
she would be very equipped to do so

00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:39,920
there's a lot of data

00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:41,599
about a person it's their entire you

00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:43,440
know you know sort of

00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:45,040
largely de-identified but you know a lot

00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:46,640
of different parts of the medical record

00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:48,319
are there

00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:49,440
so you know if you have alzheimer's

00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:50,800
we're going to know which alzheimer's

00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:52,319
drugs you're on and which you know how

00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:54,480
far along in your trajectory

00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:55,839
you are for example so there's a huge

00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:58,400
potential for

00:48:55,839 --> 00:48:59,920
you know being able to broaden um this

00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:01,680
type of infrastructure to be able to

00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:03,359
serve all kinds of different disease

00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:04,960
research areas and i think

00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:06,480
you know this was obviously these

00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:08,400
regulatory arrangements

00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:10,720
were made in the time of a public health

00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:12,240
emergency but now you know following you

00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:15,599
know the better part of a year of

00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:18,800
of um you know really having

00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:20,079
very secure very safe access to these

00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:22,160
data

00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:23,760
we you know i think the institutions are

00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:25,440
realizing that we can do this and maybe

00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:26,400
we can do this for for all the disease

00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:28,559
areas and

00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:30,160
especially in certain kinds of disease

00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:30,880
areas such as rare disease research

00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:33,119
which is really my

00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:35,119
my background in interest where any

00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:37,760
given institution never has enough

00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:38,480
patients to to glean anything useful

00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:40,880
from

00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:42,000
by having you know the whole nation's

00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:43,520
data

00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,119
you can actually start to find other

00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:46,800
patients that are similar

00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:48,880
um and start to understand patterns of

00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:50,960
care and patterns of

00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:52,960
outcomes for those patients in ways that

00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:55,280
you cannot do in a single institution so

00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:57,359
i'm really excited about the idea that

00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:58,720
you know the community is starting to

00:49:57,359 --> 00:49:59,200
talk about wow this is really cool how

00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:01,200
do we

00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:03,760
how do we advance this for all disease

00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:05,359
areas similarly with the next pandemic

00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:08,000
or the next new disease

00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:08,960
to be discovered you know in the face of

00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,160
a new disease

00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:14,319
um there's a really deep need to more

00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:16,079
deeply characterize

00:50:14,319 --> 00:50:17,359
and classify patients so we can

00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:20,160
understand what

00:50:17,359 --> 00:50:21,359
what are the specific subgroups so for

00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:24,640
example

00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:27,440
in covid we have you know

00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:28,319
a 10 to 30 depending on estimates of

00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:31,839
patients

00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:34,640
of covid patients have um long-term sqla

00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:35,200
from their acute phase of the infection

00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:37,200
and

00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:38,640
these these types of symptoms really

00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,960
vary in their

00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:42,319
duration at the different time points

00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:44,240
after their infection

00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:45,359
and in the different body systems that

00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:47,760
are affected and

00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:48,880
and so by having um you know it's a new

00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:50,640
disease there are actually

00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:52,240
you know really fundamentally many

00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:54,559
different subtypes of

00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:56,400
what we call long covid and how we

00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:58,000
actually care for the patients that are

00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:59,280
in each of those subgroups should

00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,880
probably differ

00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:02,559
but until we have enough data in the

00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:03,359
face of a new disease we don't know what

00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:05,599
those

00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:06,400
subtypes really are well enough to

00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:08,400
design those

00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:10,079
those treatment and care strategies and

00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:11,839
so

00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:13,440
you know i think that's a great example

00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:14,880
of just and this is true for the rare

00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:17,839
disease or any kind of

00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:19,119
new new disease that we start to subtype

00:51:17,839 --> 00:51:22,559
as we get

00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:24,559
more information about how to classify

00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:26,000
patients it's really important for for

00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:27,520
care considerations so

00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,359
in the long term we're really excited

00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:31,920
about the idea that maybe we could

00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:33,680
um you know really endorse this this

00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:36,160
idea that we could do this for many

00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:38,880
many for all disease areas for for

00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:40,720
clinical and translational research

00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:42,240
yeah thanks melissa and i think that uh

00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:44,559
that really resonates with me i started

00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:47,280
my career at a cancer research institute

00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:48,640
and it was it was exciting to see these

00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:50,319
large data sets of like

00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:53,040
cancer data but then heartbreaking that

00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:54,960
it was only used for cancer research

00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:56,880
it could have been used for a lot of

00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:59,440
other things um

00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:04,559
but it's exciting to hear that we're

00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:06,240
moving forward slowly

00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:08,079
um netter ricardo did you have anything

00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:09,680
to add around um

00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:12,240
yeah open source in the future and what

00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:12,240
this could mean

00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:19,839
uh yeah

00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:26,640
right quickly

00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:34,480
if we think that your thirties and the

00:52:30,319 --> 00:52:37,599
2040s you know the 20s 2030s and 2040s

00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:40,240
where we'll have a lot of

00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:42,240
bio fermented food we have a lot of new

00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:45,440
materials developed from

00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:46,960
scratch and all these kind of things how

00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:49,200
this thing will be appropriate

00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:51,200
you know we will have proprietary foods

00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:55,520
proprietary sources of protein

00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:59,440
protein proteinary materials and

00:52:55,520 --> 00:53:02,079
if if we believe in a future

00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:03,359
where we can live as a equal community

00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:07,119
we need

00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:08,800
open patents licensed softwares and

00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:12,240
whatever so

00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:15,359
uh i think this

00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:16,559
this this i believe this coffee movement

00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:19,040
the open source was

00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:19,760
really strong and very helpful and i

00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:22,640
really hope

00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:24,559
we can move forward for larger open

00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:29,760
source

00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:31,680
struggles you know sorry again

00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:33,280
thank you ricardo neta did you want to

00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:35,839
chime in

00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:36,400
yes uh one lesson that the pandemic has

00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:38,079
taught me

00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:39,839
is that the collaboration is the way

00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:43,599
forward and i'm sure

00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:44,960
melissa will i i i resonate with melissa

00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:47,520
in this case that

00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:49,359
most of the important research related

00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:50,079
to covet 19 happened because the

00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:52,160
scientists

00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:53,760
share their findings openly and build

00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:55,520
international collaborations to share

00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:57,680
and analyze their data

00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:59,599
and people around the world they

00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:00,800
gathered information about copied 19 not

00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:02,880
only from textbooks

00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:04,000
but they mostly read websites and

00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:05,599
wikipedia they

00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,280
read about it on the internet because it

00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:09,280
was a relatively new disease

00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:10,800
there were no like written books about

00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:12,640
it so everybody had to go into the

00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:15,680
internet to know about it

00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:17,359
and uh and the research uh surrounding

00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:19,760
covet 19 progress so far

00:54:17,359 --> 00:54:21,599
including vaccine research because there

00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:23,200
was a lot of collaboration between

00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:24,079
international collaborations between

00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:26,240
scientists

00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:27,760
and this kind of collaborations are only

00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:28,480
possible only when you when you share

00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:31,040
data

00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:31,599
share data between research groups and i

00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:34,079
think

00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:35,760
this idea of sharing in order to build

00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:38,720
bigger collaborative projects

00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:40,240
has really sunk into the academic world

00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:41,119
and this is going to continue in the

00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:42,880
future

00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:44,160
so i think that one of the lessons that

00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:47,599
pandemic has taught us

00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:50,000
is that collaboration is really the way

00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:53,040
forward

00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:55,680
thank you so much and

00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:57,680
we have five minutes left um in this

00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:59,359
lovely panel so i do want to close this

00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:00,880
off with a little bit of a call to

00:54:59,359 --> 00:55:02,880
action for our audience

00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:04,160
um so i thought we could go around and

00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:06,480
each of us can say

00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:08,240
how how others who are watching now can

00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:11,359
support you and your work

00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:14,400
um nathan did you want to go first yes

00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:15,440
uh the kobe 19 pandemic is changing the

00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:17,200
world in a way that

00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:19,680
more and more people are now using the

00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:20,960
internet and subsequently wikipedia to

00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:22,720
learn new information

00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:24,319
so there is recent research which shows

00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:25,680
that the viewership of wikipedia

00:55:24,319 --> 00:55:28,079
increased manifold

00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:29,200
during uh the kobit 19 pandemic and

00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:30,720
especially during

00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:33,119
lockdown periods in the respective

00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:35,200
countries so i think that it's therefore

00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:36,880
important to keep wikipedia up to date

00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:38,640
and reliable because lots of people

00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:40,960
access wikipedia for their

00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:42,480
as their first source of information and

00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:44,880
therefore my call for action for

00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:46,240
everyone is to start participating in

00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:48,559
sharing your knowledge

00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:50,640
freely and openly on the internet

00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:53,760
including on wikipedia projects

00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:56,559
uh so that you you can help people

00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:57,440
uh with the knowledge that you have yeah

00:55:56,559 --> 00:55:59,119
thank you

00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:00,720
thanks so much and yeah people can do

00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:02,720
that by publishing blogs i guess

00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:04,480
they don't necessarily have to edit the

00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:06,559
wikipedia page if they're scared

00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:07,760
still yeah yeah there are lots of

00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:10,079
possibilities but

00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:12,319
people but i believe that people should

00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:15,599
share the knowledge that they have

00:56:12,319 --> 00:56:16,240
that's great um ricardo how can others

00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:19,280
um

00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:21,440
yeah help and support your work

00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:23,359
well incaribous we're part of this labs

00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:24,799
that i told you in the innovation hubs

00:56:23,359 --> 00:56:26,559
developed in promoting and

00:56:24,799 --> 00:56:28,000
manufacturing open source healthcare

00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:31,119
solutions so

00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:34,160
on our site carrables.org one can find

00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:34,640
hundreds of open source design models to

00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:37,200
support

00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:39,599
people with disabilities and more dozens

00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:40,400
of available designers to use against

00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:43,599
convicts

00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:45,680
infections and things like this so

00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:48,480
take part in carrie was not all you know

00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:51,520
or any other open source how to project

00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:52,480
near to your community or one month away

00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:54,640
from you

00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:56,720
and it's time to share just like share

00:56:54,640 --> 00:57:00,559
your knowledge share your possibilities

00:56:56,720 --> 00:57:01,440
share share your show that that you can

00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:04,960
share care

00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:04,960
you know and share your care

00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:08,960
thank you so much and ricardo um i think

00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:13,119
i was pronouncing

00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:14,640
carriables wrong before so i apologize

00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:17,119
i think you are pronouncing much better

00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:19,599
than i you know

00:57:17,119 --> 00:57:22,640
i have this accent from the subtropics

00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:26,319
the famous savage english

00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:27,280
but it's um i know my friend he has a 3d

00:57:26,319 --> 00:57:29,119
printer

00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:31,680
and early in the pandemic he was just

00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:33,599
printing off the the mask holders

00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:35,200
so that it's a little bit easier on your

00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:37,280
ears for the healthcare workers who have

00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:38,960
to wear the masks all day long

00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:40,720
and it's great to have resources like

00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:42,160
carriables where you can find templates

00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:44,000
for things like the face shields you

00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:47,440
were talking about and those aspirators

00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:49,839
along with like mask holders um so

00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:50,720
yeah huge props to the work you're doing

00:57:49,839 --> 00:57:52,799
thank you very much

00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:54,640
and take care everyone in mozilla and

00:57:52,799 --> 00:57:58,720
everyone in japan you'll thank very much

00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:58,720
and andre in the backstage

00:57:58,799 --> 00:58:04,079
and finally melissa how can people

00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:06,880
watching support you and your work

00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:08,079
um thanks i i think um maybe a couple

00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:10,160
different ways you know one

00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:12,079
one is i actually just love this idea

00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:15,520
like how do we get

00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:18,160
um knowledge about our clinical

00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:19,920
data um as we're revealing patterns and

00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:22,799
findings in these large data sets

00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:23,119
into places like wikipedia like how do

00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:26,480
we

00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:29,760
how do we better move knowledge about

00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:31,359
biomedicine into you know or

00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:34,160
our sort of conclusions about

00:58:31,359 --> 00:58:36,960
biomedicine into knowledge

00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:38,640
how how do we do that faster it takes a

00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:40,559
really long time to change

00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:41,760
care guidelines and to deploy things in

00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:43,920
clinical settings

00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:44,960
um but i i would love to see some work

00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:46,640
so if so

00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:48,799
if you're a biomedical person and a

00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:51,359
wikipedia person maybe we could

00:58:48,799 --> 00:58:53,359
um have a chat and think about how do we

00:58:51,359 --> 00:58:54,400
push some of our findings into the into

00:58:53,359 --> 00:58:55,760
the knowledge space so it starts to

00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,799
become part of the fabric of what people

00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:58,640
understand

00:58:56,799 --> 00:59:00,160
more quickly than i think than we have

00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:00,799
been so that was just one idea that i

00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:02,799
had

00:59:00,799 --> 00:59:05,280
the second thing is really just please

00:59:02,799 --> 00:59:08,319
join the n3c everyone is welcome

00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:11,839
we are we were very fortunate to allow

00:59:08,319 --> 00:59:15,280
uh foreign participants as well so

00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:18,079
um you know there's it really takes

00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:19,520
many different kinds of expertise to

00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:21,520
make it go and so

00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:22,880
we we would welcome everyone's

00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:25,200
participation

00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:26,240
and then finally i think if you work in

00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:28,079
pharma or

00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:29,760
in sort of you know commercial

00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:31,520
healthcare context

00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:33,440
really you know think about how you

00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:35,359
might want to leverage this public

00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:36,240
community of practice for analyzing

00:59:35,359 --> 00:59:37,760
these data

00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:39,839
in a collaborative fashion we have some

00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:40,799
really great um pharma participants who

00:59:39,839 --> 00:59:43,280
have been really learning a lot

00:59:40,799 --> 00:59:45,359
alongside our open science enthusiasts

00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:46,640
and and it's really i think you know

00:59:45,359 --> 00:59:48,960
this this handoff

00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:50,720
of like the the learning revealing the

00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:52,720
secrets of the data

00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:54,240
and then handing it off to commercial

00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:55,920
entities who can take it and run with it

00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:58,160
and develop therapies quickly

00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:59,280
um with that foundation of open science

00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:01,359
and collaboration

00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:03,119
like we need to think of the commercial

01:00:01,359 --> 01:00:05,200
partners as really key partners

01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:06,240
and how we and how we do this and and

01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:08,319
some of us who are

01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:10,640
much more deeply on the open science

01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:12,559
translational science side of things are

01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:14,559
are less equipped to understand the best

01:00:12,559 --> 01:00:16,079
ways of delivering

01:00:14,559 --> 01:00:17,760
that that information and those

01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:19,760
partnerships uh to the commercial

01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:22,960
partners so i i guess i would have a

01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:24,880
a call to action to pharma and other um

01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:26,960
commercial partners in the biomedical

01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:28,559
domain to partner with us and help us

01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:32,160
learn how to how to

01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:33,839
you know cross that divide more quickly

01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:35,839
