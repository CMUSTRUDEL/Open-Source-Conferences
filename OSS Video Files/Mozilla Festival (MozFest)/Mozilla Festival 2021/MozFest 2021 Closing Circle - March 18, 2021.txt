and steph is going to share them now in

00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,639
the zoom chat

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,199
welcome to the closing circle of

00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:20,320
mazzfest we are close to

00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,920
but not at the end not only do we have

00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,920
great sessions happening later on

00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,560
tonight and tomorrow we have the culture

00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,320
party

00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,080
from half past three to half past six

00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,199
central european time tomorrow in

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,439
spatial chat

00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,040
and the festival on the plaza will live

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,719
on for another 90 days

00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,800
where you can access recordings and

00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,559
notes of many great sessions

00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,760
and the festival also lives beyond in

00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:40,960
our connections and our new

00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,320
collaborations

00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,440
and in our partnerships that we've made

00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,760
over these last 11 days

00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:51,600
so we opened on the 8th of march with 6

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:54,320
000 participants and 550 sessions

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,120
and in true and ever evolving fashion of

00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,360
mozfest

00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,960
we close out those 12 days with nearly

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,320
10 000 participants

00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:04,159
and 580 sessions i wonder does that make

00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,040
us the largest online event of the last

00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,280
12 months

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,360
i think we need to check that out

00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,560
mossfest has always been about inclusion

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,320
and participation

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,320
but what does that look for us when

00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,080
we're remote and virtual

00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,600
the morning of the 8th of march i was

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,439
still asking myself

00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,840
will people hear the invitation and feel

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:24,000
empowered to make the festival their own

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,560
can a virtual festival meet our needs

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,640
and feel the momentum we need today

00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,600
will there be any sense of joy and will

00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,759
we feel

00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,119
and will we feel elements of surprise

00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,880
and will we see the love from the

00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,520
community and the event

00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,439
now on the 18th of march i firmly say

00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,600
yes to those questions

00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:43,360
yes you know we saw it in the questions

00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,040
from participants and sessions as they

00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,799
explored new learning and sought to

00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,000
deepen their understanding of critical

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,680
issues of internet health and

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,280
trustworthy ai

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,520
yes i heard it in the dialogue and

00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,680
debate talks as they challenged us with

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,880
new ideas and powerful and provocative

00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,360
perspectives

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,560
but i also found this special mosfets

00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,600
community energy

00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,159
in really unexpected places i felt it on

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,960
sunday

00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,560
watching a traditional live baritium

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,280
dance performance by a woman

00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,040
from her home in salem in india while

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,800
someone in her house held a camera that

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,560
followed her motion

00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,800
i felt it as i tried to figure out what

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,720
was happening across project immerse

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,160
i also felt confusion and suspicion but

00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,360
that's a different conversation to have

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,120
with those folks who attended that

00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,280
trailer show

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,800
i saw it in the short video clips shared

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,360
of two young robots running around a

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,680
garden

00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,080
after their youth session i read in the

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,680
tweets and the sketch session notes

00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,319
and i saw it in downloaded family

00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,239
resources now crayons masterpieces

00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,599
i danced to it in mozilla hubs for the

00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,680
battle of flowbots

00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:45,680
and i sat in trolls as someone sang one

00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,599
night in spatial chat

00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,000
i watched in awe of over a thousand

00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,680
people being on the plaza each day

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,920
not in my wildest dreams could i have

00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,200
imagined how this mozfest could turn out

00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,680
and how much you would all make it a

00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,760
reflection of you and who you are

00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,560
we may have provided the tools but you

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,480
created new worlds within them

00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,319
it's so important to remind ourselves

00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,440
after a wondrous 12 days of why we've

00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,040
come together

00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,959
to step back out of the individual

00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,920
moments and sessions and to think of the

00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,680
bigger picture

00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,440
so i asked mark sermon to share that

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,640
with us

00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,560
thank you sarah um so inspiring to hear

00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,400
i just wish i could hear everybody's

00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,720
version of that story

00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,760
uh and what mozfest has dealt with and i

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,599
want to say

00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,360
thank you as a starting point to each

00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:31,280
and every one of you who's here

00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,080
whether you're in the closing circle

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,200
with us or uh out on the the streaming

00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,840
version of it

00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,319
um who attended mozfest this year and i

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,319
think

00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,760
you know similar to sarah i wondered

00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,280
what this would be i worried about what

00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,640
this would be i was excited about what

00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,159
this would be

00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:50,480
and and this was at once not like moss

00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:52,239
fest but so much like moss fest

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,680
and when i think back to the the whole

00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:56,239
10 years before us

00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,319
the virtualness of it was so different

00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,040
but as sarah said it really was made by

00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,280
you

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,120
it was weird it was interesting it was

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,200
critical it was inventive

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,480
and it was in hot pursuit of a better

00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,959
future

00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,720
and that really is the the most fast

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,959
spirit where we kind of come together in

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,640
hot pursuit of a better future

00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,560
i also want to say you know tying it

00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,759
back to some of where mozilla is and

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,079
some of the things we teed up in the

00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:22,160
opening mozilla plenary

00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,680
uh it was exciting to see this core

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:27,520
theme of trustworthy uh

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:30,080
ai cutting across so much of mozfast

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:33,280
as i said in that opening we're seeing

00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:36,320
the need to shift power around data nai

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,280
and the big platforms as a task and as

00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,440
an opportunity

00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,560
similar to the need to shift power

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,400
around the web

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,479
and take on microsoft it is where

00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,080
mozilla cut its teeth and where we were

00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,080
20 years ago

00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,360
and so it's so exciting in that moment

00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,680
where that's how we're

00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,840
seeing the world and that opportunity to

00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,479
see so many different perspectives

00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,400
of how people are coming to those topics

00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:01,360
from so many different angles

00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,720
you know yes to so many different angles

00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,160
and i was impressed by all those

00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,520
different perspectives

00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,120
and the ideas that you brought to the

00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,160
table it would be impossible to list

00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,800
them all

00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,759
but just a couple of highlights to me

00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,919
that kind of

00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,600
showed how every single little corner

00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:18,240
was tied back into

00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,080
something bigger uh as i was wandering

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,199
through mozfest i really loved

00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,680
the opening session that bob did uh on

00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,759
ai

00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,000
and power that talked about the need to

00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,199
decolonize data and ai it was such a

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,160
perfect stage

00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:34,160
for the conversations that that followed

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,759
uh i kind of found myself accidentally

00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,479
wandering into

00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,759
um the talk that deborahgi and camille

00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,479
francois did

00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:44,160
on hunting biased algorithms and it was

00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,199
just such a great example of sort of

00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,360
practically

00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,680
tackling those big picture issues that

00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,759
the bob's panel talked about and you saw

00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,759
those things connecting applying you

00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:56,000
know old cyber security

00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:58,000
tools to the challenges we face today

00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,160
with ai

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,759
and then you know so much of the art

00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,960
across mozfest which i didn't know how

00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:04,960
that would play out

00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,880
digitally and that's really grown and

00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,120
you know under sarah's leadership

00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,479
and so many people contributing as a

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,440
part of mozfast

00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:14,479
and today the mozilla board was there

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,400
with in jonas

00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,400
lund's friendly advice session so we had

00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,840
all the board members there

00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,000
and if you know if you hadn't seen what

00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,680
jonas did it's really a playful way to

00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,240
look at how things like nudging

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,919
and emotion recognition kind of play out

00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,160
and make them transparent

00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,199
uh and you know things like that just

00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,280
you know gave

00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,120
gave everybody in that session such a

00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,360
different way to look at it

00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,800
and finally you know just because i want

00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,000
to make a personal thank you but also

00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,080
really enjoyed it

00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,039
the the talks in the plenary on data and

00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,960
power

00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:50,560
uh and kathleen and james um

00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:52,080
and uh brandi and sarah just so amazing

00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,599
in lifting up those issues i

00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,280
just was such an honor to be on stage

00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:57,520
with you and and hear

00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,280
you talk about such important practical

00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,440
work

00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,960
and i just want to say you know in in

00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,720
ending looking back at all of that and

00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,680
so many other things i wandered into in

00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,080
mozfest

00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,120
it's the hunger to make progress on

00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,000
topics like these

00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,919
topics like bias transparency the power

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,840
dynamics around data

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,039
that very much connect mozilla's work

00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,800
today

00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:21,199
back to the values in the mozilla

00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,880
manifesto which was written almost 15

00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,800
years ago

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,880
and clearly these are topics that

00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,599
resonate and that so many of you are

00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,000
working on

00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,680
and just delightful to see that but i

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,599
think more important than it

00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,120
just being delightful to see that here

00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:37,840
at mozfast and to meet

00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,440
so many of you as i said in the plenary

00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:42,000
our commitment at mozilla

00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,599
is to do everything we can to lift up

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,960
and support the kind of work you are

00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:47,199
doing

00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,800
and that is a key piece of where you

00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,440
know mozfest is a springboard and a

00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,840
place

00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,800
also to come back to so bob is going to

00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,319
say a little bit

00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,360
more in a moment about how we're going

00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,319
to do that how we're going to keep

00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,000
working with you

00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:03,039
but for now i pass it back to sarah

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,960
thanks mark so many of us arrived here

00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,720
unsure of what it was about to unfold

00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,919
and how this virtual event would look

00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,840
and feel

00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,199
so many of us have been to many many

00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,879
mosfets before

00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,560
but there's a huge substantial amount of

00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,800
us who are new and we

00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,039
so we've asked a mix of new and seasoned

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,560
folks to share their experiences of the

00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:24,720
past 11 days

00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,720
alex can you please play our reflections

00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,840
video

00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,640
i'll really remember the work that the

00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,479
sustainability wranglers put into

00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,760
curating the sustainability space this

00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,360
year and

00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,519
the support that we offered the

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,080
facilitators and just seeing them

00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,039
through to their final facilitated

00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,600
sessions

00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,959
and seeing how happy they were when

00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,120
their sessions were really

00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,880
successful and the audience loved what

00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,240
they were presenting to them

00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:56,000
so this was my first moss fest yay i was

00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,040
really really super excited about

00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,480
it i am going to take away with me the

00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,640
movement building

00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,240
um that i witnessed from all the

00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,839
sessions that i attended

00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:09,920
and i realized how interconnected

00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,760
we all are in our experiences to do the

00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,959
internet and ai

00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,360
and just a desire to incorporate more

00:09:13,959 --> 00:09:18,959
intersectionality in

00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:21,839
in my approach and work hi everyone

00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:23,200
my name is zaina and one of my favorite

00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:26,320
things about moss fest

00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,320
this year is that i feel constantly

00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,240
overwhelmed with awe

00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,880
every session that i've attended i felt

00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:36,240
like i'm building something with someone

00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:38,080
and with the group and um i've just

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,080
really appreciated how much

00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,920
uh care and curiosity people have

00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,080
brought to every session

00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,600
and how they deal with each other and

00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:49,040
with each other's ideas

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,000
and projects excited to see you next

00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,000
year

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,680
hi everyone i'm anna and i was a

00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,560
facilitator in the shifting the power

00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,480
space

00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,760
what i take with me is how incredibly

00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,160
participative it was

00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,480
how everyone was so eager to connect to

00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,079
share their experiences and expertise

00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,920
to actually figure out how to shift the

00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:07,839
power in the digital tech sector

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,519
specifically when leading my session

00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,399
everyone was striving for these deeper

00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,880
connections

00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,600
figuring out actionable solutions and

00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,440
ideas

00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,040
and in that sense it went smoothly

00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,480
because every attendee came without

00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,200
attitude for which i'm incredibly

00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,360
grateful

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,720
i came out of this experience inspired

00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,640
and eager to take action

00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,760
hey all my name is pratham ishtavan and

00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,720
i have been wrangling for the

00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:30,320
neurodiversity space in bus fest 2021

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,000
and the thing that you know was

00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,160
surprised uh to me

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,360
or the thing which surprised me the most

00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,760
was that

00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:40,240
we were able to create a physical

00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:42,000
atmosphere inside a virtual environment

00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,760
and i'm really thankful to the entire

00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
mosfet team for having us

00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,959

neurodiversity space

00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:58,480
i felt it was really amazing that an

00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,880
inclusive environment was created

00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,399
just for us so that we can share our

00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,279
knowledge share our tips

00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,000

recorded material will be there

00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:45,440
it's kind of like we figured out the

00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,519
cure for fomo or the fear of missing out

00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,440
so you can go to the plaza and view any

mazdas community i want you to know that

to nurture our work and each other

00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,720
i want to remind you about mozfest slack

00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,040
which will be thriving year round

00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,000
here we will continue to share ways to

00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,079
be involved

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,440
and really we urge you to continue to

00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:31,279
connect with each other

00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:34,000
to share job opportunities in slack

00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:35,920
channels to come to facilitator meetups

00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,279
to learn and help build more sessions

00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,959
throughout the year

00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:40,959
if you don't see a channel you need you

00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:43,040
can create that channel we'll even have

00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:45,040
a shameless self-promotion channel

00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,639
so you can share your greatness to

00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:49,839
everyone and i maybe

00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:51,920
just saw rupaul in my head as i said

00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,519
we're almost at 10 000 ticket holders

00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,200
worldwide

00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,600
but i'd like us to think about what that

00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,959
means to not only have access to people

00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,519
around the world

00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:03,279
who purposefully care and are creating

00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,839
an open and free internet but to get to

00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,959
build with them

00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:07,519
collaborations can and still will be

00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,360
born

00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:12,320
the work and the connections we have

00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:15,519
made here these few days will live on

00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,399
and so we have an opportunity i urge us

00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:19,440
all to take

00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:21,360
to stay connected on email and in slack

00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,040
and i assure you we'll be sharing new

00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,760
events and new opportunities

00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,399

10 days have proven anything it's that

00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:53,839
we're amazing and vast

00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:54,880
and think a million kinds of ways and

00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,760
hold the create

00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,480
creativity to leapfrog past any

00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,360
commercially

00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,000
enforced or societally scripted futures

00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,880
that don't

00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,079
center people our environment and that

00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,800
presuppose where

00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:10,839
and with whom power and resources are

00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,839
supposed to sit

00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:16,240
movements are not just words on a page

00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:17,519
movements are the verb of us the

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,680
commitment of us

00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:21,199
the action we produce by coming together

00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:25,120
in joint purpose

00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:27,600
open free for all

00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,240
so you met us here virtually and we will

00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,480
continue

00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,440
in this world wide web but we also are

00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,279
very excited

00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,199

00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,079
world and i do believe we can

00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,000

00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,760
dj nate nace is soundtracking the global

00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,640
dance floor

00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:30,400
but it is now time to say goodbye and to

00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:33,600
be honest it feels harder to do it this

00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,600
time than any other time

00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,679
maybe it's because we spent nearly two

00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,360
weeks together

00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:42,799
maybe it's because of the preciousness

00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,400
of the community in these turbulent

00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:46,159
times

00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:49,520
so many of you joined us each day on the

00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:51,600
plaza and in sessions and across slack

00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,520
i don't know about you but i am as tired

00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,440
as i would have been after a weekend of

00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,640
raven born stairs and i don't think i've

00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,320
left this chair

00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,600
but i'm ultimately and i'm so filled

00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,280
with gratitude for you all for these

00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,840
last 12 days

00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:06,000
we were unsure how this would work we

00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,799
didn't know who or how many people would

00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,240
show up

00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:11,200
and we were not certain that people

00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:13,679
wanted to spend any more time in zoom

00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,679
but what mozfest is is people the

00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:17,120
community and it's always been

00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:19,200
it's about the joy and the laughter in

00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,640
sessions it's about meeting and learning

00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,559
from our facilitators

00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,080
it's about the connecting the time

00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:25,679
taking the time to listen

00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,120
to read and reply across all our

00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:28,000
participants engaging in all the

00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,880
platforms

00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,640
that makes moss fest what it is thank

00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,880
you for hanging out with us

00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,320
thank you for sharing your work with us

00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:41,039
thank you for trusting us

00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:41,039
and thank you for mozfest 2021

00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,880
alex can you play out our wrap-up video

00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:49,039
i hope to see you all at the culture

00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:52,000
party thank you everyone i hope yes

00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:53,200
we're live you can't really code trust

00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,840
you have to trust

00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:58,400
each other as humans and technology is

00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:01,440
there to support the trust building

00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:04,400
what is done for me without me is done

00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:08,159
against me

00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:11,840
we have to be able to have technology

00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:14,080
and have safe online spaces as well

00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,679
i just refuse to yield that that's not

00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,840
that that cannot be the case

00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:19,919
technological tools will not be able to

00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,520
solve social problems on their own and

00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,640
we really should stop asking them to do

00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:26,320
so

00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:27,200
this year at most fest i met people from

00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:30,400
canada

00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:32,480
uk kenya tunisia

00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:50,320
now it's possible that a few of you feel

00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,760
a bit

00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:56,799
uncomfortable seeing this let's take

00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:58,400
a picture of the good times

00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:00,320
i think there's a lot of interesting

00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,640
opportunities with the way in which

00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,360
harnessing artificial intelligence can

00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,960
enrich

00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:08,880
what you're making
