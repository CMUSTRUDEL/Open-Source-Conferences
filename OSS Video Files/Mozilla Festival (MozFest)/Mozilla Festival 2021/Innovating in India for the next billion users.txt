first

uh not just in india but

00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:40,720
and beyond um so to kick off this

00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,920
discussion

00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,880
uh vijay you know we've been you know

00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,680
we're talking about

00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,959
bringing you know how do we serve the

00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,399
next billion users

00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,680
and i think one of the things that's

00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,040
really interesting about what you've

00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,360
been doing is you've been taking up

00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:57,360
taking up a bottom-up approach to this

00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,720
um and you've built what some people

00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,759
describe as

00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:03,920
a twitter network for rural india

00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:05,679
and you're really focusing on a you know

00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,720
illiterate and semi-literate population

00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:09,760
who have

00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,760
important information needs but literacy

00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:14,559
and access has always stood in the way

00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:16,160
for them could you perhaps tell us about

00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:19,839
how this idea came about

00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,839
and what you were trying to solve

00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:25,039
uh thank you so much and uh wonderful to

00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:28,559
be on this panel

00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:31,280
uh truly proud to be here on this panel

00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:32,559
very glad so yeah i think uh drama needs

00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,120
spoken as you rightly said

00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:36,960
is to reverse the flow of information

00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,160
and this is by this is primarily to

00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,480
address the information

00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,080
asymmetry that largely right so if we

00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,320
indeed call information as

00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:46,000
power then more than half the population

00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,480
of the countries deprived of access

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,240
to credible contextual and timely

00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,480
information right so and

00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,480
this all the more becomes pertinent in

00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,919
the case of the most marginalized and

00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,840
underserved communities

00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,600
when the most commercial media platforms

00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,080
would largely focus on a top-down

00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,799
approach

00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,080
and be focused on information that is

00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:06,640
more of a broadcast

00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,240
uh information and also an opportunity

00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,400
to participate in the diet

00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,720
in the dialogue in the conversations on

00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,120
topics that impact their lives there are

00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,520
very

00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:17,440
limited or rather uh no channels that

00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,960
are available that really empower these

00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,520
communities right so our

00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,000
primary focus our main objective was

00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,280
that

00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,240
our belief was that a lot of these gaps

00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,400
or issues are

00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,919
because of conventional ideologies or

00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,600
conventional

00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:33,440
systems or situations where people have

00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,880
not got an opportunity to

00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,559
uh you know either through literacy

00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,080
issues or access to information or

00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:40,240
technology related issues

00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,679
or access to media related issues now

00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,280
what we are trying to do that we believe

00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,559
that you know a lot of these issues can

00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,640
be solved through

00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:48,720
good policy but these good policies in a

00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,280
democratic setup have to be demanded by

00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,039
people

00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:53,200
and if people have to demand for these

00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:54,960
services or better access to services

00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,160
then they have to be better informed

00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,360
right so if they have to be better

00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,440
informed then then

00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,280
we need participative media platforms

00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,360
platforms that can enable people

00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:06,160
not just to understand why these gaps

00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:08,240
arise but also be able to debate ask and

00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,840
demand for many of these services the

00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,360
very objective gram gambani was to

00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,280
reverse this whole process right so

00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,360
before a conventional top-down approach

00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,480
to uh to reversing that whole process

00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,640
and be able to

00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,520
hear these voices listen to them to what

00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,280
they want to say

00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,640
and to be able to contribute these

00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,960
learnings and insights

00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,280
back to the ecosystem in terms of policy

00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:29,280
level interventions and also be able to

00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,320
impact uh you know people both at an

00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,000
individual level

00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,600
uh community level and at an

00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,799
institutional level and

00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,000
while seeing the lowest common

00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:39,919
denominator for the mobile penetration

00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,080
growing amongst this target population

00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:44,000
very widely they believe that white was

00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,600
the very logical and the lowest common

00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,280
denominator to start off with

00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,799
and people with a simple feature phone

00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,400
they could just give a missed call

00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:52,240
they get a call back from the platform

00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,600
and it is almost uh you know

00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,440
you know created in the form of an

00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,160
interactive radio where people access

00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,679
information

00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,440
and they are also able to engage with

00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,960
the platform in terms of not just

00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,159
listening to information but also be

00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,080
able to ask questions

00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,760
share their opinions and that's exactly

00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,880
why you rightly said it's almost like

00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,799
the twitter of the root

00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,120
of the hinterland right so and that's

00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:11,760
how rambani's whole mission has been

00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,480
driven

00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:16,080
so our what we're working right now is

00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,000
not just to empower people with access

00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,159
to information and an opportunity to

00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,200
participate but also be able to take it

00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:23,200
further to

00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,640
a logical uh you know destination in

00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,919
terms of impact or change

00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,080
by collaborating with concerned

00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:30,799
stakeholders on the ground

00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:33,039
so so that that's where gramani's whole

00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:35,280
mission has begun and continues to work

00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:37,760
towards

00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,440
that's fascinating so when you're

00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,039
describing this voice system where

00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,640
somebody gets a call back from your

00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:45,200
system and can just talk

00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,760
um to the platform what does that mean

00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,440
so

00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:51,520
somebody calls and they ask a question

00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,360
or they want some information what what

00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,960
happens then

00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,720
think of it almost like a social media

00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,640
platform right so but it's all unwise

00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,400
where people give a missed call

00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,000
to the mobile bani number we call it

00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,240
mobile vani the federated network

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,679
of community media platforms so each

00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,080
community or each district

00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:09,120
geography or team base have a dedicated

00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,640
instance

00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,080
and a mobile number that is mapped to

00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,600
that instance so people in that

00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,159
community give a missed call to that

00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,159
number

00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:17,520
they get a call back from our platform

00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,960
and they pick up the call and they

00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,360
listen to it like a radio

00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:23,440
they they they navigate through content

00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,520
that is packaged in the form of channels

00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,280
for example one of the district channels

00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,640
which is called jamie mobile bani jamui

00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,480
the district in bihar

00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,679
uh you know province in bihar so people

00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:35,039
will call that number

00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:35,039
they are welcome by by saying that

00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,720
welcome to mobile money and they are

00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,400
able to to

00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,000
interact with or engage with the system

00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,559
by listening to information

00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,080
pressing one to shift channels by

00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:47,840
pressing two to

00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:50,400
record their question or record their

00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:52,000
opinion if people record their question

00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,960
or opinion on the back end we have a

00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,120
moderation team

00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,960
the responses that we collate with the

00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,400
help of our expert teams or with our

00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,919
partner network as well

00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,760
and when it is posted back on the

00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,280
platform just like on social media

00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,799
people are not just able to see the

00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,520
information but they are also able to

00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:07,120
see the

00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,880
questions and the responses that are

00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,200
provided along with those comments or

00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,200
that's

00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,960
those pieces of information that allows

00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,360
for community sharing of knowledge as

00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,960
well

00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,480
right and that's why it is almost like a

00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,559
social media but on voice

00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,240
and people listening to their own voices

00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:21,600
is truly empowering right so people in

00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,320
the community when they listen to their

00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,080
voices

00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,760
they're able to record grievances these

00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,280
grievances are shared so we actually

00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,480
work with a very strong network of

00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,559
community volunteers

00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,400
who actually are our eyes and you know

00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:34,720
feet and ears on the ground

00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,919
and they help us create the trust and

00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,120
the connect with the concerned

00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:38,640
communities we work with

00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,640
we believe that the communities have to

00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,039
own these platforms only then will there

00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,960
be

00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:44,559
sustainable and long-term change right

00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,400
so we cannot come from outside and

00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:47,360
understand the context of their issues

00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,880
or their problems

00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,559
it is only when the communities take

00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,400
ownership of these technologies or these

00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:54,240
platforms will there be sustainable

00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,600
and long-term change so these volunteers

00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,240
play that critical role of

00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:00,480
connecting us to these uh communities

00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,159
and contributing hyper local news

00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,080
by sharing these grievances with local

00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:06,000
authorities coordinating with them

00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,840
ensuring these grievances are addressed

00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,880
so those stories are recorded back on

00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,120
the platform

00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,880
inspiring other people right and that is

00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,720
how the collective action is created

00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,640
through these community media platforms

00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,200
which are participatory media platforms

00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,799
helping

00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,720
the community to not just become

00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:22,400
informed take informed decisions

00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:25,760
but also be able to drive collective

00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:27,600
action across the community as well

00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,600
that's fascinating and you know as we as

00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,440
we think more about local community and

00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,520
what that means and how we

00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,880
hold information ecosystems for them i

00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,080
think what you're building plays such an

00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:40,080
important

00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:42,240
important component of that

00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:44,480
you know by talking of community i guess

00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,080
supriya what you're building with josh

00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,240
is building community as well but

00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,679
focused on a different segment

00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,760
and with somewhat different approach i

00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,360
know you've just crossed one billion

00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,520
views on your platform

00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,799
um for your talks in you know about 10

00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:59,360
different languages

00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:00,720
um and your focus has very much been on

00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:03,120
the youth of india

00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,240
um so tell us a bit about why how did

00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,600
you start this you know because it's

00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,440
grown tremendously

00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,039
um you're obviously touching a lot of

00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:12,320
people

00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:14,000
sure so um you know um we sort of

00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,200
started jewish talks stemming from our

00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,880
own frustration

00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,880
showbit and i we were in our final year

00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,159
of college and we were super confused

00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,159
about what to do in life

00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,679
what stream to choose what subjects to

00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:25,120
take up what career profession to

00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:27,120
actually go into

00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,799
um and one of the things that we found

00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,559
at that time was that we always had to

00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:31,919
seek to the west for inspiration we

00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:33,200
always had to look at steve jobs

00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:34,880
commencement speech

00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,880
to motivate us to actually get up and

00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,559
you know take the entrepreneurial path

00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,919
but for people who were studying with us

00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:41,679
in college and i studied in delhi

00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:43,440
university who were coming from all

00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:44,400
parts of the country from all types of

00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,799
economic

00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,640
backgrounds there was no way for them to

00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:50,559
get access to role models

00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,640
so that's what we started josh with the

00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:54,480
idea was super simple that how can we

00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,480
basically create a platform that gives

00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,320
rural youth access to role models

00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,600
so people who look like them talk like

00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,600
them in their own language

00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,360
and people whose impact is relative to

00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,200
what they want to do in their life

00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:07,679
for example for somebody who's sitting

00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,600
in a small town in sage harkand

00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:12,480
he doesn't want to he doesn't aspire to

00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:14,480
be you know ritesh agarwal or the ceo of

00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,559
which is a big startup in india he

00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,240
aspires to be a local shopkeeper and

00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:19,760
earn 50 000 rupees so that he can

00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,520
provide for his family

00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,440
but that's not the the story that he

00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,840
hears on a regular basis the stories he

00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,919
hears

00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,039
are of you know local goons etc in that

00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:29,039
particular village

00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:30,640
and those are his role models so that's

00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:32,480
what we tried to do you know bring out

00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,960
positive stories from the grassroots of

00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,799
india

00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:38,880
across multiple vernacular languages and

00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:41,279
we started off with events and now it's

00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:43,600
a completely online based community

00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:44,640
we put out close to i think 180 talks

00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:47,039
every month

00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,320
um and the viewership is growing and now

00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:50,559
what we're also

00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:52,799
working on is that this community that

00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:54,559
we've built who's super inspired and you

00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:56,559
know aspires to be someone

00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:57,600
how can we connect them or how can we

00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:59,600
how can we connect them with

00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,120
opportunities and how can we also equip

00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,400
them with the right skill sets to be

00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,240
able to do well in life

00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,080
so the next phase of actually becoming

00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,520
employable or becoming the career path

00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,600
that they choose

00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:12,720
they chose for themselves so that's what

00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,720
we're working on currently

00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,039
and it seems that you know as you've

00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,640
been thinking about this and building us

00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:20,559
what what struck me

00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,640
was you know you were really looking at

00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:24,320
two things that people needed

00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,080
one was you know sort of the confidence

00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:29,120
to think they could do something

00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:30,400
um which perhaps wasn't uh that

00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,559
wasn't something they were expected to

00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:34,240
do or their families expected them to do

00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:36,960
um you know because of you know the way

00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:38,720
things are passed down by generation

00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,320
and also to give them the information to

00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,039
sort of break out of the cycle of you

00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,840
know just

00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:44,320
what's that next bit of information um

00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,080
that could

00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,440
perhaps change their lives and change

00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,159
the trajectory of their family which

00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,480
wasn't

00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:52,400
you know go and become the ceo somewhere

00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,480
but rather you know do something

00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,440
um join the army or join the police

00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,120
force or become a

00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,559
you know you connected them with

00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:01,840
something that was quite

00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:03,600
achievable um as a next step

00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,360
absolutely so you know the entire

00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,960
approach that we follow till now is that

00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,880
how can we play the role of an elder

00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,720
brother or bodybuilder as we call it

00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,480
in this entire journey for this person

00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,440
who has probably not had that person

00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,000
guide them

00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,520
um so you know uh even in terms of for

00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,039
example if you look at the demographic

00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,440
that we cater to english isn't a

00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:22,640
language for them english is a skill

00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,320
and they don't know that they need

00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,520
english for jobs eventually so by the

00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,679
time that they realize it they're

00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:29,200
already 23 24 years old and they're not

00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,159
able to move ahead in life because of

00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,679
this barrier

00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:33,360
so the next product that we're actually

00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:35,600
working on is a product that teaches

00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:37,600
people how to speak in english fluently

00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,640
so the idea is to you know sort of

00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,559
occupy this

00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,760
uh journey of a young person right from

00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:43,679
the time that they turn

00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,919
13 and start thinking about what to do

00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:47,760
in life till the time that they're 25

00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:49,520
which is like the time that people think

00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,240
we are settled in india or so-called

00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,600
settle

00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,600
and just help them with tools and

00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:57,039
products along the way that

00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,039
a father would do for us

00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,760
well then clearly it's been received

00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:03,360
quite well

00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,120
by the youth are there any are there any

00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:08,159
success stories that

00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:10,480
you've come across um that

00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:11,600
you think really exemplifies what uh

00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,840
what josh talks

00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:18,240
is doing absolutely so you know uh

00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:20,240
from um like from the impact of the

00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,720
talks so for example somebody in madhya

00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,880
pradesh watched a story of a local

00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,760
sarpanch or a person who holds a village

00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,440
level post

00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:29,039
and he decided to contest the election

00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,720
in his village that year because he was

00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:32,080
super inspired about how politics could

00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,679
bring about change

00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,200
there have been stories of people you

00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:36,559
know who switched career streams

00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,000
completely because they realized that

00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:40,159
what they were doing and what they

00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,399
wanted to do was two different things

00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:44,320
um you know there is a tv survivor who

00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:45,679
got motivated by one of the stories and

00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,440
now he has a support group for

00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:48,960
tuberculosis survivors and he's helping

00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,799
them get by in life

00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,480
and then more tangible is on the the

00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:54,240
skills level where people have been able

00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,919
to learn english and because of that

00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,760
either they've got employed for the very

00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:58,240
first time or people who are earning say

00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,960
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,799
000 to 20 000 rupees now after being

00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,960
able to communicate effectively are now

00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:06,799
earning between 25 to 30 000

00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:09,679
so that has changed their household

00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:09,679
income drastically

00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:14,000
well that's fantastic perhaps let's

00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,720
shift gears and

00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,240
go to syria you know when i first

00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,159
started looking at what sari was

00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,320
building i couldn't access it

00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:25,120
because it was catering for a very

00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:26,559
specific community and audience

00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,799
inside you now you're sitting with over

00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:30,880
21 million women in your network

00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:32,159
um and it really you know provides a

00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:35,840
safe space for

00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:38,159
women to learn share but also earn

00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:40,000
an income how did you how did you get

00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:42,640
here how did you what what what led you

00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,640
to start this

00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:48,480
well i think uh so india's gender gap is

00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:50,320
known to all that's not new at all every

00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,520
year when davos happens i think one of

00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:55,039
the things

00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:57,760
that glaringly stands out is how this

00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:59,360
this aspirational economy that wants to

00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:01,679
be a trillion dollar economy

00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,559
uh has has the largest gender gap in the

00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:05,600
world so

00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:06,480
it's damn glaring but but but to me the

00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:11,120
big thesis

00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:14,159
is as and it comes more into our lives

00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:16,799
and as more and more women get onto the

00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:20,080
smartphone they get onto data packs

00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:22,320
uh this is the biggest a tool for

00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,600
social and financial mobility that they

00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,840
have access to

00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:27,440
i think for women uh the biggest

00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:30,720
challenge is not just

00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,279
uh not just patriarchy but also social

00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,760
structure

00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:35,440
social mobility both physical mobility

00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:37,200
and moving up the value chain in your

00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,360
life is a very very hard ask

00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:41,279
so what are we doing here we created a

00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:43,360
women-only space because culturally

00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:45,120
women only space is a thing

00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:47,120
women only communities have done

00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:49,039
extremely well in india

00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,880
whether it was microfinance or whether

00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:54,159
it was companies like amul or

00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:56,480
fab india or women only networks like

00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:58,799
common body workers or russia workers

00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,840
so we have a tradition of women only and

00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:01,840
and here now

00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,120
these are women who are coming online

00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,559
when i started shiro's

00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,320
i think the number of women online was

00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:08,240
10 10 11 12 million

00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,840
something that was minuscule and our

00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,519
first business plan said we'll get to

00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,480
one million women and then everybody can

00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:15,600
ipo

00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:18,320
but uh here we are at almost uh touching

00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:21,360
25 million you know in this quarter

00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:23,519
and we hope to get to like a hundred uh

00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,559
but the big tailwind that we're riding

00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:27,600
is that india

00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:30,240
latched on to the data revolution

00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:31,679
the whatsapp revolution and digital

00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,760
payments revolution

00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:35,919
and there's no stopping anybody who's

00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:37,279
tasted tested the internet you know it's

00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:39,360
a personal device

00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:40,799
it's your own name out there so what are

00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,600
we building when a woman comes to

00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:45,200
shiro's

00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:46,000
she has she one finds her own identity

00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,840
she uses her

00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,200
space it's her version of linkedin it's

00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:51,679
her version of gmail

00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,440
it's her version of clubhouse uh second

00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:55,039
is she finds this big network of other

00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:57,840
women of champions of

00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:59,279
organizations uh any a lot of people who

00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:01,519
are supporting them and of course that's

00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:04,320
the job that shiros does as curator

00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:05,919
third is access to well-being we we run

00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,919
a helpline which is our

00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:09,600
our biggest you can call it a growth

00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:10,880
hack but it's also our retention tool

00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,679
and acquisition tool and all of

00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,519
everything

00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:15,200
over two million women have availed a

00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:17,360
free counseling via that and

00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,399
when i was when i said counseling it is

00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:21,200
ask us anything

00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:22,880
ask us about careers or relationship or

00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:25,840
whatever you need to talk about

00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:27,679
and for this access to income by

00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:29,200
employment and entrepreneurship

00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:30,960
which is a big gap i mean we all know

00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,840
india seven percent women in workforce

00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,519
numbers and

00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,880
and given the state of the economy job

00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:36,399
growth hasn't happened in a while so we

00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,519
are relying more on entrepreneurial

00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:39,760
opportunities

00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:41,519
so to to a woman this is her internet

00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:43,279
calling card this is her club membership

00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:45,279
that she's not going to sort of give up

00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:46,640
and and once she's within the shiro's

00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:48,720
ecosystem

00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,799
she will only benefit from it the system

00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:52,240
is designed to work in her favor

00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:54,159
and of course it's built on a lot of

00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:57,120
tech it's built on platforms

00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:58,320
it's built for scale uh and everybody is

00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,399
welcome and i think

00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:02,240
the the most interesting part about

00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:04,080
cheetos is that it may sound like that

00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:07,039
we're talking a lot of serious stuff

00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:11,840
here but to a user she's just walking

00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:11,840
into an app

00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:21,519
i think cyrus internet connection

00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,960
she's currently in a village in india

00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:26,320
where the connection isn't great

00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:29,039
so she'll dial in in a moment

00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:31,760
um perhaps while she's reconnecting we

00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:34,799
had a question from philip conrad

00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:38,159
um who uh

00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:39,760
what a question for you supriya um and

00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:42,399
do you connect people locally on a

00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:45,600
personal level or digitally

00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:47,440
so um it's digitally so uh our primary

00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,960
tool of distribution for the talks is

00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,559
youtube which is where you know

00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,720
uh like mohammed said earlier we've done

00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:54,640
about 1 billion views cumulatively

00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,559
and the same viewer who's watching us on

00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:58,320
youtube is now funneled down to our own

00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:59,840
android application which is called your

00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,360
skills where they're learning skills

00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:03,440
that can help them get jobs

00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:05,519
so the skills app is a more personalized

00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:07,360
experience like we use a whatsapp style

00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:08,639
chat based interface to teach

00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,320
and that's where they can connect with

00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:11,919
each other uh there's also a calling

00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,599
feature where you can speak to anybody

00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:14,960
else who's also learning english just to

00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:16,800
help you improve

00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,839
so that's where more of the community

00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:21,119
building and the connection actually

00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:24,240
happens

00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:26,560
great um sorry it looks like you may be

00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,560
back

00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:32,879
yes i'm back sorry

00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,839
do you want to go ahead and finish that

00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:36,480
thought

00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:37,919
yes basically i was saying yes so

00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,760
basically i was saying that

00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:41,839
she was just a safe space for women to

00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:43,760
nurture and grow and

00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:45,520
hang out i think we all do well when we

00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:47,679
are not judged and i think people are

00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:49,440
smart enough to figure out their options

00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:51,679
so on one hand we're just creating a

00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,720
safe space uh and learning from peers

00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:55,440
and on the other hand

00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:56,560
we are obviously lining up resources so

00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,480
we run a remote

00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:00,000
business women work from home they work

00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,720
for large companies and the whole

00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,119
transaction

00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:05,040
stack is shiro's similarly hershey comes

00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:07,119
where women are

00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:08,880
micro entrepreneurs and they did they

00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:09,680
they kind of own shops and cheetos and

00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:13,119
distribute

00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:13,599
uh a lot of d2c brands so we at heart

00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:15,440
we're

00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:16,640
really now we're leveraging all these

00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,280
levers that

00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:20,320
plow it back into the community and and

00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,960
that's why

00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:24,320
there is a very strong network effect uh

00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,800
you know women go and tell

00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:28,160
other women they tell their friends uh

00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,839
and and and it's

00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:31,359
almost like a super app it's a term i

00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:34,560
don't like but they get to do

00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:36,480
a lot of things with the same login

00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:38,640
you know one of the you know i want to

00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,760
come back uh on the business side and

00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,560
you know some of the comments you're

00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,720
enabling

00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:44,000
a bit later i mean in our conversation

00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:47,040
but you know one of the things that

00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,640
struck me i heard you on a talk uh

00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:50,400
just before this one i you know i know

00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:52,480
you you're going from back to back uh

00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,440
public talks but uh one of the things

00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:56,000
that really struck me

00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,960
is you told the story um about when you

00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,000
were leaving school

00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,880
um and uh about how empathy was so

00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,800
important uh

00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,160
and with some feedback you had gotten

00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,560
from a teacher um

00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:08,160
and how you were using that when you you

00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:10,000
know quite uh

00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:11,520
you know you know when you were building

00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,520
this platform it was you know you were

00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:15,119
really thinking about the empathy

00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,800
um to be built into it and i thought

00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:18,160
that was quite fascinating um

00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,839
especially in this day and age when we

00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:22,480
seeing so much uh

00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:24,240
uh you know uh all the things that we

00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:27,839
see with our social media and how it's

00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:27,839
supporting divisiveness

00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:31,760
absolutely i think empathy is at the

00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,440
core of building

00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,359
you know i think building for the next

00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,240
billion needs a lot of empathy you know

00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:38,640
otherwise

00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:39,599
uh you know we're not going to get there

00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:43,119
also

00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:45,839
uh look i think uh we we are a country

00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:46,640
that that is uh that has a huge

00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:49,520
population

00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:51,839
and very little resources so if we if we

00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,160
if we do not practice kindness overall i

00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:56,560
think

00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:56,560
uh we are setting ourselves up very far

00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,480
absolutely and i think it's some of

00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,640
those lessons

00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:04,960
uh which we're learning you know in

00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:07,280
india and you know as we as we build

00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,079
in this market that you know need to be

00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,839
um

00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:11,599
taken back you know superior spoke about

00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:13,680
how you know we'd look to the

00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:14,960
look to the us for inspiration for lots

00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,560
of the products we're building and we're

00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,880
trying to find local

00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:20,400
uh you know locally made role models and

00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:23,839
you know ideas and i think it's time to

00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,839
export some of these

00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:28,079
speaking of which samir you've you've

00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:30,240
both scrolled at i am

00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:31,680
one of the most important news and

00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:34,290
information

00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:35,599
players in the indian market

00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:37,040
[Music]

00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:38,560
so you know i'd love for you to tell us

00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,760
a little bit about that but then to

00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,440
really tell us about what you're

00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:43,680
building with scrollstack

00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:45,839
um you know because it seems like you

00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:47,119
know you've been working on news and now

00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:50,400
you're really looking at

00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:51,920
how to empower makers and creators

00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,680
you know and give them the tools to

00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,960
thrive which i think you know

00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,960
approaches this topic somewhat

00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:59,200
differently from

00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:04,320
you know thinking about a traditional

00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:07,599
news operation

00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:09,760
yeah no so so the scroll stack in a way

00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:11,520
flows uh you know directly out you know

00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:14,720
out of the experience i had in

00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:15,200
um trying to get school uh to scale

00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:18,079
which

00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,640
uh you know some of you know is uh 10 12

00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:21,599
million

00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,920
unique visitors a month uh fairly large

00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:25,200
uh

00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:26,480
and slowly built out um organization and

00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:30,000
audience which is very

00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:32,400
uh what would i say loyal uh and uh

00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,839
in building that uh you know the paradox

00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,520
that is the heart of the internet right

00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:35,760
now is very clear to anybody who tries

00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,359
to

00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,520
try to build or tries to build a media

00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:41,359
company which is the paradox being there

00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:44,240
are very large audiences on the one hand

00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:46,560
for many individuals or publications or

00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:47,599
what have you uh but it is really hard

00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:50,160
to monetize it

00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:51,680
right so on the one hand uh leave alone

00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:54,880
just cruel but even

00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:57,040
even there are creators who may have uh

00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:58,079
you know audiences on instagram that are

00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:00,480
bigger than

00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:01,839
fashion magazines there are uh creators

00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:04,240
who have podcasts each

00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:05,680
bigger than radio stations and it is

00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:08,560
really difficult because

00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:09,440
the entire model has been ad supported

00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,280
so that was the

00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,480
idea behind scroll stack and in that way

00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:15,280
is a direct link to

00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:17,440
uh you know my experience is scroll uh

00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,640
and then the second paradox is uh

00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,800
where cyrie and others have been

00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:23,839
pointing out that india has

00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:25,760
its own uh you know creator economy

00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:26,960
its own issues with languages and

00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,960
there's almost like

00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:31,040
the the fact that sixty percent of the

00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:33,119
world's internet content is in

00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:34,240
english um you know you take a language

00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:36,960
like hindi

00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:37,920
with half a billion um uh you know

00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,839
speakers

00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:42,480
it has less than it's not even in the

00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:45,040
top twenty uh you know by content

00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,640
uh you know languages on the internet

00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:48,560
and some of it is because of video and

00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:50,800
video has taken over the net but

00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:52,560
a lot of useful information a lot of

00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:55,680
things that are text

00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:56,000
or images or you know explanatory video

00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,920
plus

00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,160
text is just simply not there because

00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:02,240
it's very hard to sustain that activity

00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:04,240
so those are the two things uh again

00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:05,520
they come directly from my experience

00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:07,680
with scroll

00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:09,520
which scrollstack is trying to solve uh

00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:11,200
which is to actually make it very very

00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:14,319
simple for anybody

00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:17,119
uh to create um on

00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:17,760
the internet decide how much it will be

00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:19,520
for

00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:21,119
and then charge anybody in the world

00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,599
right which is the third part of what i

00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:24,480
would say

00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:26,480
since we're talking about india i think

00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,839
famously india's gdp in india is almost

00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:30,240
the same as india's gdp

00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:32,720
outside india from all the expats so i

00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:34,720
think a lot of indian creators would be

00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:37,040
very well served by being able to offer

00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:38,560
their creativity to the world

00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:40,160
so in fact we think those are going to

00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:42,079
be one of some of the early adopters of

00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:44,079
school stack as a platform

00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:45,680
um so yeah so with that i'll stop if you

00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:47,280
have questions but that's roughly the

00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:49,760
idea of scroll stack

00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:51,200
and uh the idea is that again coming

00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,240
from india is mobile first it's

00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,760
multilingual

00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:56,560
and it allows any creator to charge

00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,560
anywhere in the world

00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,760
did we lose

00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:07,200
and you think i'd know how to unmute

00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:09,920
myself by now um

00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:11,599
after spending a year on zoom so samir

00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:13,599
when you know somebody signs up

00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:15,040
comes and joins scrollstep what what are

00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:16,240
they really doing what's

00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,839
what's the reason that they're coming

00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,880
there so you're saying it's multilingual

00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:21,599
you're saying

00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:24,720
um they can make payments um what are

00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:24,720
they actually going to see and do

00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:28,560
yeah so what we find now you know we

00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,160
have been up

00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:32,319
in open beta for a while and we have

00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:33,839
almost 2000 creators so i can actually

00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:35,280
answer that question empirically and as

00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:38,640
well as what we think they will

00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:40,079
i we want them to do uh so the first

00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,920
thing is that if today you want to

00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:44,960
actually create something online and

00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:46,560
uh you know be your own brand kind of

00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,920
graduate from social media there are a

00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,440
lot of people that are like again

00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:51,040
famously india has more people on social

00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,880
media than any other country

00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:54,960
uh we see this as a graduation from

00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,839
social media to create your own identity

00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,359
online

00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:59,040
uh the counterfactual for them is to

00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:01,520
create either a website

00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:03,440
or an especially e-commerce enabled

00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:05,359
website would cost you a few lakh rupees

00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:07,040
we are bringing that cost down to zero

00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:07,760
right so if you wanted to make a vix or

00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:10,880
a

00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:13,119
uh square space or any of that uh you

00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:15,680
don't have to do any of that

00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:16,560
the integration with the payments is

00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:18,400
already there

00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:19,839
you will you can get global payments

00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,359
anytime right so that's like

00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:23,040
foundationally the thing it's

00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:24,640
it's creating your own voice creating

00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:26,400
your own brand on the net

00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:28,079
uh where you are in control of

00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,359
everything you're in control of your ip

00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:32,160
you're in control of

00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:33,599
uh who sees your uh your content whoever

00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:35,440
you distribute it to

00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:37,280
you're in control of the email list and

00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:39,280
phone numbers that you you know gather

00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:40,880
on your site right so that's that's the

00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:43,200
foundational element

00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:45,119
uh the second is that we are seeing that

00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:46,640
our idea is that anybody who has more

00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:49,119
than a thousand followers

00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:51,520
um on social media that's a group of

00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:53,839
almost 100 million people globally right

00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:55,040
uh and that is actually an under

00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:58,079
counting because

00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:59,680
uh it is thousand maybe a random

00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:01,200
you know cut off because there are a lot

00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,960
of people who may have very large

00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,599
followership on whatsapp which we don't

00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:06,960
see

00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:08,480
um so so our target audience is that

00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,240
like people who want to graduate from

00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:12,960
social media for their own reason for

00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:14,560
you know uh being able to control their

00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:17,359
content their brand their

00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:19,920
ability to gather their followers into

00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:21,920
supporters and then maybe charge for it

00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:23,520
and then the second is that there are

00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:25,520
hundreds of millions of them and that

00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:26,880
that group is just growing so that's

00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,880
that's what um

00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,720
we expect to happen and what we are

00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:32,319
seeing is some of that pattern already

00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:33,440
many of the people the earliest people

00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:35,040
to make money

00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:37,200
on scrolls that are people who are

00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:40,640
selling uh a fictional story

00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:41,520
uh writing fashion tips or you know skin

00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:44,240
care tips

00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:45,839
uh writing um you know the more

00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:49,040
traditional economics

00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:50,640
blogs so we we what we see will happen

00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,200
are these people could not have made

00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:53,440
money on

00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:55,040
any other platform right so the way we

00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:56,319
see it i said there are 100 million

00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:58,319
creators right now

00:43:56,319 --> 00:44:00,160
and all the creator platforms are

00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:00,640
targeted at trying to solve the problem

00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,640
of the

00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:04,640
top one or two percent with their

00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,200
newsletter solutions or patreon with

00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:07,599
like

00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:08,560
very high barriers to being able to uh

00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:10,880
do something

00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:12,640
our idea is to solve the problem for the

00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:14,319
rest of the 98 percent and we are seeing

00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,880
some of that already on the platform

00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:18,319
right

00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:20,000
again no friction to starting up uh no

00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:21,599
uh you know limitation if you know

00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,400
social media you know how to use girl

00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:24,800
stack

00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,760
and you can be anywhere in the world so

00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,440
so that's really

00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:31,680
our sort of what we are building this

00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:31,680
for for the 98 of the creator economy

00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:37,040
that's that's fascinating so just before

00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:38,640
before we move uh forward we've got a

00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:40,720
question in the chat and just to remind

00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:42,400
everybody in the zoom room with us

00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:44,079
um if you've got any questions to our

00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:45,280
panelists you can pop it into the

00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:48,880
comment box

00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:51,200
uh which is where we'll pick it up hanan

00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,720
asks uh cyril do you have any examples

00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:56,240
of how shiro's connects women

00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:56,240
entrepreneurs to the broader market

00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:01,920
oh absolutely so um actually we work

00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:04,560
with the entrepreneurs uh

00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:05,200
in different cohorts so the first cohort

00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:08,079
is uh

00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:10,319
women who do not have any products of

00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:12,240
their own but they're very enterprising

00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:13,680
they do not have capital to invest in a

00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:17,280
business

00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:20,400
so that's where uh what we do is we

00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:21,520
bring the inventory of each brands into

00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:24,400
our ecosystem

00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:25,119
uh a very very negotiated preferred rate

00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:28,240
so

00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:30,800
so there is an upside for them and

00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:33,359
and what she really ends up getting is a

00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:36,640
uh is a platform on zeros which is a

00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:38,640
social platform so uh we all know that

00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:40,079
commerce is going social the future of

00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:42,480
commerce is social

00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:44,800
transactional commerce is on its way out

00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:47,200
and what what's really happening here is

00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:48,160
not only women are able to access their

00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:50,800
peers as

00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:52,880
as potential customers uh they also

00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:54,400
access the extended network and

00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:55,920
and what they end up doing is also

00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:57,839
building like a

00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:59,040
internet presence for themselves so

00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:02,400
these are uh

00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:04,640
these are women uh who are were possibly

00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,680
only use whatsapp you know they they are

00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:08,960
women who have never

00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:10,640
before uh either ventured out or

00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:12,160
you know they they don't own any

00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:14,720
property or capital

00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:16,560
and this way they basically by by having

00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:16,960
a smartphone they have a business you

00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,560
know

00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:20,160
and some of them earn as much as

00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:22,560
thousand dollars a month or

00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:24,240
two dollars a month uh you know when

00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:27,359
they get get onto it

00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:28,000
and and pretty income uh you know in in

00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:29,520
india

00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,200
the other state of entrepreneurs are

00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:33,280
women who are building up

00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:35,119
you know capital intensive businesses

00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:36,960
and what we've done now is

00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:39,440
created partnerships with a lot of

00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,560
partners google is a partner microsoft

00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:43,040
is a partner

00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:44,400
uk india is a part yes bank is a

00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:46,560
unilever as a partner

00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:47,920
and what we really do is we run various

00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:51,520
cohorts of

00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:54,000
uh accelerators depending on the

00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:54,880
on the on the market on the segment so

00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,400
it could be rural

00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:58,240
women entrepreneurs it could be women

00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:00,319
entrepreneurs building businesses

00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:01,599
that let's say assassin's creed or

00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:03,359
consumer businesses

00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:05,520
so depending on the partners in some

00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:08,640
ways we become the middle air connecting

00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:09,520
connecting capital mentorship and market

00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,880
access

00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:12,960
to different cohorts of urban

00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:15,359
entrepreneurs and the third is a lot of

00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:17,119
entrepreneurs who are building their own

00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:18,800
micro businesses these are

00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:20,800
these are businesses that perhaps are

00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:21,839
still small for an amazon or they're

00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:24,000
still small to

00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:26,000
sort of be set up on their own but what

00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,440
we end up doing is one we open our

00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,240
access to capital for them

00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:32,319
which is micro loans uh again by our

00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:34,160
nbfc partners and banking partners

00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:35,520
and second is opening again market

00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:37,680
access via shiro's

00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:39,440
there build your own presence on sheroes

00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:42,000
build your own url on cheetos

00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:44,079
uh start selling for the first time if

00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,040
you build a product you you make art you

00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:47,280
make pickles

00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:48,079
you are a yoga teacher you are somebody

00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:51,200
who who

00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:52,160
who sells uh uh who sells clothes or

00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:54,079
jewelry or

00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:56,640
or whatever that product might be so a

00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:59,680
lot of peer-to-peer marketplaces i think

00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:01,280
china has some amazing models that have

00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:02,160
scaled up because these appear to be a

00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:04,559
bucket places

00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:05,520
these appear to be a conversational

00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:08,720
commerce

00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:09,440
plays and uh yeah so that's that's

00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:12,319
exactly

00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:13,839
what we end up doing and of course then

00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:16,880
there's a whole ecosystem of

00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:18,640
many computers that are producing

00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:20,000
high quality content that are offering

00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:21,920
high quality advice

00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,160
uh within the shiro's app within the

00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:26,240
shiro's within the ecosystem

00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:27,839
uh so it's not just a place to transact

00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:30,720
but it's also a place to

00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:31,520
uh when i come here i get an idea i grow

00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:33,839
every day

00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:34,640
up so it's a very nice loop that skates

00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:37,520
created

00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:39,200
a woman entrepreneur comes in uh slowly

00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:39,920
learns on the network slowly starts

00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,760
selling

00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:43,760
now has a brand that she wants to

00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:44,160
distribute further so she ends up giving

00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:46,400
it to

00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:47,920
other women on the network who are micro

00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:49,440
entrepreneurs to distribute in their

00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:52,640
potential networks so

00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:52,640
so both are parallely

00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:59,920
and society one of one of the things

00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:02,000
that was fascinating for me and i

00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:04,319
learned a lot engaging with you

00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,640
um when i first started uh learning

00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:09,760
about shiro's was this idea of social

00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:12,400
of social commerce and you know i know

00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:13,599
you started talking about it but uh

00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:16,319
you know i think there might be many

00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:18,640
people on the stream who liked me

00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:20,400
you know it was quite new to really try

00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:22,800
to understand what this really was and

00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:26,240
what's the impact and how big it is

00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:26,240
in india and in other places

00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:32,400
absolutely so i think

00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:33,760
social media camera right social media

00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:37,119
has been around and

00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:39,520
uh so as a country we know that anybody

00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:40,559
who's on a mobile now and coal kind of

00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:43,040
double

00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:44,319
doubled back that their uh hydration too

00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:46,079
many in the internet

00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:47,599
and for women it's it's double in

00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:49,280
aspiration because they don't need to

00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:50,400
stand up step outside of their homes

00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:51,200
they don't need to take family

00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,960
permission

00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:54,880
so internet plus entrepreneurial

00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:58,559
opportunities is like a big win

00:49:54,880 --> 00:50:00,640
uh and how does this work so uh

00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:02,160
historically there have been some models

00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:03,760
which you can call offline social

00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:04,880
commerce like tupperware was one such

00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:06,880
model mary kay

00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:08,160
was another but these were mlm models so

00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:10,400
they were a little

00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:12,480
little spammy in their flavor here

00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:14,960
what's happening is uh

00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:15,520
i'm on shiro's this is my community i

00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:18,319
have

00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:19,359
uh i have 250 friends i have 2 000

00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:21,280
followers

00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:23,680
and these people listen to me because

00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:24,079
they trust me they trust my judgment

00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:26,160
they

00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:28,000
they like what i do they like that i'm a

00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:31,119
great contributor to the community

00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:34,160
and and when i come out and say hey guys

00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:36,880
i started making art i started

00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:37,359
making start selling important plants uh

00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:39,680
and i

00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:41,599
i post a video every day of my potted

00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:44,160
plants i become an influencer around

00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:46,000
potted plants and it becomes very

00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:47,680
referenceable content

00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,760
and when i add a buy button to that

00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:51,280
content it's social commerce

00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:53,920
i'm creating content that can be

00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:57,040
consumed but i'm also a

00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:58,319
transaction layer to it based on trust

00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:00,160
i think the difference between

00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:03,359
traditional commerce and

00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:05,920
with in social commerce is that all

00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:08,640
buying decisions are backed by trust

00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:11,680
very poor based as opposed to push based

00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:14,480
uh and i think up india it's very

00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:15,599
uh it it's very genetically embedded in

00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:18,800
our social dna

00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:21,200
uh women women do a lot of this

00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:22,079
in in a traditional setup in the offline

00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:24,960
world

00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:26,000
the whole microfinance setup was this

00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:27,760
women in groups

00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,200
kind of trusting each other with money

00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:31,680
and other social decisions

00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:33,599
now that that whole has come online they

00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:34,559
contain this video there's live

00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:37,440
streaming

00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:39,440
their products so it's basically

00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:40,800
conversational commerce i'm going to buy

00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:43,280
from people i trust

00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:45,040
and i'm going to build on social capital

00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:46,800
so it matters to me that my social

00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:48,160
behavior is excellent it matters to me

00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:50,319
that i have great ratings

00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:51,599
it matters to me that i show up with the

00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:53,839
community every day

00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:56,720
i think they're two companies that that

00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:58,480
uh that are sort of similar and maybe

00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:00,240
different markets one is poshmark in

00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:02,960
china that just went ipo

00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:04,880
huge ipo marine chandras but a fantastic

00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:05,760
business there and second is a company

00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:07,280
called red

00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:09,200
red in china it was called the little

00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:12,240
red book now they were just called red

00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:16,000
um 85 million monthly active users

00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:18,240
huge gmb all peer-to-peer commerce so

00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:20,000
the platform does know selling directly

00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:22,000
everything goes through somebody

00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,040
who's creating content and is being part

00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,359
of the community

00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:27,680
as in and and is investing in creating

00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:27,680
trust

00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:32,640
fantastic so i've got a some good

00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:35,280
questions from

00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:37,359
our audience eddie avila my friend from

00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:40,079
global voices

00:52:37,359 --> 00:52:42,319
has a question on what do you consider

00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:44,800
to be the biggest challenge in engaging

00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:47,680
and digitally including minority

00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:49,440
language communities

00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:51,839
i guess all of you are working on this

00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:55,440
somewhat

00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:55,440
does anyone want to take a crack at that

00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:00,000
um i'll share it a little bit and i'm

00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:02,800
sure uh supriya

00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,280
and uh vijay have a lot to share there

00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:06,160
and

00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:06,720
samira as well i think uh the thing

00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:09,119
about

00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:09,920
minority language is that i think one

00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:13,200
it's it's

00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:14,640
it is uh it it does change how you build

00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:16,000
your company because

00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:17,280
uh there's no one person who's

00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,800
unauthorized who's an editorial

00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:22,000
authority anymore because

00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:23,839
uh it uh you know what what what

00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,520
sounds right in one language doesn't

00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:27,440
sound right in another

00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:29,040
so that itself is is quite a bit of a

00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:31,359
challenge but i think at the same time

00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:32,319
the aspirational to not get thrown off

00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:34,400
the english web

00:53:32,319 --> 00:53:36,160
is still there i think everybody wants

00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:37,359
to make sure that their access points

00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:39,200
are always open

00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:41,119
and the aspiration to get on to

00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:43,440
mainstream web is still there

00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:44,880
and we see that on trios that a lot of

00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,680
women come around to shiro's as the

00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:47,119
first app and

00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:48,400
as part of the grow journeys they do

00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:49,920
want to sample what's going on on

00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:51,440
twitter or instagram which have

00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:53,200
which have no no sort of regional

00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:55,520
content per se

00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:57,200
but uh yeah i think it's it's a little

00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:59,359
more complex building for

00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:01,920
for multiple languages like we have we

00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:04,000
built a stack to make 17 languages live

00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:05,440
we have only been able to make like five

00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,839
or six live because

00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:11,839
it's just a lot of logistics to to get

00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:11,839
that going

00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:19,839
no i was going to say similar sort of

00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:22,319
experience in that

00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:24,240
um i think the first thing that needs to

00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:25,920
happen is that tools should be available

00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:28,640
so for example like i said

00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:29,599
you know even basic uh creativity on

00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:32,000
platforms

00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:33,760
um does not take into account what are

00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,760
india's specific needs so

00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:37,200
you know you don't need an email to sign

00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:38,640
on to something like a medium for

00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:41,440
example so i think

00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:43,200
we are seeing so so i think we are

00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:44,160
seeing a faster uptake on the languages

00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:46,880
we have

00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:48,559
20 languages already on scrollstack and

00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:49,599
i think the the way this will scale will

00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:51,680
be much faster

00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:54,160
for the next uh generation of platforms

00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:57,119
like ours and everybody on this panel

00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:57,520
because in a way the internet was highly

00:54:57,119 --> 00:54:59,200
uh

00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:00,559
you know skewed towards english but the

00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:02,240
social media was not

00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:04,240
not i don't mean social media is twitter

00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:05,839
and twitter per se but facebook for

00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:06,720
example people write posts in their own

00:55:05,839 --> 00:55:08,960
languages

00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:10,400
whatsapp is almost entirely uh in

00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:12,480
people's own languages

00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:14,000
so i think there is a third phase of the

00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,880
internet which may be around social

00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,680
commerce

00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:19,200
uh it really is going to uh you know

00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:20,559
make use of the fact that there are a

00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:22,799
billion uh people

00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:24,400
uh who the next billion who actually

00:55:22,799 --> 00:55:25,599
have been expressing themselves in their

00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:28,960
own languages

00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:30,640
on the social uh platforms the internet

00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:32,400
had not been designed to them

00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:34,160
for them and i think now you'll see

00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:35,839
people like us who are going to

00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:37,760
make use of those two right so on school

00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:39,280
stack for example our experiences people

00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:40,160
are writing hindi is the fastest going

00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:42,079
language right

00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:44,319
because i think people will want to be

00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:46,960
on the open web in their own languages

00:55:44,319 --> 00:55:48,079
in a thing that looks like any global

00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:50,400
website right

00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:52,079
and the other thing i would say that a

00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:53,280
hard to solve problem that we'll have to

00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:55,280
solve is that

00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:57,119
in theory you could write in any indian

00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:59,040
language on many of the global platforms

00:55:57,119 --> 00:56:01,040
the problem is you'll never be found

00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:02,079
right so how do you solve discovery and

00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:05,520
distribution

00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:07,839
in languages um is the the next big

00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:07,839
challenge

00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:11,040
yeah i think uh just to add to that one

00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,720
of the

00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:14,559
you know like sari was saying so we are

00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:16,160
in ten local languages right now and one

00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:16,880
of the biggest challenge that we faced

00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:19,119
in these

00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:21,200
you know keeping up with the quality uh

00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:23,280
consistently across all languages

00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:25,119
simply because uh you know hiring and

00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:26,799
building a team in local languages is

00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:28,079
super difficult at least we face this

00:56:26,799 --> 00:56:29,760
problem right now

00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:31,440
um and the second thing is that how do

00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:33,119
you monetize this entire piece

00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:35,200
like you know we would love to launch

00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:36,960
smes right because it represents a large

00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:38,079
part of the country but then again

00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:39,839
when we are thinking of running a

00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:41,839
sustainable business we don't have

00:56:39,839 --> 00:56:42,160
advertisers who are willing to advertise

00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:44,160
on

00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:45,520
an assamese channel uh so then it

00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:47,520
becomes more and more difficult to

00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:48,240
utilize resources and actually launch a

00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:50,400
language

00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:52,000
because in india you know each language

00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:53,599
is like an independent country the

00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,280
nuances that are involved with the

00:56:53,599 --> 00:56:56,880
aspirations of people who speak in

00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:58,000
marathi as opposed to someone who's

00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:00,079
speaking in bengali

00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,240
are totally different so even in terms

00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:02,720
of content strategy how we execute how

00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:04,799
do we

00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:06,319
how do we distribute everything differs

00:57:04,799 --> 00:57:08,319
from each language

00:57:06,319 --> 00:57:10,240
so so yeah it's almost like starting a

00:57:08,319 --> 00:57:12,799
new business line every time you start a

00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:15,280
new language

00:57:12,799 --> 00:57:17,200
one of the things that you you i mean we

00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:19,760
at rambani have been doing is leveraging

00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:22,160
the power of voice which actually is uh

00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:22,880
is a format which uh which actually you

00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:25,280
know which

00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:27,040
which in many ways allows people even

00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:28,000
from the most marginalized communities

00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:30,160
to be able to

00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,920
engage to listen easily without the

00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:32,799
barriers of literacy or access to

00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:34,000
technology

00:57:32,799 --> 00:57:35,599
now that's something that we have been

00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,680
doing and in fact the very objective of

00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:40,400
grammar is to create a platform where

00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:40,799
service providers or with largely in the

00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,880
you know

00:57:40,799 --> 00:57:44,640
considering information as a service is

00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:45,920
able to reach the most marginalized

00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:46,799
right or the most underserved

00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:48,480
communities

00:57:46,799 --> 00:57:49,920
uh because conventional media platforms

00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:51,760
would not be able to provide that treat

00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:53,520
and voice would be the easiest medium

00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:55,200
right because people in the marginalized

00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:57,440
communities are able to listen

00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:58,799
in their own vernacular language right

00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:00,960
or even in the most

00:57:58,799 --> 00:58:02,400
the minority languages and be able to

00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:04,160
engage with the platform what we have

00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:05,200
been trying to do is that trigger this

00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:07,040
whole power of

00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:09,119
the community volunteers the community

00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:10,720
taking ownership of creating content

00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:12,960
right and when these volunteers who

00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:13,920
create hyper local news and content from

00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:15,440
the ground

00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:17,119
right create content that's relevant to

00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:19,040
the community and that's what creates

00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:21,280
that traction and the stickiness

00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:22,799
and the engagement but again a very

00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:24,640
important point uh highlighted by

00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:25,920
supriya is that how do we monetize it

00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:27,680
right so

00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:29,200
you know we can we create community we

00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:29,920
create very strong communities even

00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:32,160
among these

00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:33,920
minority uh groups of marginalized

00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:34,720
groups but are there players who are

00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:36,400
willing to

00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:38,079
uh you know run campaigns or reach out

00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:38,559
to these small groups right so that is

00:58:38,079 --> 00:58:39,839
where

00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:41,920
the challenge always lies the

00:58:39,839 --> 00:58:42,640
sustainability of these uh of these

00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:45,440
small

00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:47,520
platforms but in terms of the technology

00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:49,440
tools like for example we have the ivr

00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:50,000
which targets the feature phone users we

00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:52,160
have a mobile

00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:54,079
running smart app which targets the use

00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:55,680
which again uh uh you know provides

00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:57,920
information on audio formats

00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:59,599
we have created a voice bot which again

00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:00,799
eases the whole process of

00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:02,799
engaging and you know making

00:59:00,799 --> 00:59:04,640
conversational uh you know

00:59:02,799 --> 00:59:06,240
messaging much easier we've created a

00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:07,680
voice based quora where discovery of

00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:09,920
content is much easier

00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:11,920
we're creating these tools but again one

00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:13,359
is creating the community is one part

00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:14,319
which of course we have been doing to a

00:59:13,359 --> 00:59:16,000
good extent because

00:59:14,319 --> 00:59:17,520
we are engaging with the community but

00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,559
the second part is the sustainability

00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:20,000
part which again as

00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:21,920
superior rightly said is going to be

00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:24,880
discussed because although we

00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:26,160
you know we might have ngos or donors or

00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:27,599
you know governments who might

00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:29,440
want to run some campaigns and they

00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:31,040
might want to pay but will commercial

00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:31,520
players be willing to put their money

00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:32,799
here

00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:35,760
that is definitely going to be a

00:59:32,799 --> 00:59:35,760
challenge in the long term

00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:40,160
well you know i guess there's a there's

00:59:38,559 --> 00:59:42,720
a follow-on question from puja

00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:45,200
in the channel which uh you know which

00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:47,119
which i guess picks up on this idea

00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:49,440
of marginalized communities and you know

00:59:47,119 --> 00:59:52,240
people we'd reach out to

00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:54,000
where he asks you know what according to

00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:55,760
each of you is the most underserved

00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,440
group in india

00:59:55,760 --> 01:00:01,040
in any community that's still missing

00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:02,799
education services and access

01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:04,400
maybe vijay do you want to take a swing

01:00:02,799 --> 01:00:06,559
at that

01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:08,319
uh i mean i mean there you know this is

01:00:06,559 --> 01:00:09,680
the deprived segment now if you're

01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:11,520
talking about the 60

01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:12,720
percent aspirational segment right so

01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:14,960
the people who are

01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:16,720
now you know becoming aspirational start

01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:18,720
having access to phones and you know

01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:20,559
smartphones and getting access to

01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:22,319
information and a more demanding of

01:00:20,559 --> 01:00:24,000
services and access to services

01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:25,839
there is the whole deprived segment now

01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,680
i don't know if there is one community

01:00:25,839 --> 01:00:29,359
but i think there are many many because

01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:29,760
every community or every village or

01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:32,400
every

01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:33,520
for example geography has these

01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:35,520
communities which are

01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:37,280
outside the peripheries right so who are

01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:38,079
deprived who are marginalized both on

01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:40,640
the cases of

01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:42,559
both social and economic factors right

01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:44,319
and they are deprived of access to

01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:46,319
many of these services including access

01:00:44,319 --> 01:00:46,799
to even your simple feature phones right

01:00:46,319 --> 01:00:48,480
so they

01:00:46,799 --> 01:00:50,319
there are still many many people like

01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:52,240
that so it is not just about

01:00:50,319 --> 01:00:54,640
one community but i think it's more

01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:56,079
about uh you know every geography or

01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:56,960
every state or every district pretty

01:00:56,079 --> 01:00:59,040
much has

01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:01,119
uh these communities and unfortunately

01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:02,319
so and i think that is where we really

01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:04,400
are trying to see

01:01:02,319 --> 01:01:06,240
uh and work towards free to ensure that

01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:08,240
there is no media dark

01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:09,599
geography in the country right so that's

01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:10,000
how we will be able to really serve and

01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:14,319
provide

01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:14,319
information to the last man standing

01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:23,280
so one way

01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:23,280
sorry right hello go ahead

01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:28,000
okay so i think this is a very

01:01:26,319 --> 01:01:29,839
interesting reference what is

01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:32,079
who is marginalized in india or who's a

01:01:29,839 --> 01:01:35,280
minority i think the way to look at that

01:01:32,079 --> 01:01:36,480
is actually the top one percent is the

01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:39,839
minority

01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:39,839
but because

01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:44,160
media uh you know venture obviously

01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:46,720
takes

01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:48,160
up disproportionate amount of attention

01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:51,280
venture-backed companies

01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:52,079
i think the thing is that uh if you if

01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:55,119
you look at

01:01:52,079 --> 01:01:56,079
rural if you look at uh middle india if

01:01:55,119 --> 01:01:58,720
you look at

01:01:56,079 --> 01:01:59,920
uh you know the lowest of capital and if

01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:02,079
you look at women

01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:03,599
i think these are these are large

01:02:02,079 --> 01:02:05,520
communities that are actually not

01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:07,039
minorities they are marginalized but

01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:11,119
they're not minorities

01:02:07,039 --> 01:02:12,160
the top 10 disproportionate attention

01:02:11,119 --> 01:02:14,720
and access

01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:16,000
is the digital divide and the income

01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:17,920
divided in india

01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:19,200
has only been growing in last two

01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:22,559
decades i think

01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:23,760
uh and a lot of us are working on these

01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:27,039
segments because

01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:27,280
i think they that's where a large amount

01:02:27,039 --> 01:02:30,480
of

01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:33,680
market sits you know i think the

01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:34,559
percent has been saturated and i think

01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:36,880
the first

01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:38,319
first internet revolution you know the

01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:40,960
first dot com buzz

01:02:38,319 --> 01:02:42,960
boom the the second and and you know i

01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:45,119
think the first decade and a half

01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:46,559
were were invested in building for the

01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:49,440
one percent it's only

01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:50,079
last four or five years after data and

01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:53,200
payments

01:02:50,079 --> 01:02:55,280
went uh went more and more

01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:57,119
uh to every part of the country is is

01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:57,920
that we are able to think about this in

01:02:57,119 --> 01:03:00,480
a little more

01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:01,440
a little more distributed way so so

01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:04,640
going back to

01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:06,160
uh i think large chunks of people much

01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:07,920
like if you look women if you look at

01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:10,240
millicast if you look at youth

01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:11,839
uh you know averagely hundred plus

01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:14,480
million kind of cohorts

01:03:11,839 --> 01:03:16,319
200 million in certain cases women are

01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:19,039
500 million women so

01:03:16,319 --> 01:03:21,280
you know i think pretty stark numbers

01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:21,280
there

01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,960
i mean just in case of you know just a

01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:25,599
point to highlight you know just in

01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:27,680
terms of the

01:03:25,599 --> 01:03:28,880
opportunities i may say so or other you

01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:30,960
know people who are still

01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:32,880
you know at that exactly as terry said

01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:35,760
in terms of a large large part

01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:37,440
of people who are deprived 34 percent of

01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:39,280
women in rural india and about 55

01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:42,079
percent of men in rural india

01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:43,760
have access internet right so at least

01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:45,599
one so which we're talking about

01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:47,520
very very large numbers who still

01:03:45,599 --> 01:03:49,280
haven't even seen the face of internet

01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:50,799
who don't have access to these services

01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:51,920
or to the information that can really

01:03:50,799 --> 01:03:54,559
change their lives

01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:56,240
right so i think both in terms of uh

01:03:54,559 --> 01:03:57,039
disappointment that they've not really

01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:58,559
had access

01:03:57,039 --> 01:04:00,480
which could really have changed and two

01:03:58,559 --> 01:04:02,880
in terms of the opportunity that we

01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:04,400
we are still working towards uh i think

01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:05,599
these are very very large numbers as

01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:09,039
rightly said i think this is not a

01:04:05,599 --> 01:04:09,039
minority this is a majority

01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:14,480
that's uh that's a fascinating insight

01:04:12,079 --> 01:04:17,599
uh samir i saw you go off mike

01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:17,599
did you want to respond

01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:22,079
no no i was going to say that um it is

01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:22,720
that that there is a very large number

01:04:22,079 --> 01:04:25,359
even by

01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:27,119
just the number of people who are below

01:04:25,359 --> 01:04:28,960
the poverty line this official party

01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:32,000
line is a few hundred million

01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:34,480
and uh and that

01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:36,400
the number of people who have access

01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:37,920
even after this data revolution like at

01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:39,520
least half the population is still

01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:41,039
outside of that right so if you assume

01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:44,079
there are half a billion

01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:45,760
uh connected uh smartphones uh but i

01:04:44,079 --> 01:04:48,720
think for the first time like cyrie

01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:51,039
says we have a glimmer of hope that you

01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:52,960
have a technology that is as

01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:54,079
as widely distributed as almost anything

01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:55,520
else in india right

01:04:54,079 --> 01:04:57,039
someone jokingly said i don't think the

01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:58,480
stat is true but it is worth sort of

01:04:57,039 --> 01:05:00,240
people say there are more toilets

01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:01,599
uh more people with access to phones

01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:04,720
than toilets at uh

01:05:01,599 --> 01:05:06,880
you know personal uh private toilets uh

01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:09,119
so it for the first time you have a

01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:12,640
technology which cost is low enough that

01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:12,640
almost everybody can access it

01:05:13,359 --> 01:05:17,359
so i'm sorry i'm going to chime in there

01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:20,079
we just drove down

01:05:17,359 --> 01:05:21,440
3 000 kilometers from delhi to southern

01:05:20,079 --> 01:05:24,000
part of the country

01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:25,520
uh and you know we didn't have to take

01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,319
different months on any of the tone

01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:29,440
boards it was

01:05:26,319 --> 01:05:32,559
automated digital payments uh

01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:34,160
fantastic mobile access but no toilets

01:05:32,559 --> 01:05:36,960
no public washrooms

01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:37,680
uh you know around around the highway so

01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:41,520
i think

01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:43,920
uh yes it it is as as dichotomous as it

01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:43,920
sounds

01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:49,039
yeah and the sorry again based on what

01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:50,000
she said you know payments is one

01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:52,240
fascinating thing

01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:53,920
where having going back and forth

01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:56,720
between india and the us i'm so

01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:57,440
surprised that uh how fast and how

01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:59,119
quickly

01:05:57,440 --> 01:06:01,280
the indian infrastructure for payment

01:05:59,119 --> 01:06:02,640
has moved and how sophisticated it is

01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:05,039
relative to the west

01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:06,640
like you can sort of anybody can accept

01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:09,359
digital payments in india

01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:11,359
uh you know uh it takes five minutes and

01:06:09,359 --> 01:06:12,880
it's a typically improvised indian setup

01:06:11,359 --> 01:06:15,440
where you print out your

01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:17,280
uh you know your uh code and people can

01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:19,440
scan it and you get the money right

01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:20,640
so it i think there are some things that

01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:25,039
are moving very very

01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:25,039
rapidly and a lot of it is digital tech

01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:30,000
well you know just uh pulling on a

01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:32,000
thread a bit and taking it in a in quite

01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:35,119
a radically different direction

01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:36,000
um from what you know what we've just

01:06:35,119 --> 01:06:37,920
discussed about

01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:39,520
india you know each language grouping

01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:40,720
and entire market about you know the

01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:42,240
number of people

01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:43,839
and so on that you're serving you know i

01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:45,359
guess the one thing before we run out of

01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:47,200
time that i wanted to

01:06:45,359 --> 01:06:48,880
pull on and superior that you can you

01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:50,480
can open this discussion is

01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:52,160
you know we talk about india it's a

01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:52,960
massive market there are many markets

01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:56,000
inside

01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:57,680
um but even with all of that i see you

01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:00,319
expanding and going beyond

01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:01,839
the borders in india um you know so what

01:07:00,319 --> 01:07:05,359
what what have we learned in india that

01:07:01,839 --> 01:07:05,359
we can take to other parts of the world

01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:11,280
and what are you doing uh with that

01:07:09,039 --> 01:07:13,039
sure so i think how we sort of um you

01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:14,640
know are looking at this is so i think

01:07:13,039 --> 01:07:17,200
you know like i said earlier with us one

01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:18,960
of the the problems that was there was

01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:20,640
monetization when we went to regional

01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:22,240
languages because english is a language

01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:23,359
that everybody is willing to advertise

01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:24,880
on and pay for

01:07:23,359 --> 01:07:26,640
uh because they believe that a person

01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:27,760
who is consuming content in english has

01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:29,599
purchasing path

01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:31,599
but we didn't see that kind of traction

01:07:29,599 --> 01:07:32,960
in the multiple other regional languages

01:07:31,599 --> 01:07:34,960
that we went into

01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:36,079
uh but what we've uh you know actually

01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:37,839
seen as trends

01:07:36,079 --> 01:07:39,440
uh is that there are a lot of

01:07:37,839 --> 01:07:41,760
demographies that are similar

01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:43,359
um to india similar in terms of

01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:45,599
aspirations in terms of content

01:07:43,359 --> 01:07:48,240
consumption in terms of you know career

01:07:45,599 --> 01:07:50,160
etc so for example indonesia is a market

01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:51,599
that we have tried to explore and we do

01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:52,319
have a channel that's actually live

01:07:51,599 --> 01:07:54,400
there

01:07:52,319 --> 01:07:56,000
um and we've seen that the aspirations

01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:56,799
of the youth what they think of the

01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,480
government there

01:07:56,799 --> 01:08:00,480
how they sort of you know go about

01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:00,960
school college etc and what they want to

01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:03,760
be

01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:05,760
is is 90 um you know coinciding with

01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:07,440
what we're already doing over here

01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:09,039
um another thing is that in these

01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:10,880
countries as well there are multiple

01:08:09,039 --> 01:08:12,319
dialects so why there is one you know

01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:13,920
sort of national language

01:08:12,319 --> 01:08:15,200
there are other multiple dialects that

01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:16,640
have millions of people who are

01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:18,480
consuming content there

01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:20,000
so the pattern is very similar and

01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:22,319
that's i think what excites us

01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:23,040
as an organization to try um and you

01:08:22,319 --> 01:08:27,199
know move to

01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:27,199
other similar uh demographies

01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:36,560
that's great so um just before we we

01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:38,080
we've got four minutes left um i've got

01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:38,480
20 questions i could still ask each of

01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:40,960
you

01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:42,640
um so but we'll have to start wrapping

01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:43,839
up unfortunately because we have a hard

01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:46,960
stop on the stream

01:08:43,839 --> 01:08:47,359
but uh the one thing just before i let

01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:50,159
you

01:08:47,359 --> 01:08:52,000
each get into some closing remarks is uh

01:08:50,159 --> 01:08:54,719
chris is asking if you could share

01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:56,560
links to your projects in the chat um so

01:08:54,719 --> 01:08:59,440
maybe if you can just pop in

01:08:56,560 --> 01:09:00,319
uh your website so uh participants can

01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:05,839
have a look

01:09:00,319 --> 01:09:07,120
as well so perhaps uh a minute each um

01:09:05,839 --> 01:09:11,040
i'll start with uvj

01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:12,480
and we can any final comments for people

01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:14,239
just thinking about

01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:16,159
the challenges in india anything any

01:09:14,239 --> 01:09:19,359
advice you'd give to people

01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:22,239
embarking on projects in the country any

01:09:19,359 --> 01:09:22,239
big problems to solve

01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:26,640
uh no thanks so much i mean in terms of

01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:28,159
being

01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:29,839
i think they're clear in terms of where

01:09:28,159 --> 01:09:31,279
we are going in terms of creating the

01:09:29,839 --> 01:09:32,560
technology tools the appropriate

01:09:31,279 --> 01:09:35,279
technology tools

01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:37,120
riding on our voice-based uh you know

01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:38,640
formats right reaching out to the last

01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:40,799
mile reaching out to the

01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:41,759
uh communities of you know helping

01:09:40,799 --> 01:09:43,600
organizations

01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:45,359
engage with these communities creating

01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:47,120
platforms that can help them

01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:49,120
you know not just provide information

01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:50,960
but also find out pathways and create

01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:52,480
standard operating procedures for

01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:54,400
grievance addresses you know this was

01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:56,400
quite evident in the way we were able to

01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:57,760
handle our the you know you know how we

01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:59,120
were able to repurpose our platform

01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:00,560
during the forward times

01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:02,400
we had close to almost like a two and a

01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:03,360
half million calls so close to a million

01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:05,600
plus users

01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:07,280
use the platform 25 000 plus grievances

01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:09,360
that were recorded on the platform

01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:11,280
so our objective is to again as i said

01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:13,120
you know reverse the flow of information

01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:14,640
create more a federated network of

01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:16,640
community media platforms

01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:18,400
and leverage the insights and learnings

01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:20,320
that we get from these platforms

01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:22,719
uh you know to to not just help

01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:25,040
organizations to help the businesses

01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:26,000
but also more importantly from from the

01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:27,199
government or

01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:29,600
you know other stakeholders who are

01:10:27,199 --> 01:10:30,960
working to improve the lives of these

01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:32,320
people right for information if

01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:34,000
information is indeed power

01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:35,920
then i think we really have to reverse

01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:37,600
reverse the flow of it and that's where

01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:39,600
we believe long-term sustainable change

01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:42,159
can happen and i think rahmani's pro

01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:43,440
goal and the road and pathway ahead is

01:10:42,159 --> 01:10:45,199
quite clear on that uh

01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:46,400
front and we're working towards building

01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:48,239
more and more innovations in that

01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:50,370
direction

01:10:48,239 --> 01:10:52,239
thanks vijay uh sorry

01:10:50,370 --> 01:10:55,520
[Applause]

01:10:52,239 --> 01:10:58,719
well i think um one interesting so

01:10:55,520 --> 01:11:01,040
first learning along the way is that

01:10:58,719 --> 01:11:02,800
you you've got to sort of poke the

01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:05,840
business models a lot more

01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:07,760
you know i think about

01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:09,679
10 years ago if you were a founder

01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:11,520
everybody said does something like this

01:11:09,679 --> 01:11:13,199
exist in the us you know can you cut

01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:14,239
copy paste a model from the west and

01:11:13,199 --> 01:11:16,880
bring here

01:11:14,239 --> 01:11:17,760
and i think for the longest time uh this

01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:19,520
one

01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:21,520
there's an internal battle and it was

01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:22,480
also a way to say how do we how do we

01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:24,800
retrofit

01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:26,080
models that that don't belong here and i

01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:27,440
think truly uh

01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:28,960
if you're going to build a business for

01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:30,080
the next billion then you've got to

01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:32,560
build a model that's

01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:34,239
very very from the context because the

01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:37,040
market doesn't have the same depth

01:11:34,239 --> 01:11:37,440
the the macros don't match up so i think

01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:39,840
that's

01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:40,880
that's one big takeaway as a founder and

01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:43,440
second is i think

01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:44,560
uh investing in communities i think

01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:46,400
historically

01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:47,679
this has really worked well in the

01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:48,960
offline world uh

01:11:47,679 --> 01:11:50,960
and i think there's still a lot of

01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:53,040
opportunity to build communities online

01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:54,800
uh that space is just about getting like

01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:56,080
super super early super

01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:58,080
all of us are super early in our

01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:58,640
journeys in terms of where this can this

01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:00,640
can

01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:02,320
uh you know sort of land up if you if

01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:04,560
you fast forward this let's say five

01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:07,040
years or seven years or ten years

01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:09,280
uh each of these platforms can be you

01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:09,760
know 100 a few hundred million users you

01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:12,320
know

01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:13,040
and also i think create massive massive

01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:15,679
impact

01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:16,480
uh you know identity impact income

01:12:15,679 --> 01:12:18,960
impact

01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:20,560
uh and of course i think the quality of

01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:23,840
discourse on the internet

01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:25,840
i think uh which which i think internet

01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:27,679
1.0 didn't do enough

01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:29,040
or maybe internet 2.0 or whatever we

01:12:27,679 --> 01:12:31,840
call it but i think

01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:32,320
the the quality of internet matters and

01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:34,000
i think

01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:37,600
a lot of lot of what we do kind of

01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:40,960
changes that narrative

01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:40,960
thank you samir

01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:45,920
yeah i think uh one lesson probably and

01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:48,400
this applies more to

01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:50,480
uh maybe tech and platforms is that i

01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:52,560
think the time has also come that we can

01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:55,920
build in india for the rest of the world

01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:58,640
um we have enough uh local user base

01:12:55,920 --> 01:13:00,080
that innovations that are uh valuable in

01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:01,840
india would be valuable

01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:03,440
around the world right and payment is

01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:06,400
going to be one of the big things

01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:08,239
mobile first internet is another um so i

01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:10,080
i don't think we have had too many

01:13:08,239 --> 01:13:11,600
consumer companies yet that have come

01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:13,040
out of india if you see the indian

01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:14,560
unicorns or whatever you want to call

01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:16,239
them there have been there has been a

01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:17,120
wave of services base there's been a

01:13:16,239 --> 01:13:19,840
wave of

01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:20,400
sas marketplaces but i think you will

01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:23,120
see

01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:23,600
uh hopefully some of those on this panel

01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:25,120
um

01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:26,480
you know you'll see more innovation

01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:28,480
coming out of india that in because

01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:30,719
india now is enough of a petri dish

01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:32,000
as well as a scaled market for something

01:13:30,719 --> 01:13:35,679
uh that you will see

01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:37,760
uh you know uh platforms emerging out of

01:13:35,679 --> 01:13:40,640
india that are useful around the world

01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:41,280
and that's an opportunity thank you

01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:44,800
samir

01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:46,400
supriya will uh give you the last word

01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:47,600
sure so i think what i've sort of

01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:48,960
learned along the way is that when

01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:50,000
you're working for this audience it's a

01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:52,000
game of patience

01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:53,840
and persistence so we've been building

01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:55,280
content for six years and i think what

01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:57,120
has happened as a result of that

01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:59,520
is that there is this immense amount of

01:13:57,120 --> 01:14:00,080
trust um and loyalty that we've built

01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:01,840
amongst

01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:03,199
our audience um and the second thing

01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:05,440
that i've seen is that the power of

01:14:03,199 --> 01:14:07,760
referral in this community is super high

01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:09,280
um and i don't see that with you know um

01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:11,120
other communities as well

01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:13,199
so when you are looking at building a

01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:15,440
product for the next billion users

01:14:13,199 --> 01:14:16,800
it takes time to get to monetization but

01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:18,159
you know we're at the stage where we've

01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:20,000
realized that we've built this

01:14:18,159 --> 01:14:21,440
huge you know top of the funnel we have

01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:21,840
people watching our content and they

01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:23,679
trust

01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:25,600
us and now is the time that we are

01:14:23,679 --> 01:14:27,440
moving to our uh you know b2c

01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:28,960
monetization of what is it that we can

01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:31,840
actually provide off value for which

01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:31,840
they're willing to pay us

01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:36,159
thank you so much um and thank you to

01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:38,880
this entire panel it's been such a great
