00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:42,720
but always arriving at the right

00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:47,120
destination

00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:47,120

00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:28,399
best and worst moments of

00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:30,240
internet health in 2020 and lora vidal

00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:33,440
knows all about this

00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:35,440
hello laura nice to see you um

00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,200
yeah you've created this gallery full of

00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,159
personal stories about the health of the

00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,080
internet

00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:42,640
so first off what does it mean for the

00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:44,159
internet to be healthy

00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:46,240
well it means different things for

00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:48,159
different people a health is a kind of

00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:51,360
metaphor that was created

00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:54,000
to understand how the internet can be

00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,720
best for you know as many people as

00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,880
possible

00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,960
it's about having enough people being

00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:02,720
included enough spaces

00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:04,960
that it can really work independently of

00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,399
many uh you know many kinds of

00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,240
limitations but it's important to know

00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:09,919
that health in the internet is different

00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,679
depending on the region depending on the

00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:13,840
context and depending on

00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:15,440
their resources yeah and and for you

00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:18,960
personally what does it mean

00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,960
what a healthy internet

00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:24,080
it means that enough people have the

00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:26,480
space and the resources to access freely

00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:29,200
to information that is relevant

00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:30,480
that is reliable and they can also have

00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:33,760
the space to

00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:35,919
create to not only to create the

00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:37,279
new spaces but also to be able to

00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:41,120
express themselves

00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:43,519
freely and free of violence nice and um

00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:45,679
if if we're looking at 2020 what was the

00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:48,000
healthiest moment of the internet for

00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:50,480
you in 2020

00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,960
well on that one i am biased because to

00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,679
me one of the healthiest moments of 2020

00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,240
was the

00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:57,519
you know elaborating and publishing the

00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,840
internet health report

00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:01,360
of course of course yeah because yeah

00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,880
because you're combining all the healthy

00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:05,600
moments so i can see that

00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,960
and and the unhealthiest moment then in

00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:10,399
your opinion

00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:11,760
um so you know i'm from venezuela and

00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:13,119
things over there are being really

00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,879
really complicated so one of the

00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:16,720
unhealthiest moments for me

00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:19,119
were some fishing campaigns that had

00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:21,200
place and i know some

00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:22,639
some moments in which journalists were

00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,320
targeted so the

00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:25,919
situation is really complicated and the

00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:28,800
internet reflects that

00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:30,320
yeah nice and if people that are

00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,760
watching have a story that they also

00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,040
would like to share can they still share

00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:35,520
the story

00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:37,440
yes they can come to our spatial chat

00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:39,839
it's called share your stories

00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,760
you will find that the people that are

00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:44,399
behind the internet health report

00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,919

00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:46,400
and it all really looks complicated to

00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:49,520
me so let's quickly move on

00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:51,599
but nice um and natalie posted a picture

00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:54,240
of the paper crane lab that she made

00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:55,680
during the pop-up house party yesterday

00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:58,160
and we spoke with the facilitator of

00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,480
that session before the session started

00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,520
so

00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:04,480
really nice to see what came out of that

00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:06,320
and then luciana she cannot wait till

00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:08,400
friday because she's

00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:10,320
and she posted it on linkedin she's

00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:13,359
already rehearsing for the most fast

00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:14,880
party so really nice lociana we cannot

00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:17,839
wait to see what you're coming what

00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:20,480
you're going to come up with

00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:21,280
and although most fest is almost over

00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,280
mosfets

00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:25,680
themselves just tweeted that it's not

00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:27,920
too late to still buy your tickets

00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:30,000
jump onto slack to find a link to the

00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:31,040
tweet so you can retweet this share it

00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,119
with your network

00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,480
because we want as many people as

00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:36,880
possible to

00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:37,920
come us fast with us when the festival

00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,079
has ended so

00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,040
share the post share the link share

00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:45,119
everything

00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:45,920
and keep up posting because we love to

00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:48,480
see your small

00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:50,240
projects perhaps post a selfie while

00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,320
you're watching mozfest studio

00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:55,700
and always be sure to use the hashtag

00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:59,839
mozfest so we can easily find your posts

00:36:55,700 --> 00:37:02,000
[Music]

00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:03,119
var society and technology here in

00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,440
amsterdam has been

00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:06,720
operating as a research institution for

00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,800
25 years

00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,839
at the crossroads of arts science and

00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,920
technology

00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:13,839
and it explores the social and cultural

00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,359
impacts of new technologies

00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:17,520
and they want to keep their research

00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:19,359
open fair and inclusive

00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:21,839
and that's why in their building they

00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:24,160
house three diy labs where

00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:26,160
normal people can work on extraordinary

00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:28,720
projects

00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,839
i'm standing in the ridge of the vac

00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,920
centuries ago

00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:33,760
this room was being used to teach people

00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:35,760
about the human anatomy

00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:38,079
nowadays the vast strives to empower

00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:39,359
citizens to discover the anatomy of

00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:42,640
technology

00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:44,720
and this building houses three diy labs

00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:46,560
and i'm meeting with heiss burwinkel

00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:48,880
who's going to tell me all about it

00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:50,720
guys you work here in nevada what is the

00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,680
idea behind the labs that are located

00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,400
here

00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:56,000
so bach is a feature lab for technology

00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,560
and society and we work in many

00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,280
different

00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:00,560
research labs and three of the most

00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,480
tangible ones

00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:04,800
are here located at va so you have the

00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:07,200
fablab the wet lab and the

00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,960
textile lab textile lab could you show

00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,640
us around a little yes of course

00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,000
so what is this lab called and what is

00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:14,720
being done here so

00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,440
we are here at the open wet lab which is

00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:19,040
a lab that

00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:22,000
experiments with new technologies in

00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,960
biotechnology what we do here we try to

00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,160
combine

00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:29,200
experimentation and diy approaches with

00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:31,359
artistic approaches to be able to ask

00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,480
the important questions of the future of

00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:34,640
biotechnology

00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:36,400
so this is called the fab lab but this

00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:38,160
looks much more like a workshop

00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,440
what kind of things are being made here

00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:42,800
so the fablab is a

00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:43,680
place to improve your skills in digital

00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,760
fabrication

00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,880
so you see many different tools here

00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:49,520
that allow you to

00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:50,480
to fabricate digitally for example a 3d

00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:53,359
printer

00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:55,040
a laser cutter that allows you to design

00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:57,440
and prototype very rapidly

00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,560
so if you want to try out develop or

00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:01,200
design new

00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:02,960
things this is a very good place to to

00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,000
start and to develop your ideas to

00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:07,040
create to

00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,000
experiment which is normally a place

00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,000
that

00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,359
is happening in the research and

00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,640
development

00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:15,359
departments of big companies but in here

00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,440
everyone

00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:19,440
is able to skill themselves in this

00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:21,440
digital fabrication tools to be able to

00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,920
develop new ideas and new tools for the

00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,240
future

00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:25,040
so we're now in the textile lab what

00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,880
happens here

00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:28,079
as you can see there's been a lot of

00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,400
experimentation done

00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:32,880
in the field of new textiles and the

00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:35,839
team is researching in ways to

00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:36,800
make the system of textile more circular

00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:37,680
on the other hand they're also

00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,800
researching

00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:43,040
into new ways of designing materials

00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,880
so not only making the textiles more

00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,839
sustainable but also the materials that

00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,599
are being used

00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:50,400
in textile industry are being researched

00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:55,200
new forms of biodegradable plastics

00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:57,280
or other natural sources of textile

00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:58,720
was really cool to have a look inside

00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:00,720
these labs so if you're ever in

00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:02,160
amsterdam and you need new technologies

00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:04,400
to manufacture something

00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:10,160
go and contact vac i'm sure something

00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:12,400
beautiful will come out of that

00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:14,000
and even though we're almost at the end

00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,760
of moss fest

00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,359
there's still many sessions you can

00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,640
attend and if you're looking for

00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:21,599
something fun to do

00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:22,480
why not go on a scavenger hunt because

00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:25,040
in the session an

00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:28,079
older net adventure you can tour cyber

00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:30,560
cultural history from the late 1980s

00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:31,680
all the way through to the modern era

00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:34,800
and you can even win

00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:35,440
an extra special secret prize so here to

00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,880
tell us

00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:39,200
to tell us more about that is

00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:42,319
decentralization facilitator

00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:43,359
aldon jones welcome to mosfet studio

00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:45,920
album

00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:48,079
um thank you yeah your session is a

00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:49,280
digital scavenger hunt through cyber

00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:52,800
cultural history

00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:57,040
so what will participants be doing

00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:59,680
um so participants have to go through um

00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:01,920
websites on archive.org and some in some

00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,640
existing websites to find bits of text

00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,200
or

00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:06,319
maybe images or other kinds of like

00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,880
ephemera

00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:10,000
um to work their way through a um like a

00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:13,119
quasi-narrative

00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,359
um game nice so

00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:16,800
you'll be sent through the original old

00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:19,359
pages

00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,720
yeah exactly that is so cool and you're

00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:22,319
taking us all the way back to the

00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,839
beginning of the internet

00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:28,079
what were the dominant ideas on the

00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:28,079
distribution of online power back then

00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:31,359
so i at the beginning of the internet

00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:34,640
things um

00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:36,240
were really utopic and so the

00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,680
the community that alternate adventure

00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:40,800
is focusing on right now

00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:41,680
is on the cyber feminist movement um and

00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:45,200
they really saw

00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:47,599
the network as sort of a way to

00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:49,359
completely revolutionize the way power

00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:52,560
power worked in society

00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:54,560
um it was going to remove

00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:56,560
identity people are no longer going to

00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:58,560
be stuck to

00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:00,880
this like physical form and so

00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:02,240
everything and

00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:05,680
everything about society was going to

00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:08,000
change and people were going to and

00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:10,400
and really have a much more sense of

00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:13,839
individual power versus

00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:15,599
wow so optimistic so idealistic

00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:17,520
and um is there anything that we could

00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:18,960
learn from cyber cultural history to

00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:20,480
make better decisions about

00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,880
how we think about the internet in the

00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:25,280
future

00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:26,880
yeah i think um i think that's sort of

00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:29,119
exactly why i wanted to run this session

00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:32,480
because then

00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:34,319
um i think by looking at what um these

00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:36,800
cultures on the on the internet

00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:38,640
believe the um the state of the united

00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:41,680
would be now we can kind of

00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:43,680
um create a creative vision for how we

00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:45,839
can change the internet uh for ourselves

00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:48,880
now um look beyond the sort of like

00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:52,480
public private um platform nomination

00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:54,480
yeah just kind of find some inspiration

00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:56,079
that would be very cool well if you are

00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:58,319
curious and you would like to brush up

00:42:56,079 --> 00:43:00,400
on your knowledge of internet's history

00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:01,680
look for an alternate adventure in the

00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:04,000
mosfet schedule

00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:06,079
thank you so much alden for talking

00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,079
someone on this cool project

00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:09,920
and to learn more about sessions that

00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:12,079
are coming up check out the featured

00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:14,319
session section of the mosfets plaza

00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:16,079
on the right hand side under the how to

00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:18,240
mosfest book

00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:20,560
and we're almost at the end of another
