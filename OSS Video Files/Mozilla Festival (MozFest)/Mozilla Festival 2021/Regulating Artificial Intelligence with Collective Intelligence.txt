Description: 
	To conceptualize the best manifestation of AI, we must offer the best of human governance by elevating the best of our collective intelligence. Imagine Habermasian Discourse Ethics guiding the most difficult questions of AI Governance and decision-making? This session will explore the vision, tactics and results of the recently-concluded Global Citizenâ€™s Dialogue on the Future of the Internet, We, the Internet (WTI). Since its inception in 2018, WTI has organized national deliberations in 77 countries, activating the collective insights of over 5000 citizens. Our overarching goal is to test, improve and institutionalize AI governance with and for citizens. We will open the session with reflections on the results of the 2020 global dialogue with the country leads for Argentina, Malaysia, India, Philippines, Rwanda and Timor Leste followed by an invitation to co-imagine the future of AI Governance.
