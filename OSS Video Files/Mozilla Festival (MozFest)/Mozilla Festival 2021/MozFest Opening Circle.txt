00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,120
in a room with 400 seats in a

00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,679

spans the globe and is shaped by an

00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,600
incredible range of people

00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,440
joining this meeting and watching on the

00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:14,000

today is the first day of mossfest 2021

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
it is our 11th festival on the calendar

00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,919
but it is the first of its kind as we

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,320
are all virtual this year

00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:24,320
for the next 35ish minutes i will be

00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,039
your host as we kick off 12 days of

00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,480
connecting

00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:28,720
learning and building to keep the

00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,520
internet open free and healthy for us

00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,919
all

00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,360
we had hoped to be in amsterdam but life

00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:35,520
had alternative plans for us all

00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,880
so while amsterdam is still a host city

00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,840
which i hope the video was a little bit

00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,520
of a giveaway

00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,760
we are in fact attending this year's

00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,600
event from home in our living rooms

00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,120
at the side of our beds or on phones

00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,640
distant from each other but certainly

00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,559
not disconnected

00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,720
we are all remote and hearing great

00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:51,679
numbers we're reliant on each other and

00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,520
the technology

00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:55,679
so in a true gesture of faith and

00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,720
technology i'm about to test our zoom

00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,400
room skills

00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,919
and ask us to log into multiple

00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:03,600
platforms to bring a little bit more

00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,600
mosfets into this opening circle

00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:07,240

00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:48,000
thousand people over the next 12 days

00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,600
mass fest is a moment in our year where

00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,559
all corners of the internet health come

00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,080
together

00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:53,360
and we hope mosfets can serve as a

00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,360
bridge across other diverse

00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,799
intersectional movements

00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,720
we have invited some personal

00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:00,400
reflections from three folks from across

00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,320
the internet health movement

00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,600
to reflect on why mozfest is so

00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,200
important to them as part of this

00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,760
community

00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:11,520
i'm honored to introduce j bob alotta

00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,520
and mozfest executive producer

00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,960
thank you sarah good morning good

00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:24,320
afternoon

00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:27,440
good evening as sarah said

00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:28,960
i am j babalota i'm the vice president

00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,240
of global programs at mozilla which

00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,919
means i get to serve

00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:35,840
as the executive producer of mozfest

00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:37,440
what this means is i get to roll up my

00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,120
sleeves with so many of the folks who

00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,279
helped put this on

00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,320
i get to serve as our biggest hype

00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:44,080
person and

00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,640
i'm also just a big kid in the candy

00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:50,000
store when it comes to moss fest

00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:52,000
so much of what has gone into making

00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,520
this year's mozfest and i can't stress

00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,600
that enough it's incredible

00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,799
what has happened behind the scenes and

00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:00,400
is still happening

00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:03,200
um but i i i want to also underscore

00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:05,520
what we let go of

00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,960
we scenario planned a million versions

00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:09,120
of the festival

00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,320
there was i i can't remember if it was

00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,640
plan a b and c

00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,760
plan one two and three and there were a

00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:18,240
million iterations

00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:21,360
of that but it wasn't until we let go

00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:24,400
of what it had been that

00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:28,480
or what we thought mozfest had to be

00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:32,400
that we were able to allow for

00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:35,760
the mozfest that we'll each experience

00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:37,760
um to become and so

00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,200
that's actually what i want to offer

00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:41,520
everyone here today

00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,279
the opportunity to become right

00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:45,679
alongside of us

00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:46,720
as an activist as an idealist as part of

00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:50,159
mozilla

00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:51,840
the way forward uh for me is often most

00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,760
viable if it's an invitation

00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,960
even if it's an invitation that i give

00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:58,880
to myself

00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:00,640
and i am called then to ask myself how

00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,440
can i hold on to all that has come

00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,480
before

00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:06,559
and still show up brand new

00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,600
how can i be one of the many to help

00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:10,799
pathway us

00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:12,240
into the best future possible and that's

00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:15,279
really what mozfest is

00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:17,200
mazfest is built on the belief that if

00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:20,320
you bring as many folks into the room

00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:23,760
who are willing to play to interrogate

00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:24,559
to dream to build to learn and grow

00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,120
together

00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:28,880
that we can pathway our communities

00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,480
someplace better

00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,400
and that's really the basis of movement

00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,120
building it's making an enduring

00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,400
commitment

00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:39,600
to each other to do that work together

00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:41,440
and the other invitation i want to give

00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:44,400
folks and i shared this with

00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,360
the wranglers um who are amazing and who

00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,200
blew my mind

00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:49,120
and and actually i hope that you have

00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,760
the opportunity to just get your mind

00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:53,120
blown

00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:56,159
um for the entire uh uh i'm calling it

00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:59,600
100 days of mosfes

00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:00,480
um but i the the other invitation that i

00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:04,400
offered up

00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:05,440
was this um was this ask of yourself of

00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,520
what can you start

00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,679
at moss fest and i can tell you that all

00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,400
of us who are helping put this together

00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:13,840
and just

00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:16,400
um i i'll every time you see my

00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,039
me on stage i will give kudos to the to

00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,559
the staff

00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:20,080
and the wranglers and all of the

00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:21,440
volunteers who helped put this on

00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:24,720
because it's it's really

00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:27,120
incredible um uh

00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,159
but the invitation that i that i offer

00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,720
up also

00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:31,279
is what can you start at moss fest sarah

00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,600
and i

00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:36,240
have a document that we work up on and

00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:39,520
we meet and at the top of it we put our

00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:41,120
um our goals and and mine was

00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,559
what can i start because instead of

00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,640
thinking how do we get here and

00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,000
how do we finish and how we build this

00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,400
thing that's finite

00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,320
it's much truer to the spirit of moss

00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:53,120
fest if we think of it as a beginning

00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,799
and so this is the opening circle surely

00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,559
and it's the opening circle for the next

00:26:54,799 --> 00:27:00,000
two weeks but really

00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:02,000
i i i implore you and i invite you

00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,080
to find your ways through all the

00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,039
technical and virtual nooks and crannies

00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,200
of moss fest

00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:08,640
which are filled with so many brilliant

00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,279

hope

00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,960
that you find proof of all the stuff

00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,640
that you've been thinking in your head

00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,000
that there's somebody else who thinks

00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,200
that that's a brilliant brilliant

00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,640
brilliant idea

00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:10,399
space and is a senior

00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,120

thanks for the intro part

00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:52,640
so neurodiversity at mod fest um well

00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:54,480
basically we began our journey

00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,559
as facilitators at mazzfest to share

00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,480
some of the ideas that we're working on

00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:59,760
under our cognitive design research at

00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:02,399
the bbc

00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:04,240
um which was exploring opportunities um

00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:06,240
to re-imagine how we work together how

00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:08,720
we act how we communicate

00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:10,399
and how we learn for example we

00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,080
facilitated sessions built around

00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:13,679
covering themes such as inclusion

00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,760
unconscious bias and exploring new

00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:16,799
perspectives we ran several different

00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,679
sessions over

00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:21,120
a few festivals running design workshops

00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:24,240
trialling new ideas

00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:26,080
um and sharing our concepts and full

00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,080
prototypes and cognitive design

00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:30,480
like a zombie survival workshop

00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:32,399
exploring unconscious bias for the twist

00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,000
or a creative workshop on attitudes

00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:35,919
towards neurodiversity and disability in

00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,799
the media an immersive 360 virtual

00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:38,720
reality film

00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:40,559
highlighting the hidden world of the

00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,799
neurodiverse community

00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:44,080
it was all of all of that that opened a

00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:45,360
collaborative environment that

00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,760
ultimately resulted in the

00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:49,520
neurodiversity space for the 2019

00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:51,440
festival

00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:53,440
and it was my first time as a wrangler

00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:55,279
so after facilitating a few sessions

00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,880
uh we managed to get ourselves a space

00:29:55,279 --> 00:30:00,240
at the neurodiversity space

00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,840
at multiverse sorry um

00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,360
as part of the festival's dialogue on

00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,960
internet health we saw

00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:07,120
the opportunity to create a space that

00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,720
would support and represent this new

00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:10,480
growing community

00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,080
um the vision we had for this space

00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,240
stretched across three main elements

00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:15,760
which we identified as important to

00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,279
landing a successful introduction to

00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,799
neurodiversity

00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:20,960
a space that would allow people to

00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:22,799
explore and share what neurodiversity is

00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:24,240
both for those who already identified

00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:26,080
with it and also for those people who

00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,320
didn't know much about it

00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,679
we wanted to find a mix of people from

00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:32,080
all over the world who would

00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:33,440
not only um inspire with their personal

00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,799
stories of neurodiversity

00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,799
but also be able to share their

00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:37,360
expertise towards the festival's goals

00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:40,240
of

00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:41,919
accessible and healthy internet this

00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,840
would be the festival that provided

00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:45,679
adjustments to support new adversity

00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:48,080
with cognitive accessibility options to

00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:50,080
empower people and to make the most of

00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,679
what the festival had to offer

00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,440
we have been able to build some really

00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:55,039
good relationships at the festival both

00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,840
with the organizers and fellow wranglers

00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:57,519
for example

00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,120
and also some of our anglers this year

00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:00,880
are in fact facilitators

00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,320
from the first time we introduced

00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:05,519
neurodiversity

00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:08,320
at the festival in 2019 so

00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:09,919
um as a result of that we saw a great

00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:12,399
result in bringing in new talent and

00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:14,240
perspectives

00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:15,679
we were also able to explore at mazzfest

00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,360
how neurodiversity is the future of

00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:18,320
creativity and innovation in the age of

00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,799
ai

00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:22,480
artificial intelligence is helping us to

00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:23,600
create opportunities for neurodiverse

00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,200
talent to flourish

00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,640
in the age of ai we know that there is

00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:29,679
an increasing need for

00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:31,840
out-of-the-box thinkers um

00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:33,360
and also um the fact that talented

00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,080
individuals can work on difficult

00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,919
problems

00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:38,080
often neurodiverse talents who possess

00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:39,760
strengths in memory pattern recognition

00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:41,200
and critical thinking are most suited to

00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,799
do this type of work

00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,240
so for instance in data science many

00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:44,960
companies have found that neurodiverse

00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,440
employees

00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:49,360
like perform anyone else although

00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,799
creativity as a concept is the most

00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:53,440
commonly associated with

00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:55,120
the arts creative thinking encompasses

00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,960
uh plenty of other areas

00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,320
in daily life such as science technology

00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,000
or design

00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:02,799
all of these fields and more require

00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,880
imagination ai continues to make huge

00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:06,640
strides in creative and technical fields

00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,159
but there is something unique about

00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:11,760
human cognition

00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:13,200
um our empathy curiosity and imagination

00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:16,000
that ai will most likely

00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,200
never replicate ai can however inspire

00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,200
us to think deeply

00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,559
allowing us to do what we are uniquely

00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,000
meant to do to promote

00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:23,799
human diversity and challenge

00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,799
homogeneity through

00:32:23,799 --> 00:32:29,360
neurodiversity

00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:30,159
this year we have sessions exploring um

00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,159
concepts of

00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:33,919
universal language to diverse attention

00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:35,279
spans with a flow of art practice and

00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:37,919
social consciousness

00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:39,519
we're hoping to um we're hoping to

00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:41,200
create a neuro verse

00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:43,039
we're hoping this will emerge promoting

00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,559
an inclusive culture neurological

00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:45,440
differences on the need for pockets of

00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:47,600
serenity

00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:50,000
in the age of digital distraction and

00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:52,080
information overload

00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,000
the neurodiversity space this year aims

00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:55,600
to create a virtual safe space

00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,679
where people can be their authentic

00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:59,600
selves um

00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:02,080
celebrating a thriving neurodiverse

00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,640
community full of detail nuances

00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,519
patterns

00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:06,799
specialisms we will challenge the manner

00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:08,240
in which we relate to the world

00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:10,240
ourselves and one another

00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,440
addressing established preconceptions

00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,039
and inequality

00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,559
through a wave of cutting-edge human

00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:16,640
creativity and innovation

00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:18,320
connecting the world of arts tech and

00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,840
science in this year's neurodiversity

00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,120
space we will explore how today's

00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:25,120
diverse thinkers

00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:27,360
will shape tomorrow's creative future

00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:29,760

for those who don't know as the open

00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:09,839
data charter is a collaboration between

00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:10,240
over 150 governments and organizations

00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:12,639
uh

00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:13,520
working to open up data based on a

00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:16,480
shared

00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:18,399
shared set of principles we promote

00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,760
policies and practices that enable

00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:21,200
governments and civil society

00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:24,000
organizations to collect

00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,399
share and use well-governed data and we

00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,280
turned

00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:28,159
five years last year um we're very happy

00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,879
about that

00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:32,399
um we are this year participating

00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:34,000
finally in moss fest

00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:35,520
with a panel that revolves around our

00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,839
gender work but

00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,720
our overall goal for most fest is to

00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:42,079
connect

00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:44,639
learn share listen get to know people

00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:46,159
and organizations and different projects

00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:48,399
three years ago we went through a

00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:51,599
process of refreshing

00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:52,560
our core principles and while the six

00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:55,440
principles remain

00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:57,040
sound to our network we did have a

00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:59,440
comment and request

00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,640
that as an organization we should try to

00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:03,440
make a better job

00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:04,880
connecting with people and organizations

00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:07,440
that worked

00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,640
within the vigor openness and civic

00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:11,839
touch community

00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:14,960
rather than just with our open data

00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:16,320
colleagues from around the world we need

00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,560
to make a better job

00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:20,320
uh we need it and we're working on that

00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:22,560
uh we need to make a better job

00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:24,480
uh connecting with organizations and

00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,359
people from civic touch from digital

00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,400
human rights

00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:29,680
from data uh privacy from the opers open

00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,960
source community

00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:35,040
and we have been doing so ever since uh

00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:37,040
but that's why we're very happy to be

00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,720
joining moss fest and expect to get to

00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:40,720
know a lot of people and a lot of

00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:42,000
projects and be able to share also what

00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:44,800
we've been up to

00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,599
uh in this in these five years of of

00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:49,040
work

00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:51,599
our core themes are gender pay gap data

00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:52,160
climate change data and anti-corruption

00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:55,119
data

00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:55,440
but we know and very much recognize that

00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:57,520
uh

00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:59,440
collaboration is the way that we work is

00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:02,000
the way that we want to work and it's

00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:04,720
core to any a project that we implement

00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:07,040
so events as open and engaging as

00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:09,280
mosfets are what we want

00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,240
where we want to be where we want to go

00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,720
and

00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:14,400
it also challenges us to break our own

00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:17,200
silos

00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:19,040
on tuesday we will be having a panel on

00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:22,160
our caring for equity

00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:24,800
work uh to share our work on gender pay

00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:26,800
gap and we would like everybody to join

00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,240
but we will be also participating in

00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,480
other panels and

00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,280
trying to engage with as many people as

00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,119
possible

00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,400
uh in order to understand what

00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:36,880
everybody's been up to

00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,760
and and try to uh learn as much as

00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,800
possible

00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:42,640
um that's all for for me and i'm

00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,480
really really happy and uh thank you

00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:46,560
very much for inviting me once again

00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:48,240
see you all during all these moss fest

00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:52,079
and please contact us

00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:54,079
uh i'll be around brilliant thank you so

00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:56,160
much nadi thank you so much lina and bob

00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:58,240
for sharing that with us

00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:00,000
so moss fest is a little different now

00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:02,560
our home for this virtual event is no

00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:05,200
longer a building but a digital platform

00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:06,000
for 2021 mozfest is a global rolling

00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:09,440
event

00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,599
live from 1430 cet central european time

00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,880
zone until after midnight in the central

00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:15,920
european time zone

00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:17,440
until march 19th we don't expect anyone

00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,599
to be with us for the full time

00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:21,359
instead it's important you participate

00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:23,520
in a way that suits your day

00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:24,400
and your schedule and your tolerance for

00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,640
zoom

00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:28,560
the mosfest plaza is our home and on one

00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,960
page it is the one page that you need to

00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,640
find

00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,640
your way around the entire festival you

00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:35,119
can ask access schedule sessions

00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:36,000
15 minute skill shares art and media

00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:37,920
which is the home to

00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,040
all of our on-demand art films and

00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,280
podcasts

00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:42,480
on the plaza you will also find the

00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,640
family resources

00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:46,560
our common spaces and slack and the

00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:48,000
plaza is also home to our live stream

00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,200
where many of you are now watching the

00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,040
opening circle

00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,880
this stream will host live and recorded

00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:54,480
sessions over the next 12 days

00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:57,680
and is the home to our daily mozfest

00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:59,599
studio but some things have not changed

00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:01,520
how and why we're here is very

00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:02,560
recognizable and consistent to previous

00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,240
years

00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,839
because moss fest is about connecting

00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,599
it's about collaborating and building

00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:08,800
towards an open free and healthy

00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:10,880
internet

00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,400
design to participation of the fore the

00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,240
exchange of knowledge and feedback

00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,440
between participants and facilitators is

00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:18,480
what gives the festival

00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:20,240
its energy and its identity the roles of

00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,440
participants and the facilitator are

00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:23,119
interchangeable

00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:25,040
each of us moving between learning and

00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:26,400
sharing knowledge over the next 12 days

00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:29,119
as we collaborate

00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,880
on new ideas and existing projects and

00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:31,280
contribute to the biggest issues we all

00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:34,160

00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:35,599

00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,760
society at large

00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:50,160
the trustworthy ai team has been

00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:52,000
translated into 13 community spaces

00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:53,760

00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:58,720
ec lou steven mayer and connect

00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:58,720
libraries connected

00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:03,680
before we wrap up this virt with a

00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:06,880
virtual version of our world famous

00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:08,720
moss fest group photo let me just share

00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:11,760
we are here for 12 days we are

00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:14,000
connecting across multiple time zones

00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,800
from about 116 countries the last time i

00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,599
checked

00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:19,040
and from various devices this is a bit

00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:21,599
of an experiment

00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:23,040
so there will be bumps along the way

00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:23,920
technology will probably fail to meet

00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:25,920
our needs

00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:27,200
someone most certainly will dial into a

00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:28,240
session from what sounds like the

00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:30,880
airport

00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:31,599
and with 5000 participants and 540

00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,359

we will not all enjoy perfect wifi

00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:37,200
connections but with grace and patience

00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:39,359
we can get through this together

00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:40,400
we promise you ours and we thank you for

00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:42,720

done this without you

00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:48,480
the mosfest team is made up of many

00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:50,960
groups but throughout the year
