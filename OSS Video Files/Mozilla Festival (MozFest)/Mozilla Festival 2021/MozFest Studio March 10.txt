00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,720
right now we're at the center of this

00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:09,120
year's host city of mosfes 2021

00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,840
amsterdam and this place is called dam

00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,920
square

00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,920
the monument behind me is the national

00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,280
monument that was placed here right

00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,960
after the second world war

00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,840
to commemorate the casualties that have

00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:22,160
taken place during this ride

00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,119
it reminds us never to take our freedom

00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,720
for granted

00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:26,960
which is something that is completely in

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,720
line with what mozfest stands for

00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,880
you should have the freedom to control

00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,120
your own data and if you don't

00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:44,550
you should fight for it welcome to

00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:51,520

the mozfest schedule

00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,240
on another note uh since all

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,399
participants are watching from all over

00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,079
the world we're very curious to see what

00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,759
your area looks like

00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,759
so we would love it if you could share

00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:06,399
this with us in a short video

00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,960
showing an iconic spot near where you

00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,800
live

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,959
so maybe you're watching from a place

00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,440
near the eiffel tower that would be very

00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,599
cool

00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,680
or you could show us uh the beautiful

00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:18,640
scenery from your balcony

00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:22,560
or it could look something like this hi

00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:25,360
guys i'm joining was fest this year from

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,640

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,239
and then share the video on slack and on

00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,920

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:39,360

and since we saw you last a lot has

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,720
happened here at moss fest

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,400
so let me highlight a few of the

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,840
interesting most fast sessions that you

00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,760
might have missed

00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,440
one space that we haven't talked about

00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,200
much in our shows so far is the

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,120
sustainability space

00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,720
and yesterday they discussed the role of

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,640
tech in human rights

00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,480
and the future of the climate and the

00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,440
recording of this discussion will be

00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,800
available on demand soon another session

00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,800
that happened yesterday

00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,840
and that really spoke to me is the

00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,000
session in the space

00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,920
openness where they discussed how to

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,120
open up when it comes to gender

00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,920
inequality

00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,599
and to talk some more on how this data

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,319
how data can be used to solve this

00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,040
problem

00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,640
we've invited marisa miyodovsky who

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,879
facilitated this session

00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,879
and caleb kibbett who is a wrangler of

00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:28,300
the space openness

00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:29,920
hello guys lovely to see your faces

00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:33,200
[Applause]

00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:35,360
marisa um i think most people

00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,640
have heard about the pay gap between men

00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,799
and women

00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,760
but you now have new data to support

00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:43,440
these claims

00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,440
so how did you acquire this data

00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:49,920
hello hello to the audience well

00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,560
i i work for the buenos aires city

00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,439
government

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,000
and i am very proud to say that in our

00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:57,599
government

00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,319
we produce this data we collect the data

00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,680
through household surveys and to and

00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,640
through surveys that we do

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,519
to companies to to to to the labor

00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,760
market

00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,400
we collect the information and we

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,799
produce the indicators we calculate this

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,599
gap

00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,640
with this sources of information the

00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:17,919
interesting thing

00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:21,759
is that this is official information

00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:24,479
and that is available to anyone who can

00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,520
would like to to see it to analyze it

00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:29,360
and to use it

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:32,240
for any purpose in our case we use it

00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,880
for making decisions to understand how

00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,080
the gap

00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:39,840
is produced and how to and we design

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:41,919
in order to tackle it okay and

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,280
how did the participants maybe this is a

00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:44,400
question for you caleb how did the

00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:48,000
participants the women

00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,000
and the men react to this data

00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:54,160
the reaction from the participants was

00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,320
we were concerned and majority

00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,680
participants are concerned and

00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:02,160
actually concerned by an alarm

00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,759
by the data especially talking about

00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,360
over 70 percent

00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:09,280
disparity income of the region and

00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,960
actually they actually accepted and

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,360
agree with the data and

00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,479
they see the need to change the city's

00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,360
core

00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:18,560
that was the impact of the presentation

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,880
of the session head

00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,639
nice so now we have really hard evidence

00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,560
for people to act on

00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,080
marissa you're saying you're going to

00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,520
use this information to

00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,440
to do something about it what is

00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,520
something that you could use the data

00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,680
for

00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,039
like how are you going to to implement

00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,000
it

00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,720
we are we are already using the data

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,280
first of all

00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,360
we publish the data in a portal that we

00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,919
call the gender indicator system when

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,160
you can

00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,960
where you can see not only the gender

00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,680
pay gap

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,160
but another set of indicators that gives

00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,680
you

00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:56,160
an integral picture about the situation

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,120
for women and for men not only in the

00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,400
labor market

00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:02,319
but also in other axis for example in

00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,280
decision making positions

00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,160
in in situations regarding in situations

00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,639
regarding to

00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,600
violence either in the labor market or

00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,720
in the domestic

00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,479
sphere so with all that information you

00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,280
have a comprehensive

00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,400
picture about the situation with that

00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,880
information

00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,520
then we analyze it and we start to

00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,400
understand

00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,680
what are the causes that uh that that

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,960
affect that make

00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,360
the this difference between what women

00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,479
make

00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,560
relative to what men make and we

00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,600
use this information in order to pass

00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,000
regulations

00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,960
in order to refocus certain

00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,720
interventions

00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,880
just to give you an example we

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:46,319
understood that part of the pay gap

00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:49,280
was a driven by the time that women also

00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:51,599
allocate for caring related tasks so

00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:54,400
with that information we passed a law

00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:55,360
for the for buenos aires city in order

00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,800
to increase

00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,199
the leave that men can take when they

00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,479
have

00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:05,440
kids and and and this was

00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,560
kind of a a compensation relative to

00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,800
what women were

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,599
were having because what the law was

00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,560
saying before

00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:14,400
is that it is the women's responsibility

00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,599
to take care of children that

00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:20,319
are born because they had 90 days

00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,759
and we and men only had 10. wow yeah i

00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,680
understand

00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,520
so you're actually making law with this

00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,319
new data that's very cool

00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,560
um and caleb one question i have to ask

00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,919
you because you are a man would you give

00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,919
up your wrangler position

00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:36,319
if it would go to a suitable women

00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:38,880
candidate

00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,639
absolutely i think the intention of

00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,560
wrangling is to deliver the best

00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:45,120
mozilla festival experience and if

00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,720
that's going to happen by me giving up

00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,039
the seat that would be

00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,160
uh absolutely perfect but i think that's

00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:53,680
not usually the

00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:56,160
the reason uh the main thing is the lack

00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,000
the inequality that exists and as she

00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,160
has highlighted or already

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,919
women already natural disadvantage so

00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,280
there's always a need for affirmative

00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:05,759
actions to make sure that

00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,680
we have a level of playing field so that

00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,360
would be my response with regard to that

00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,520
and absolutely i would

00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,120
okay nice well that's the right answer i

00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,280
think and thank you guys for

00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,800
shedding some more light on this topic

00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,430
we hope to see more of you guys in the

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,210
future

00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:22,800
[Applause]

00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:26,000
[Music]

00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,000
time to get

00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:29,680
because we're very pleased to see you

00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,759
guys are using the hashtag

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,919
musfest and there were definitely some

00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:36,640
tweets that caught our eye today

00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:38,320
like this one from frank who is really

00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,399
happy just like us

00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,760
about the amount of participants this

00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,159
year over

00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,080
six thousand which is crazy because when

00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,839
mosfes was held in real life

00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,120
the amount of participants was around

00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:52,640
two thousand

00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:55,279
so that's very good and then this one

00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,440
by erika she's embracing her neural

00:08:55,279 --> 00:09:00,640
nerdiness and she made a very cool

00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,399
collage to summarize her day so nice

00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,839
work erica we love to see all this

00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:08,480
creativity

00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:11,680
um and paul shared a lovely zoom

00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,600
group photo of his session looks very uh

00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,200
zelek paul as we would say here in dutch

00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,080
that means something like cozy

00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,160
cute but good to see you finding ways to

00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,959
still connect with each other

00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,839
and it was also quite the busy day on

00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:26,880
slack

00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,519
um there we heard from chris who is

00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,320
looking for

00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:32,080
team captains and non-player characters

00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,800
for the simulation game called

00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,360
the future of money so if you're still

00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,279
free

00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,399
this friday or next week when the

00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:41,600
sessions take place

00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:43,760
hit chris up and of course if you have

00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,120
any pictures or videos from your

00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,480
sessions and you would like to share

00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,399
them with the world

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,800
make sure to post them on twitter or

00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,720
slack using the hashtag mozfest

00:09:50,800 --> 00:10:04,320
and then they might end up here at

00:09:52,720 --> 00:10:06,160
mosfest studio

00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,320
i'm sure you're not the only one because

00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,279
we're all constantly under surveillance

00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,920
through cameras

00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:13,600
wi-fi tracking you name it but there is

00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,079
something you can do about that

00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,640
and that is what mozilla fellow and phd

00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,440
candidate at the data justice lab fika

00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:32,240
johnson

00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:34,480
is trying to teach us

00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,920
do you know when and by whom you are

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,839
being followed

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,240
you might think you know but it's not

00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,480
always that obvious

00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,760
fika why are we at this place and what

00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,200
is the link with this place on

00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,760
artificial intelligence

00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:50,000
because i don't really see it we are on

00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,680
the marina terrain which is the old navy

00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,880
terrain in the city of amsterdam in the

00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,360
city center

00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,200
this marine terrain is one of these

00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,200
locations in amsterdam that has been

00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,600
labeled as a testing area

00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,760
they are testing things that goes from

00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,079
uh they call the crowd management system

00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,079
so

00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,920
counting how many people are there in a

00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:09,760
specific location but i think the

00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,680
interesting thing about your question is

00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,079
it's not really visible you can't see it

00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:16,160
so you can only see small little traces

00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:18,720
like three cameras hanging in a public

00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,240
space but that's it and we sort of been

00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,920
normalized because we're so used to

00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,519
security cameras hanging there so yeah i

00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,079
don't realize it's being used for other

00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,440
things

00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,880
is it a problem that we're being

00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,720
surveillance is it something that we

00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,399
should be scared of i think it's about

00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,839
how far do we want people

00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,760
how intrusive do we want these

00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,519
technologies to be and i think that

00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,959
should be a conversation and sort of

00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,720
for me it's really clear that i don't

00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,680
want this because for instance for

00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,600
example

00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,360
wi-fi tracking if you ask do you think

00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,279
it's problematic that wi-fi tracking

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,680
happens at central station for instance

00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,720
yeah

00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,880
and then they say well it's a security

00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,160
risk so of course like for security

00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,399
we're willing to give up some of our

00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,480
privacy which is of course a very

00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,560
natural balancing act

00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,160
but then say this data is not used for

00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,920
security but it's used to sort of

00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,000
actually calculate how much money

00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,360
unlike how many visitors the supermarket

00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,360
in central station gets

00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,399
determined the rent price then all of a

00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,320
sudden it becomes a different

00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,560
conversation and what about your project

00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:15,360
because you also have a project on this

00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,680
space right we created these low-tech

00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,600
canvas against high-tech surveillance

00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:22,079
and it's around facial recognition

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,880
thermal imaging and wi-fi tracking

00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:26,160
and which all happens in certain spaces

00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,240
and it's really about

00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,079
being an explorer in your own city

00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,079
having small little exercises

00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,120
going out looking for cameras looking

00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:35,279
for signs

00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,399
to showcase whether or not this is

00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,560
happening so

00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,240
with your canvases uh you're just trying

00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,240
to raise the awareness so that people

00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,000
start thinking for themselves yes

00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,760
whether they like it or not yeah and

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,519
start the conversation about where is it

00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,200
what is what that we want and what is it

00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,560
that we don't want and what is it that

00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,600
we actually don't know and we want to

00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,480
sort of figure out

00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,200
more about if watching that leaves you

00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,360
wanting more

00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,440
fick is hosting a session tomorrow and

00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:06,399
co-hosting a few sessions next week

00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:08,160
so look out for her name on the schedule

00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,839
do you recognize that feeling when

00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,639
you're scrolling through the most fast

00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,480
schedule

00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,639
and you see so many sessions that you

00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,760
want to attend but you only have 24

00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,079
hours in a day

00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,040
well we have invited facilitator becca

00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:23,200
riggs to help you

00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:27,120
choose becca welcome to the show

00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:29,200
um yeah what will your session be about

00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,519
hi everyone yeah so we have an amazing

00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,680
discussion that's happening in about 45

00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,200
minutes as part of our mozfest dialogue

00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,639
and debate series

00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,040
it's going to be a panel that's looking

00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:42,480
at the intersections of labor justice

00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,279
and ai and tech so thinking about the

00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,519
ways in which

00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:46,320
internet platforms and complex ai

00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:48,560
systems

00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,839
have created this new ecosystem of

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,240
on-demand

00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,279
app facilitated services things like

00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,360
uber drivers

00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,800
amazon turk workers people who do gig

00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,800
work through fiverr

00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,079
instacart doordash and lots of other

00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,000
apps

00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:04,160
we'll be talking a little bit about work

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,839
that's precarious and temporary and the

00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,079
people who perform that work

00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,279
aha nice because i was reading a little

00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:12,399
bit the summary

00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:13,199
and i was thinking um are we talking

00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,680
about label

00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,959
labor rights for algorithms that sounds

00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:20,959
a bit silly to me

00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:23,040
but does do algorithms need labor rights

00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:24,000
or is it for the people who are so

00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,800
talking

00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,440
it's for the people yeah so um a lot of

00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,639
what we

00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:33,440
call ai is really powered by like

00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,240
thousands of people doing labor so for

00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,240
example

00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,079
to build a machine learning system you

00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,360
have lots of workers who are involved in

00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,040
labeling those data sets

00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,720
training the data and usually they're

00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,519
using platforms and not getting paid

00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,079
very much

00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,880
and also our laws don't really reflect

00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,600
you know the gig

00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:51,040
economy so a lot of what we call ai is

00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,560
really powered by people

00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:56,240
and workers nice um and um if people

00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,760
want to learn more about this subject

00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:01,760
after most fest is over what can they do

00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,120
um well so i would definitely recommend

00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,240
that they check out the work of our

00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,639
three panelists

00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:09,040
so our panelists will be dr lily irani

00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:12,480
who's a professor at uc san diego

00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:14,320
um we also have uh sherry stanley who's

00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,600
a lead organizer at a project called

00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,920
turk opticon

00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,120
which is a tool that helps the amazon

00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,199
mechanical turk

00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,360
workers talk to one another so check out

00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,079
that work and then finally we'll also be

00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,199
hearing from
