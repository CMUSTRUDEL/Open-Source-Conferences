Title: What has the Wikimedia movement to do with sustainability?
Publication date: 2021-03-11
Playlist: Mozilla Festival 2021
Description: 
	Our discussion will focus on how the Wikimedia movement can help the sustainability and climate movements while maintaining our neutral point of view. What does knowledge activism look like in a platform focused on being apolitical? In this talk we will look at how activist communities are developing a playbook to meet the world's information needs to confront a pressing climate crisis.

hello and welcome to this session on

00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,119
sustainability

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:02,880
and wikimedia this session is called

00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,799
what has the wikimedia movement to do

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,280
with sustainability but that's a little

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,439
bit too

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,560
inward-facing so we're going to widen it

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:13,599
up and invite you in this session

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,160
uh i'm my name is john einelli

00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,800
and i'm co-hosting this with alex

00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,239
stinson

00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:23,840
who is the c is a senior program

00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:26,640
strategist at the wikimedia foundation

00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,760
and you're all free to have video on if

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,720
you want to you don't

00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,879
need to do it we're going to start off

00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,480
with a little bit of an introduction to

00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,560
the topic and then we're going to go

00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,120
into

00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,120
co-creation and

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:45,840
yeah collaborative discussion

00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:49,040
and the topic as we said it

00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,800
at first is a little bit

00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,879
like what do we have to do with

00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,800
sustainability we want to wind it up and

00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:59,519
we're calling it right now

00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:02,879
how is wikimedia doing on climate change

00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:05,440
and i'm

00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:08,640
one of the co-founders of the wikimedia

00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:11,440
for sustainable development

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:14,000
and alex it's also part of that and also

00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,000
wikipedia

00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:22,959
and so

00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:26,159
do you go to the next slide alex

00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:28,480
yep and we

00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:30,799
recently in the wikimedia movement had a

00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,799
very

00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:37,360
uh large strategy

00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:38,720
session and two of the point or three of

00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,280
the points

00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,319
that came out of that has to do with

00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,239
sustainability

00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:48,959
in various ways and

00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,760
since we know wiki media is so heavily

00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,760
used

00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,040
we want to improve the content to raise

00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,799
awareness of about

00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,879
environmental sustainability that's one

00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,959
of the things we

00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,000
started with and the other one that

00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,599
we're going to focus on today

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,159
perhaps is create partnerships with

00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:06,159
relevant institutions and organizations

00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,439
the third one is also a little bit

00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,200
inward facing in

00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:12,400
for the organization itself so we're

00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,400
going to skip that for today

00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,079
and um do you want to continue there

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,160
from there alex

00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,280
yeah and part of the reason we're going

00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,400
to skip it is

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:26,080
when our carbon footprint analysis and

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:29,440
the the conversations about um

00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:31,600
uh the uh kind of actual like

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,560
carbon footprint of our events and data

00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,680
centers

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:38,800
uh came through it uh uh

00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:41,680
we realized very early that

00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,160
the the kind of size of our footprint is

00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,759
not

00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,400
huge um and so we're looking at the

00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,040
bigger

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,240
uh part of this which is the

00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,240
sustainability awareness and

00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,639
partnerships

00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,600
um so we're gonna look at this through

00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,639
the perspective

00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:01,919
of climate change because it's

00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,400
scopeable as as you know sustainability

00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,120
affects

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,520
everything in our lives every single

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,960
part

00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,960
of the human experience is connected to

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,919
sustainability in some ways so it's kind

00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,440
of overwhelming

00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:16,800
if you try to quantify or evaluate that

00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,400
so we're going to start at something

00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,440
that's a little bit more concise which

00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,360
is climate change

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,120
uh which is like one aspect of

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,360
sustainability and what we know is

00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,560
there's about 2 800 articles on english

00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,720
wikipedia

00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,880
um that are about climate change there

00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,880
are seven language wikipedias right now

00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,560
who are organizing content around

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,199
climate change topics

00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,400
um and we have a group a community group

00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,840
but convenience for sustainable

00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,080
development that's facilitating the

00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:45,440
multicultural multi-contextual

00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:48,720
knowledge gap work required to to

00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:51,520
communicate about sustainability um and

00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,280
we know this content's pretty impactful

00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:56,400
so this was a page view analysis

00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:59,680
uh from uh earlier last year uh

00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:01,919
from uh october last year of

00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,840
uh english wikipedia's climate change

00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:05,440
content and you can see that there were

00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,080
lots of pageview spikes

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:10,160
as much as a million page views a day on

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:13,280
just the english wikipedia content

00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:15,440
uh and uh when the covet 19

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,199
crisis happened like other climate

00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,080
communication channels we had a huge

00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,919
crash

00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,759
in these pageviews you can see it right

00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:24,560
here in the graph

00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,039
um and we're only just now recovering

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,680
from

00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,319
that that kind of communications bubble

00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,720
collapse

00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,160
um but in the meantime we still had

00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,919
about at the

00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,280
time i was measuring this 98 million

00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:37,600
page views in a year

00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,919
or if we look at it with a bit more

00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:44,160
comprehensively for all of last year's

00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:45,919
uh content from those 2 800

00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,560
english wikipedia articles they had

00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:51,360
about 125 million page views

00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:54,080
um and those same pages across all the

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,280
other language wikipedias had about 166

00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,720
million page views

00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:00,319
that's uh only a fraction of what the

00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,000
the communication content about

00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,720
sustainability and climate change

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,360
on the pages but this is only like the

00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,560
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,800
000 or so explicitly about uh

00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,319
climate change and these articles are on

00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,680
almost all of the 300

00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:17,840
language wikipedias um so it's

00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,759
we are probably one of the most read

00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,599
sources of climate change knowledge and

00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:24,800
i would argue sustainability knowledge

00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:26,720
on the internet right now uh and

00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,560
it's it's really a not climate

00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:32,240
communication opportunity

00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,680
um and it we like the rest of wikipedia

00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:37,280
it's very responsive

00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:40,319
to to change right so when something

00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,120
in the public uh uh witnesses like a

00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,240
crisis

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,680
or for example vanessa nakate getting

00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,120
cut out of the ap

00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,639
photograph uh last year and causing huge

00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,919
kind of

00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:52,879
self-reflection of the climate movement

00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:56,319
on where

00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:59,280
activists of color were being

00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:01,440
kind of elevated in the conversation you

00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:05,280
see the wikipedias responding

00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:06,720
uh pretty soon after uh the nessa nakate

00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:10,160
article was in

00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:12,720
you know 12 20 languages and we had

00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:15,840
community groups organizing to write

00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,680
uh the the biographies about her

00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,199
and other black climate activists and we

00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,400
see this same kind of like

00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:25,120
equity justice system level change

00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,639
kind of motivation drawing in people to

00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,199
edit on these pages

00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,800
um and it's uh we had a couple events at

00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,080
the end of last year that were kind of

00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,880
organized around this and they're very

00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,120
effective

00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,880
we also think that wikipedia could be a

00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,800
channel for

00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,399
more diverse communities to show up and

00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,240
communicate about climate change

00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,159
to make sure that it's in their local

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,040
language you know sixty percent of the

00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,640
page views

00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,320
to this climate content is to

00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,720
non-english content

00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,640
um that's a big deal because uh it's

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,800
actually outperforming the

00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,720
the half of our page views on all of

00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,440
wikipedi wik media platforms

00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,720
including page uh projects other than

00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,080
wikipedia

00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,680
are to english wikipedia um so just

00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,760
just the climate content alone is

00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,600
outperforming in terms of diversity and

00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:13,200
global representation and multi

00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,560
kind of multilingual context also when

00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,600
you look at

00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:19,600
climate communication channels they're

00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:23,040
overwhelmingly in english or

00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:25,200
european languages and so uh there are

00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,800
community groups that when the activists

00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,959
kind of networks out in the world

00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,120
talk about issues one of the big ones is

00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:33,440
bringing good relevant science-based

00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,680
communication into local languages that

00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,160
is meaningful to local contexts

00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,959
and wikipedia is kind of a good place to

00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:43,279
do that

00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:45,279
um and for example when disha ravi's uh

00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:48,000
arrest happened as part of the india

00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:50,320
farmer protests about two months ago

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,160
immediately her page become became a

00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:55,040
place of contention but also of

00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,959
of kind of awareness of where kind of

00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,120
closing society is happening in india

00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,720
but also the climate movement in india

00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,480
and its relationship to the farmer's

00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,160
protest or not relationship to the

00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,200
farmer's protest depending on

00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,920
like how you read the news and so this

00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,800
was a

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,320
a good example of where wikipedia is a

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,120
very responsive way

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,200
to highlight or look at like the climate

00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:20,399
movement sustainability movements

00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:22,160
uh more broadly um we also

00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,680
like just to give you some samples of

00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,720
very popular articles on english

00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,200
wikipedia

00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,560
um and a caveat like i'm using examples

00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,680
from english because it's one of our

00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,160
most organized

00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:34,560
sets of content right now and that jan

00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:38,000
and i are very familiar with it because

00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:41,200
of our our uh kind of international

00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,040
uh linguistic focus on english um but

00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,959
this is happening in other languages too

00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,000
like scan who's on the call right now is

00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:48,240
organizing the spanish

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,360
language community um around some of

00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,760
these topics

00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,959
and uh you'll notice that like key

00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,279
figures and key

00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,640
public events like in other climate

00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,880
communication settings

00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,760
uh bring pivot a whole bunch of

00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,279
attention

00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:06,480
to climate change to wildfires um

00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:07,519
and uh yeah uh and all that stuff thank

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,720
you scan for

00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:13,519
sharing the numbers um this has not gone

00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,079
unnoticed recently uh the wikimedia

00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,480
foundation

00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:17,360
has gotten a kind of study steady stream

00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,519
of requests

00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,680
about climate communication after seeing

00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:24,160
just the scale of our covid

00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:26,640
uh coverage and importance in the kind

00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,399
of global crisis response of wikipedia

00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:31,600
and the covet

00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,800
crisis and we're also seeing community

00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,560
groups begin to organize

00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,160
uh kind of spearheaded by wikimedians

00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,320
for sustainable development

00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,600
but also connected through various

00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,560
community groups for example in the

00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,480
bottom left

00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:46,720
this is a uh casinophi who's in nigeria

00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,399
he organized a black climate activist

00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:52,079
event after the vanessa

00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:53,040
nakate ap erasure and then uh this

00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,720
organizing group

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,800
climate development knowledge network

00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,800
hosted both an edithon

00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,040
two years ago and an online edithon

00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,200
recently focused on

00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:05,600
climate change and we have some very

00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:08,320
high profile high page view kind of

00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,680
african climate change content um and

00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,079
we're also seeing community groups

00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,320
really

00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:14,240
start to localize and improvise uh on

00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,200
this so climate communication is best on

00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,880
one's local

00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,720
and relevant and attached people's

00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,240
health health and well-being

00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,079
and what you see is when our community

00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,160
groups and the philippines

00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,279
on the left for example organized

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,880
translatathons

00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:28,720
they they focus on things important to

00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,639
the philippines like monsoons

00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,320
and their effect on human kind of

00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,720
lifestyles and food and that kind of

00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,320
stuff

00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:39,440
or in ghana they really do uh connect

00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:41,839
the um uh to these other

00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,600
uh uh other topics of interest to the

00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:45,440
ghanaian community

00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,680
and like i said at the beginning the

00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,600
opportunity is not just the pages about

00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,560
climate change uh when we say things

00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,079
like climate change

00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,920
a lot of people think climate science

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:56,160
but it's like how do we connect

00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,600
all of human society to the climate

00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,160
crisis in some way

00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,680
for example the article water in africa

00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,959
during one of these africa focused

00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,920
climate change

00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:06,399
events um really expanded and made a

00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,160
more

00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:10,320
kind of explicit connection to water

00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:13,360
scarcity climate change and

00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:17,200
kind of changing environments in these

00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:20,639
uh uh contexts or for example

00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:22,800
um and this is an edit i made um the

00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,160
article about petroleum said nothing

00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,639
about conflict or

00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,240
the environmental crisis uh in the

00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,240
beginning of the article and this

00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:33,680
article has something like 80 000

00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:36,320
or 40 or 50 or 60 000 page views a month

00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,600
and and people are reading it and not

00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,399
we're only seeing the

00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,240
economic and extractive value of uh

00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:44,000
petroleum and not connecting it to these

00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,440
larger social issues that are important

00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,160
for sustainability

00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,480
and it could be as small or as simple as

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,720
going to a geography article and saying

00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,079
there is sea level rise there will be

00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,320
coastal erosion

00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:58,160
uh communities are planning right so

00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,600
it's everything from the kind of broad

00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:03,120
high level

00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:05,920
issues and country type articles

00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,440
um to petroleum which is like a more

00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,639
kind of medium-sized

00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,800
uh topic um two very local

00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,079
very relevant topics and this article in

00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,680
particular has about twenty three

00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:17,920
thousand page views a month

00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:20,000
so just by connecting it to sea level

00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,800
rise where there's a communication

00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,480
strategy

00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,920
and we're seeing community groups so in

00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,639
spanish for example

00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,519
um we have a argentinian group of

00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,760
organizers

00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,920
uh applying for a grant right now for

00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:34,160
wiki meets sustainable fashion

00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,279
uh with the goal of connecting many of

00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,760
our fashion pages

00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:39,519
to sustainability and issues like

00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:43,199
climate crisis and water

00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:44,639
access or um and so there's

00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,320
there's opportunities like this

00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,519
abounding and i just wanted to highlight

00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,000
a few of them

00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,600
um first the wikimedia foundation has a

00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,760
partnership with unhuman rights and

00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,399
we're going to be doing a series of

00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,800
kind of contests and campaign activities

00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,519
uh

00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,480
through the april and may window around

00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,040
earth day

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,800
about right to a healthy environment um

00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,079
so we're able to kind of leverage these

00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:09,600
international partnerships

00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:12,720
to to focus our community on key

00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,639
justice related issues

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,800
you can join us on wikiproject climate

00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:20,560
change on english wikipedia or spanish

00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:22,480
scan is linking to in the chat right now

00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:25,680
and learn how to edit yourself there's

00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:28,000
some easy edits we've been documenting

00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,680
and then you can join wikimedians for

00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,399
sustainable development by going to this

00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,759
url

00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,920
going to that section that says

00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:36,560
communication channels and clicking

00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,440
um and that will connect you with the

00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,000
stuff

00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,759
um so i'm going to hand it back to yon

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,160
to facilitate kind of the co-creative

00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,199
part

00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:48,000
of this yes and and i also want to

00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:48,959
to fill in a little bit on what you said

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,120
there with

00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,320
going local instead of trying to go

00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:56,720
large

00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:59,040
for example try if you want to edit the

00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,399
article on climate change on english

00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,519
wikipedia

00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:08,000
it already has almost 25 000

00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:10,720
edit to it so it's very refined already

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,920
it might be hard to find the the low

00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,240
hanging fruit

00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,279
where whereas in other places there's

00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:19,440
much more

00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:21,839
of a gap to fill and i

00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,040
also have or i'm not sure if it's

00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:24,880
already in the arts

00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,720
session but i'll put a link here in the

00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:29,279
chat there's a little bit

00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:32,560
of a video of the evolution of the

00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,560
article of climate change

00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:40,320
but for the co-creation and

00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,880
here we we will see if we get go into

00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,240
too much

00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:47,759
chaos or not so we have prepared a

00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:50,639
an ether pad an ether pad is a

00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,519
way to co-write a document and i'll put

00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:54,079
the link in the

00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:55,920
chat there so you can hopefully click it

00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:59,600
and find it

00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:03,040
and if you find your way into it

00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:06,720
you will see that i have written

00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:09,199
down one question so far

00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,600
and here we want to collect all your

00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:13,439
ideas

00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,799
so the first question and we're going to

00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,400
only spend 10 minutes here and then

00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:19,600
we're going to go into a

00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:22,880
discussion and questions and answers

00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:25,760
the first question is where do you think

00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,280
or where do you know that you can find

00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,679
good sources about

00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,799
the local effects of climate change so

00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:35,039
that you can

00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:38,080
go into an article in geography article

00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:39,200
and try to improve that with good

00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,799
sources

00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:45,840
so please just go in here write

00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:47,039
some ideas that you have go nuts you

00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,200
can't really destroy

00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:51,280
anything unless you really really really

00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:55,360
try to

00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:58,240
so try to be gentle and

00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,799
start adding a few ideas on where you

00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,919
can find

00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:05,039
things and it doesn't need to be your

00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:06,640
local area but any local area so don't

00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:08,640
only think but of course it might be

00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:11,760
easier to think about oh where can i

00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,760
find things about my home

00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,039
and then i'm gonna come with a few more

00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:20,799
questions here so

00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:20,799
we'll spend a few minutes in this

00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:33,679
see a lot of things happening already

00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,679
that's very nice

00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:43,840
if you need more lines just press enter

00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:43,840
and add a new one

00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:39,840
this is really cool so much activity

00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:53,679
i'm gonna give you a few a minute more

00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:55,600
and then when i added another question

00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:57,039
if you come up with an answer to the

00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:00,240
previous one just

00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:03,919
go back you can edit this whole document

00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:07,840
all the time so don't feel

00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,840
too stressed when i add something

00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:51,780
all right i think we'll add the next

00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:54,880
question here now

00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:54,880
[Music]

00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:04,880
let's see if i can put it in here yes

00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:07,039
and i think this question

00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:09,440
is one that you wrote alex do you want

00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:11,600
to speak anything to it

00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:14,240
yeah so one of the things we're learning

00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,440
about wikimedia is there's basically two

00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,400
types of participants

00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,760
in the wikimedia movement um kind of

00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,760
communicators and

00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,679
kind of knowledge creators who are like

00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,720
become editors on wikimedia and then

00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:27,919
organizers

00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:30,559
who kind of facilitate access to the

00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,200
the communicators and content creators

00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,720
um so

00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,200
we invite you to think about like what

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:37,600
kinds of organizations should wikimedia

00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,720
or communities like yourselves who help

00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,520
wikimedia

00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:45,840
um connect with and and what do they

00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:45,840
look like what might they be involved in

00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:18,559
and i i do like

00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:22,000
uh that you add

00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:22,400
generic examples so that anyone can sort

00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,159
of

00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:29,360
oh what can i find in my uh

00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:32,559
vincinity or my area

00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:34,720
but also don't be afraid to

00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:36,080
give very specific examples if you

00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:39,120
happen to know that oh

00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:42,159
there's a person in this school because

00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:43,200
that might be a useful entrance for us

00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:45,760
to start

00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,640
something that might become a larger

00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,200
collaboration

00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,880
because even a single teacher in one

00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:54,640
local school might have a

00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:58,080
very nice network which could turn bloom

00:22:54,640 --> 00:23:01,360
into something nice so both

00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,360
both ideas are welcome

00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,840
can i send you a couple requests for

00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,840
apps

00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:53,600
all right and i'll

00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,880
add a last question here but you can

00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:59,279
keep on going

00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:04,480
if you if you're not done yet and

00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:07,679
here's something that might be hard

00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:11,520
to directly answer now but perhaps you

00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:11,520
can come back to this a little bit later

00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,880
yes

00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:20,360
so what would make you feel more

00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:23,500
empowered in this regard

00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:23,500
[Music]

00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:35,039
yes perfect thank you alex

00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:36,080
and our hope is to think like what kinds

00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:38,880
of communication

00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:40,159
or knowledge exchange would people

00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:43,600
benefit from

00:24:40,159 --> 00:25:01,840
uh on projects like wikimedia or

00:24:43,600 --> 00:25:01,840
uh other kind of open knowledge space

00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,640
and this will be our last

00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:18,240
writing question here

00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:21,679
so try to

00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:26,000
pour your thinking through the fingers

00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:26,000
into the keyboards onto the internet to

00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,840
us

00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:57,919
and then uh alex i'm gonna

00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:00,000
do a little bit of a practical exercise

00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:03,360
here we didn't talk about this because i

00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,919
sort of came up with this after

00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,640
we prepared yesterday so this is going

00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:09,520
to be an

00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,520
entirely

00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:13,039
interesting experiment but i i wanted

00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,240
you

00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:19,440
to get a sort of uh a taste

00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,000
of what wikipedia looks like and of

00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,760
course

00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:26,159
you obviously have seen wikipedia before

00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:29,760
but i want you to go to

00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:32,320
the article in

00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,919
preferably your native language

00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:37,279
wikipedia

00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:40,640
about your local either home

00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:43,360
town or village or municipality or

00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:47,120
county or something like that

00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:48,080
and trying to see is there already

00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:53,520
something about

00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:56,000
climate change on that article

00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:59,360
so do a little bit experiment open up a

00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:04,400
second tab in your browser and

00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:06,880
navigate to somewhere

00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,480
or or if not climate change other

00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:12,080
environmental issues

00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:15,200
like uh pollution or public health

00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:19,039
or or marginalized communities

00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:22,159
being disproportionately impacted by

00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:22,159
by that space

00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:30,720
and if if it turns out that you're from

00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,760
uh somewhere which is already very well

00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,679
covered

00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,039
it might be hard to skim through the

00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:37,919
page in

00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:39,279
everything so just try to use the

00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:41,039
browser's

00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:42,320
search function perhaps you have a

00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:45,520
control f

00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:47,840
and type in climate and see if

00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:50,559
you get anything you might get

00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,559
temperatures

00:27:50,799 --> 00:28:06,240
over the year

00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:09,919
so we'll just give you a little bit of

00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,919
time for that and then we'll come back

00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:17,279
more or less into this room and and

00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:20,960
we'll open it up for for

00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:21,520
a general discussion and you can either

00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,960
write

00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:25,840
questions in the chat and we'll try to

00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:29,440
monitor that

00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:30,799
and lift it up or you can raise your

00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,399
hand and i'll i'll

00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:33,919
make sure you get unmuted and you can

00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:36,799
ask questions

00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:37,440
uh or perhaps you can even i'm not sure

00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:39,360
i'm not a

00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,840
zoom expert perhaps you can even unmute

00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,840
yourself

00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:46,320
but i'll see and just to kick this off a

00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,240
little bit

00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:51,360
so we get some sort of discussion

00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:56,320
started i have a question for you alex

00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:59,039
uh and that's sort of

00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:02,159
going into well we're doing sort of

00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:04,480
activism here on wikipedia

00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:05,600
is that something that we can readily do

00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,520
and like where's

00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:09,360
where's the line because there's some

00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:11,679
sort of policies for what you can write

00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:15,520
on wikipedia

00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:17,679
yeah i i think um there's this tension

00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,880
of like in the wikimedia community more

00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:21,120
generally about

00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,640
whether activism is appropriate on

00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:25,679
wikimedia projects

00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:27,679
and what we find is uh

00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:29,120
like explicitly saying like the world

00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:31,760
needs to get better at solving

00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,640
x problem uh usually runs you into

00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,799
trouble

00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:37,120
uh most of the community is very

00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:39,039
supportive of increased representation

00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:41,279
of diversity of perspectives

00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:42,559
and so there's a lot of opportunities to

00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:44,559
work on that like

00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:46,320
adding information about how a city is

00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:48,880
responding to climate change

00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,840
or um the gender gap like adding new

00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:53,039
biographies

00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:55,200
of based on reliable sources um

00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:56,799
we're kind of assuming that people in

00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,559
this call have some basic

00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:00,399
understanding of how the wikipedia

00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:02,000
community works but if we want to

00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:05,120
explore those questions or

00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:07,120
what questions do you have um

00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,799
about thinking about activism or

00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:12,240
audience or recruiting

00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:13,520
or participation or like has this made

00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:16,720
you think differently

00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:23,840
about wikipedia as a climate or

00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:23,840
sustainability communication tool

00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,440
and we yes i have we have a question

00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:33,039
here from celine

00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:33,039
so i'll ask you to unmute here

00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:39,760
hello good morning hello

00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:43,919
um i will try my video and see

00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:43,919
if my connection holds

00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:54,799
okay hello everybody yeah

00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:58,640
greetings from mexico uh yes i

00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:59,360
i um i wonder if from what you said in

00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:03,279
the beginning

00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:06,399
about the objectives of the wiki um

00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:09,840
sustainability um

00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:10,399
project and with more collaborations and

00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,240
and what

00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:14,720
the work we did right now in this

00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:16,240
document and even just searching my city

00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:19,440
sakatecas

00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:22,159
and searching a prominent uh

00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:23,840
colombian writer critical writer on

00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:24,960
environmental things i noticed two

00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,760
things right away

00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:30,320
uh cypherticus has a lot of information

00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:33,519
that's very demographic

00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:36,399
and very very uh

00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:37,440
more factual based rather than a

00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:40,960
conversation

00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:43,039
there is no critical thought invited

00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:45,120
it's just you just get a fact where it's

00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:47,840
located what is its history

00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:49,200
but there is no controversy there is no

00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,880
here are the issues

00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,799
we're still figuring out so i feel like

00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:55,679
that makes it feel very

00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:57,200
static and that could be a problem

00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:58,880
because obviously there are many things

00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:01,039
going on in this state and other

00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,640
parts of the world and then another

00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:02,960
thing was seeing that yes there's a lot

00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,039
of

00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:07,200
thinkers who are in spanish but not in

00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:09,120
english so

00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,880
there's some information on them but

00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:13,440
there's no translation in english and so

00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:15,919
then i'm thinking of course now

00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,799
can we reach out to you outside of this

00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:20,320
call

00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:22,399
if we want to get more uh

00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:24,480
either familiar with the process of

00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:27,039
wikipedia editing but also how we can

00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:30,159
make that as something more formal

00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:31,679
with a group of professionals if we have

00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:33,679
those connections

00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:34,880
and thank you it was very nice to be

00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:37,760
here

00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:38,640
you're so welcome on this both first

00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:41,679
very great

00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:42,960
observations that you have and so i

00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:45,200
want to address them but i wanted to

00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:47,519
answer the easy question first

00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:49,279
and that yes of course you can we can

00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:49,519
get in touch afterwards with this this

00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:52,159
is

00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:52,960
sort of a little bit of our point so

00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:54,960
this is

00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:56,159
of course only a 60-minute session we

00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,880
cannot teach you

00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:00,240
everything in this session so this is

00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:03,760
sort of

00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:04,240
giving you the chance and opportunity

00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:08,159
for

00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:10,960
knowing what to ask us for later on

00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:11,440
do you want to address the the topical

00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:16,399
question

00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:18,320
alex right now you're muted

00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:20,080
uh i was going to invite scan to do that

00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:22,080
actually because she's been doing that

00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:24,240
on the english to spanish and spanish to

00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:27,360
english that would be great

00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:28,159
even if you if you would like there and

00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:31,919
i'll see

00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:35,440
oh did i accidentally mute you now

00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:38,000
yes no no no yes do you hear me

00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,480
yes yes and you're gonna hear the dog

00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,600
too

00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:45,039
um so um

00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:48,559
well basically um about the

00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:50,960
translation issue um so

00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:51,760
we have an interesting problem there

00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:54,159
that is that

00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,799
it's actually easier to translate from

00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:57,120
english

00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:59,679
and other languages to spanish for

00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:02,720
example than the other way around

00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:04,720
and this is because of the editorial

00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,600
decisions by the english wikipedia

00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,800
communities

00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:11,359
that unfortunately it's very hard to

00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,240
advocate against and i don't think that

00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:15,599
we will

00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:18,960
be able to change it anytime soon

00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:21,520
um and yeah that's kind of like

00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:23,679
in part the reason why some of the

00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:26,560
content that is in spanish is not

00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:27,919
uh present in english wikipedia right

00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:31,200
because it's very hard to

00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:33,359
to to translate it um

00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,560
yeah i mean yes you need to invest a lot

00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:38,159
of time in doing it

00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:39,200
i would say um and also to be frank from

00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,480
a

00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:42,800
perspective of someone that is

00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:44,480
constantly editing in spanish but also

00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:47,200
occasionally editing in

00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:48,240
english we have so many cops in spanish

00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:51,280
wikipedia

00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:53,839
that to be honest spend my time

00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:55,119
like editing in english wikipedia not

00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:58,320
really right i'd rather

00:34:55,119 --> 00:35:00,640
like help the people in my language

00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:03,119
than you know span like english

00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:05,680
wikipedia has around six million

00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:08,960
articles and english wikipedia has only

00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:10,800
1.5 million articles so

00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,880
we have so many content gaps that we

00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,839
need to fill that that it's a sort of a

00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:17,680
decision

00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:20,240
on on where to put your efforts

00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:21,119
and the the question about kind of

00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:24,480
dialogue

00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:27,040
um of content too i think the

00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,560
the the point we're trying to make with

00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,920
the climate change wiki project

00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:32,160
and with comedians for sustainable

00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:34,720
development and this angle

00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:36,400
is just like so the wikimedia community

00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:39,119
has been addressing the gender gap

00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,960
for about six eight years about writing

00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:43,119
women's biographies and trying to write

00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:45,599
more content that represents women

00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:47,119
and that lens of like where are the

00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:50,000
women and how do we add it

00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:50,960
um can also be applied to other activist

00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,640
perspectives

00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,079
uh for example climate and

00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:57,520
sustainability

00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:59,599
or um diaspora

00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:00,560
communities uh african diaspora

00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:02,240
communities or

00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:04,400
from the perspective of indigenous

00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:06,160
knowledge and we have community groups

00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:09,680
who are organizing in that direction

00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:10,160
and we often find um that these call to

00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,560
action

00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:14,320
create better editors and better events

00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,920
and more motivated people

00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:18,400
um because they are looking for the

00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,119
complexity that is not being represented

00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,920
in the like

00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:22,720
rough factual data that's already there

00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,280
um

00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:26,000
and so part of the kind of art and

00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,000
science

00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,280
of organizing people to participate in

00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,160
this way um

00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:34,560
is designing good actions that are both

00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:37,920
consistent with wikipedia's neutral

00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:40,560
perspective and like summary style of

00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,599
other expert sources of information

00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:45,359
while also

00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:48,400
adding that critical lens to the content

00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:49,520
right um so i know scan ran a group with

00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:52,480
the uruguayan

00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:54,640
comedians not too long ago where they

00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:57,760
asked experts to critically read

00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:59,440
the city of montevideo article

00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,960
and by adding the perspective of

00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,480
afro-descent communities of

00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,240
sustainability activists and gender

00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:07,520
activists you get a very different

00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:10,640
read of what's missing on wikipedia um

00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:14,160
than you would if you just said uh

00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:16,240
like hey like someone write about a city

00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:19,119
right um they might land on the

00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:21,040
demographics or economic stuff

00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:22,800
can i also add something since we have

00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:25,040
so many um

00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,480
spanish speakers on the call so they

00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,320
have they might actually be

00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,599
able to like see a lot of what we've

00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:32,800
done so

00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:34,960
um we actually uploaded like those

00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,000
interviews and we are like preparing

00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,000
them to

00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,040
to sort of like do something that you

00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,000
might find

00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:42,720
interesting that is we want to sort of

00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,119
like start

00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:46,400
building in some of the discussion pages

00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:48,400
with experts

00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:50,079
um to get their perspective because what

00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:53,440
happens a lot with this

00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:54,640
um city or local articles is that they

00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:57,760
are written like a

00:37:54,640 --> 00:38:00,079
tourist flyer type thing right so

00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:02,240
they look very much like oh these are

00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:03,680
like the 10 places that you can visit

00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,599
right but they won't talk about the

00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:06,560
environmental conflicts and things like

00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:08,880
that

00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:10,480
and i want to share this like this is an

00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:13,760
example of one of the things that

00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:15,599
i've been doing so um this is like a

00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,520
very important river in the city of

00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:21,119
buenos aires in argentina

00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:24,960
and there in the talk page i've left a

00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:27,040
conversation at the end with an expert

00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:29,040
that has been studying the topic for

00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:30,240
a while and he actually wrote a book on

00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:33,280
the whole river

00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:36,240
whatever and he sort of like

00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:37,680
gave his perspective on okay so here are

00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,520
all the things that you could do to

00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:41,599
improve this article if you really want

00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,640
people to have access to environmental

00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:45,680
information

00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:47,680
and i can do it but the information now

00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:49,680
is also available for someone else if

00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:53,040
someone else wants to pick it up

00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:54,160
and another like uh minor comment that i

00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:57,440
wanted to say

00:38:54,160 --> 00:39:00,880
um uh jan said something around

00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:03,440
you know some articles are very

00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,079
complete but i i want to add that some

00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:07,040
articles

00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:07,680
sometimes look very complete but

00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,440
actually

00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:11,280
they are not very complete so for

00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:13,760
example if you go to the

00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:16,400
paris agreement article there's nothing

00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,760
around gender perspectives or indigenous

00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:20,000
perspectives

00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:22,640
if you go to the farmer article there's

00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,640
nothing around gender perspectives

00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:26,240
or indigenous perspectives in that

00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:27,359
article so there are a lot of

00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:30,000
perspectives that

00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:31,760
in articles that look very complete are

00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,200
actually not there and so there's a lot

00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:36,320
of things that we could do

00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:37,920
from like a social um a slash climate

00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:40,800
justice perspective

00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,680
in indeed you you make a great point

00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,240
there

00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,960
and i should have been perhaps more

00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:47,440
clear

00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:48,720
because it might be that specific

00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:51,920
paragraphs

00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:53,680
have been polished so much

00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:55,280
so it's hard to improve that specific

00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:59,359
paragraph but we can miss

00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:02,720
entire sections of other things so yes

00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:06,480
and that's the impossible to to add

00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:07,359
i also wanted to acknowledge that you

00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:10,640
said

00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:12,640
where you started that you saw the

00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:16,160
demography of the

00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:17,520
of an article and it it might feel very

00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:20,240
dry

00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,960
and that's a little bit by design

00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:24,079
because it's

00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:28,319
meant to be an encyclopedia so it's a

00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:32,079
genre a style of writing which is

00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:35,599
perhaps not the most beautiful to read

00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:38,640
but we try to capture the knowledge and

00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:41,280
and ins and here we also have uh

00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:43,839
in different language versions nuances

00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:46,880
in policies and writing style

00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:49,760
i know that in some wikipedias uh

00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:52,240
having a controversy section is sort of

00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:54,960
like a last resort

00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:56,640
you should try to have a reasoning

00:40:54,960 --> 00:41:00,560
within the

00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:01,440
normal text about what how complex a

00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:05,680
topic is

00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:08,720
and if you if you need to have a

00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:12,079
controversy section or critic criticism

00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:15,200
against x then

00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:18,000
that's not in some language versions

00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,720
uh what you try to aim for but of course

00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,720
you see it

00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:22,640
in english wikipedia you see it and i in

00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:25,760
swedish i have seen it

00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:28,400
so it exists but not

00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,880
it's not always the the good place to

00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:35,839
start

00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:35,839
in do you agree with me there alex

00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:44,079
i i think you're doubly muted yeah um

00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:45,440
the yeah i agree and sometimes the the

00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:47,040
kind of artful thing

00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,880
that needs to happen and this is why we

00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:51,440
need to organize people and teach them

00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:52,400
how to write is to actually add a

00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:55,520
section about

00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:56,720
you know um instead of like a climate

00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,720
change section it might be an

00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:01,119
environmental issues section

00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:02,480
and that might be you know like you

00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:04,240
describe the conflict

00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,920
from an objective perspective where

00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:07,920
there's like multiple people

00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:09,359
in dialogue multiple perspectives in

00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:11,440
dialogue but just by

00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:12,880
highlighting the conflict you you're

00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:14,560
doing a form of

00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:17,040
intervention right you're making it

00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:20,240
visible where otherwise it was invisible

00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:22,640
before um so yeah

00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,440
i wanted to give a chance for others to

00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:26,240
raise hands

00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:27,839
or ask questions or share thoughts or

00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,319
observations and thank you so much for

00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:31,280
the great

00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:31,280
start of the conversation

00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:36,160
i think there was a question by tais the

00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:38,560
salsa

00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:39,920
in the chat she was asking about the

00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,680
relationship between

00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:43,440
english and other languages like what is

00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,000
the percentage of spanish articles

00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,400
compared to

00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,040
english ones and other languages i think

00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,760
that they

00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:50,960
thais probably speaks portuguese so

00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:54,079
maybe if you could

00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:57,040
sort of point her out to those

00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:58,560
yeah that's me i speak portuguese and i

00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,920
was just curious about like

00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:01,920
spanish versus english or like

00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:04,480
portuguese versus english i assume

00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:07,040
that most of the language like english

00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:11,280
the majority and just wondering

00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:14,480
uh yeah so it it varies widely

00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:15,440
um the big languages the un languages

00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:18,480
for example

00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:20,480
um you tend to have

00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:22,240
come some pretty consistency a pretty

00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,040
good consistency across from the core

00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,880
topics

00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:27,040
uh like you know does climate change

00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:28,640
exist does paris agreement exists do

00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:30,480
major cities exist

00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:31,920
do country articles exist but soon as

00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:34,079
you get into

00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:35,599
regional topics like deforestation

00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:36,000
argentina i know that's one of the

00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:38,800
things

00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,680
scan works on um it changes quite

00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:43,200
dramatically

00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:46,720
and we actually have a cultural content

00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:50,560
observatory that is a research project

00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:51,839
trying to evaluate how cultural context

00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:53,280
changes content

00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:55,520
and the overlaps are actually

00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:58,880
surprisingly not that big

00:43:55,520 --> 00:44:02,079
on on some things um and it's really

00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:03,680
quite quite interesting um and so the

00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:05,200
there's a whole bunch of links to like

00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:08,240
methods for

00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:10,160
evaluating that in in that page and it's

00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:11,040
very researchy it's a little bit hard to

00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:14,480
interpret

00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:17,839
um but if you click through on the

00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:20,240
um uh let me

00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:21,040
there's some other ah there there's some

00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:24,319
better like

00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:25,680
visualizations and tools listed on that

00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:28,800
page

00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:31,119
and you can kind of dive into and see

00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:32,400
where some of these gaps are and it's

00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:36,240
quite profound

00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:37,359
um so and one of the things especially

00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,640
when you take a sustainability and

00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:40,640
climate angle

00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:41,760
all of the research on sustainability

00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:43,119
communications and climate

00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,640
communications and science

00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:46,400
communications more generally is you

00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:48,319
really need to take these

00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,520
hard technical concepts and make them

00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:53,040
very locally relevant

00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:56,640
to people's health and lifestyles right

00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:58,480
um so we may say go from like a

00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:00,640
small holding article on english

00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:02,960
wikipedia i might really focus on

00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:05,440
smallholders in anglophone africa and

00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:07,359
india um while the same article in

00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:08,240
spanish might be really focused on

00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:11,440
smallholders

00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:14,240
uh small farmers in brazil or or

00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:15,440
central america or costa rica where like

00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:17,839
there's a or

00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:18,960
cuba right where like the practice of

00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:22,319
small farming is

00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:23,920
is more culturally relevant um

00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:25,359
so so there's at the level of like

00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:27,119
articles missing and then each

00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:27,839
perspective of article and there was

00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:30,319
some

00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:31,839
really great early research into the

00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:33,920
wikimedia movement that compared like

00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:36,880
the french revolution article

00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:38,079
um and you see like really high contrast

00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:41,359
across languages

00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:44,400
um so the overlap is good

00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:46,319
but it's not it's not great it's mostly

00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:48,640
on the science and the core topics

00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:52,240
but not on all of these things that are

00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:52,240
very culturally specific

00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:58,079
and we don't have a portuguese wiki

00:45:56,319 --> 00:46:00,720
project on climate change

00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:02,560
so if you're interested in starting one

00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:06,400
we can help you

00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:08,160
okay good to know and we know a few

00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:09,440
brazilian portuguese editors who are

00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:12,720
interested too so

00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:14,079
there might be an opportunity i posted

00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:16,720
also in the chat

00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:17,920
our general statistics resource so if

00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:19,520
you if you're curious

00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:21,119
in numbers in general and want to

00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:24,480
compare language versions

00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:29,440
against each other uh that's

00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:32,640
uh just above alex link

00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:34,000
that's a could be a rabbit hole if

00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:36,800
you're into numbers because there's so

00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,800
much to find there

00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:45,680
i want to invite other people if they

00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:47,440
have questions or observations or

00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:51,200
reflections

00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:51,200
or even if you want to challenge us

00:46:53,119 --> 00:47:00,580
we're open for everything here

00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:03,820
so yes so we have connor here

00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:03,820
[Music]

00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:14,240
what's the percentage of well how do i

00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:14,240
explain this

00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:21,119
what percentage of people

00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:25,520
or on each

00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:27,760
wikipedia english language wikipedia

00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:30,160
what percentage of those are editors

00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:33,839
because i assume

00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:36,800
that there's not as many uh

00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:37,680
english wikipedia editors per person

00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:41,040
reading it

00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:41,040
then in spanish

00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:46,640
what's the density of editors per

00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:46,640
language

00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:52,160
that's a really good question we have

00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:55,599
some old numbers on here

00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:56,319
are you digging alex yeah i saw a graph

00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:59,359
recently

00:47:56,319 --> 00:48:01,440
on this all right but it's

00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:04,000
a little bit surprising i i can tell you

00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:07,359
already because

00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:10,559
some of the most high density

00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:13,359
in ratio editors to speakers

00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:15,359
are of course with languages with fewer

00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:16,400
amount of total speakers because you

00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:21,119
only need

00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:21,440
a minor or not as large group of editors

00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:25,359
to

00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:27,280
skew the numbers so so to speak

00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:28,880
in general we can see that the nordic

00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:32,000
countries are doing

00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:35,200
quite well in this regard and

00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,480
i think that's because they have a lot

00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:40,160
of spare time and

00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:42,640
internet is available so it's a little

00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:42,640
bit of a

00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:50,400
having the luxury to be able to add edit

00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:54,079
wikipedia yeah

00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:57,200
we have this incredible like bias

00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:59,359
um towards europe north america and

00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:00,800
australia so what would historically be

00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:03,839
called the global north

00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:07,040
um where access to finance

00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:10,160
free time internet access skills

00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:10,880
early kind of cultural dominance and

00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:13,040
knowledge

00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:13,920
ecosystems like all of these things

00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:17,440
conspire

00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:19,359
to create inequality right um uh

00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:20,800
and so this is part of the whole like

00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:23,280
decolonizing the web

00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:24,720
conversation more generally there's

00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:28,000
pretty profound gaps

00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:29,040
um the gaps are worse in subset here in

00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,319
africa

00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:35,200
so the ratio of people per speaker and

00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:36,720
languages that don't have a history of

00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:40,160
publishing

00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:43,200
in digital spaces because of

00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:46,400
various inequalities

00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:48,800
often are the ones that have the most uh

00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:50,000
like the the hardest challenges right so

00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:53,200
uh swahili

00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:54,640
indic languages um uh like

00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:56,880
smaller languages in like the

00:49:54,640 --> 00:50:00,319
philippines and indonesia

00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:03,599
um are really disproportionate

00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:06,640
in the like ratio of speaker to content

00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:10,319
to to reader potential reader

00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:13,760
um and i i saw a graph recently where

00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:16,480
like most of our best spaces for growth

00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:17,440
are in like sub-saharan africa latin

00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:20,640
latin america

00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:23,040
indonesia and india um and

00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:24,839
the always interesting question about

00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:28,160
china where we're blocked

00:50:24,839 --> 00:50:31,760
um because of you know closing

00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:35,440
freedom of internet access issues

00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:38,640
um so yeah that's

00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:42,480
that's true um the

00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:45,839
there's also a lot of density around uh

00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:47,040
yeah um around uh

00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:48,880
there's a better graph and i'm not

00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:50,960
finding it right now um

00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:52,559
there's a lot of density around the

00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:55,839
cities and the like

00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:59,119
americas in europe yes and i put in

00:50:55,839 --> 00:51:03,040
a link to an old table this is

00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:05,520
only data from 2019 but i think it's

00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:06,319
in general quite good this table which

00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:10,000
is huge

00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:11,280
has one column which says editors per

00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,079
million speakers

00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:16,240
which is i guess the exact thing you

00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:18,000
asked for connor

00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:19,280
and you can see the the constructed

00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:22,319
language volapuk

00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:23,920
with only 20 speakers of course if one

00:51:22,319 --> 00:51:27,359
of them edit

00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:30,240
excuse it totally so they have 300

00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:32,880
000 editors per million speakers so 30

00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:32,880
percent of them

00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:37,839
but they're after all the

00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:43,440
i think most extreme you have the basque

00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:47,520
language

00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:51,680
which also have quite a lot of editors

00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:55,119
you know actively

00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:57,680
active community as well

00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:59,520
and you can see some of the research on

00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:01,440
geographies and wikipedia

00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:03,680
from the oxford internet institute which

00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:06,720
is a really high concentration of

00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:09,520
stuff they did through 2018 um

00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:10,079
and then i'm not finding the map i saw

00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:13,280
recently

00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:14,800
but um uh there there's kind of

00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:18,079
proliferation of data

00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:21,599
um and most of it is pointing out the

00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:24,240
the big gaps global north south ones

00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:24,640
um and there's a lot of reasons for that

00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:26,160
and

00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:27,760
you know if you wanted to talk about it

00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:29,920
we could do a whole session

00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:31,280
and i'm sure there's folks from whose

00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:32,960
knowledge and some of the other

00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:36,079
wikimedia communities

00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:36,800
here at the conference who can speak to

00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:39,920
it better than

00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:39,920
jan or i might

00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:49,850
um any other thoughts

00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:52,640
questions concerns

00:52:49,850 --> 00:52:55,330
[Music]

00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:58,560
reflections now that we've talked about

00:52:55,330 --> 00:52:58,560
[Music]

00:52:58,839 --> 00:53:01,839
this

00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:12,160
i'm i'm seeing your message here in the

00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:13,599
chat celine i'm very happy we're leaving

00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:18,640
you with something to think about

00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:18,640
that's that's really good hopefully

00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:24,490
more people feel like that i feel like

00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:26,800
the things that you left for me in the

00:53:24,490 --> 00:53:29,280
[Music]

00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:31,520
document that we co-edited it's gonna

00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:34,400
keep me busy for

00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:34,400
a long time

00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:40,720
all right so connor please admit

00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:40,720
yourself again

00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:48,000
yeah this is not as much on topic but it

00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:51,119
is kind of about wikipedia kind of

00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:53,280
i sent something to

00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:54,640
the encyclopedia britannic website and

00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:58,240
among other things in it

00:53:54,640 --> 00:54:01,520
i said they should try and contact

00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:06,000
uh google and microsoft

00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:08,880
to try and uh

00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,200
because on wikipedia i do like wikipedia

00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:11,280
but

00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:13,520
there has to be other sources suggested

00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:17,520
sometimes when you search something

00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:21,200
and usually those aren't britannica or

00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:24,720
oxford dictionary or merriam-webster

00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:24,720
i ask that they could probably

00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:31,520
talk to them and very easily i think

00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:34,880
convince them to

00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:37,040
boost their suggestion rate

00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:38,880
and maybe put them put them more in

00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:43,119
sources on the

00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:43,119
the side card whatever that's called

00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:47,680
do do you think that would be an easy

00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:49,040
thing to do because i think that would

00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:51,440
be

00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:53,119
good because i like wikipedia but other

00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:57,200
sources are needed sometimes

00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:57,200
because people lean on that very heavily

00:54:59,359 --> 00:55:03,680
you're mute alex sorry i keep meeting my

00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:07,040
mic

00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:10,240
um i i can i can do a rough answer that

00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:13,280
um the long and short of it is we don't

00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:13,599
actually like talk to google about where

00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:16,720
we're

00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:17,119
ranked uh a lot of that's organic um but

00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:20,400
it's

00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:21,920
it's no it's no uh like

00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:24,559
google and wikipedia definitely have a

00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:28,640
very mutually supportive relationship

00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:30,720
um but the google is emphasizing other

00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:32,160
sources and knowledge cards a lot more

00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:33,520
in the last year or two and it's

00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:35,040
actually like a

00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:37,680
open question by the way community

00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:39,839
community the problem is usually the

00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:42,319
webmasters of these other websites

00:55:39,839 --> 00:55:43,839
and the relative way in which these

00:55:42,319 --> 00:55:46,960
other websites relate

00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:49,920
to um users do users click

00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:51,200
from google to the website so it's it's

00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:53,839
often uh

00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:54,640
like these other institutions don't do

00:55:53,839 --> 00:55:57,200
good

00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:58,240
uh website design um and i'm sure

00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:03,760
there's a track

00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:06,079
on seo or other conversations in mozilla

00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:07,119
yeah and unfortunately that's not only

00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:10,319
due to

00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:12,720
wikipedia being good at seo but there's

00:56:10,319 --> 00:56:16,240
also some

00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:17,040
the all the links and all the data about

00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:19,440
the pages

00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:21,680
is also available which means that any

00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:25,520
search engine can build up

00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:27,599
a knowledge graph from the content on

00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:29,359
wikipedia and the sister project much

00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:32,880
easier than on other sites

00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:33,680
where it's not as easy to get everything

00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:37,359
so neat

00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:38,000
and tightly packaged i'm pretty sure

00:56:37,359 --> 00:56:41,280
that

00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:42,480
all these big search engines are those

00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:44,960
who downloads

00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:45,920
all the dumps and listens to all the

00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:49,760
changes

00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:52,640
that occurs on wikipedia so they

00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:53,839
they know a lot about wikipedia and the

00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:56,319
data about it

00:56:53,839 --> 00:56:58,160
not only not only having access to the

00:56:56,319 --> 00:57:00,319
the content but they also know exactly

00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:02,079
what it means

00:57:00,319 --> 00:57:03,680
and this is part of the reason i'm so

00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:05,920
interested in sustainability and climate

00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:09,839
related to wikipedia because it both

00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:11,839
um drives like readers and other

00:57:09,839 --> 00:57:13,119
and google searchers and stuff to ask

00:57:11,839 --> 00:57:15,760
the question like

00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:17,920
oh my local chesapeake bay article or my

00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:19,599
local city article like celine was given

00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:22,799
an example of earlier

00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:24,160
um uh has this concept connected to it

00:57:22,799 --> 00:57:26,400
but it also

00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:28,480
it like pulls up all the sources that

00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:31,119
get linked in the wikipedia article it

00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:32,640
it they use it to inform search so if

00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:33,520
the sustainability and environment and

00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:36,319
climate issues

00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:36,960
are not kind of baked into the system

00:57:36,319 --> 00:57:39,119
like

00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:40,559
knowing that aspect of the topic is

00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:44,000
there um

00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:46,240
can be be a challenge um so yeah

00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,920
um i want to invite others if you have

00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:49,200
any thoughts or questions about thinking

00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:51,680
about sustainability

00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:52,720
climate change wikipedia the media

00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:55,760
movement

00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:57,200
kind of leveraging wikimedia as part of

00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:59,920
the open infrastructure

00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:01,200
for addressing these issues and even

00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:04,400
though you can

00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:05,520
always get hold of us afterwards perhaps

00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:07,280
we should post our

00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:08,960
links in the chat here before we stop we

00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:11,359
have a five minute warning so we can

00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:14,480
take too many more questions so

00:58:11,359 --> 00:58:14,480
do raise your hand now

00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:25,440
all right i

00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:26,960
just give a few seconds see if someone

00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:28,799
else because

00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:30,160
conor you have asked a few questions but

00:58:28,799 --> 00:58:32,240
if there's no one else

00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:37,839
on task anything i'm gonna give the

00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:37,839
floor to you again

00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:47,119
i just thought that just now

00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:50,000
maybe uh wikipedia should try and

00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:50,400
wikimedia more like it should try and

00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,359
push

00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:55,599
for people to take careers and stuff

00:58:53,359 --> 00:58:55,599
like

00:58:56,079 --> 00:59:02,640
encyclopedia editing

00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:04,960
and information whatever

00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:07,040
editing for big information sources like

00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:09,440
stuff like this

00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:11,520
i think that would be good for not just

00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:13,920
wikipedia but for

00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:15,760
other encyclopedia sites and the

00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:20,240
truthfulness of the internet

00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:21,599
do you agree um

00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:23,119
i i would like to think that everyone

00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:24,960
who edits wikipedia learns a little bit

00:59:23,119 --> 00:59:25,599
more about information literacy and we

00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:27,440
actually have

00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:28,880
quite a bit of evidence that that's the

00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:32,720
case and we're

00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:34,960
we're never um we never argue as

00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:37,119
uh a movement that you should trust

00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:39,200
wikipedia but rather you should

00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:40,880
become a good critical consumer and

00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:43,599
engager with our content

00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:43,920
which is like a great place to land uh

00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:47,119
at

00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:49,520
towards the end of the session is um

00:59:47,119 --> 00:59:50,960
you know wikipedia is kind of both a

00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:53,680
gateway to the best

00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:54,240
part uh uh best parts of the internet uh

00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:57,680
hopefully

00:59:54,240 --> 01:00:00,400
the truthiness uh of the internet and

00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:01,680
um kind of a helpful vehicle especially

01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:04,079
for small languages

01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:04,799
uh or smaller languages or less dominant

01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:07,280
languages

01:00:04,799 --> 01:00:08,799
on the internet really powerful way to

01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:12,000
to elevate that knowledge

01:00:08,799 --> 01:00:12,000
so um

01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:16,319
i think that was a great ending alex and

01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:19,599
i

01:00:16,319 --> 01:00:22,000
