00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,680
to the mosfest plaza

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,400

we've got a little present for you yeah

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,360
um if you want to celebrate in style by

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,920
adding uh some

00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,920
moss fest flare to your zoom background

00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,920
we've created a few cool looking

00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,560
backgrounds which you can download and

00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,360
customize the way you like it so for me

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,519
it would look

00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:07,360
something like this

00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:10,879
nicer so um yeah if you'd like that

00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,390
it's available through muzzle.la

00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:16,159
backgrounds

00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:17,840
[Music]

00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:19,920
so i'm sure you would like to know what

00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,480
happened since we saw you last

00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,319
so let me highlight one of the many

00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,040
sessions that happened in the last few

00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:28,000
hours

00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,760
the mozilla session add transparency and

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,080
access for researchers

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,879
what are platforms hiding brought

00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,799
together those

00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,400
interested in discussing how online

00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,599
advertisements can be made more

00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,000
transparent

00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:42,080
um and now in the zoom call we have

backgrounds looking very

00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:05,760
very sharp today um can you say

00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,760
uh for me one time intelligently

00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:14,959
intellectually nice very nice

00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,959
and you

00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:22,240
[Music]

very nicely done hey uh pip you guided

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,280
your participants through the creation

00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,000
and recording of a new

00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,280
story using prompts and frames in the ai

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,199
wellness space

00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,639
were you pleased with the story endings

00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,639
that came out of your session

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,639
definitely it's always really exciting

00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,240
to

00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,639
lead a collaborative digital

00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,479
storytelling um session

00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,080
and it was really interesting to see

00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,240
what ideas people had

00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,600
at one point we came up with the idea of

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,240
an ai president

00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,479
so it was really useful to to experience

00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,759
those ideas using we use things like

00:04:54,479 --> 00:05:00,560
story cubes and visual metaphors

00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,080
and multimodal prompts and we also used

00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,120
a really interesting ai

00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,400
tool called the ai nice yeah because

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,639
i've read that the main

00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,600
the main character in the story is an ai

00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,680
character

00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,800
so could you tell us a little bit like

00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,600
what is its name

00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,720
what happens with it or or should we for

00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,880
that have to join the session

00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,400
oh no no definitely you can um you can

00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,800
contribute outside in

00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,160
a singles capacity so the main character

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,759
was called pendra

00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,720
and i actually borrowed the main

00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:33,919
character idea from brave new world

00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:36,000
and kendra was an ai system that uh led

00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:39,840
a dystopian society

00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,080
and so we kind of um talked about uh

00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,440
her world and what she did and what she

00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,080
did for work and

00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,240
how what what what a home was like and

00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,759
what work was like in the year 3000 so

00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,240
it was really exciting to kind of

00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:54,639
ideate and iterate together to kind of

00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,120
build this world of an ai character and

00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,720
what

00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,039
what kind of rights she had it was

00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,880
really exciting yeah yeah it sounds like

00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,759
it's a good basis for interesting

00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,960
stories

00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:06,960
um fernanda you talked with your

00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,680
participants about creativity in the

00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:12,240
brain in the neurodiversity space

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,600
um neuroscience sounds a bit like a

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,000
complicated topic

00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,080
were the participants able to demystify

00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,600
uh brain science in the session today

00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:23,440
because that was one of the goals

00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,440
yeah well i hope they did we would have

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,880
to ask participants i think that

00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,520
there was a lot of engagement the

00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:32,240
discussion became very interesting

00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:34,080
i was uh very glad to see like very

00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:37,199
diverse faces we i

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,800
even had like three girls that i think

00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:42,160
they were around 10 years old

00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:45,199
wow joining us from nepal so i i was

00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,039
kind of nervous because i i i do science

00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,160
communication but sometimes i would use

00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,080
terms you know like

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,199
cognitive neuroscience and like what

00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,080
does a 10 year old know

00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,800
10 year old but i mean we tried to go

00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,639
back

00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,759
to the basics you know explain what is

00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,759
neuroscience what is it that

00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,440
neuroscientists do

00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,960
and and like everything like what's a

00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,759
neuron it's a cell

00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,199
and it has wires and biological wires

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,840
connects to other neurons so

00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,800
i think that at least they they learned

00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,120
something and

00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,520
and they were excited about it because

00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,400
they were asking a lot of questions and

00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,840
engaging a lot in the discussion so nice

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,560
well it sounds like it sounds like it

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,440
was great

00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,960
and pip do you think uh ai could learn

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:28,479
to be as creative as

00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,479
uh the human brain can be

00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,400
oh that's a very difficult question well

00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,800
if picasso

00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,960
uh programmed a robot perhaps would get

00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,599
a very creative result

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,520
yeah but so it's possible right but it's

00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,120
not something that ai is doing right now

00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:46,720
or is it already uh

00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:50,080
in the trenches i think we are doing

00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,639
um it depends how we define creativity

00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,599
isn't it

00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,039
if creativity is something original can

00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,560
ai

00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,080
simply just repeat something that's

00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,080
already been created or create

00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,400
something new it depends how we sort of

00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:05,919
define creativity and how we understand

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:07,440
it naturally um for

00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,039
what do you think about that is it

00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,919
something that you think

00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:14,000
the robots can can beat us on or are the

00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:16,240
humans the most creative

00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
well that's definitely a very polemic

00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:21,280
question uh as pip said

00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,680
sometimes some of the characteristics

00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,319
that we attribute to algorithms come

00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,479
like algorithms in the ai actually come

00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,479
from the people that program them right

00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,479
uh so far we have some examples that

00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,399
have uh approached this kind of like

00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,560
creativity algorithm like kind of like

00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:39,919
the deep dream uh google

00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:41,919
algorithm where you like uh input the

00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:43,599
picture and using convolutional neural

00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,680
networks it goes through it and kind of

00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,480
projects some images on top and it kind

00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,600
of looks like

00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,519
uh like kind of hallucinogenic art

00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,360
you know like psychedelic art nice so

00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,959
it's happening already

00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,040
yeah i think that's been done by google

00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,880
since a couple couple years but there's

00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,640
a whole philosophical discussion of if

00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,120
that's really creative or it's just you

00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,880
know

00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,120
repeating patterns that can be like

00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,000
aesthetically pleasing or aesthetically

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,080
interesting

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,480
so as peeps said it depends a lot on how

00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,640
we define creativity

00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,680
nice well i think it's very interesting

00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,080
i could talk with you

00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,360
for hours about this but uh that's our

00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,040
time we have now

00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,200

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,240
lot of tweets coming in

00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,120
make that decision we're talking to

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,560
julia johnson um who has sessions

00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:22,079

be sure to hop on for one of our

00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,519
sessions later tonight

00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:32,320
hello julia nice of you to take some

00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:35,040
time out of your busy schedule this week

00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:38,640
um yeah could you please briefly explain

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,640
to us what your session is about

00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,839
yes of course so i'm hosting a session

00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,240
called

00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:51,839
0.0146 seconds and it is a collective

00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,800
read out loud performance of 835 privacy

00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,360
policies

00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,760
that you accept with just one click when

00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,120
you visit the website of the daily mail

00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,519
the code that you gave

00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,120
me and it will take hundreds of hours to

00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,880
read let alone understand

00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,279
all these conditions so i thought let's

00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:11,040
do it together i love that idea

00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:12,560
physical performance thank you

00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,320
yeah it was it was fun to start it's

00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,920
physical uh traveling around with this

00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:19,040
public radio studio

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:20,959
uh but then the pandemic came around and

00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,160
we had to postpone all events so here we

00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:25,279
are for the first time

00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:27,680
um doing a virtual version so wow

00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:29,200
he's invited to to read a page and to

00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,959
join this

00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,320
yeah and i'm going to be honest with you

00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,079
i always click yes

00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,240
right away without thinking when it

00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:40,560
comes to accepting privacy policies

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,560
but how dangerous is this behavior

00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,399
well i think we all do i mean it's not

00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,519
really a fair choice that is given to us

00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,760
i mean it's either

00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,200
click accept or not using a platform and

00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,440
i think in many cases

00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,200
it's not really a choice even so it's

00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,800
it's very binary and i think

00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:00,240
also what is also very bright green

00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,240
which the other options is always

00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,920
blending in with the page so your

00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,639
your brain is instantly thinking like

00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:08,959
hey that's the one i should suppress

00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:11,040
so we all do it and we don't take time

00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:12,639
for privacy policies it will be insane

00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,200
to do so

00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:17,279
so yeah i think that we really have to

00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,160
reconsider this concept of giving

00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,560
consent

00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,399
yeah well yeah it's i'm glad to hear

00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,519
that we all do it that's not just me so

00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,920
you also do it

00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,440
but when most fest is over where can

00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:30,880
people listen to this

00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,880
auditory work of art

00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,680
so yeah we're first um doing all the

00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,320
different

00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:40,959
uh sessions so i think we'll take about

00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,560
350 hours to record all

00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:45,360
everything so i hope to do a lot of

00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:48,399
hours here um but then after

00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:51,519
we have finished all recordings we will

00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:53,040
exhibit it as an artwork um the

00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,639
location is still to be determined but

00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,000
you can

00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:58,639
see that on my instagram or on my

00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,399
website you can check where it's

00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,920
where it will be exhibited all right

00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,560
cool so people just have to follow you

00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:07,199
and they'll get all the information

00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:09,040
nice okay well thank you so much julia

00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:11,199
and um yeah i'm gonna think twice before

00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,160
accepting another privacy policy again

00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,079
in my life

00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,360
and for uh once again if you're

00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:17,680

skillshares

00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,199
in which facilitators from around the

00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:44,399
world are sharing their knowledge

00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:45,360
with on topics ranging from art to cyber

00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,000
security

00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,800
through 15 minute videos so let's watch

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,760
a short clip

00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:54,240
on the video how to solve a murder by

00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,240
using your digital skills

00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,399
any crimes there can be a trail of

00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,839
digital evidence that leads directly to

00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,600
the criminal

00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,440
in this interactive lesson you're going

00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,880
to step into the shoes of a digital

00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,279
forensics specialist

00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,240
and use your digital skills to solve a

00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:10,160
crime

00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,240
an eyewitness gave a statement that he

00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,079
saw another man leaving the office

00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,360
the description of the man matches that

00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,680
of non-fugitive

00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:20,079
chris mallam who police are keen to

00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:22,000
speak to about a series of murders

00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:23,760
your challenge is to use your digital

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,240
skills to solve the crime

00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,880
and help the police catch the murderer

00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,279
first

00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,959
you'll identify log and validate the

00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,519
digital evidence recovered at the crime

00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,519
scene

00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,440
then you'll investigate the digital

00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:37,680
evidence to look for clues

00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,120
finally you'll recover the key evidence

00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,199
to lead police to the suspect

00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:44,000
this is based on actual techniques and

00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:46,000
procedures that are used in real cases

00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,079
now it's time to start the investigation

00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,360
follow the instructions and let's see

00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:53,759
if you can crack the case so now you can

00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,040
finally put all that netflix true crime
