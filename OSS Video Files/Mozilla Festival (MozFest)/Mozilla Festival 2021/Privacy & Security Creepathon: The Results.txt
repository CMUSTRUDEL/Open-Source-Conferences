	00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,919
so welcome to privacy and security

00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,600
creep-a-thon the results

00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,680
a session showcasing the work of

00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,639
students at kodam coding college in

00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,360
amsterdam

00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:12,880
who participated in a creep-a-thon event

00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,799
at mozilla last year

00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,119
the creep-a-thon which is basically a

00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:20,160
hackathon with the challenge to find

00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:21,359
creepy information in the data set they

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,720
were provided

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,960
with one major goal to make user privacy

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,560
the default

00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,560
the challenge was to use creative

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,680
storytelling alongside

00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,760
data to show people how

00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:40,160
exposed they could be in their favorite

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,160
apps today we are joined by the winners

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:51,280
naomi

00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:51,280
griffin reed time and alberti

00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,440
welcome to mozfest 2021 we're so happy

00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,920
to have you here

00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,960
please introduce yourselves to the world

00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,559
and tell us

00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,079
what got you interested in joining the

00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:05,359
creep-a-thon in the first place

00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,359
we'll start with you naomi

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,520
um what got me in particular interested

00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:12,000
in the creepathon is that i had just

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,200
started

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,040
at codam this seemed like a really

00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,799
safe environment to do it because it was

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,720
in-house and

00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,119
i was excited to work in a team and to

00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,520
learn from my peers

00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:27,439
hi i'm griffin i'm from california and i

00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,640
have a great interest in cyber security

00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,159
so that seemed like a nice starting

00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:34,000
point

00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,400
hi i'm taima i'm 26. i have a background

00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
in

00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,000
philosophy and economics

00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,119
when i joined the hackathon i was only a

00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,040
student at codon for a month

00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,240
and i liked it a lot because it made me

00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,280
really feel like a

00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:52,479
detective great

00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,240
so before we get into your session

00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,840
i would really love to hear a little bit

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,560
more about your school i hear there are

00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,240
no teachers no classes no courses

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,640
naomi can you please tell us a little

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:06,320
bit about this innovative peer-to-peer

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,320
educational model that you're studying

00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,840
within

00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,640
it's like your regular schools have it's

00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:22,000
all peer-to-peer so you really

00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:24,239
learn from your schoolmates you learn

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,239
by making mistakes so it's also set up

00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,959
that you you're going to make mistakes

00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,720
and it's about learning from it it's

00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,319
really inclusive you don't need to have

00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,160
any type of diploma to

00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,680
start you don't need to have any type of

00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,400
experience with coding

00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,640
like tyman said he is from philosophy

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,599
and economics i myself have a psychology

00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,760
background

00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,959
um and we both are accepted with open

00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,239
arms and have already

00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:51,280
in what is it like six months

00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:53,519
learned so much from our peers so it's a

00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,239
really good model

00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,680
it sounds like a model for the future so

00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,720
now we're going to kick off

00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:03,120

and as she sets up i just want the

00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,840
audience to know that we will be

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,879
monitoring the chat in this room

00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,480
as well as comments on youtube so if you

00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:15,760
have any questions during her

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,159
presentation

00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,680
please feel free to ask them and we will

00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:24,080
present them to naomi

00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,080
naomi take it away thank you

00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,640
all right every day we post information

00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,200
about ourselves

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,560
online maybe you got just got a

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,440
promotion at work

00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,519
so you update your linkedin profile or

00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,319
you have an old couch to sell you want

00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,840
to get rid of it

00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:44,080
so you log into ebay and you place an ad

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,879
maybe today you wake up find yourself

00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,959
looking is

00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,000
especially cute or your pet looking

00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,560
especially cute

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,959
and you want to post that on instagram

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:57,840
or you go to a bar with your friends

00:03:52,959 --> 00:04:01,360
you buy the beer and you pay using venmo

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,959
suppose your name is paul

00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,040
you're walking across the street with

00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,879
your date you had a wonderful date you

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,439
just had ice cream together everything

00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,879
is going

00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:11,439
super super well you tried to get the

00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,080
courage

00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:15,360
to hold their hand and as your hand goes

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,400
towards their hand

00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,320
their hand draws away points towards the

00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:23,199
sky you follow it with your eyes

00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,759
and you see this billboard i'm paul

00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,919
simpson

00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,160
in august i had eight dates with becky

00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:30,479
lazard and two with molly johnson

00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,000
want to know more check my venmo and on

00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:35,600
the bottom of the billboard it says

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,000
exposed by venmo now if you're paul

00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,800
this isn't necessarily super invasive

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,520
information

00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,320
but if i were paul and i would see this

00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,520
on the street

00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:48,240
i would be freaked out

00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,040
now suppose your name is justin justin

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,800
taurus

00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,080
you're a super sociable guy you have

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,160
loads of friends you

00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,960
go to sports bars maybe you invite them

00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,639
home check out your sports memorabilia

00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,320
you too are walking along the street

00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,120
you're going to see some friends

00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,320
and you see this billboard much bigger

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,360
than the other billboard

00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:10,240
paul's billboard your billboard says

00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,360
i'm justin c taurus i work at visa my

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,400
passion is sports

00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,600
my favorite bar is mickey sports bar it

00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,000
gets worse

00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,759
you can reach me on my private phone

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,240
number if i'm not at home

00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,919
at my home address and it's your actual

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,960
phone number it's your actual home

00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:26,800
address

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,120
and then it says don't mention my felony

00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,039
for vandalism to my parents giulio and

00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,320
fatima

00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:35,840
another campaign same exposed by venmo

00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:39,840
it says don't find your data on the

00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:42,160
street check your privacy settings

00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,880
we made these fake billboards with real

00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:47,120
data that we found

00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,880
as a starting point in venmo's public

00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,520
api

00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,240
this is how public their data is and we

00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,160
wonder

00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:57,600
if they saw these billboards in real

00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,600
life how would they feel

00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,880
so how did we do this how did we get

00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,919
this

00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:05,840
massive invasive like bits of

00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,199
information about these people using

00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,520
this public data set

00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,360
that only has to do with these like

00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,960
finances how do we get all this other

00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,319
stuff

00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:19,280
every transaction in venmo's public api

00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,560
has certain variables the key variables

00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:24,400
for us

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:27,039
were the notes merchant name

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,160
username and last name now why were

00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,880
these important

00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,919
we wanted to get as much information as

00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,039
possible but

00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,520
varied types of information so that we

00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,479
could

00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,759
try to get a global picture of somebody

00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:42,880
so what we did is we

00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:44,639
we scoured the database

00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,400
we found the people that had the most

00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,639
transactions

00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:51,360
then we checked these variables these

00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:54,240
four variables

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,880
so for the first more innocent case paul

00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,160
simpson

00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:00,800
we did it all just using the notes

00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,960
his was a love a love story a nice story

00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,919
he found a woman stronger than anybody

00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,759
he knows

00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,759
really enjoyed the date hopes to see

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,720
them again soon and simply cannot

00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,360
stay away a love story a match made in

00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,120
heaven

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:17,919
right maybe not

00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,440
the next case user two justin taurus now

00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:22,319
this one is where it gets

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,199
more creepy what we did here is we had

00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,280
several

00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,120
transactions and the one that we used we

00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,599
got the most information from

00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,360
is the version of the one you see on

00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,639
screen now obviously all the names are

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,160
false by the way

00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:38,080
um we changed them so what we see here

00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,919
is we see that the user he goes by the

00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,400
username just store and the actual

00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:44,879
display name is justin taurus

00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,800
here as i mentioned before one of the

00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,639
things we looked for was a merchant name

00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,520
now why do we want to know the merchant

00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,199
name

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,039
because we want to find out where they

00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:55,280
live we want to find out more

00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:57,120
like how do we locate this person and

00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,000
isolate them from all the other justin

00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,280
tauruses around

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,199
the world if we type justin torres into

00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,120
google we probably won't find his home

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,400
address immediately because people don't

00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,720
post that

00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,560
companies post their addresses because

00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,879
they want customers

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,560
so that's what we did we took mickey's

00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,960
sports bar

00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,360
we googled it and we found that it's in

00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,960
san diego california so that's good now

00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,319
we have a little bit more information

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,360
just in taurus like sports goes to san

00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:29,599
diego

00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:33,440
so now the next step google

00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:35,760
from very very very stalkery googling

00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,560
we google the username in combination

00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,039
with the state

00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,399
the username instead of the actual name

00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,240
because there are

00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,519
i want to say dozens but there's way

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,640
more thousands

00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:49,519
of justin tauruses online

00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,839
the username though is more specific we

00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:55,920
want to see does he use this username

00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:58,240
across platforms can we find this user

00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,640
and we did so first we find an instagram

00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,440
post some instagram things

00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:05,440
we find items for sale with a username

00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,880
that's almost the same almost exactly

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,040
the same

00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,160
and another item for sale from the same

00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,360
user

00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:15,760
just store seven what's important here

00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,360
oh you can't see that with the clicker

00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,080
in the second and third

00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,959
um search result you'll see an extra

00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,000
location

00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:25,360
la mesa so we wondered okay let's google

00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,680
that too let's see if this

00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,600
just store is the same just store from

00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,880
our public data set

00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,519
let's see where la mesa is so we googled

00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,160
it

00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:37,200
it's here and if this picture seems

00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,120
familiar to you

00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,800
it's because it's almost exactly the

00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,920
same picture that we should that i

00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,680
showed you earlier

00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,120
when i showed you mickey sports bar

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,360
that's right over here

00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,959
so that's good it really it seems like

00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:52,080
this person is indeed

00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:55,279
are just in taurus but still it's not

00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:58,160
creepy enough right so let's go on

00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:59,680
let's take la mesa mickey sports bar and

00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:02,000
let's take

00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,680
this information bandfloor because we

00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,279
had two actors here

00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:08,079
we have the person who received the

00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:10,240
money the person who paid the money

00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:12,000
let's google bend floor as well in

00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:15,279
common in california

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,680
we find a linkedin page

00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,680
note that this ben flor went to san

00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,720
diego state university so again right

00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,320
that's something hey

00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,240
that's the same this might be the same

00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,920
person

00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,839
now we have more information a lot of

00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,959
googling was involved you guys a lot of

00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,399
googling was involved

00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:35,519
so we go on by googling

00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:37,680
ben flor and um california

00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,720
and justin taurus we come across this

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,279
linkedin page

00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,480
now it seems like this is just exactly

00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:45,200
what we already know

00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,200
but it's not

00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,680
okay you can't see this i'm clicking

00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,240
with my pointer but in justin taurus's

00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,320
picture

00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,519
look below his name and check out the

00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,399
location

00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:58,560
la mesa just like ours just like just

00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,079
tour 7 who sell to sportswear who really

00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:03,360
likes sports

00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:03,600
also now we have an extra letter justin

00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,200
c

00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,040
taurus i don't know what the c stands

00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,000
for but it's that little extra bit of

00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,320
information

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,560
that makes it more likely for us to find

00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,560
him

00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,880
now comes the really scary part with

00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:20,480
this information

00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:23,519
justin taurus la mesa california

00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:26,399
we were able to find

00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,920
lots of public records we found his home

00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,839
address so i'm not showing you the

00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,440
website the exact website right now

00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,959
because

00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,120
even this like getting all the

00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:37,519
identifiable information out of there

00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,240
but when you click when we click this

00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:42,000
page

00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:44,880
we found his parents his home

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,600
address his telephone number his

00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,720
criminal

00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:51,920
court records his felonies

00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:54,320
all of that we found online it's

00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:57,279
all out there and we found it in under

00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,160
12 hours for people who hadn't done this

00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:00,480
before

00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,079
and that's really shocking i'm pretty

00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,959
sure justin

00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:06,480
justin would not like this at all i know

00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:10,079
i wouldn't

00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,839
so what do we do how do we prevent this

00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,920
there are two recommendations that we

00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:17,040
make one is for venmo

00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,880
but we realize that venmo might not

00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:21,040
immediately pick up on

00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,639
all recommendations that we give the

00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,160
other one is for the users let's start

00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:26,800
off with minimal

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,240
what vemmo could do is leave notes out

00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,639
of the public api

00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,760
don't publish them or if they must

00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:33,839
publish them

00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,600
publish them separately not link to

00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:38,399
username or user id

00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,120
try to really get these bits of

00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,279
information

00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,680
further apart have them not be linked

00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,680
together

00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,240
same here publish the display name only

00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,680
and not the username

00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,760
in the case of justin torres where we

00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,000
found his home address his phone number

00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,639
all

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,040
of that stuff it was the username not

00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:57,360
his

00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:59,519
actual name that made it possible for us

00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,680
to find all of this

00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,120
so what can users do i kind of already

00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,440
foreshadowed

00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,880
don't use the same username across

00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,279
platforms

00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,880
you know most people don't post

00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:13,120
information about their dates

00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:15,920
on linkedin they don't post their home

00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:18,240
address on their instagram

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,079
but they do use the same username for

00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,160
linkedin for instance for instagram

00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:24,079
for all these other platforms so

00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,959
basically you are putting all these bits

00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:27,600
of information

00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,720
out there with the same username making

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,120
it very

00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,480
easy actually for people to find all of

00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,079
this stuff about you

00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,720
so even something like that could really

00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,880
make a very big difference

00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,160
so having said that we also have

00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,639
linkedin

00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,480
you have seen my face already my name is

00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,839
naomi i want to introduce you to my

00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:49,040
lovely teammates

00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:52,639
we have hillmi beer and some

00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:55,920
so look us up connect with us and

00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,920
yeah and we'd love to hear from you

00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,199
that was a brilliant presentation naomi

00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:04,880
i can see why

00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:08,079
your team won the creepathon

00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:11,040
so we're getting a few questions my

00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:11,760
first is what do you think that the

00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:15,120
average

00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:16,000
user can do to protect themselves online

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:20,000
so you mentioned

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:22,160
not using the same um

00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,519
the same name across platforms but at

00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,120
the same time

00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:27,519
a lot of people will say for personal

00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,800
branding and to be found on the internet

00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,639
so just like you're saying we

00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,800
should connect with you you know on

00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:35,920
linkedin a lot of people want to connect

00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:38,720
with um others on the internet

00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,480
so how do you think your generation can

00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:43,199
balance that desire

00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:46,880
to be well branded online and at the

00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,880
same time maintain their privacy

00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:54,240
um it's a difficult one also

00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,360
also because using the same username is

00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:59,440
just

00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:02,720
very useful i do it too

00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:05,680
but not for long um i think

00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,480
that changing your username doesn't

00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,720
necessarily

00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,000
impact the branding all that much as

00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:13,760
long as you keep

00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:16,079
um your own name on there but

00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,440
i can see let's say you are an artist

00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:19,519
then probably you do want to have the

00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:22,079
same username everywhere in that case

00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,959
i think my recommendation would be to

00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:26,079
have your

00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:28,000
personal usernames your personal stuff

00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,759
and the stuff that you do for your

00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,839
online presence for branding

00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,279
to have them separately that's a but i

00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:36,320
it's a difficult

00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:38,320
um yeah situation

00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,399
yeah it's definitely a difficult one i

00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,079
and i think it's a trade-off that our

00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,440
generations are gonna have to make at

00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:45,759
some point

00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,639
um thank you so much naomi for your

00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:48,880
presentation

00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,920
we're gonna move now to the other

00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,480
winning team

00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,000
operation anonymous represented by

00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:57,839
griffin reed

00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:02,880
and tymon albaradi

00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:02,880
alrighty victoria

00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,279
i'm just going to quickly set the stage

00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,720
here you wake up in the morning it's a

00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:12,000
beautiful morning and you're making your

00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,680
first cup of coffee

00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,199
you go to check your phone to see what

00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:18,800
kind of emails came over

00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:20,959
through overnight and it hits you

00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,399
the first email you see has a subject we

00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:24,959
know you have a foot fetish

00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,079
does your mother know this stops your

00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:28,079
new tracks

00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:29,199
don't know your deepest darkest secret

00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:31,040
that you don't tell your parents don't

00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:33,279
tell your best friend don't tell anyone

00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,240
someone else knows it is it random i

00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,639
don't know so you

00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,079
oh you open the email and you read it

00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:41,680
the first

00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:44,320
subject the first paragraph it reads

00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,440
we know you bought these photos these

00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,720
three photos

00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:52,160
from these sellers on these days

00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,639
for this amount of money you freak out a

00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,160
little bit

00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:58,639
but you keep reading the next paragraph

00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,839
it has your mother's linkedin account

00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:02,399
her facebook

00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:03,120
and her email address your employer's

00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,199
linkedin

00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,799
his email address and then the next

00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:07,360
paragraph follows up with a bitcoin

00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:09,679
address

00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,199
and a note saying within 24 hours if you

00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:14,000
don't pay this amount of money

00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:16,839
to this address we will expose you to

00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,839
the people that we linked inside of this

00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,839
email

00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,600
could very well be reality in fact it's

00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:28,720
a

00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:31,600
much more attainable reality than than

00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,000
you might think and that's thanks to the

00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,600
public

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:38,240
api from venmo but first let me

00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:41,360
introduce ourselves

00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:43,600
this is griffin i'm taima late november

00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:46,480
we teamed up with victor and thais

00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,280
to join in the creepathon and in that

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,400
creepathon

00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:54,320
we explored the data the vamo dataset

00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:57,919
for feet specifically we identified

00:17:54,320 --> 00:18:00,320
over 300 transactions of

00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:03,200
feed picks or actually transactions that

00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,640
mentioned feed picks

00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:08,400
feed picks are of course highly

00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:11,840
desirable by foot fetishes

00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,120
why did we pick feed pigs as our as our

00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:16,240
search term

00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:18,000
we did so because well we wanted to keep

00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,960
it lighthearted but of course we all

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,240
understand

00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:24,000
that sexuality and

00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,160
this matter is something that should be

00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,679
very private and it's very personal and

00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,799
it's not something you want

00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,799
out in the open

00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:37,840
so how did we find over 300

00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:39,360
transactions mentioning feed picks we

00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,080
did so by looking

00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,200
again at the payment note just like

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,400
naomi did

00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,280
um we filtered the database looking for

00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,320
the phrase

00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:53,280
feed pics but also looking for you know

00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,080
a foot emoji paired with a camera emoji

00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,320
or

00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,440
a foot emoji paired with like a kissy

00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,000
emoji

00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,919
or just you know well actually i'll show

00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,280
you some examples later

00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:07,200
um we wanted to keep it lighthearted so

00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,280
here are the examples they're also a bit

00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,120
more fun these are some of the notes we

00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,840
found in the data set

00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,240
i'll read them out to you this one you

00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,200
know

00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,080
the thing you do with your feet or your

00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,559
feet pics

00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,320
or the classic foot emoji followed by a

00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:24,559
tongue emoji

00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,440
we also found more fun stuff in the data

00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:28,640
set at least

00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:32,080
fun for us we identified the top

00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,039
feet tycoon named shu with over five

00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,520
sales

00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,400
we also identified the top feed lover

00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:40,000
josh

00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:41,679
with three feet pick purchases

00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,679
of course to us this might seem funny

00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:46,880
but these people actually exist

00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:50,480
so we decided to focus and

00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:54,000
zoom in on josh and

00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:57,600
we found a lot of info on josh

00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,840
we found josh's full name last name

00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,200
included we found his phone number we

00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:04,159
got his email

00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,559
all in the venmo data set we even found

00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:07,120
you know

00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,600
a profile picture the picture you see

00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,240
here

00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:12,240
is a fake photo of a non-existent person

00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,440
but we found an actual picture of this

00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:17,200
josh

00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:19,919
and our next step was duckduckgoing

00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,840
this information his name and

00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:24,159
cross-referencing this information

00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:26,720
and within a minute we found him on

00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:29,360
several social media platforms

00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,559
we found his instagram we found his

00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,120
linkedin

00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:33,919
and we found his facebook account with

00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,960
there

00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:38,799
also a link to josh's mom's facebook

00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,840
account

00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:44,559
we did this very quickly and

00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,440
josh was probably very lucky that this

00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:47,919
information

00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,120
fell in our hands and not in the hands

00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:52,559
of a bad guy

00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:55,840
who could abuse all of this info

00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:58,240
so what should josh do or

00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,440
what should josh have done perhaps

00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,960
better yet also

00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:05,360
what should you do well a lawyer would

00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,840
tell you

00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,960
you know read the terms and conditions

00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,919
of every

00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,880
app you use but that seems highly

00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:16,000
impractical

00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,760
and i'm no expert and

00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,679
definitely not a lawyer but i tell you

00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:22,720
you know just be aware

00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:25,440
of everything you put out there

00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,159
assume every company is out there to

00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:30,159
collect

00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:30,960
your data and please set your account to

00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,679
private

00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,679
if possible

00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,520
of course when i'm preaching like this

00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,240
it seems like

00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,720
you know you maybe start to forget that

00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,320
josh

00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:47,760
is the victim and that's a bit

00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:51,919
twisted because um in the end

00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,919
isn't it should it shouldn't it

00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,080
in the end um

00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:57,440
[Music]

00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,159
it should not be the user's

00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:03,679
responsibility to manage their data

00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:06,880
we feel shouldn't vemma be to blame

00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:09,360
for all this and that's why

00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,840
we also strongly advise venmo to make

00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:14,080
payment notes

00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:17,200
optional users should not be forced

00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:19,679
to provide venmo with

00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,520
seemingly innocent but highly

00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:23,840
monetizable

00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,640
information with every transaction they

00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:28,240
make

00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,880
through the app but now we're pointing

00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,799
fingers

00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,320
at vemmo but this story is actually

00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:34,480
bigger than vemmo

00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,679
because many companies track you and

00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,840
track your data

00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:39,360
look at google chrome i'm not gonna go

00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,320
through the whole list but this is how

00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,679
google chrome

00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:46,320
tracks its users this is a this is a

00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:47,280
more widespread problem and that is also

00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,520
why we

00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,880
would like to encourage developers to

00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:54,559
make user data

00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:56,799
private by default

00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:57,600
so during our challenge we came up with

00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:59,600
the

00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,760
decision of how could we help josh how

00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,520
could we spread awareness of this issue

00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,960
and our answer was an email campaign to

00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:07,679
raise awareness to teach

00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,200
and to put josh the potential josh at

00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:11,919
ease

00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,360
and this is our draft of a email

00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:15,440
campaign and how it would work out

00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:17,280
i'm gonna read it subject we know you

00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,799
have a foot fetish does your mother know

00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,559
based on the public information you

00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:22,400
shared through venmo we were able to

00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:24,320
find out

00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,440
who you are and that you push purchase

00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,200
feet pictures

00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,440
don't be alarmed this is an automatic

00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,760
email nothing has been stored by us

00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,360
no further action will be taken by us

00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,240
beyond this email this email is a part

00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,320
of a campaign

00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,600
to create awareness for the movement

00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,520
private by default

00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,200
on venmo much of your transaction data

00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,840
is public unless you change your

00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,559
settings

00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:46,880
we wanted to shock the potential person

00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:49,039
the potential jost in the circumstance

00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,320
to be aware of it to show them that yes

00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:53,919
this data is public

00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:55,840
and to scare him be it a little bit

00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:58,240
that he should set his settings to

00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,760
private under this email we would show

00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:02,480
him how to

00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,200
set his settings to private and how he

00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,720
could

00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,720
encourage others to do the same

00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:11,360
so of course we go to a coding school we

00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,960
wrote a little bit of code

00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,559
we wrote an open source script to be

00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:18,159
able to filter out and parse through

00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:21,600
the data set specifically for venmo to

00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:23,039
create a tag search looking for keywords

00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,400
if we were to have the time and be able

00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,840
to iterate upon this and what we

00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,799
encourage others who want to iterate

00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:30,320
upon this to do

00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:33,120
is to create a system in which they can

00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,760
a user could search up to see what kind

00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:37,440
of

00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:40,960
data is collected by venmo itself

00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,520
well that's us again tice diamond myself

00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,200
griffin

00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:45,200
and victor thank you very much

00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,799
thank you so much what a wonderful

00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:50,000
presentation i really love the

00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:53,360
storytelling

00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:56,799
in this one um and the email at the end

00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:58,640
was amazing um so you have a few

00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:02,000
questions from the audience the first

00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:04,000
is would you say all this public

00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,799
information is the responsibility of

00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,279
venmo

00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:09,279
or the user to make private

00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:18,159
the answer would be the developer but

00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,919
as we know everyone wants to make money

00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:22,799
especially companies want to make money

00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:24,400
so at this point in time the answer is

00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:25,760
that it's upon the user to be able to

00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,520
figure out

00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,760
what is being shared and where they

00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:32,559
could be set to private for example i

00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:34,320
am an american and i use venmo i didn't

00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:37,360
realize that my settings were

00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:39,120
public at first um inside the data set i

00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,320
found myself paying for rent

00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,240
of course it could have been something

00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:45,919
more inconspicuous or

00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:47,039
more extortable but uh thankfully it was

00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,279
just rent

00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:51,440
um i would really implore that

00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:53,760
developers do set everything to private

00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:57,840
but again um you gotta look out for

00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:57,840
yourself and take care of yourself

00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:03,279
the second question we got is how can

00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:05,279
users keep data and private sites safe

00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:07,279
so think about when you're using google

00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:08,159
drive or you have things in the apple

00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:10,159
icloud

00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:11,600
and you think they're private but at the

00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:13,039
same time they're online

00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,799
so how can you make things like that

00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:17,440
safe um

00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:18,480
so this is a more difficult question to

00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:21,039
ask the your

00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,320
your best bet is to always keep

00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:25,039
everything you have

00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,760
updated to the highest degree possible

00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:27,760
to make sure

00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,880
nothing's deprecated and never share

00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,360
passwords between

00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,240
um any accounts and always keep strong

00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,840
passwords

00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,600
do rotate your passwords on a three

00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:38,000
monthly basis is recommended

00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,279
but it's upon you to be able to look out

00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,880
for your own personal safety

00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:43,279
on the internet internet is a scary

00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:45,279
place but also a very necessary place

00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:47,919
so you just got to try your best to keep

00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,919
yourself safe

00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:53,840
we are coding students and not privacy

00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:53,840
experts

00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:58,720
yes and people really love your designs

00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,880
as well so

00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,080
someone is asking who made the beautiful

00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:06,080
illustrations

00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:09,039
in the presentation our lovely timing

00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,600
well done timing thank you excellent

00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:11,919
work so

00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,880
thank you both for joining us in this

00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:15,679
session

00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,799
i think you both both teams did an

00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:18,799
amazing job

00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:20,480
we can welcome naomi back to the stage

00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:22,080
as you know we close out

00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,640
but i think this session was really

00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:27,520
important to have at mozilla because

00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,880
a lot of people don't realize how public

00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:31,840
their private data

00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:33,360
is and so i think the creep-a-thon is a

00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,000
really great way of showcasing that and

00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:37,120
the work you

00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,880
did you know over just a few hours in

00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:41,279
uncovering all that information about

00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,880
people really brings awareness

00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:44,960
you know to how vulnerable you can be

00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,960
online so thank you so much

00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,000
for the work you did in the creepathon

00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,240
for joining us again

00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,600
today to present your work to the

00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,159
mozfest audience

00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:56,480
you are awesome and we are so happy that

00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:59,360
you were able to host this session

00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,360
thank you kodam

00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,840
bye

00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,919
