Description: 
	The future is uncertain. Whether climate policy, trade relations, or disruptive technology, we cannot be sure of how key factors reshaping the world will play out in the coming decade. Also, the operating context for business and other stakeholders is formed by the complex interactions of many factors, but often factors are considered in isolation and responses, siloed.

Water scarcity, wildfires, extreme weather, and rising sea levels already disproportionately affect marginalized populations, resulting in loss of livelihoods, forcing migration, and increasing conflict.
