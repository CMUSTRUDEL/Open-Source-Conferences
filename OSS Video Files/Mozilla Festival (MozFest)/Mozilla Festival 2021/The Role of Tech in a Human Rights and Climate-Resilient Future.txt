Title: The Role of Tech in a Human Rights and Climate-Resilient Future
Publication date: 2021-03-11
Playlist: Mozilla Festival 2021
Description: 
	The future is uncertain. Whether climate policy, trade relations, or disruptive technology, we cannot be sure of how key factors reshaping the world will play out in the coming decade. Also, the operating context for business and other stakeholders is formed by the complex interactions of many factors, but often factors are considered in isolation and responses, siloed. The climate crisis plays a large role in shaping our future, with a growing impact on human rights. Water scarcity, wildfires, extreme weather, and rising sea levels already disproportionately affect marginalized populations, resulting in loss of livelihoods, forcing migration, and increasing conflict.

so i'm sorry for that but also we have a

00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,840
few other things that

00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,039
um a few other ways to to sort of get

00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,879
information from you

00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,960
instead of doing the poll um we'll go

00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,720
through what what is this human rights

00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,240
and climate change what does that even

00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,000
mean what does that look like uh we'll

00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,680
give a quick introduction about that

00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,520
um how we can plan for the future for

00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,120
this lens and we'll do an interactive

00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,800
exercise and breakout groups

00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,319
uh so all of you can participate and

00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,319
chat with each other and us

00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,840
and we'll we'll give a quick share back

00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,960
with the group on those breakout groups

00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,880
and then we'll wrap it up

00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:34,959
um let me bring us to some housekeeping

00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,120
just so you know and and this would have

00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:37,680
been on the web uh the website sort of

00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,440
um

00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,120
registration page the workshop is being

00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,399
recorded and this is just for the

00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,760
potential opportunities for

00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,600
for others to learn that couldn't

00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,440
couldn't make it for and for a number of

00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,320
other reasons um this workshop was

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,160
really only

00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,000
designed to be with a limited amount of

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,920
people and so we wanted to make sure

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,480
that we're able to share

00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,600
what we talk about so a couple of

00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,600
different things if

00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,440
um if this isn't your vibe you don't

00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,040
want to be recorded that is totally fine

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,880
there are a couple ways you can sort of

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,040
avoid that and still participate

00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,640
you can write in the chat function you

00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,760
can engage through the chat function

00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,200
that won't be saved

00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,440
you can turn off your video if you'd

00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,040
like that won't be uh recorded

00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,720
the breakout group also won't be

00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,440
recorded so you can feel free to

00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,200
participate

00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,800
freely in the breakout groups without

00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,320
being recorded or anything

00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,640
nobody's spying on you or anything like

00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,680
that so um so really you know we

00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,320
encourage you to stay

00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,519
if you if you if you'd like and engage

00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,560
in these other ways if you don't want to

00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,480
be recorded

00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,000
um we want to encourage you to

00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,760
participate however you

00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,080
feel comfortable so if you want to have

00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,279
your video on that is great if you don't

00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,519
that's also great

00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:43,519
i'm going to keep my video on and um

00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,320
just so you can see me i like to engage

00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,440
that way but

00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:50,560
but again that's really up to you um

00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,200
we uh want to offer you know other ways

00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,760
to engage

00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,600
in the chat like i said um if you want

00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,440
to raise your hand use the raise to hand

00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,560
function if you want to come in verbally

00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,720
that's also great um if you add a

00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,000
at a good time obviously when someone's

00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,640
not speaking if you want to just

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,480
come in um unmute yourself and speak we

00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,480
are totally open to that um

00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,320
try to maybe keep yourself a mute if you

00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,480
have noise in your background

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,760
um just so it doesn't interrupt others

00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,160
when they're speaking

00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,600
but um but really please do feel free to

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,640
participate and engage

00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,120
in the way that makes you feel

00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,240
comfortable um and unfortunately i don't

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,720
think we'll have time to

00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,519
do full introductions with everyone on

00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,959
um

00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:32,880
on this in the session but please do

00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,160

00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,920
to do that if you want to introduce

00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,440

maybe what hat you're wearing today if

00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,519
you're an academic

00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,519
or if you're just an advocate and you're

here to learn just let us know we'd love

00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,160
to know that was really what the poll

00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:54,160
was about like

00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,240
um why are you here so please do feel

00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,760

00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,200
recording now

00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,120
again if you don't feel comfortable with

00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,440
that just let us know or to

00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,480
go ahead and drop off or also just use

00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,480
the chat function

00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,640
and engage in a way that makes you feel

00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,519
comfortable all right let's get started

00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,959
we only have an hour so first of all

00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,440
what are we talking about what is this

00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:52,880
human

00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,160
and human rights and climate change

00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:58,639
thing um we want to make sure that we um

00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,000
we provide you with a bit of background

00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,120
to be able to engage in this

00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,200
conversation

00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,920
obviously we can't get into every single

00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,399
um detail about this this is a very huge

00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,800
pillar

00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:10,240
of of work and a big community of people

00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,480
that work on this so we can't go into

00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,320
all the details but just enough to have

00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,560
an engaging conversation

00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,680
um and so hopefully that's what we leave

00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,600
you with but please do

00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,839
feel free to ask questions throughout

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,279
the chat or in the chat function

00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,959
i'm also going to pause after this if

00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:27,760
you want to come in verbally and we can

00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:30,720
try to address those questions as well

00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,839
so when we think about climate change

00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,680
and human rights

00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:34,880
fundamentally what we mean is the

00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,680
unequal or

00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,079
inequitable impact on people and so you

00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,360
can

00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:41,360
see a couple of quotes here on the

00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,600
screen as ban ki-moon the former

00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,839
he was this former u.n secretary general

00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,200
said the poorest and the most vulnerable

00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,800
those who have done the least to

00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,120
contribute to climate change

00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,240
are feeling the impacts the most today

00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,720
it's inequitable

00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,800
it's unfair and those are the main sort

00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,279
of key messages that i want you to take

00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,839
today

00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:00,639
from this you can also see that in 2008

00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:02,639
which is not

00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,800
recent so this has been around for quite

00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,800
some time that the un human rights

00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,959
council made a resolution focused on the

00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:11,279
human rights impacts from climate change

00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:12,639
noting that it poses both a short and a

00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,160
long-term threat to people and

00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:15,760
communities around the world

00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,600
it can have implications for reaching

00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:20,480
the full enjoyment of human rights

00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,920
these are related to jobs livelihoods

00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,720
access to resources

00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,880
access to food and water health mobility

00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,560
and even and even homes

00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,720
and we've been seeing this happen for

00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,399
some time now and we're seeing it happen

00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,880
more and more but action

00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,800
remains minimal unfortunately so what

00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,440
we've been working on is really trying

00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,160
to

00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:42,320
scale up action and and build awareness

00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:45,199
about this intersection so we can move

00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,839
the community to act on this um we also

00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,000
know that

00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,519
when without looking at these two

00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,839
together we can't solve

00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,560
one crisis without solving the other so

00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,959
climate

00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,720
change really does threaten to undo the

00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,440
last 50 years of progress and

00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,920
development

00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,920
in global health and poverty reduction

00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,360
and we know that in order to curb global

00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,680
emissions to a safe

00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,040
and i'll i'll get into that in a bit um

00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,680
a safe scale

00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,680
it will require ambition ambitious

00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,040
action and societal transformation so

00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,720
one that really involves bringing

00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,959
society and people along

00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,240
so really another key message there

00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,839
around like

00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,600
making sure that when we're looking at

00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:24,160
this we know that we need

00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,120
to move on one we need to solve the

00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,120
climate crisis

00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,680
in order to in order to really address

00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:33,519
poverty reduction and vice versa so

00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:36,320
that's just another key message there um

00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,440
so why is this happening why is this

00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,839
happening and

00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,959
i want to try to not add too much jargon

00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,560
in lingo

00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:44,720
basically we have rising global

00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,240
temperatures which are creating a series

00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,800
of climate impacts

00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,560
and this is often increasing in numbers

00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,880
and severity and so these could look

00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,880
like

00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,920
extreme weather events like hurricanes

00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,560
and storms

00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,079
floods or droughts sea level rise in the

00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,320
much longer term

00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,360
um and changes in vector-borne diseases

00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,680
like malaria

00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,399
zika and others of course and and these

00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,399
impacts are

00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,920
disproportionately affecting different

00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,000
groups and communities acro

00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,880
around the globe this looks different

00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,399
across the globe this looks different in

00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,079
in countries it looks different in

00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,000
regions it also can look different

00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:20,160
within a community itself

00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,399
so many nuances there and some of the

00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,360
groups are listed here as an example but

00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:25,519
this is certainly

00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,360
it doesn't capture all of the

00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,279
populations all of the people that will

00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,600
be disproportionately affected

00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,399
and but some some that we want to i

00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,320
guess

00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,320
bring to you for this conversation today

00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:39,199
is groups around

00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,000
gender impacts or women bypass black

00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,839
indigenous people

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,160
of color populations people with

00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:46,000
disabilities elderly and children

00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,600
and i've already mentioned this on the

00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,600
last slide but that this can

00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,440
really affect the human rights and and

00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,040
here we have it laid out where it's um

00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:56,639
these are the human rights that

00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:58,800
are most um that we see most commonly

00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:00,560
reflected like access to jobs health

00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,160
livelihoods and even access to food and

00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,920
water like i had mentioned

00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,440
um i want to give you a few stats not

00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,680
too many but

00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,600
even if we meet some of the goals that

00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,720
that are we're expected to meet like

00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,040
some of you might have heard about the

00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:16,880
paris agreement um and that really

00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:19,440
does say that we need to reach um

00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,639
keep warming within levels of 1.5

00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,759
degrees celsius

00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:27,519
um for example in the us

00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:30,720
sorry 100 to 400 million people could be

00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:32,160
at risk of hunger and one to two billion

00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,160
people may not even be

00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,079
uh may no longer have access to adequate

00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,759
water so that's even if we reach

00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:40,160
the goals that we're really striving to

00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:42,480
reach and we could see climate change

00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:45,680
resulting in global crop losses

00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,600
in agriculture of 30 by 2080 which seems

00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,199
like a long way away and doesn't seem

00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,560
like a lot but 30 percent of

00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:53,279
agricultural

00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,639
crops is actually quite a big number

00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,959
that we could see

00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,560
um lost and so what we'll also

00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,240
potentially be seeing is

00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,079
really large-scale movements of people

00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,720
both internally and across borders

00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:06,880
creating climate refugees

00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,400
or people that have had to move because

00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,039
of climate impacts and

00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,720
and and flee their homes to to different

00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:14,480
countries even so

00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,319
this looks again different everywhere

00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,120
you go a couple of nuances i want to

00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,919
flag

00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:21,520
for example in the u.s race and income

00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,520
are the salient factors

00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,360
where we see bypass populations most

00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,199
affected because of historically having

00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:29,280
less access to resources

00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:31,600
and one example is hurricane katrina

00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:35,440
where we really saw this

00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:38,880
come to light in 2005 where we saw

00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:41,200
mostly women black women and children

00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,240
in in low-income communities that were

00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,360
most affected

00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,720
and one example is really in in south

00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,559
asia we see gender

00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,080
and income as the salient factors

00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:52,400
because of the socioeconomic and

00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,720
cultural barriers that women face

00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,080
in some of those countries um like not

00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,080
being allowed to leave their house

00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:00,960
without a male guardian for example

00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,520
or um not being uh allowed to learn how

00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,600
to swim

00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:05,679
so in the event of an emergency or a

00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:08,000
flood they actually cannot um

00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:09,840
they cannot leave their homes so those

00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,320
are just a few of the nuances there are

00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,120
many

00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:15,440
um one more slide just to give you a

00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:17,120
sense of some of the themes that we're

00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,840
seeing arise because this

00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:21,360
this can be both in from the physical

00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,640
impacts of climate change which i've

00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,640
already explained

00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,400
and also from the solutions that we're

00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,600
putting forward so we have to be careful

00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,919
about how we're

00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,360
moving away from certain technologies

00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:33,200
and fossil fuels

00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,799
that we know we need to transition away

00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,320
from um but

00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:38,559
really ensure that we're bringing those

00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,240
communities with us and so if there are

00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:42,880
you know communities that are dependent

00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,400
on fossil fuels for their livelihoods

00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,080
workers that are dependent we need to

00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:49,039
make sure that we're helping them

00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,960
transition from jobs like coal mining

00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:54,480
for example or fossil fuel

00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:56,000
jobs into new jobs or or have social

00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,480
protection measures that can

00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,799
can can help them in other ways and this

00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,480
is referred to as the just transition

00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:04,400
um another element that we're also

00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,000
seeing uh we're seeing human rights

00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,000
allegations on the other side of the

00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,160
transition to renewable energy

00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,679
renewable energy which we know is is

00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,360
something that we need and we it's

00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:15,840
necessary in order to

00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,360
uh curb emissions and it's i mean they

00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,360
are the key solutions to

00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,960
uh reducing emissions but we need to

00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,280
make sure that they're also being done

00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,679
in a way that protect human rights

00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:28,320
and provide good working conditions and

00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:30,080
not taking land from communities

00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,679
et cetera so lots of nuances there but

00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,440
those are some of the themes that i want

00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:36,799
you to think about when we start the

00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:39,120
work the workshops later

00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:40,240
and last slide and then i'm going to

00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:44,320
hand it over to hannah

00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:46,080
is just to uh describe a few of the

00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:48,559
other terms that that we're seeing that

00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,880
are associated with this um and so one

00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:51,440
is

00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,000
really cl this climate apar side which

00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,679
is

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,440
um something that phillip alston who was

00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:58,000
a un special rapporteur on extreme

00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:01,360
poverty and human rights in 2019

00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:04,080
said but really is just looking at

00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:05,280
the fact that those with resources the

00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,039
wealthy

00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,320
are able to escape the impacts of

00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,400
climate change and

00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,240
those that aren't wealthy don't have the

00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,760
resources can't and they end up

00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,600
suffering and feeling the brunt of

00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,480
everything so that's one of the terms

00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:20,240
that we're seeing and

00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:22,400
and it's also really um i guess a sister

00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,280
term of of climate justice and many of

00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,960
you may have seen

00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,960
quite a lot around climate justice over

00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:30,559
the last year um

00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:32,159
and that's really ensuring that equity

00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:34,000
is placed at the heart of climate

00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:36,080
solutions so making sure again that

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,120
those that are most affected by

00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,679
climate change by environmental problems

00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,559
are

00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:43,919
put at the center of either responding

00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:45,919
to

00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:47,679
responding to how climate impacts are

00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:48,400
affecting them or at the center of those

00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:50,400
solutions

00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,440
that we're putting forward so let me

00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,760
stop here

00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,760
let me um see if there are any quick

00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,679
clarifying questions i will also go to

00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,720
the chat and and try to answer as much

00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:00,240
as i can

00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,720
and then and then i'll hand it over to

00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,320
hannah who will talk us through some of

00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,919
what this looks like in the future and

00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,720
how we are we're starting to solve this

00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,720
and think about this

00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:14,400
great thanks so much sam we can move to

00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,400
the next slide then

00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:19,520
sorry great so all as you all know

00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,440
the intersection between human rights

00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:23,039
and climate is not new this is something

00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:26,159
as sam mentioned that has been

00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:27,840
in existence for years and years however

00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:30,080
really it's coming into focus

00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:32,240
now companies civil society actors are

00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:34,720
starting to look at the implications

00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,559
on human rights of climate change and

00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,240
trying to address it with a streamlined

00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:40,000
approach that tackles both climate

00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,880
impacts and human rights impacts

00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
together but what we're not necessarily

00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,720
doing is taking real

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,400
futures lens to it thinking through how

00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,520
these impacts could intersect in the

00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,799
years to come

00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,640
and that's what we want to talk about a

00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:55,440
little bit today is how we can apply

00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,080
futures thinking to some of these

00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,520
different

00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,480
kind of implications that are going to

00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:02,080
be arising next slide

00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,799
so the first thing to think through is

00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:06,880
that disruption is the new norm

00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:08,400
the world around us is changing more

00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,480
rapidly than ever before

00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,159
with massive implications for how we

00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,000
consider the role of business

00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:15,840
civil society creating a just and

00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,320
sustainable world

00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,760
the context for society ethics human

00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:22,320
rights and technology

00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,600
is radically different than it was even

00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,679
a decade ago

00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,280
as evidenced by the accelerating energy

00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:29,360
transition

00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,880
highly disruptive technologies such as

00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:33,919
artificial intelligence

00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:36,320
and increasing geopolitical volatility

00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:37,760
and new expectations for actors within

00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:40,320
the system

00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:42,799
businesses organizations that fail to

00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:45,919
adapt quickly to changing conditions

00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:47,440
aren't risk of being swept aside so how

00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:51,440
do we think about this

00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:55,039
next slide sam our brains

00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:57,919
evolve to help us think about short-term

00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:59,039
survival needs we have hard wild

00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:01,360
cognitive

00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:02,960
biases that make it difficult for us to

00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:05,360
think effectively

00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:07,360
about complex global issues and

00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:09,039
unpredictable change

00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:11,039
we frequently respond to uncertain

00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:13,360
future possibilities with denial

00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:14,799
so oversimplification or false

00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:17,919
confidence about certain

00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:19,679
elements or with paralysis so planning

00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:21,120
for everything or a wait-and-see

00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:24,159
approach

00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,880
our business tools our civil society

00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:27,520
tools rely

00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,559
too much on extrapolation from the past

00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:31,919
and outmoded

00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:33,679
mental models yet effective leaders

00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:35,120
need more than ever to be able to think

00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:38,720
about complex

00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:40,000
unpredictable change and to make wise

00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,520
strategic decisions

00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,520
in the face of uncertainty

00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,440
let's look at one thing we've seen in

00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:50,960
the past on the next slide sam

00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:52,799
this is where futures comes in companies

00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,799
have started attempting to predict

00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:57,600
futures using forecasts

00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:59,039
however forecasts do have their limits

00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,039
this graph that you'll see here is from

00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,440
the international energy agency the

00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,720
world

00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:07,600
energy outlook with predictions for this

00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,799
future of solar and renewables market

00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,279
but as we see here

00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:12,480
in the colored lines year after year

00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:14,960
their forecasts have been

00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,840
wrong that black line going straight up

00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,000
is what's actually happened in that

00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,679
market

00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,600
forecasts are a useful tool for

00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:24,640
well-defined phenomena

00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:26,240
and over a short time horizon

00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,240
but they're less effective when

00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:31,360
considering complex

00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:34,400
phenomena or over long-term horizons

00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:36,799
or when based on highly incomplete and

00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:39,200
data and unknowns some emergent

00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:40,880
phenomena are too complex or too new to

00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,880
be meaningfully forecast

00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,400
we need a new way to be thinking about

00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,240
these issues

00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,799
and that's where futures comes in or

00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:51,360
futures thinking as we call it here

00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:53,120
this is also known as futures or sorry

00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,880
strategic foresight and saying we can

00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:57,520
move to the next slide

00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,320
futures thinking is a structured

00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,480
approach

00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,520
to exploring the forces that shape the

00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,200
future

00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:05,360
this includes identifying and

00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,000
understanding emerging issues that may

00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,799
disrupt

00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,480
current trends and considering multiple

00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:11,600
future scenarios to improve

00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,320
decision-making

00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,200
in the face of future uncertainty it's

00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,760
not focused

00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,120
on predictions but rather on expanding

00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,799
our field of vision

00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:23,600
challenging our assumptions about the

00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:26,159
future and identifying blind spots

00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:28,480
thereby improving our capacity to adapt

00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:31,760
and to steer change

00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:34,400
next slide so today we want to pilot

00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:35,679
one way of using futures thinking to

00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,000
help consider

00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:39,520
the wide range of future possibilities

00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,480
and help us prepare

00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:43,520
for those future eventualities on the

00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,760
next slide we'll see

00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,880
that exercise today so it's called

00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,320
futures wheels

00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,320
would love to hear in the chat if

00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:52,559
anyone's used these before

00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:55,440
but really futures wheels are a way to

00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:57,360
map the possible cascading impacts of an

00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,840
event or development

00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:01,279
you start with a plausible future

00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,640
development or what we're going to call

00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:04,159
a prompt

00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,400
and the futures wheel is used to

00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:08,799
consider potential first order

00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:11,600
second order and third order human

00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:13,600
rights implications of that development

00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:15,360
it does not enable us to predict the

00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:18,320
future but can help us

00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:20,400
anticipate plausible important and

00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:23,440
non-obvious future developments of

00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,880
relevance to climate and human rights

00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:28,960
so if you go on the next slide we're

00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,960
just going to show a quick example here

00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:35,120
so here in the center you can see the

00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:37,679
prompt that we're using within this

00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:40,240
hypothetical so driverless cars are

00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:42,080
ubiquitous in all major cities

00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,559
so what happens if that's a near-term

00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:46,880
reality on the next slide we can see

00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:47,600
that one of the first order impacts of

00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,559
that

00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:52,240
we've included a few here so private

00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:52,720
companies gain the right to drive in

00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,880
certain

00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,880
areas while others don't thereby

00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,480
excluding certain populations

00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,400
you have transport options for the

00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,440
elderly and disabled are increased

00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,200
thereby allowing

00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,640
you know increased mobility increase

00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,440
access to employment

00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,799
and services in the community many

00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,919
different things resulting from

00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:13,600
in this first order category second

00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:15,679
order consequences though bring

00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:17,279
new considerations on our next slide

00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:19,120
here so what results from this new

00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:20,480
employment opportunities as we mentioned

00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,720
from increased mobility

00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,080
but you also have vulnerable groups that

00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,919
might be edged out of

00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:27,679
the communities if they're not able to

00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:30,399
access these driverless cars if they're

00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:32,640
not serving certain populations

00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:33,760
and finally we consider the third order

00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,840
impacts here

00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:37,760
in our next slide thinking long term

00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,679
what this could actually lead to

00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,760
if you think about driverless cars for

00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:43,679
example you could actually have

00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,360
coalitions forming around the right to

00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:47,520
drive you could have

00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:49,279
reduced emissions but you could also

00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:52,159
have potential

00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:53,279
extremists using cars to drive bombs

00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:56,000
into

00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:57,760
the stadiums or sports facilities of the

00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,520
local community lots of things that can

00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,039
happen that you can then think through

00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:04,000
the trickle on effects

00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:05,279
of those original actions and that's

00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,600
what we're going to be doing today is

00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:10,240
working through a few of those near-term

00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:12,000
potential realities at the intersection

00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,440
of human rights and climate

00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,600
we're going to then extrapolate the

00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,520
first second and third order impacts

00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,919
and then take a step back as a breakout

00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:21,760
group to think through the implications

00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:23,760
on business civil society

00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,919
and what that means for us today and

00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,559
what actions we should start putting in

00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:29,440
place

00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:30,080
to advance positive outcomes and

00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,480
mitigate

00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:34,240
those negative adverse consequences that

00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,480
could come from some of these potential

00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:39,120
realities

00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,520
so in a moment we're going to break you

00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,919
out

00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:43,120
into a few different groups sam if you

00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:45,279
could just jump forward

00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:47,200
another slide i'd love to show what this

00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:49,200
looks like if we were in person

00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,880
so if we were in person and i wish we

00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,399
could be we'd be having lots of

00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,760
different color sticky notes with us

00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:56,480
today and we'd basically be

00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:58,399
working around this prompt in a group

00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,399
putting sticky notes on a big white

00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:02,159
board and working together but today

00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:04,720
we're going to be working with moreau

00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:06,880
and you probably all have a link to it

00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:09,440
already in the invitation for the

00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:13,200
session but maybe sam can drop it in the

00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:15,440
chat as well and what i'm going to do is

00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,039
just share my screen briefly so you can

00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,880
see what this monroe board is going to

00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:21,840
look like before we actually move

00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,840
into your groups

00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:28,559
so here we go you should be able to see

00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:31,600
my screen

00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:31,600
sam can you see it

00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,399
great so i'm going to assume you guys

00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,480
can see my screen this is what your more

00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:39,919
board is going to look like today

00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,080
so as you'll see here you have your

00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:43,600
first order effects you're going to be

00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:46,399
able to put sticky notes

00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:48,240
draw move drop these on there to think

00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:50,159
through those first order implications

00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:52,159
of this near-term reality

00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:53,360
your seed or your prompt is here in the

00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:55,120
left-hand corner

00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:57,200
so you'll be able to actually look at

00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:59,679
the prompt that you're going to be

00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:02,559
working through it's also in your black

00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:04,399
circle here in the middle and you'll be

00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:06,399
looking through the reflection prompts

00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:07,679
here as your group so what happens as a

00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:09,919
result of the seed

00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:10,720
or previous order consequences who's

00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:12,480
impacted

00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,480
what are the advantages and positive

00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,640
outcomes and what are the disadvantages

00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,720
and potentially negative outcomes

00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:21,039
you'll spend about five to seven minutes

00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:23,200
on this first order consequences

00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:25,440
then you'll move to about five minutes

00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,880
on the second order consequences

00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,120
and about five minutes on the third

00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,640
order consequences so 15 minutes total

00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,240
to fill out this circle in the center

00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,840
here before then moving on

00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,000
to a 10-minute discussion around the

00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:38,320
implications

00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,159
that businesses and civil society may

00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,760
see and what they can take as real

00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:42,720
actions to mitigate negative

00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,600
consequences

00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:47,279
and advance positive opportunities now a

00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,200
couple things to know about moreau

00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:51,120
one in the bottom right hand corner you

00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,640
can zoom in and out of the screen so it

00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,440
makes it a little easier to see the

00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,440
whole thing

00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,720
or you can zoom right into the center

00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:59,120
there to be able to

00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:01,440
put on your sticky notes there's also

00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,880
can be cursors flying around so you can

00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:05,039
see where everyone's participating

00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,640
that's in the top right hand corner here

00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:08,240
you can either show collaborators

00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,880
cursors it'll show where everyone is on

00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,559
the screen

00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:13,200
or just click and turn that off so you

00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:14,799
don't see everything whizzing around

00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,799
and finally just to make sure that you

00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:18,880
all know how to add these stickies here

00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:20,480
so if you click on the screen itself

00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,399
you'll see a little bar come up

00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:24,240
that'll help you add a sticky you can

00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:26,559
just add a little shape here

00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:29,200
or you can just click on a sticky copy

00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:32,640
it add directly

00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:34,080
and make some notes right on the screen

00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,919
if you have any questions feel free to

00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:37,519
ask samurai we will be facilitating

00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:38,799
these sessions but that gives you a

00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:41,200
little bit of an idea

00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:43,279
of how you'll actually be able to

00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,720
participate in the session it allows for

00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:46,000
a little bit more engagement than

00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:49,200
perhaps just a

00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,640
normal webinar so with that i'm going to

00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,559
stop sharing my screen

00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,399
and we are going to be moving you into

00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:56,000
these two groups where your facilitator

00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:57,679
will be able to walk you through

00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,320
what you'll be exploring for the topic

00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:02,559
today let me just

00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,760
before you whiz us off into two breakout

00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:05,440
groups let me just

00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:08,000
let's pause and see if anybody has any

00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:10,640
questions um if you have any issues um

00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,320
accessing the links or i mean anything

00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,679
we can help you troubleshoot if you have

00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,120
any um

00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:17,120
questions about the logistics or

00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,399
anything you do come in now either you

00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:21,760
know through the chat or

00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:24,159
um or by voice

00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:29,840
we can also answer any questions in the

00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:29,840
breakout groups as well

00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:34,080
all right and welcome to everyone thank

00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:36,080
you for sharing your

00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:37,600
um introducing yourself on the chat it's

00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,080
been really great i've been enjoying

00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,679
reading

00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,600
who's on lots of different climate

00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:42,320
activists which makes me super excited

00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,799
so

00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:46,159
yeah so i'm going to head over to hannah

00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:47,200
again i think she's going to break us

00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:49,279
out

00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,799
is that correct yes so i'm going to move

00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:53,600
everyone to your room right now

00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:55,600
we'll spend about 25 minutes in this

00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:57,200
exercise then i'm going to zoom everyone

00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,720
back with about five minutes left in the

00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,519
session so we can share out

00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:03,120
the thinking from each group and with

00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:11,840
that you're going to be automatically

00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:11,840
whizzed into your group

00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:29,360
hi everyone hi

00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:29,360
hello hi kiddo

00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:35,120
i think i've seen you twice today was it

00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:38,559
yesterday yeah it was

00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:38,559
today as well yeah this morning

00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:42,240
so yeah it sounds like we have some

00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:45,039
friends already on the line that's great

00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:46,320
makes for workshops easier

00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:48,640
and i see that josh you have some

00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:52,720
guitars in the background myself as well

00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:54,240
start a band we have extra time

00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,840
but thanks so much everyone for joining

00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:58,080
today um first

00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:00,320
real quick kind of survey does everyone

00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:02,720
have access to moreau can you see the

00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,720
screen

00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:08,159
got some thumbs up great okay well then

00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,760
i'm not going to share my screen i'm

00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:10,639
going to keep this camera open so we can

00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,960
see each other

00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:14,800
and we are going to move into group one

00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:17,119
so if you're familiar with muro

00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,800
you can click on that first frame there

00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:20,240
it should just say futures wheel and

00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:23,280
discussion group one

00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:25,919
right at the top and

00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,960
with that we're just going to take a

00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:28,960
quick minute

00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,960
what i'd love for everyone to do is take

00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:33,040
a look at that left-hand prompt

00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,639
and just take two minutes by yourself to

00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:38,000
kind of think through okay

00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:40,960
if this is the reality of today so

00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,720
intrusive electronic surveillance and

00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,800
individual tracking measures

00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:46,159
that have been put in place to combat

00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,240
covid19

00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:49,919
have also proven effective in managing

00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:52,720
climate-driven disruptions

00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:54,879
and many countries have kept using them

00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:57,200
despite privacy infringements

00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:58,800
if this is the near-term reality what

00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:01,520
could be a possible

00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,560
near-term kind of first order impacts of

00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,920
that bee

00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,599
i'm going to ask you just to reflect

00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,720
give it 60 seconds two minutes

00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:08,800
and then we're going to come back and

00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:17,839
start populating this screen with a few

00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:17,839
sticky notes

00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:46,240
okay hopefully everyone's gotten a

00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:47,440
chance to wrap your brain around this a

00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,640
little bit

00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,400
i'd love to hear what you guys are

00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:52,240
thinking feel free to add a sticky note

00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,920
write things down in the middle here or

00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:56,079
i can take the notes if you

00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:57,359
don't feel like typing that's fine too

00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:59,040
um but

00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:00,960
what are you guys thinking is the first

00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:04,079
order impacts of this

00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:13,839
new reality widespread surveillance

00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:13,839
tracking climate disruptions and people

00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:18,640
i'm sorry if i pronounced that wrong but

00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,320
i see you smiling you look like you're

00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:22,960
thinking of a couple do you want to jump

00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,960
in for us

00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:30,960
i'm er not specifically you know

00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:34,160
sorry okay that's so good anyone else

00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:34,160
got some early ideas

00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:39,119
oh i just wrote down um i was literally

00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:41,200
trying to write down

00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:43,119
kind of like tracking and following

00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:46,160
people um

00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:48,480
regardless of their consent

00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:51,440
which i was about to write yeah keep

00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,440
going that's a great one

00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:57,359
and i think ian that also brings up what

00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,160
do we think about public and private

00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:01,280
spaces

00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:03,680
how much is this going to be omnipresent

00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,480
versus you know perhaps only in certain

00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,160
locations

00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,119
do you think this will be everywhere do

00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,640
you think it's only going to be in

00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:10,640
certain areas

00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:12,720
are the lines between private and public

00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:14,320
becoming a little fuzzier with this type

00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:16,800
of surveillance

00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,760
yeah that's a good point actually it's a

00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,920
really good point

00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:21,760
because there'll be no new public spaces

00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:24,000
per say because

00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:26,720
because you know everything will be now

00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:29,520
one type of area

00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,520
and that's it

00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:38,480
so i'm just adding that a little bit

00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:39,920
here maybe also the question of who

00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:42,079
actually owns the data

00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,920
so i mean obviously a lot of data data

00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:45,680
is generated with the surveillance and

00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,920
then so so who is actually going to own

00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:50,800
it and who has the right

00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,839
to manipulate the data and change it or

00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,160
delete it or

00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:54,160
whatever

00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,800
one of the things that comes to mind

00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,800
actually is is more question than

00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,160
than a than an actual suggestion which

00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:06,800
is um

00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,520
we're saying that you know intrusive

00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,040
surveillance

00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,960
and tracking techniques are being used

00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:13,520
to manage disruption

00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:14,880
are we thinking they're being used to

00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:16,400
influence behavior

00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,960
are we thinking they're simply being

00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:21,520
used in an observing capacity

00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,800
are we thinking um there's a combination

00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:26,480
of both

00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:29,119
um yeah

00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:30,400
that's oh go ahead sorry i'll say surely

00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:33,359
um

00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:35,760
by being observed uh your behavior

00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:35,760
changes

00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:39,280
and that's always a big question of

00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,880
behavioral practices when you're

00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:43,599
actually being surveyed

00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:45,119
do you have full autonomy of your person

00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:47,280
if you know you're being watched

00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:49,119
what's your individual agency look like

00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:51,040
and how does that change

00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:52,800
so i think foreign that might be a

00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:54,720
really good question is

00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,320
are all of those potential options that

00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:58,960
you just listed possible

00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:00,480
perhaps depending on the rule of law of

00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,200
the country where this is deployed that

00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,960
could change

00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:05,200
you know you might have ones that are

00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:07,839
just kind of gently monitoring to make

00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:09,520
sure that emissions are only going

00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:11,359
so high but in another instance you

00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,240
might have individual tracking to see

00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:15,200
exactly how much

00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:17,119
you as an individual are producing your

00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,440
practices are you taking an uber every

00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:19,760
day

00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,480
are you walking to work are you you know

00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,720
what are the

00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:24,480
penalizations that perhaps come out of

00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,920
that as well or the ramifications of

00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,760
your actions

00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,680
so someone is their feedback being

00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,960
targeted directly at individuals for

00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:32,400
instance with like covet tracking when

00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,920
people are talking oh like you let's

00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,440
like build some kind of tracking system

00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,920
that gives people notifications on their

00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,920
phone

00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,960
based on stuff being noticed about their

00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,040
you know like

00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,000
immediate environments or is the

00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:44,000
feedback only happening

00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,880
at like much much larger level here's

00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,480
what's going on at scale

00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,400
yeah let's add that in too that's a good

00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:52,400
one wouldn't

00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,000
sorry i just kind of uh sorry i was like

00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:56,560
joined late but um

00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,000
would some of those be more second order

00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:01,599
effects

00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:03,680
some more might be but i think that

00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:05,920
you know part of this gets a little bit

00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:07,200
gray in first a second order and i think

00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:08,880
it's all right to write them down when

00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,240
they're kind of coming to you

00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,000
yeah because i do think that if you're

00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,920
seeing tracking you know

00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,680
the immediate next step you might see is

00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:17,040
that you're getting feedback loops

00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,400
from that tracking you're getting that

00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:20,800
data fed back to you so you better

00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:22,240
understand your individual behavior

00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,680
but you could also see that if the

00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:25,119
tracking is a little bit slow that could

00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,480
be further down the line if there's

00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:28,000
other questions that come first

00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:31,440
so it might be a little context specific

00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,440
on how the future manifests

00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:39,680
so we've seen some negatives here we've

00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,280
seen some positives too

00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:43,280
so around you know being able to

00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:45,119
understand your individual behaviors but

00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:47,440
what are some positives of this that we

00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:50,560
might see in terms of climate change so

00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:54,240
might this help actually us understand

00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:54,720
how individuals are committing to

00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:57,920
different

00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:58,240
actions or if countries are being better

00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,160
than

00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:01,760
others and help kind of incentivize

00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:06,560
action what do you think are some of the

00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:08,720
positives here

00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:10,480
easier to develop targeted solutions now

00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:13,920
i mean if you if you know

00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:15,599
what you're solving for according to the

00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:17,920
behavior of the people or your your

00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:20,720
clients so to speak

00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:23,119
then then it might be easy to to solve

00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,119
for that

00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:32,880
definitely and feel free to keep adding

00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,319
to this first order but

00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,079
i think we're already i'm already seeing

00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:37,599
some blue stickies starting to think

00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:39,200
through the second order let's move to

00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:40,880
that second order as ian was saying a

00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:43,359
lot of times they do kind of

00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,000
mesh together a little bit so we have

00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:46,000
some good

00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,680
easier to develop targeted solutions we

00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,680
have tracking of people

00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:51,760
regardless of if they've consented or

00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:52,640
not we have questions around who owns

00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:55,119
the data

00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:56,880
what could all of this lead to and let's

00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:58,800
start perhaps first with

00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:00,640
tracking and following people regardless

00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:02,000
of consent i'm a human rights person so

00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:04,160
this is one i really

00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,680
pay a lot of attention to what might

00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:07,280
this do to different marginalized

00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:09,200
communities different vulnerable

00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:13,280
populations all of a sudden we have

00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:14,640
information on all lg btq populations

00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,319
in some parts of africa where it's

00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:18,079
illegal you know so

00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:20,800
what does that look like now that we

00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:20,800
have this data

00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:24,079
well i will expose people that may not

00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:27,150
necessarily

00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:29,200
want to to be exposed and

00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:30,400
[Music]

00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:33,280
it takes away the freedom to

00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,280
self-identify

00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:45,839
what are some other implications here

00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:54,000
there's also potential to

00:42:52,790 --> 00:42:57,520
[Music]

00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:00,560
generalize and you know

00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:03,920
i don't know like yeah like

00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:06,400
um say for instance

00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:07,680
um that a certain group if you know

00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:10,800
sometimes data like

00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:13,839
is cured towards a certain thing

00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:14,560
and it could result in certain groups

00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:16,480
being

00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:17,680
identified as that certain thing even

00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:19,520
though that's not

00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:21,359
you know what's the that's not the

00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:23,680
reality

00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:27,839
so it exacerbates like i guess i guess

00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:27,839
like biases against

00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:34,240
and i guess also prosecution by the by

00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:34,240
the state

00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:39,040
prosecution or even violence depending

00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:41,440
right there's a rule of law people might

00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:42,880
decide to just take their own actions

00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,560
indeed yeah i may not necessarily be

00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:47,200
from the state uh

00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:47,200
completely agree

00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:54,079
and i think there's some good questions

00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:56,079
here around you know carbon tax on

00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:58,000
individuals who owns the data what are

00:43:56,079 --> 00:44:08,560
some other second order impacts we might

00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:10,640
see from these

00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:11,839
someone someone put in i don't know yet

00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:13,680
low income groups impacted

00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:16,640
disproportionately by carbon taxes if

00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,640
that's a really good one

00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:21,599
and you could see that driving home

00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
maybe this is the third order impact a

00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:23,920
little bit

00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,000
i'm getting ahead of myself but you know

00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:28,960
that could drive even a bigger divide

00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,560
between uh different social classes or

00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:33,280
socioeconomic classes

00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:35,440
so people all of a sudden then can't be

00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:37,839
able to access education maybe

00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:39,040
that one of that could also interrelate

00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:39,920
with the fact that people don't want to

00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,680
be tracked

00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:45,200
so they're hiding and then no longer

00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:45,200
accessing public services

00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:49,920
one thing i haven't seen here is as well

00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,000
is we are

00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:53,920
talking about this electronic

00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,560
surveillance and tracking now being

00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:57,440
used in certain areas but we could

00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:59,680
imagine

00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:01,680
where not all areas are being surveyed

00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:04,480
right so we might have certain countries

00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:06,000
unable to really set up the

00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:06,800
infrastructure needed to do this

00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,119
tracking

00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:11,200
so you could have also a data divide

00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:13,680
where certain countries have this

00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:15,599
insider kind of understanding of how

00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:16,640
their actions are affecting climate but

00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:19,359
others don't

00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:20,319
and so they have no data no solutions

00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:23,520
therefore that are

00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:26,400
really applicable to their context and

00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:29,680
huge differences and then viable climate

00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,680
solutions in different areas

00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:34,480
does that resonate with people as well

00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:41,680
i mean i think i i kind of disagree with

00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:44,720
that and it's great i think it's

00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:46,880
true it's true but it's i mean

00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:48,480
i think it's it's true for the global

00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:52,480
north you know loganos

00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:54,319
as in like um uh marginalized people and

00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:56,400
not marginalized people but i think

00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:58,960
across north south

00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:00,880
um in in with respect to like people

00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:02,640
understanding you know how like climate

00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:04,240
change works how they actually

00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:06,319
um impact the environment i think

00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:08,720
there's

00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:10,800
maybe a greater you know understanding

00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:12,319
of how our individual actions from the

00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:14,400
global south could impact the

00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:18,000
environment in which we live in

00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:18,400
i think in my opinion so you're saying

00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,119
sorry

00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:22,160
that the which side would have a greater

00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:26,319
understanding

00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:27,839
that the um i think in generally i think

00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:30,000
communities marginal indigenous

00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:31,359
communities or marginalized communities

00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,680
in inverted commerce

00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:35,200
um in the global south have a different

00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:36,960
relationship to the environment

00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:38,319
and so they have a greater understanding

00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:41,359
of how their actions

00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:43,119
could impact um yeah like

00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:44,560
could have an impact on climate change

00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:46,720
and um

00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:48,400
yeah the communities yeah how they how

00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:50,960
they basically their relation to

00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:51,920
the earth or yeah the environment i

00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:54,800
think it's

00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:55,440
more different but um on a global scale

00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:57,920
i think it's

00:46:55,440 --> 00:47:00,640
we talk about like power hegemonies and

00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:02,560
like how if you know the more data is

00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:04,480
um collected in the global north for

00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:07,200
instance it would come across

00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:07,760
you know in like platforms like these

00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:09,839
that

00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:11,680
certain groups are more knowledgeable on

00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:13,680
their you know actions

00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:15,599
but you know the lack of data on the

00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:17,839
other side not the lack of data from

00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:18,960
systems in global systems would be

00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:21,520
interpreted as like

00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:22,400
lack of information where it's not

00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:24,480
necessarily

00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:26,000
what is happening right there's still

00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:28,240
that information it's just not being

00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:31,119
captured in the same way right it's uh

00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:32,400
yeah yeah yeah exactly no that makes a

00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:33,920
lot of sense let's make sure that's

00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:35,760
reflected in here because i think that's

00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:38,880
a good call out as well

00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:40,720
is these systems are capturing data in a

00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:42,640
very specific way but it's not

00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:45,119
necessarily

00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:47,920
reflective of the understanding of all

00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:52,720
populations of how their actions are

00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:54,000
engaging with climate change

00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:56,079
and i think we're kind of moving out i

00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,800
see a couple third-order impacts here i

00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:58,960
think a mental

00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:00,160
health epidemic from people never having

00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:01,599
their own space to think

00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:03,359
that's a really good one and it's

00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:05,760
something we think about here a lot

00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:07,280
sam and i on our team about individual

00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:09,599
autonomy and identity

00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:10,960
how do actual societal behavioral

00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:13,520
practices completely

00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:15,280
change you could see kids you know being

00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:17,760
trained to completely

00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:18,400
kind of uh eliminate all emotions at

00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:20,240
least

00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:21,520
physical manifestations of emotions

00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:22,800
because they know they're always being

00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:25,040
surveyed or tracked

00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:26,559
right and so what then how does that

00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:27,520
change society how does that change

00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:29,119
mental health

00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:30,880
how does that change our understanding

00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:31,520
and ability to interrelate with one

00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:33,280
another

00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:35,040
there's a lot going on here and it's

00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:37,280
getting a little sci-fi you can imagine

00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:40,240
if everyone was very stoic all the time

00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:42,079
but i swear that this is an exercise the

00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:42,880
writers of black mirror use in some of

00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:45,920
their

00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:47,440
some of their kind of screenwriting so

00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:48,400
let's push ourselves a little bit here

00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:51,920
what else is kind of

00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:53,359
weird large-scale societal impacts like

00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:54,640
that that we could see from some of

00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:58,000
these first and second

00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:59,359
second order impacts that we've created

00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,119
well maybe you should also think about

00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:04,880
power

00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:07,920
and you know how how how that affects

00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:11,200
or or who holds who who

00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:14,880
um gets in a position of power by

00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:18,640
either you know having access to data or

00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:21,200
having the necessary resources

00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:21,680
versus either individuals or countries

00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:24,400
or

00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:24,880
regions that may not necessarily have

00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:28,400
that

00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:29,839
that have those resources and

00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:31,520
it sounded like you were kind of getting

00:49:29,839 --> 00:49:35,680
to some of the questions around

00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:37,760
power as well and so those yeah

00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:39,520
and power how it's interpreted too what

00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:43,760
is power what are the definitions

00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:46,160
yeah yeah but i'm i'm also thinking like

00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:46,800
you know if you have your colleague data

00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:49,839
on the

00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:52,079
individual scale i mean later on

00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:54,000
who determines based on who owns the

00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:55,200
data there's 15 questions about you know

00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,680
who owns the data who

00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:58,400
has the right to manipulate it it's also

00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:59,920
like you know

00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:02,079
later on at some point there will be

00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:05,040
like key indicators of

00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:06,559
you know what is um positive change or

00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:08,880
what we should be looking at

00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:11,440
so carbon tax reasons or like just

00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:12,800
certain practices that we do on a

00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:14,400
individual level or like on an

00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:15,280
industrial level and those will be

00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:17,920
indicated where

00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:18,720
in other regions perhaps it's different

00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:22,960
for instance

00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:25,920
i mean um an example would be maybe

00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:26,880
i think i'm from namibia and i think um

00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:29,040
generally

00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:31,200
groups that are uh defined as

00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:32,480
marginalized or indigenous although like

00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:35,520
everyone is indigenous

00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:37,839
i think um they have a very

00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:40,079
like a healthy relationship with like

00:50:37,839 --> 00:50:41,119
meat and like animals and so but like on

00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:43,359
a global scale

00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:45,280
you know it's like oh let's reduce the

00:50:43,359 --> 00:50:48,880
amount of meat that we eat

00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:48,880
but it's not the same for everyone

00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:55,839
so almost different different levers

00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:58,319
that are already

00:50:55,839 --> 00:51:00,160
like different uh points of leverage

00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:01,520
these communities have identified for

00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:04,960
themselves and what they might be

00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:04,960
expecting out in the future right

00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:13,040
and in a moment we're going to turn to

00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:14,800
implications but any others that we want

00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:16,559
to make sure to jot down here i see some

00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:18,640
good ones going up laws changing to

00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:20,000
reflect your history over your lifetime

00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:21,440
oh yeah that's a good one

00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,440
insurance going up for countries who

00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:24,240
don't collect this data also really good

00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:26,319
one

00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:28,480
class divide is worsened i think we

00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:30,800
should add probably something of

00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:37,839
individual autonomy i like the mental

00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:37,839
health one

00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:49,040
oh thanks guys for getting in there with

00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:50,000
me at least you're you're pretty techy

00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:51,520
i've been on some groups

00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,119
before that we couldn't even get into

00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:56,880
mural so it was uh always a

00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:58,240
always a challenge but in our last let's

00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:00,640
see i think we have about

00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:02,240
seven or eight minutes left together so

00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:03,760
i'd love to start thinking about the

00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:04,480
implications you know we've obviously

00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:06,240
brainstormed

00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:08,079
out there's lots more that we could put

00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:10,559
down on this board

00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:12,319
what are some of the positive negative

00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:15,440
implications that we can start

00:52:12,319 --> 00:52:16,800
thinking about today putting actions in

00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:18,960
place or putting

00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:20,480
mechanisms in place to make sure some of

00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:23,839
these negative

00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:25,680
long-term consequences don't arise and

00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:27,520
to ensure that some of these positive

00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:28,720
opportunities that are actually helping

00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:30,319
us identify

00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:33,040
some of the actions we should take can

00:52:30,319 --> 00:52:36,559
be put in place in advance now

00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:36,559
i'd love to hear your thoughts on those

00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:43,520
i have one um i think more

00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:44,720
what would i think it'll be cool if like

00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:47,680
later on we have like

00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:48,720
data commons and like individual groups

00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:50,880
you know like

00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:52,800
taking control of their data finding

00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:54,640
their individualized context and

00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:56,000
you know having a participatory like

00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:57,839
approach

00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,280
that like contextualized with a

00:52:57,839 --> 00:53:01,280
different like environment

00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:02,480
so instead of having like one global

00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:04,559
like you know approach

00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:05,599
it's like different approaches depending

00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:08,720
on the

00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:08,720
um community

00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:11,359
i like it

00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:16,800
other responses to either that idea or

00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:19,200
other ideas that you'd like to throw in

00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:19,200
the mix

00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:29,839
go ahead i heard two at once go ahead

00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:40,079
ian why don't you go for it

00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:41,760
okay um i was gonna say

00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:43,440
i was gonna say that but i think it's

00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:47,440
basically um

00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:51,520
i think that there there should be

00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:54,240
um i'm looking at the the one about

00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:54,720
who's policing the data i think that

00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:58,480
there

00:53:54,720 --> 00:54:01,760
could be um something where

00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:04,960
there's you could see

00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:06,319
what data has been collected um not just

00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:09,280
on yourself

00:54:06,319 --> 00:54:11,119
but also um you know there's like

00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:12,240
another almost like an agent that kind

00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:15,359
of like

00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:17,680
lets you know that um

00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:19,440
the data is saying this about you or

00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:21,440
they they think this about you

00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:23,280
does that make sense so it was like

00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:26,480
you've got some kind of like

00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:29,599
um third party who's giving you

00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:30,800
prompts about this is what uh if you do

00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:33,520
this action

00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:34,960
then this is what the result will be

00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:38,960
almost

00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:41,839
you know so individualized

00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:42,960
data to help you take individualized

00:54:41,839 --> 00:54:44,480
action

00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:46,319
yeah yeah i think it sounded like so

00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:47,200
it's like you it was like maybe it was

00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:50,000
kind of like

00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:51,599
gives you like a risk score almost but

00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:54,880
in real time

00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:57,119
you know um so that i mean it's it kind

00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:59,920
of sounds a little bit

00:54:57,119 --> 00:55:01,760
like negative but also if it's under

00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:04,880
your control

00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:07,040
then it could be positive yeah to at

00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:09,280
least have access to that data

00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:10,160
um rather than rather look at the data

00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:13,200
but actually like

00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:15,920
here's what the result will be of that

00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:17,040
based on the algorithms that are being

00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:20,240
used

00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:22,079
you know that makes sense if done in a

00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:23,680
rights respecting manner where you have

00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:25,839
those privacy mechanisms where you have

00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:28,160
your own data ownership

00:55:25,839 --> 00:55:30,079
and it's not necessarily visible to

00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:32,079
others there could be really positive

00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:33,760
cases where you start taking seeing

00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:37,040
individual action

00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:38,319
yeah just as a quick anecdote too one of

00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:40,480
the things we saw

00:55:38,319 --> 00:55:42,000
the nordics tried to create a blood

00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:43,680
drive years ago

00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,599
and they couldn't figure out how to

00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:46,960
actually get people donating blood

00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:48,480
there was no way they couldn't do it

00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:49,520
they were so short and they ended up

00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:51,280
getting all these people together and

00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:52,799
finally found that if you tracked it and

00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:55,520
showed where your blood donation

00:55:52,799 --> 00:55:56,720
went and how it ended up in social like

00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:58,319
positive change so

00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:59,839
a five-year-old in need of a blood

00:55:58,319 --> 00:56:01,520
transfusion was able to live today

00:55:59,839 --> 00:56:04,079
because you gave blood

00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:05,280
that data back to the individual donor

00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:07,920
changed and now their net

00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:10,400
exporter of blood donations just because

00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:12,000
of that one simple tracking mechanism

00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:13,520
and you could see how that could

00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,240
actually be the same here

00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:17,839
this helps you reduce emissions by xyz

00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:21,200
amount right

00:56:17,839 --> 00:56:22,799
so and sorry forehand i think you were

00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:25,119
jumping in there a while ago and i i

00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:26,559
rudely took up too much time

00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:28,480
yeah i know i was just going to mention

00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:29,760
like you know it feels like you know the

00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:30,960
more

00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:32,559
it's surprising like the range of

00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:33,359
different conversations in this space

00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:34,880
that like

00:56:33,359 --> 00:56:36,160
you know like keep emphasizing how much

00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:38,240
this is needed but yeah like you're like

00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:40,000
having like regulatory framework that

00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:41,680
you know and for ai to take a

00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,160
comprehensive look at human rights

00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:44,799
questions

00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:45,359
democrat democracy protection questions

00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:47,680
rule of

00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:50,400
rule of law questions is really central

00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:52,079
to resolving a challenge like this

00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:53,760
as well and it's not just like you know

00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:55,040
like like a thing for

00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:56,720
i mean yeah it is also like you know

00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:57,359
like when it comes to these like you

00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:58,799
know like

00:56:57,359 --> 00:57:00,640
more targeted question about the

00:56:58,799 --> 00:57:02,799
intersection between

00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:05,040
surveillance technologies and uh the

00:57:02,799 --> 00:57:06,559
environment

00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:08,160
some kind of you know like work that's

00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:10,839
coming out of united council of europe

00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:13,839
is really interesting and that's fun for

00:57:10,839 --> 00:57:13,839
me

00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:20,720
okay so we've got a couple here

00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:21,839
i'd love to i've added the one that you

00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:23,440
just mentioned kind of around

00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:23,839
considerations of the context in which

00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,200
these

00:57:23,839 --> 00:57:27,119
these technologies are deployed so

00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,839
considering rule of law considering kind

00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:30,160
of

00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:31,760
the different governance and regulatory

00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:41,119
structures that are in place

00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:43,200
any others that we want to add here

00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:44,160
i i'll say i mean one thing that we

00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:46,319
haven't added

00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:48,559
or i don't think we've added is

00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:51,839
facilities since you mentioned

00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:55,760
the pandemic is that um there's some

00:57:51,839 --> 00:57:57,599
very easy um

00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:59,040
determinations that can be made with the

00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:01,440
next pandemic

00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:02,880
you know it's like okay well we have

00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:05,680
this information

00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:06,160
we know a little bit about i mean what

00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:07,839
actually

00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:10,000
this is this will be the smart part is

00:58:07,839 --> 00:58:13,359
that you have that data about

00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:14,640
people's uh patterns of tracking and

00:58:13,359 --> 00:58:15,599
stuff like that with tracking but then

00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:18,240
also

00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:19,280
you have your data about your health and

00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:22,000
stuff like that

00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:22,720
and then something pulls them both

00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,760
together

00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:28,880
i'll say the agent again excuse me

00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:30,960
and we'll let you know

00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:32,880
this is you know it's too risky to go

00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:36,640
outside right now or

00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:38,480
don't do this because you know um

00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:41,280
the chances are that you're that you

00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:42,559
will be infected for example

00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:44,400
it was like kind of like yeah i think

00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:45,520
they're saying about having having

00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:47,040
access to that data

00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:48,880
but also having access to your own

00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:51,440
personal data and then

00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:53,200
something kind of like going so you'll

00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:54,559
get less hopefully get less people who

00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:58,000
are infected

00:58:54,559 --> 00:59:00,559
the next pandemic yeah

00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,520
so yeah data aggregate aggregated data

00:59:00,559 --> 00:59:03,839
combined with

00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:06,319
individualized data leads to personal

00:59:03,839 --> 00:59:08,319
data yeah yeah

00:59:06,319 --> 00:59:10,559
which is obviously a massive public

00:59:08,319 --> 00:59:12,160
health um

00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:14,160
that'll be really good for public health

00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:15,040
that's a that's the that's the end

00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:17,520
result

00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:19,520
yeah well i think we're going to need to

00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:20,000
move back to the group would anyone like

00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:22,400
to help

00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:24,240
share out some of our findings here i

00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:27,920
would love a partner in crime

00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:27,920
although i am health happy to help

00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:33,119
oh everyone's looking away from the

00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:34,720
screen i see it i see it

00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:36,000
okay how about i start things off and

00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:37,599
then you guys contribute does that sound

00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:39,119
good

00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:41,119
okay perfect i won't put anyone on the

00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:47,839
spot well i'll see you guys back in the

00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:47,839
breakout room

00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:01,839
recording in progress

01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:12,839
perfect great to see everyone made it

01:00:10,319 --> 01:00:15,680
back you didn't lose anyone in

01:00:12,839 --> 01:00:17,119
cyberspace

01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:20,960
we'll just wait for the others in the

01:00:17,119 --> 01:00:20,960
meantime i will start sharing my screen

01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:43,839
feel free to keep adding if you if

01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:43,839
anything comes to you

01:00:45,359 --> 01:00:49,119
okay i think my group is coming back um

01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:49,920
they're still continuing to put

01:00:49,119 --> 01:00:54,000
implications

01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:56,160
in the in the implication box so

01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:58,559
wonderful well thanks so much sam great

01:00:56,160 --> 01:01:00,319
to see that almost everyone's making it

01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:00,640
back let's just move this board so it's

01:01:00,319 --> 01:01:03,599
not

01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:05,200
quite overlapping we have about five

01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:06,880
minutes or a little less than five

01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:07,280
minutes left so we just wanted to give a

01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:11,119
quick

01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:12,880
recap of some of the things we found so

01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:14,559
taking a look first at group one and

01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:17,359
then sam will pass over here

01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:18,960
for group two feel free to um have

01:01:17,359 --> 01:01:20,079
anyone that you selected to share out

01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:22,799
jump in

01:01:20,079 --> 01:01:23,440
but there we go thank you for moving

01:01:22,799 --> 01:01:26,160
that so

01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:27,520
our first prompt in the group one was

01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:30,079
thinking through

01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:32,319
intrusive electronic surveillance and

01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:33,920
individual tracking measures

01:01:32,319 --> 01:01:36,720
that have been put in place to combat

01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:38,960
copin 19 and the pandemic has also

01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:41,599
proven effective in managing

01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:42,480
climate-driven disruptions and many

01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:44,720
countries

01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:46,880
have now kept using them despite

01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:48,559
significant privacy infringements

01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:50,160
so our group started thinking of course

01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:52,079
through the first second third order

01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:54,160
implications of this and i can zoom in a

01:01:52,079 --> 01:01:57,359
little bit so you can see those

01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:58,400
um there we go but basically we started

01:01:57,359 --> 01:02:00,880
thinking through

01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:01,839
how this would actually impact different

01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:03,760
communities

01:02:01,839 --> 01:02:05,680
how you could gamify climate-friendly

01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:06,160
activities you would track and follow

01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:08,400
people

01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:10,640
regardless of their consent there might

01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:12,880
be a carbon tax on individuals

01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:14,720
a fuzziness between public and private

01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:15,359
spaces they might become one in the same

01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:18,480
with this

01:02:15,359 --> 01:02:20,160
um the comprehensive surveillance

01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:22,160
and that could lead to many different

01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:25,200
things so it could lead to

01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:27,280
actions and legislative or regulatory

01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:29,839
issues from the state or even violence

01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:31,680
by the nation state in question it could

01:02:29,839 --> 01:02:33,440
lead to questions around who's policing

01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:34,960
the data who owns it

01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:37,119
you could have certain communities that

01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:38,960
are being followed while others aren't

01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:40,559
authoritarian leaning countries may

01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:42,160
start to lead global climate change

01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:43,359
efforts because they now have the data

01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:45,520
to do so

01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:47,119
but you also have low income groups

01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:50,480
impacted disproportionately

01:02:47,119 --> 01:02:52,480
by carbon tax and social pressures

01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:53,599
now this is moving let's see we'll move

01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:56,559
it back

01:02:53,599 --> 01:02:58,400
there we go um and inequality over data

01:02:56,559 --> 01:02:59,359
use could be seen as dangerous so lots

01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:02,079
of different kinds of

01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:03,440
impacts here in our third tier we really

01:03:02,079 --> 01:03:06,000
started thinking of

01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:07,359
how this could actually centralize power

01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:09,760
in different areas

01:03:07,359 --> 01:03:11,200
and the fact that tracking technology

01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:14,079
becoming the norm

01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:15,520
embeds certain social behaviors so if

01:03:14,079 --> 01:03:17,440
you are being tracked

01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:19,119
how do you respond as an individual how

01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:21,359
do you think about your own autonomy

01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:22,640
maybe you start masking emotions because

01:03:21,359 --> 01:03:24,079
you don't necessarily

01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:26,160
want to be showing it to all these

01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:28,160
different tracking mechanisms

01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:30,319
and insurance goes up for countries who

01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:32,319
aren't collecting this data perhaps

01:03:30,319 --> 01:03:34,079
laws might change to reflect your your

01:03:32,319 --> 01:03:35,359
history over your lifetime of your

01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:37,280
practices

01:03:35,359 --> 01:03:39,280
and class divides are worsening so those

01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:39,839
are just a few we're seeing a lot of

01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:42,960
different

01:03:39,839 --> 01:03:44,799
kind of end outcomes here that resulted

01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:46,319
in quite a few implications so

01:03:44,799 --> 01:03:48,079
one of the uh there are a couple great

01:03:46,319 --> 01:03:49,200
ones that came up so thinking through

01:03:48,079 --> 01:03:52,079
data comments

01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:54,079
what could individuals do to take

01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:55,839
control over the data so we would create

01:03:54,079 --> 01:03:57,920
a commons so that many people were

01:03:55,839 --> 01:03:59,119
participating and how data was collected

01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:00,960
shared and used

01:03:59,119 --> 01:04:02,319
having it be a global approach rather

01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:05,760
than country by country or

01:04:02,319 --> 01:04:07,280
siloed in different communities we also

01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:09,599
thought that it could be helpful to

01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:11,599
have individualized data that helps you

01:04:09,599 --> 01:04:13,839
take individualized action

01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:14,720
so if you control all of your data and

01:04:13,839 --> 01:04:17,200
then can take

01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:19,119
action on your climate impacts and

01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:19,760
really be able to help make personal

01:04:19,119 --> 01:04:21,359
change

01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:23,200
but done in a privacy and rights

01:04:21,359 --> 01:04:24,960
respecting manner so that you have

01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:26,000
actual ownership of your data it could

01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:27,920
actually be a positive

01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:30,160
outcome we could start thinking through

01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:31,680
what that would look like today

01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:33,520
we have a couple others here but i want

01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:34,480
to make sure to give sam the chance to

01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:36,000
really um

01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:37,599
talk through her so i guess i just

01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:39,599
passed to my group for a quick 30

01:04:37,599 --> 01:04:40,240
seconds anything to add here that we

01:04:39,599 --> 01:04:41,920
missed or

01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:44,079
things you wanted to specifically call

01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:44,079
out

01:04:47,839 --> 01:04:51,440
i think hannah because we're at time

01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:53,280
unfortunately

01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:55,119
we probably won't have time for me to

01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:57,520
recap but why don't like let me also

01:04:55,119 --> 01:04:59,119
give the opportunity to my group to

01:04:57,520 --> 01:05:00,960
to call out some of the examples

01:04:59,119 --> 01:05:03,039
otherwise we can also invite everyone to

01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:06,400
look at the other miro board

01:05:03,039 --> 01:05:07,839
or the other um sorry topic

01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:09,119
that you didn't work on if you want to

01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:10,400
look at some of the things that we came

01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:12,559
up but let me just quickly see if

01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:14,559
anybody in my group wants to come in

01:05:12,559 --> 01:05:16,160
for about 15 seconds i don't want to

01:05:14,559 --> 01:05:23,200
keep people in case they have

01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:24,880
another another session to go to

01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:27,039
all right and i see people shaking their

01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:29,200
heads they're like no

01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:30,400
all right well i think we can go ahead

01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:32,480
and close out

01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:34,079
yeah as a closing note um this is a

01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:35,920
really helpful exercise

01:05:34,079 --> 01:05:37,599
as a group but it can be really helpful

01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:39,760
in teams if you want to get a little bit

01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:40,799
more concrete at your own organization

01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:43,839
your own company

01:05:40,799 --> 01:05:46,160
to help through rather than just broad

01:05:43,839 --> 01:05:46,799
implications the specific actions your

01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:49,440
team

01:05:46,799 --> 01:05:51,280
department or organization should take

01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:52,960
in relationship to some of these and

01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:54,720
outcomes and how you can create really

01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:57,200
resilient strategies

01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:58,480
that might be fruitful in any potential

01:05:57,200 --> 01:06:00,160
future environment

to continue the conversation the mirror

01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:15,760
board i believe will stay up for a bit

01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:17,599
