festival and

00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,880
it's a sad day but look at all that we

00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:01,440
have accomplished together we have

00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,440

00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:06,320
9587 participants

00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:07,360
which is amazing i can hardly believe

00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,360
these numbers

00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:12,640
and it's incredible that so many people

00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:14,559
join together with the goal of inspiring

00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:18,280
inspiring action for a healthier

00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:21,279
internet and a trustworthy ai

00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:22,559
[Music]

00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:24,320
and we've made this whole journey

00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:25,039
together and we've tried to keep you

00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,120
informed on

00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:29,279
everything that happened over the last

00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:31,679
uh two weeks as much as possible

00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:34,240
but we've also had our eyes and ears on

00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:36,559
the ground in the form of our wranglers

00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,279
so i would like to invite a few of them

00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:39,760
to share

00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:40,720
their favorite moss fest moments of this

00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:43,760
year

00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:45,840
so welcome everybody

00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,760
lovely to see your faces let's start off

00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:49,520
with sean gilroy wrangler of the

00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:51,840
neurodiversity space

00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,640
sean what are some of your favorite most

00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,480
fast moments

00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,640
you've had this year that you'll likely

00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:58,320
never forget

00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,919
um well there's a couple of things i

00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,840
think the first is uh

00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:03,120
and we've managed to capture kind of

00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,640
across all the spaces and in the

00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,080
festival the creativity and the

00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:08,000
experimentation that

00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:09,600
the festival's always delivered uh when

00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,320
it's been a physical festival but we've

00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,960
done it

00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:14,559
this time through virtual experiences

00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,399
using video conferencing tools

00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:18,240
collaborative tools

00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:19,840
and the different sharing platforms like

00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:22,000
spatial chat um

00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:23,279
and it's just just been really exciting

00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,600
to be able to do that

00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:27,360
um i think also for me the sessions have

00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,679
been curated by

00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:31,120
uh all the facilitators uh to make it a

00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:33,440
truly global experience

00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:34,399
in particular for me stephen emmanuel

00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,720
session

00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:38,640
um which i missed but my fellow wrangler

00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,600
lena shared and i caught it uh i caught

00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,200
the recording

00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,880
um and it's a powerful especially not

00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,679
just for the topic that stephen talks

00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,600
about but

00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:47,600
reminds us of the importance to kind of

00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:49,519
global sharing and collaboration

00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,880
of an accessible and healthy digital

00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:53,279
infrastructure powered by

00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,320
an open internet which can help us share

00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:57,360
stories

00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:58,320
find friends and allies and help to

00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,919
encourage to

00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,600
kind of encourage positive change and

00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:03,120
growth nice

00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,720
well thank you sean and it's good to

00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,360
hear that we've still been able to catch

00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,440
that

00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:09,200
mosfest vibe this year even though it

00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:12,640
was completely virtual

00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:15,279
um moving on to more rubenstein you're a

00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:17,279
wrangler of the shifting power in tech

00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:19,519
more what were your highlights of mosfes

00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:21,679
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:22,880
so we are a new space the most past and

00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:25,279
we envision it

00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,799
as a space where people can come and

00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:29,200
have difficult conversation

00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:30,159
and come with action but i think what we

00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,240
did anticipate

00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:34,320
that it will be so reflective and so

00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:36,559
honest and at the end of the day we'll

00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,760
be with so many actions like we've seen

00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:39,600
so many different

00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:41,200
and diverse group of people coming to

00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:43,519
speak with actually coming with

00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:45,039
a strong idea and we'll move forward so

00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:48,000
i'm very excited

00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:49,600
that all of these ideas happened here

00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,360
and then it will move on after the

00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:53,120
festival meaning that this space is

00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,600
really important to try to shift power

00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,480
and tech

00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:58,240
with people on the ground nice yeah it's

00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,159
lovely to hear that it's gonna move on

00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,440
after the festival because i think all

00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:04,159
of us want that

00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,120
um also are there any best practices

00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:06,799
that you picked up

00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:10,559
uh this year that you will be able to

00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:13,519
use in your work definitely

00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:13,919
make people very um interactive during

00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:15,679
zoom

00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:17,760
including meditation which i think i'm

00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:21,440
going to take into my next zoom

00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:24,640
meeting is to have like nice action

00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:27,440
but i also think just be honest

00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,679
and like using virtual space to honesty

00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,080
is

00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:31,519
very new and very amazing i think

00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,919
because you don't see one another maybe

00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:33,440
some

00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:35,440
walls are breaking so i think what i'm

00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:38,880
gonna take is like try to have

00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:42,640
the nurturing environment of mosfest

00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:43,679
into my daily uh life yeah great tips i

00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:46,960
think everybody

00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:48,000
can use them and last but not least we

00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,000
have another wrangler from the

00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:53,039
neurodiversity space with us

00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,720
welcome to the show pratamesh javan um

00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:56,799
what would you pick as your highlight of

00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:58,960
most fest this year

00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:00,880
yup so uh this was uh one of the

00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,480
greatest festivals which i attended in

00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:04,399
recent past and

00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:06,159
i have picked three of my favorite

00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:08,879

neurodiversity sessions

00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,480
and trust me her sketches were kind of a

00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:40,159
summary to the entire session

exhibition space for the past three

00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:02,880
posts

00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:04,960
[Music]

00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:07,200
and yeah it's a real bummer that this is

00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:09,280
the last show but the good news is

00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,320
that we can finally show you this little

00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,240
masterpiece

00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:14,480
let's look back at some of our favorite

00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:18,480
moments of mosfest 2021

00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:20,560
roll the tape yes we're live

00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,880
you can't really code trust you have to

00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:24,960
trust each other as humans

00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:26,320
and technology is there to support the

00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:29,359
trust building

00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:32,000
what is done for me without me is done

00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:32,000
against me

00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:39,839
we have to be able to have technology

00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:42,000
and have safe online spaces as well i

00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:43,599
just refuse to yield that that's not

00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,760
that that cannot be the case

00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:47,839
technological tools will not be able to

00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:49,440
solve social problems on their own and

00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:50,560
we really should stop asking them to do

00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:54,240
so

00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:55,119
this year at most fest i met people from

00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:58,320
canada

00:37:55,119 --> 00:38:02,400

00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:26,320
[Music]

00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,240
there's a lot of interesting

00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:30,560
opportunities with the way in which

00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,280
harnessing artificial intelligence can

00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,500
enrich

00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:35,980
what you're making

00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:35,980
[Music]

00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:43,440

health movement

00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,770

00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,929
me

00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:50,929

00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:15,359
mosfest 2021

00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:17,040
but that doesn't mean that it ends here

00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:18,000
and here to tell us more on what will

00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:20,240
happen next

00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,280
is a very special guest the director of

00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:25,200
mosfest

00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:27,280
sarah ellen hello hey sarah how are you

00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:29,839
feeling right now with mozfest coming to

00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:32,960
an end sentimental feelings

00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:36,960
all the emotions yeah and tired

00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:38,160
but excited and but also overwhelmed and

00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,599
filled with gratitude for all the

00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:41,040
incredible sessions and incredible

00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:41,680
participants that have joined us over

00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,599
the last

00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:45,040
12 days i can't believe it's over i

00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:46,960
haven't really yeah

00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:48,640
i feel you have the same but have you

00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,760
been glued to your screen like for the

00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:52,079
last two weeks or

00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,040
were you able to get some breaks i don't

00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:55,839
think i've left this

00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:57,440
chair and for the last eight weeks but

00:39:55,839 --> 00:39:59,200
there's been so much to

00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,560
to catch up with and and one of the

00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,760
beautiful things about this year is that

00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:03,839
we've been able to

00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:05,599
experience more of the festival as it's

00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:06,800
happening right in front of us on our

00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:08,319
laptops across

00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,599
and able to attend more sessions so

00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:10,160
we're not running up and down as many

00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:12,480
stairs

00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:13,520
yeah and a lot of more participants

00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,280
crazy numbers

00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:17,040
yeah we're overwhelmed with the amount

00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:19,440
of people that have joined us yeah

00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:21,200
and in the opening circle you said that

00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,880
things were likely to go wrong since

00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,720
this year's most fast is operating with

00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:26,000
different time zones using technology

00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:29,040
that might fail us

00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:32,240
um has that prediction come true

00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:33,839
yes but what i think we found and you

00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:35,839
know what we expected is that

00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:38,319
everyone comes together to fix things

00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:39,920
and to support each other and so while

00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:41,359
you know we might have needed a passcode

00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:43,040
for a zoom room or

00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:44,880
someone might have gotten a lot we might

00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,280
have lost a link everyone came together

00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,960
and

00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:48,720
shared that code and brought people in

00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:51,040
or if the facilitator was late

00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:52,319
and people would help occupy everyone in

00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:55,440
the room and like just

00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:57,119
everything is so cool yeah nice

00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,560
and um so the official part of the

00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:01,839
festival might be over but

00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:02,640
what will happen now so much like moss

00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:04,160
fest does not

00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:06,079
end just because of our sessions have

00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:07,920
completed today the platform

00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:09,920
is live for another 90 days so you're

00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:11,359
going to be able to return tomorrow

00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,960
as long as you have a ticket you'll be

00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:14,640
able to return tomorrow to

00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,800
watch all the session recordings read

00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:18,960
the session notes and still engage

00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:21,200
in the art and media and sessions and

00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:23,920
art and film and podcasts

00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:25,040
and we will be creating more moments for

00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,520
you to engage with us we're going to

00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,440
have some

00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:28,880
more sessions we will be kind of

00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,640
connecting treads across

00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,760
different topics that we saw evolve from

00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:33,440
the festival and bringing those

00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:35,599
collaborators together

00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:37,119
we want people to stay with us on slack

00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:38,720
we want people to like

00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:40,400
email us and let us know and share their

00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:42,160
blog posts about what's going on

00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:44,000
we want them also to stay connected and

00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:46,240
read the mosfest book there's

00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,680
loads of ways to stay part of this and

00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,560
part of this community but i think the

00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:52,079
biggest thing to

00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:53,599
to take apart take away is you know

00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:55,040
you get to take home the friendships you

00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:56,640
get to take home the connections and you

00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:58,240
get to take home those learnings

00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:59,599
from those sessions and with those

00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:01,440
facilitators and bring them back into

00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:03,760
your own day and your own work

00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:06,160
nice so secretly mosfest is still kind

00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,880
of going on for 90 days and a long time

00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,800
after that

00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:12,160
and it may be a bit premature but do you

00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:16,640
have any information on mosfes 22

00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:17,680
2022 um we are hoping to be in amsterdam

00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,720
i don't think that's going to come as a

00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:20,800
surprise to anyone

00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:22,160
as you've expertly showed us around the

00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,240
city for the last

00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:25,520
and two weeks and i think we're just

00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:27,040
gonna we're just gonna if

00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:29,680
anything as we've been thought anything

00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:33,440
for the last 12 months is take it slowly

00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:35,760
and plan for a b c and d

00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:38,000
very good well sarah thank you so much
