and so mesos is a place where we're

00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,960
coming together

00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,360

00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,960
and

00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:53,679
inspiration to share with our community

00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:58,080
talking about

00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:59,679
alternative business models um and i

00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:02,880
wanted to ask each of you

00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:05,440
to share a little bit more about

00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,159
really this this process of innovation

00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,120
how do you go

00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:11,200
from a bold idea to really manifesting

00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:14,159
this in the world

00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,480
and what are all the steps that we may

00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:16,720
not

00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,840
see because we haven't had your life

00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,679
experience

00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,360
in building products and really bringing

00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:23,440
them to the marketplace what are all the

00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:25,840
steps between an idea

00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,039
and bringing that to the market and i'm

00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,640
particularly interested

00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:31,280
also in thinking about what this

00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,240
community of co-builders and innovators

00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,360
can do to

00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:37,600
to nurture that larger um context and

00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:40,880
landscape of of exciting ideas

00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:43,360
so i'll throw it to i'm on for you ayman

00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:46,480
sorry for you to start uh and lead us

00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,480
off here in this question

00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:52,400
yeah i think um what's interesting about

00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,440
having ideas i mean it's easy to have

00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,840
ideas but then

00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,440
it's the implementation of them uh that

00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:00,640
that's the challenge and

00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:02,880
when what i always seek to do is put

00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,080
great people around me to be able to

00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:07,120
take

00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,600
sometimes ideas that don't have a form

00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,240
yet

00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,679
it's more like a feeling and turning it

00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,400
into something that

00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:15,360
is tangible and it's important at all

00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,320
stages

00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:19,760
to to always be focused on actually

00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,240
executing

00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,960
getting it down on paper recording

00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,080
things

00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:28,640
um coming up with a with

00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:30,400
some sort of production otherwise it's

00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,799
just conversation after conversation

00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,400
around

00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:36,799
ideas um which is fine and there's a

00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:40,400
time and place for that in the process

00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:43,840
but it's important always to be thinking

00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:46,000
an idea when when you go to execute an

00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,360
idea there's always compromise and you

00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,280
want to start understanding what that

00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:53,600
compromise is

00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:56,240
working in a team allows for different

00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:58,640
sides different experiences different

00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,120
cultural backgrounds to be put on the

00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,320
table

00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:05,039
and and brought forward which then

00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,000
make it more realistic to actually get

00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:08,080
the thing done

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,039
whatever the idea may be whether it's

00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,440
software

00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:12,400
whether it's hardware whether it's it's

00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:15,440
you know

00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:17,679
a service a product

00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:20,000
an end user product or or a business to

00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:23,200
business product

00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:26,159
working with that in mind

00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,520
gives you a sense after doing it a few

00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:30,640
times

00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:32,799
that there are stages to any idea

00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,400
that an idea needs to go through and you

00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:35,600
you're looking forward to that next

00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,559
stage

00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,880
and you know if you've baked it enough

00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:41,840
to

00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:43,120
take it to that um to stage two and

00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,200
stage three

00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,720
and you keep that in mind and if you're

00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,640
working with a good team

00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,159
you're all keeping your each other in

00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:53,120
check over

00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:55,120
you know going too far down the rabbit

00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,720
hole and then sort of pulling back

00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,159
and saying okay we actually need to

00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:02,000
deliver something

00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:05,200
what is it what does it take and so

00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,440
i would say initially just

00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,360
being free form and then turning it into

00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,760
something more solid

00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,960
with the idea of execution and doing it

00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,720
with discipline

00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,720
over and over again gets you used to

00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:20,000
doing it and being able to deliver

00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,000
product into the marketplace

00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:24,159
tony does that match with your

00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:26,880
experience

00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:28,240
uh yeah yeah actually um uh that

00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,360
definitely does merge

00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:34,080
uh with my with my experience

00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:35,200
what i've also found is that you know

00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,960
i'm sure

00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,039
most of the people tuning in to this

00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,679
today they're very curious individuals

00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:42,720
and they have

00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:45,440
a lot of ideas and so what normally

00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:49,279
happens is you have so many ideas

00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:51,520
that you have to really filter them out

00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:52,880
right and it's not just ideas of one

00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,480
thing you want to do but you have

00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,080
different ideas of all different things

00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,440
you want to do so how do you first start

00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,919
with that

00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:02,240
and the way i think about it and because

00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:04,000
i used to latch on to the first idea i

00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,760
had and i would run with it

00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,520
and it would run fast i was like oh this

00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,279
is the best idea ever and i'm like

00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:12,400
commit everything burn the bridges we're

00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:14,080
going for it and i've learned over time

00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,559
that that isn't the right way to do it

00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,880
i've wound up doing lots of cool stuff

00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:21,840
but they were meaningless at the end and

00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:24,720
the whole reason was is that i didn't

00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,600
i didn't think about and break down the

00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,240
issues

00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,880
well enough before i committed to it and

00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,799
so

00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,720
i think about this in a different way so

00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:35,840
i say that great ideas

00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:37,440
chase me they stalk me they hunt me down

00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,320
so i have a great idea and i'll have

00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,279
maybe

00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:42,640
20 or i think are great ideas but then

00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,120
you know there's that idea that you kind

00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,960
of go

00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,640
yeah you all of them are like yeah it's

00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:49,360
great but i've been there before

00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,240
i've already tried it it's not good

00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,240
enough

00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,840
and then after a few days that idea

00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,320
comes back and it kind of eats at your

00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,840
brain

00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,440
and then a few more days it eats at your

00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,320
brain you're like this is a good idea

00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,000
and then you're like

00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,679
now i'm gonna start breaking it down

00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,799
into small parts and bits and

00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:06,880
pieces and i'm like okay now it's more

00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:08,640
manageable but now i see some more risks

00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,159
maybe it's not so good and then i break

00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,960
it down some more and go

00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:14,000
good more risks and then i start talking

00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:17,200
to people about it that i

00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,039
trust and then they're going yeah but

00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,279
did you think of this and so you start

00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:23,360
to make this risk and risk mitigation

00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:25,279
and figure out where the holes are and

00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,080
where the good ideas are and starting to

00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:28,960
prune

00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,600
and so too many people i see like you've

00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,200
heard those

00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,799
those stories about where they go out to

00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,320
a dinner and they write something on the

00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:36,799
napkin and then the next day they get

00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:39,120
funding and they're off running

00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:40,480
stupidest thing you can do you need to

00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,960
sit here and you need to

00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,640
before you commit start really breaking

00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,240
it down really understanding risk

00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,600
mitigating and getting other smart

00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,840
people like eamon said

00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,200
to start contributing and helping you

00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,799
see it from different angles

00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,559
and then when you get to a certain point

00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:56,240
i'm not saying this goes on for years

00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:57,760
but i'm also saying it doesn't go on for

00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:00,640
24 hours but

00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:02,240
you take a number of weeks maybe months

00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,360
to really figure out what it's going to

00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,440
take to build

00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:07,840
and build a team what's the right

00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,559
expertise understanding the markets the

00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,039
customers

00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:12,720
and then pulling in your community and

00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:14,640
this is when you were talking about the

00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,480
you know mozfest community i'm sure you

00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,320
have you know people have great people

00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,400
that they tap into online or whatever

00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,840
who can give them great critical

00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,559
feedback and help

00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:26,320
so that you can go and get started in a

00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:28,720
more confident manner even though you

00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:30,320
know more of the risks

00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,000
the more you know of the risks and the

00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,400
more you think you know how to solve

00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,559
them

00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,320
the more confident you get with the idea

00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:38,320
as opposed to

00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,440
you know you get faced with risks and

00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,279
challenges and all of a sudden you

00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,400
become deject you're like oh now i ran

00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:44,640
into another problem

00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,559
when you start a company your whole job

00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,440
is just problem solving and you're going

00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:49,279
to have problems

00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,480
if you don't like problems don't get in

00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:51,200
starting companies because that's all

00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,600
you have

00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,120
your whole day is solving problems

00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,400
problems you knew were going to exist

00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,240
and problems you didn't know

00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,840
and your biggest thing is trying to

00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,799
understand all the problems you're going

00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,559
to run into

00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:04,559
so you can figure out ways to get around

00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:05,760
them and so you've minimized the ones

00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:08,080
that are going to be the

00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,039
oh moment when you're like i didn't

00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,240
expect that

00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:12,080
because you didn't surround yourself

00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,520
with the right people so i think that's

00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,799
the first way of starting and getting

00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:17,279
your community to pull in

00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:19,120
and help you do that that's the way it

00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:20,799
starts to funnel and you get

00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,960
you get people behind you going yeah you

00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:26,080
got to do this now you got to do this

00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,960
um and uh and you'd be dumb not to and

00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,960
then you're like okay

00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,799
now i'm on my way that's the way i've

00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,640
always find it but don't just

00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:34,080
when you have your first when you have

00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,799
your first idea just

00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,840
run and chase it like no no no it's kind

00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:39,600
of like getting married

00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,880
you know you may not want to just run

00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,240
and chase and get married the first

00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,880
person you see you might want to take

00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,559
some time

00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:47,440
and figure it out and make sure it all

00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:49,200
works you know yeah there's a process

00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,799
that's really really insightful and i

00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,960
think it is a really good connection to

00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:54,320
mozbest one of the most fest taglines is

00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,360
you know come with an idea leave with

00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,279
the community

00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:59,440
the community gives you the resilience

00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:01,360
right of the do you know the multiple

00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,720
perspectives that you both mentioned

00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,880
about the people who've had more

00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,000
experience i mean as you were talking i

00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,760
thought well this is why people are

00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,159
serial entrepreneurs because once you

00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:12,000
know how this works you almost can

00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:14,559
now that it's repeatable and rinse and

00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,480
repeat but the process probably has some

00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:18,080
some similarities from company to

00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,679
company that like really give you the

00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,360
confidence to keep going

00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:22,880
but if you've never done that before you

00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:25,440
need to work with an advisor

00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,919
and someone who has to contextualize and

00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,720
help you

00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:29,200
problem solve as you said tony and and

00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,640
sort of

00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,640
you're going to fail you're going to

00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:35,200
fail you're going to fail so

00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,919
you need to have people around you yeah

00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,279
it's called

00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:42,399
fail learn not learn and and

00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:43,760
do no it's do fail learn do

00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:45,760
failure that's what everyone's going to

00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,480
go through so there's one question that

00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,159
i have for

00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,679
each of you that kind of pulls on a

00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:52,640
string that you mentioned

00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:54,480
um a little bit uh in in the background

00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,480
which is sort of testing the market

00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,000
and sort of seeing where the idea lands

00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,679
so you have an idea that

00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,200
haunts you you can't let go of it love

00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:02,640
that image and you know this is

00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,520
something i need to kind of pursue and

00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,840
check out

00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,799
from from my side you know one of the

00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,440
things that we're trying to do at

00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:12,559
mozilla is show the consumer appetite

00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:14,159
for new products and new ways so we see

00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:15,360
you know these polls that talk about how

00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:16,880
people are really concerned about

00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,320
privacy and security

00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,760
they don't feel comfortable with a lot

00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,279
of products they're using but they don't

00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:23,840
have an alternative

00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:25,120
and so part of my job is to really

00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,600
continue to

00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:29,840
to give people good information that

00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:32,080
grows their awareness and by

00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:34,080
by default some of their concern and

00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,720
then kind of demonstrates to folks like

00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,720
you

00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,399
that there are what are people waiting

00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,399
for new products is that something that

00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:42,240
you really look to

00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:44,159
when you're trying to validate an idea

00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:46,480
where do you even get that information

00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:48,080
to kind of signal there's a market and

00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,919
an interest

00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,200
more broadly than just among you and

00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:54,320
your

00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,039
colleagues aim and go for it yeah i

00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,279
think i mean

00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:58,640
obviously market studies are important

00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:00,640
and uh

00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,320
the way i try to approach things is both

00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:05,360
from a market study

00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:06,320
um approach but also from an instinctual

00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,159
approach like

00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,520
yeah if you start to hear things over

00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:12,880
and over

00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:16,240
um it's important to to

00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:18,559
start developing an ear that

00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:20,880
hears what people mean and not

00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:23,360
necessarily what they say

00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,399
and so if you surround yourself enough

00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:27,600
and you put yourself

00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:30,480
out into environments where

00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:32,000
there are there's sufficient amount of

00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,039
information coming from the people

00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,840
around you

00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:38,320
about the things that they need and if

00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:40,880
you're able to translate them into

00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:43,760
into product i think that that's um you

00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:47,360
know a very very important skill

00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:50,399
one mustn't um i mean you can

00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:52,720
you can start with the granular

00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:54,240
product or idea just you know from the

00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,159
sense of uh

00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,679
just from a philosophic sense or a

00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:00,080
theoretical sense and

00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:01,840
start to a b test your way into a

00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:05,279
product that that you'll

00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:08,720
find yourself you know out in

00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:12,080
in space lost you know if you do that

00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:15,600
but at the same time i think being

00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:17,200
utterly um you know

00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,880
closing yourself off from the world and

00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,440
not wanting to listen i don't think

00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,120
that's

00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:24,000
that's the way either so a healthy

00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:26,399
combination of the two

00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,559
but it's it's also you know i've i've

00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:30,640
been in meetings where

00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:32,559
powerpoint presentations are put up with

00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:35,679
big spreadsheets and

00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:37,760
you know about um this is where the

00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:40,799
market is going and this and that and

00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:43,039
and tons of market research etc but

00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:44,559
people aren't really listening to what's

00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:47,120
actually going on

00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:48,320
and uh and they've been wrong many many

00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:51,279
times

00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,600
i think it's important to really you

00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:54,080
know

00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:55,760
the thing tony mentioned before and i'll

00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:57,519
mention over and over again is putting a

00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:00,240
good team around you

00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:01,360
who aren't just going to who aren't a

00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,919
bunch of yes people

00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:05,600
i think that's very very important one

00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:10,320
mustn't get enamored too much

00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:13,760
with themselves and their ideas because

00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:15,919
there's fault lurking around the corner

00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:17,919
there's a mistake there's uh oops

00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:19,279
forgot about that didn't realize that

00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:21,039
hadn't thought about that around the

00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:23,600
corner regardless of what

00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:24,640
a market is asking for and what you are

00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:29,279
proposing

00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:32,640
as a solution and i think uh the more

00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:33,039
you know the just you know the word fail

00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:36,320
that

00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:37,039
tony said uh is extremely important in

00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,840
the process

00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:41,039
and once you accept that there can be

00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:43,600
failure

00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:44,720
overall of the of what it is that you're

00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:47,120
doing

00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,960
but then there are potentially that each

00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:52,240
idea could fail

00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:53,840
and you accept that it liberates you

00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,120
and you're not having to be the genius

00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,159
in the room that's coming up with every

00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:58,799
idea

00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:59,360
all the time and be right it's not about

00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:03,440
that

00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:06,640
it's about um a journey of discovery

00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:09,519
and you you go along the way and you see

00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:10,159
at the end how much of that original

00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:12,960
idea

00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:14,080
if they're if it's a basket of of of

00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,480
apples and you're

00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,600
walking you know and and every time

00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,279
there's a

00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,720
mistake or something or whatever a

00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:22,159
compromise that you have to make

00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:24,159
as i was saying before you have to throw

00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:24,880
an apple onto the ground at the end of

00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:26,720
that journey

00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,480
how many apples do you have in the in

00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,679
the basket is it the same is it

00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,640
different did you have to put

00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:35,200
other things then to make it whole again

00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:37,279
if you accept that process

00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,200
including listening to marketplace

00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:42,240
including validating

00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:44,480
etc i think that you have a healthy a

00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:47,039
healthy environment for ideas

00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:49,360
creating products creating product after

00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:49,360
product

00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:54,080
that's really helpful yeah i remember

00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:56,080
once early in my career i had

00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:57,840
my boss interviewed someone and said i

00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,159
don't feel confident she would tell me

00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,320
no

00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:02,480
or tell me about an idea was bad and

00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:04,480
that makes me extremely nervous

00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,919
i can't afford to have you know an

00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,799
environment of people who want to please

00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:08,720
me that's not

00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:10,159
what this is about and that really stuck

00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:11,040
with me and it sounds like that's a real

00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:13,599
principle for

00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:15,839
for building teams for you to to build

00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:18,079
companies and good ideas

00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:20,320
any anything you want to add there tony

00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:22,560
and just in terms of this idea of

00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,599
reading the market and and both what

00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,440
you're seeing now and what you

00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:28,960
anticipate right so

00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:30,879
um what what you see in the tea leaves

00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,159
well let's let's just let's just you

00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:35,280
know kind of tie a

00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:36,240
bow around um what eamon was was talking

00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,079
about and

00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,839
and i think that number one is yes you

00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:41,200
have to surround yourself with a team

00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:43,280
but i think you also need to have an

00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,240
external team that is not as wedded to

00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,440
the

00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:49,359
wedded to the outcome as you are

00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,960
um as the team is right because they're

00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:52,480
you're searching and searching sometimes

00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,879
you just won't find it

00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:57,200
but if you can have great independent

00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:58,960
voices that you can trust

00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,320
um it's not your mom and dad don't tell

00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,359
your mom and dad oh look i got this

00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,880
great idea they're always going to tell

00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:04,400
you so it's great

00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,920
like you want somebody who you really

00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,599
respect who's going to you know going to

00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,160
be giving the honest truth of what they

00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:10,800
see

00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,200
so you got to have that external voice

00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,480
but

00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,480
the other thing you need to really

00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:16,640
understand especially again

00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,800
at the very earliest days like we were

00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:20,160
talking about the ideas that chase you

00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,920
is that you have to know the difference

00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:23,839
between a fact-based decision and

00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:27,119
opinion-based decision

00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:28,079
and almost anything almost anything that

00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:30,480
you're going to do that is

00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:31,839
really new and different is almost all

00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,680
opinion-based decisions

00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:35,119
and no matter how much market data you

00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:37,760
get how much customer

00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:40,000
insights or customer data you get you

00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:42,320
are not going to be able to get the data

00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,079
to turn this opinion-based decision into

00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:46,400
a fact-based decision

00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:48,160
a database decision so you're going to

00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,040
have to trust your gut and your gut is

00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,000
going to get

00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,359
you know you're going to get some

00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,040
insightful comments you're going to be

00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:54,560
able to build on things you hear that

00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,000
people are saying that you're

00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:58,160
that you've tested things you've looked

00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,760
through the risk by the end of the day

00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,200
especially at the beginnings of

00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,079
everything there are opinion-based

00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,760
decisions

00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:06,320
and you have to make sure that they're

00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:09,040
not they're opinion-based decisions

00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:10,800
with one leader or a small team who's

00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:12,560
making the decisions

00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,960
because you have to keep the vision

00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:16,720
whole because it's always about facts

00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,480
and who somebody won because of it

00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:20,560
there's and and they're trying to make

00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,400
these opinion based decisions into facts

00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,599
like eamon said they're like going to a

00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,680
b test themselves

00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:27,200
out into nowhere space because they

00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,000
don't have a core of what they're trying

00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,920
to build

00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,119
and i know when eamon was doing the

00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:33,359
first days of vero

00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:35,599
he was doing it based on lots of opinion

00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:37,680
based decisions of like this isn't right

00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:39,200
that isn't right this seems to be right

00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,680
and then he would modulate around that

00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,680
stuff

00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:43,440
so at the end of the day you got to

00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,320
really understand opinion versus fact

00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,000
based decision

00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,599
and the very first things you do are

00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,119
almost all opinion based

00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:50,400
there's a few facts like how much it's

00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:51,280
going to cost and how many people and

00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,119
stuff like that

00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:55,040
but really understanding the markets and

00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:57,520
where you're going it's a lot more

00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:58,400
feel and a lot more emotional than it is

00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:01,599
you know this

00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:03,040
always logic data driven kind of thing

00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:04,720
and what i love about that is when you

00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:07,040
first started that i i

00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:08,000
i noticed in myself that opinion based

00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:10,480
decisions seem

00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,920
bad and that no you're saying own that

00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:14,400
like that's where the i

00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,119
that's the energy that's the vision part

00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,960
of it

00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:18,800
so like you said don't sort of try to

00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,599
test it and boil it down to something

00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,599
that is so

00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:22,880
different than what you imagined and

00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:25,440
just like yeah

00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:26,800
build into that opinionated place right

00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,640
and if you have the gut

00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,240
if you have it in your gut and you know

00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:33,119
that and this is what i learned

00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:34,720
uh you know through my career which is

00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:36,800
if you believe it

00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:39,520
and you can show it and you can have a

00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:42,000
logical description of what it is and

00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:43,760
how you got there even though it wasn't

00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,119
it was opinion based but it wasn't data

00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,040
driven

00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:48,480
people will sign on and believe you

00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,400
that's how you build your team

00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,920
is because look these are the problems

00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,640
that we have i think these are the

00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,640
solutions

00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:56,400
let's go off and build this and the more

00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,359
that you have it in your gut and you the

00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,160
belief in you

00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:01,280
people follow you because you're doing

00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:04,240
something that they can

00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,800
both emotionally feel and logically feel

00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,480
through your

00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,160
through the way you think about it so

00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,640
you can build a following

00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:12,079
to get to that 1.0 to get to whatever it

00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:13,839
is to then get

00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:15,280
real feedback from the market to then

00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:18,320
modulate off of that

00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:20,560
but the first thing v 1.0 is

00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,359
all about belief in yourself belief in

00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:23,839
the in the

00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:24,640
in the matter at hand having logic

00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:26,880
behind it

00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:28,079
and convincing people to go with it and

00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,920
that's all opinion

00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:32,079
and that's all you know i won't i don't

00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:34,000
want to call it sales because it really

00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:35,760
isn't sales but it's that belief in

00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,320
yourself the vision and my wife always

00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,160
says this

00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:40,160
if you don't if you don't believe it you

00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:41,839
can't achieve it

00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:43,440
yeah right because there's no you're

00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:44,560
doing something new no one's ever done

00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:46,400
it before

00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:48,720
right and you're sort of yeah you're

00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,920
having to push out into an unfamiliar

00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:52,000
territory yourself

00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:54,240
and then also with users so i kind of

00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,720
want to shift to talking about vero in

00:38:54,240 --> 00:39:00,000
that sense of this is a new product

00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:02,240
um you are um have created a social

00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,240
media alternative to instagram with a

00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:06,000
strong privacy commitment and you don't

00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:08,240
have ads on the platform

00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,400
so there's a lot to unpack there in

00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:12,480
terms of the business model part of it

00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,760
but i'd love to hear from you eamon what

00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:16,000
what sort of

00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:18,160
how are you moving from your strong

00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:21,760
vision and opinion-led

00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:22,880
um building to really recruiting a user

00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:25,280
base

00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:28,400
um with this idea and how are you going

00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:31,200
to grow that community

00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:33,119
yeah i think um i mean it's it's kind of

00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:36,800
interesting when we first started

00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:38,960
um it was just

00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,880
an uphill battle to even have the

00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:43,280
conversation with anybody to say

00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:44,480
we're starting a new social network you

00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:47,119
know sort of

00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,520
the answer was usually in a question

00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:50,560
like

00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:51,440
why would you do that why why go down

00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:54,480
that path

00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,960
and um and i think what what everybody

00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,200
is

00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:59,200
is starting to see is the the problems

00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,800
with privacy and the problems with

00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,240
the business model the current business

00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:05,280
model which is free

00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:07,359
which is uh having a you know just a

00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:08,640
really bad effect on so many other parts

00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:10,480
of society and

00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:12,079
and people's lives everything from

00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:14,800
mental health to

00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:16,240
you know just so many different aspects

00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:19,760
of our lives

00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:20,880
and so when we're recruiting people

00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:24,160
we're actually

00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:25,680
in people are coming to us seeking an

00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:27,440
alternative i mean we're doing very

00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:30,560
little marketing today we're

00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:33,839
gearing up to a a big marketing push uh

00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:35,760
sometime this year but up to now what's

00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:38,240
been very interesting to see is just how

00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:40,800
many people have come to us

00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:41,920
purely looking for an alternative to

00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:45,760
what's out there

00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:47,359
and i think it's a very different time

00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:50,839
than when we started because

00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:55,680
now people have become very

00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:58,880
aware of the dangers of free

00:40:55,680 --> 00:41:01,359
and what it's actually costing everybody

00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:03,040
and and they're seeking something a bit

00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:07,040
more

00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:10,640
substantive clear um

00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:13,200
and there's a and a very logical

00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:16,319
exchange between

00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,960
customer true customers who are our

00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:20,319
users

00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:21,760
and the platform and um and we've always

00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:22,800
said from day one i mean when we

00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:25,280
launched

00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,720
uh the app into the app store uh that

00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:28,000
this was going to be a subscription

00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:30,640
service

00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,319
we've talked about it being a very

00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:33,440
charging a very minimal amount we're

00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:36,319
looking just to be

00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:37,440
you know first sustainable as a business

00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:40,480
but

00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:42,960
more importantly the whole idea of

00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:44,480
going subscription or starting with

00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,359
subscription and being a subscription

00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:47,440
app is that

00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:48,720
we treat all of our users as our

00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:52,000
customers

00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:53,440
and so with that um it's a clear

00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:58,720
understanding of what

00:41:53,440 --> 00:42:00,800
role we play and what to expect of us

00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:03,119
and are you finding i mean i'm curious

00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,960
it's so fascinating to watch the

00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:06,319
emergence of the subscription model

00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:09,520
because it feels so

00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:10,720
refreshingly retro in the sense of oh

00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:12,480
yeah we used to do this

00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:14,800
and this was sort of a former business

00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:16,079
model that got sidelined for a bit

00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:18,720
is it something that you're finding

00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:19,200
people understand kind of the workings

00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:22,240
of it

00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:24,240
do they have questions that emerge

00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:26,240
just sort of in terms of how they relate

00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:28,160
to the business as a subscriber

00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:29,680
does it make them feel i guess my one of

00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:31,040
my questions in it is

00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:33,200
does it create more of a sense of

00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:34,000
co-ownership or kind of community

00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,000
because

00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,359
you have that upfront transaction and

00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,520
how are you building

00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:41,040
that as part of the user experience or

00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:43,040
the the building

00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:44,240
well to be clear we haven't started

00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:46,480
subscription yet

00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:47,520
uh we have we're not starting to charge

00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:50,480
just yet

00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:52,000
every user that joins vero today gets it

00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,920
free for life

00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,240
until we turn on subscription and then

00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:59,440
new subscribers after that will

00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:01,520
uh will be charged uh but

00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:03,440
the way we treat them the language that

00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:06,480
we use everything that is

00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:09,520
um every interaction with our

00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:11,040
with our customer base uh is one where

00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:12,960
we treat them with respect

00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:15,040
we treat them to make them understand

00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:17,520
that they're part of the community

00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:18,400
and uh and that's what we've built it's

00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:22,000
it's

00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:23,920
really encouraging to see people

00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,160
looking not only looking for an

00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:29,200
alternative as in a feature set

00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:32,240
but rather a feeling of belonging

00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:34,960
and so there's a sense that

00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:36,880
um where they're supporting each other i

00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:38,720
mean i know so many people on vero that

00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:40,720
i don't know in real life

00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:42,240
that are there that are always

00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:45,200
supportive you know

00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:46,240
um if i'm if i want to celebrate

00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:48,000
something

00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:50,480
i celebrate with them and they're all

00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,920
there to to join me in that or if

00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:55,440
there's something going on

00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:59,520
like um you know raising funds for

00:43:55,440 --> 00:44:02,160
a foundation um they're all there and

00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:03,359
you know recently we um zack snyder was

00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:06,480
able to

00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:10,240
and deborah steider were able to raise

00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:13,119
uh over 000 for the american foundation

00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:16,240
for suicide prevention so it's very much

00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:19,280
a community that's supporting each other

00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:22,400
and feels that vero is

00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:23,839
almost a home an online home for them

00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,760
and i've heard that you know these are

00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:27,119
not my words these are these awards

00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:30,400
coming from them

00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:31,440
either directly to me or in zoom calls

00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:34,960
that i've done with

00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:36,000
uh with many of them yeah that's lovely

00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:39,599
i mean there are real

00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:41,920
reasons that people cherish

00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:44,240
uh you know social networks just for the

00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:46,480
reasons you've said and so to have a an

00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:47,359
ethical alternative like pharaoh seems

00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:49,119
like a

00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:50,560
really meeting the moment in terms of

00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:52,079
building especially in this covered

00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:53,680
world people need these

00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:55,599
online connections i know i've thought

00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:57,760
that more and more but really have

00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:58,880
growing concerns about the platform so

00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:00,960
you can see how those things are

00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:02,319
connecting tony i'm curious from an

00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:04,319
investor standpoint

00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:05,440
there are a burgeoning number of

00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:08,480
subscription

00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:11,440
kind of models and

00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:13,119
and other platforms are you seeing i

00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:14,400
mean is there a tipping point after

00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:16,319
which this becomes a little

00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:17,040
unsustainable how many subscriptions can

00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:18,880
people have

00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:20,880
is this sort of the new normal i'm just

00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:22,400
curious how you think about this overall

00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:25,920
approach to the

00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:29,680
to the web well i think that

00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:32,400
um that subscriptions versus

00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:32,960
you know ownership i guess you could say

00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:36,000
versus

00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:38,240
being owned right there's being owned

00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,119
owning and subscribing there are three

00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:41,200
different models

00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:42,480
and i think people are really waking up

00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:45,520
to this owned piece

00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:46,000
as as eamon said but the difference

00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:48,480
between

00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,480
ownership and subscription i think

00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:53,839
people want to have

00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:54,880
the um they want to have the ability to

00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:56,720
choose

00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:58,240
okay and you want to give them both like

00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:00,079
we're getting to the point where in some

00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:02,400
of our companies that are robots

00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:04,160
where people can buy the robot with a

00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:06,880
subscription service for

00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:07,599
maintenance or whatever else or they can

00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:09,520
just

00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:11,119
have the robot as a service and they

00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:12,960
just say i need it for three months and

00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:13,680
then they can give it back or whatever

00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,200
else

00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:17,359
so they can try it in these things i

00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:18,240
think that what we've learned in the in

00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:20,480
the in the

00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:22,000
in the world is that people have all

00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:23,359
kinds of different needs

00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,040
and there's different things that they

00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:25,680
need at different times even in the same

00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:28,880
company

00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:32,160
we have one company who in one division

00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:32,720
is using is buying or subscribing to the

00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,720
robot

00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:36,400
a robot as a service and the other one's

00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:37,920
buying the robot it's the same company

00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:39,920
but they have two different budgets and

00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:41,040
the way the taxes work and this works

00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:42,800
and all that stuff in two different

00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:43,119
places in the world they just decided

00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,960
that

00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:46,160
in the same company they can they need

00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:48,400
both models

00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:49,520
so i think that flexibility is key here

00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:51,520
with that and that

00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:53,040
you know and that's on the b2b side

00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:55,359
right b2c

00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:56,160
we're seeing that with shared services

00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:59,680
and and

00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:01,440
you know and rent to own or just rent

00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:02,720
so i think it's just flexibility i think

00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:05,119
that's fine i think

00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:06,400
people will get a little bit crazy if

00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:08,720
you know there's gonna they have to go

00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:10,400
to ten different media services to get

00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:11,839
all of their content and they need 10

00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,560
different subscriptions like what we're

00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:15,680
seeing the

00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:17,760
the balkanization or the the fracturing

00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:19,680
of you know all of these different media

00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:20,800
services so they can try to lock you in

00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:24,640
at some point there's going to be a

00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:26,640
natural backlash to that um so yes

00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:28,960
of course there's always over doing it

00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:29,839
but i think flexibility is key is the

00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:32,240
key word here

00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:33,680
and people have different needs and so i

00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:35,680
don't think it's a bad thing

00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:38,079
but i do think you have to understand

00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:41,040
when the subscriptions are

00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:42,640
for a something that's to benefit the

00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:45,280
customer and choice

00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:46,880
versus trying to lock them in for a

00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:48,319
business model that looks better for the

00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:49,839
street but it's not better for the

00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:51,119
customer overall and they're going to

00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:52,079
just throw their hands up and go

00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:54,240
somewhere else

00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:55,599
and just say i you know i give up with

00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:57,280
all this you know because

00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:59,280
i don't know how many media services

00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:01,920
there are now but it's like you need

00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:02,319
seven or eight to when you used to only

00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,319
need

00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:05,520
one or two you know everyone said oh

00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:08,800
cable cut

00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:09,200
cutting cutting the order or whatever it

00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:11,920
was

00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:14,000
so you had 100 channels now you need 80

00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:15,119
services to get those 120 channels like

00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:18,640
is that better

00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:20,800
it costs more you know so it's there's a

00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:24,079
natural you know cycle to these things

00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:25,440
right the pendulum yeah i i saw a tweet

00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:26,400
of someone saying i don't now i don't

00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:29,359
know how to read all my

00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:30,559
you know sub stacks you know i need a

00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:34,079
system to organize

00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:37,520
all that um so uh i think we're

00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:40,240
uh nearly done here um

00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:42,319
oh okay well we that's all the time we

00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:43,839
have i have many more questions but this

00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:46,240
was really a wonderful

00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:46,880
insight into this exciting new company

00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,720
