00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,040
hi everyone and thank you for joining us

00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,680
today

00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:16,160
i'm solana larsen i'm editor of

00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:18,480
mozilla's internet health report and

00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,639
your host for today's panel

00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,199
we have a vital discussion plan for

00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,480
today as part of our mozfest dialogues

00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:26,560
and debate series

00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,560
we're going to unpack an issue that's

00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,199
underpinning so many of the problems

00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,480
online

00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:33,519
and offline today that's data and more

00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,160
specifically

00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,279
who controls it and who gets to benefit

00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,000
from it

00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:40,720
the data that powers ai and increasingly

00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,040
society

00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,560
is often controlled by a handful of

00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:47,440
internet giants

00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,800
and their approach to data influences

00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,519
innovation throughout

00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:53,279
society from the internet startup world

00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:55,839
to the public sector

00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:56,959
and what we want to discuss today is

00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,279
what are the

00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:00,880
alternatives we're going to ask how

00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:03,680
could alternative forms

00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,880
of pooling and governing data become

00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,279
more common

00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:10,000
and how can communities be they

00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:13,519
technology consumers or workers

00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:18,000
unlock data power joining me

00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:20,720
today are dr funda ustekspilda

00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
researcher and project manager at fair

00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,959
work foundation

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
she's based in the uk she specializes in

00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:28,720
justice fairness

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,680
and ethics issues with respect to labor

00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,040
and migration

00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:36,079
and gender and studies visibilities and

00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:39,040
invisibilities of the gig economy

00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:40,800
we're also joined by asta kapoor she's a

00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,360
co-founder of the apti

00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,240
institute a public research firm based

00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,320
in india

00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,480
that examines the intersection between

00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:51,759
technology and society

00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:54,240
and asta has over 10 years of experience

00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:56,480
examining the use of digital technology

00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,880
for development and social good

00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,320
and at apti she leads work on the data

00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:04,000
economy lab

00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:06,160
a space focused on data stewardship

00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,720
in other words unlocking the value of

00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:11,040
data while safeguarding rights

00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,839
and then finally also here is mozilla

00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:15,600
fellow

00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:17,920
anuk ruhaq based in berlin like me

00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,000
anu creates new models of data

00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:22,959
governance for the public good

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,839
and as an architect and advocate of data

00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,920
trusts

00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:28,240
she promotes models that safeguard

00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:30,880
privacy and protect society from

00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,920
the negative externalities of data

00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,720
sharing

00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,000
and as a final message we're taking

00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,399
questions for this panel

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,240
in real time you can tweet them at

00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:43,440
mozilla with the hashtag

00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:45,040
dialogues and debates all written out in

00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:48,240
one

00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:50,480
all right um let's get started uh

00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,480
data and how to govern data i think

00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:55,040
that's something that easily becomes

00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,320
a little bit abstract and difficult to

00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,720
wrap your mind around

00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:01,040
so we're going to start into this topic

00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,920
uh using an example that's familiar to

00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:05,439
many people

00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:07,360
that of the gig economy and funda

00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:09,199
has prepared a couple of slides that

00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,439
she's going to introduce us to

00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:13,760
as conversation starters that will

00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:19,839
involve the whole panel

00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:19,839
over to you funda and your slides

00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:27,520
thank you very much um

00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:32,320
thank you very much everyone for tuning

00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:35,440
in today um

00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:37,840
i will um start our conversation

00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,840
with a bit of introduction to the fabric

00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:43,600
foundation where i work

00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:46,720
and um to get us started the main

00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,840
issues that we're working on at the fair

00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,160
work foundation

00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:52,320
related to data justice and governance

00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:55,679
in gig work

00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:59,120
in particular but also labor

00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:03,200
labor fair labor in in general

00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,200
if you can go to the next slide please

00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:14,080
the gig economy model is

00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:18,000
fairly established now um

00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:21,679
the ubers deliverers the just aids

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:25,600
or zomatos

00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:28,640
of the world are really well known now

00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:31,840
where the workers arranged

00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,720
on a platform um and distributed on a

00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,799
platform

00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,640
and where instead of the traditional

00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:39,760
employment structure the work is

00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:43,760
either gigified which means it's

00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:47,200
um on a peace rate basis

00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:50,960
or um it is relatively sort of

00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:54,960
uh compartmentalized into short-term

00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:56,400
tasks and um it's mediated through a

00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,440
digital platform

00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:03,679
so both the worker and the consumer

00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:07,200
client or user of that service

00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:08,799
signs into a platform and everything is

00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,840
arranged through

00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,840
various bits of data

00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:18,240
we put the arrangement of

00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,880
work on the geek economy into this this

00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,919
table

00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:23,679
where cloud work which is work that

00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:28,880
happens online

00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:32,000
from microtasks such as amazon turk or

00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,840
online translation jobs towards more

00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,679
geographically sticky jobs such as

00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:40,799
delivery or domestic work or

00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:42,880
care work or online

00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:45,200
beauty platforms and personal care

00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:48,480
services

00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:52,240
and the amount of time spent

00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:55,360
on the job is also very um

00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:57,200
and has an important bearing on how

00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,799
the employment structure traditional

00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,679
employment structure is

00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:04,159
um sort of to use the word that is often

00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:07,520
being used disrupted

00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:08,320
from um very disrupted to everything is

00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,200
broken

00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,720
down to very minute very small tasks

00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,799
where the worker does not

00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,159
have an understanding of the bigger

00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:18,960
picture at all

00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:20,400
to having it um having a control of the

00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:24,559
work

00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:28,400
entirely you can go to the next slide

00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:30,640
the important thing to pay attention to

00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,080
especially in the context of this

00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,799
webinar today

00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,679
is perhaps the preconditions of the gig

00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:39,039
economy which

00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:41,200
are um very much data mediated um

00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,480
the technologies and the data

00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:46,320
infrastructures

00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:49,360
um are the basic tenets of

00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:53,760
this newly emerging emerging

00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:57,039
type of work um the

00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:59,840
ability to scale relatively quickly

00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:01,360
both on the parts of the platforms but

00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,679
also in terms of

00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,559
the global globalization scale of the

00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:08,799
platforms

00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:10,880
um is very much related to the data

00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:12,159
harnessing power of the platforms and

00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:16,559
how they use

00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:16,559
how they collect and how they

00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:21,039
work with the data that they they

00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:24,400
collect

00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:27,679
and perhaps

00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:30,559
one thing to mention is that data

00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:32,080
and the job flexibility also goes hand

00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:35,679
in hand

00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:37,760
because with the main discourse in the

00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:40,080
gig economy being the flexibility of the

00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:42,000
jobs that the workers can

00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:44,880
tune in and tune out whenever they need

00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,919
to or they would like to work

00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,120
works sort of in tandem with the the

00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:52,159
data discourse

00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:54,720
that um they can

00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,919
decide to withhold or provide their data

00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:59,280
to these platforms

00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:02,000
easily which as

00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:03,679
confusing as the flexibility argument is

00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,799
the data argument

00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:08,880
is also very ambiguous and vague

00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:11,200
in terms of when we think about whether

00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:14,400
the workers actually have those rights

00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,440
have those capacities or capabilities to

00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,080
be able to

00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,919
give orbital their data as they as they

00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:23,120
wish

00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:26,720
so this is my general introduction

00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:29,039
um to the gig economy and the data data

00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,000
um infrastructures that we're working

00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:32,320
with

00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,280
um in the next slide i prepared some

00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:36,400
sort of fire

00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:40,159
starter topics for all the

00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:41,200
um the panelists um and um to discuss

00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:44,400
together

00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:46,720
um but if we um have

00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,240
a bit of time at the end of the webinar

00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,159
then i can talk a bit more about the

00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,799
fair work foundation and how we're

00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:53,600
interested

00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:54,559
in not only studying but also changing

00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,120
the gig economy

00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:59,280
and providing fair work um to the

00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:02,159
workers in the gig economy

00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,960
across the world thank you thank you so

00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,440
much funda

00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,320
and so this is an example where we're

00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,600
talking about

00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:11,840
a company a gig platform that

00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,039
collects data about the workers and

00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,600
controls the data

00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:17,840
and exerts power over the workers

00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:21,520
through their control of that data

00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:24,080
and so in the case of let's say drivers

00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:25,679
uber drivers or some other taxi service

00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,559
it could be

00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:29,120
controlling who has access to the to the

00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:31,840
gigs

00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:34,159
to actually be able to work it could be

00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,600
about setting the prices

00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:37,280
at different times or in different

00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:40,559
places it could be

00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:42,880
who has even shown labor um or

00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:44,640
given the opportunity to work it could

00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,240
be about

00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,320
[Music]

00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:51,120
pushing people off the platform firing

00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:53,200
them or asking them not to participate

00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,480
basically there are all these different

00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,880
hidden

00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:59,120
functions of a gig platform that take

00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,120
place

00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:03,679
and you know the worker has the phone in

00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,520
their hand they don't really know what

00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:07,440
mechanisms are at play they don't really

00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:10,000
know the ai that's at work

00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:12,559
nor have a complete picture of what kind

00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,760
of data is collected

00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:19,279
so i would love to hear

00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:21,360
from esther this is this is the type of

00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:23,919
of question that you also look at

00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:26,159
um not just from a labor rights

00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,880
perspective but also from a perspective

00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,960
of

00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,400
um you know if we have a model like this

00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:33,440
one like the gig economy

00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:35,039
or if we have a model like i guess the

00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,640
one that most people will be familiar

00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:39,520
with that are like the large

00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,480
internet platforms or social media

00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,559
companies who

00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,640
collect lots of data and make money on

00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:46,480
it what are the some of the things that

00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:49,279
you have been researching and

00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,760
and thinking about as an alternative

00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:52,960
path

00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:54,320
to this uh no thank you so much for

00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,120
having me and thank you thunder for

00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,440
laying such a

00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,799
excellent groundwork i think that we've

00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,480
also been thinking about in the same

00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:02,159
ways and you can see that

00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,240
you know it's not just researchers like

00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:06,880
us but also workers themselves right

00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,640
increasingly uh in conversations and

00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,960
strikes that have been a ton of during

00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,400
the

00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,320
lockdown and you know the pandemic

00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,640
during 2020 um

00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:16,640
there's been a realization that there's

00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,960
a certain sense of control that's

00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,480
that's uh that's exercised over the

00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,600
lives of people whether it's in the

00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,840
articulation of

00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,799
you know we want freedom from ratings

00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,720
which was

00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:28,159
something that delivery workers in india

00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,039
were articulating during a strike

00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:31,120
recently

00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:33,120
or we want greater transparency there

00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,720
are workers in the netherlands and and

00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:37,360
in the uk that are

00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,320
actively seeking greater control over

00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,799
their data and they

00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:42,080
you know using gdpr's uh data

00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:43,440
portability to

00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,279
do that there are unions that are

00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,799
getting involved so there's a broader

00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:49,919
realization that

00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:52,799
um data is a tool of

00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:53,760
exploitation and exertion of power over

00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:56,720
workers

00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:58,880
and um and that we need to think about

00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:02,159
it differently that it can't just be

00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:05,279
this relationship between the worker as

00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:07,840
a body that you know sort of is is

00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:10,960
available for data to be extracted from

00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:13,360
um and that they have to have a greater

00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:16,159
c greater ownership greater control

00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,960
greater agency and you know there are um

00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:19,919
over

00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,559
over how their data is being collected

00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:23,760
used

00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:26,799
managed what it's being used for and um

00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:29,919
and in that context we've been exploring

00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:31,600
uh models that allow uh workers on

00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:34,880
platforms to do that

00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:38,000
and trying to see how those can be um

00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:40,559
that those can be sort of expanded to be

00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,039
more widely accessible so that's what we

00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:43,279
call

00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:45,279
data stewardship broadly and there are

00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:47,200
nuances within it and lots of lots of

00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:48,240
debate about what data stewardship is

00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:52,240
and is not

00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:54,080
but um but for us it is the ability to

00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,520
unlock the value of data and of course

00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,880
there is a lot of debate about what the

00:26:55,520 --> 00:27:00,080
value of data

00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:03,600
is but to unlock the value of data for

00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:06,720
the community for public purpose

00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:08,400
and do so in a way that rights as

00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:11,120
defined by different regulations are

00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:13,360
protected but also such that

00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:14,720
the data principles or data subjects

00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,880
have a say

00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,480
in how their data is being used and

00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,440
managed and there are various

00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,559
instruments

00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:24,159
to do this and to me one of the most

00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:25,039
interesting ones that are beginning to

00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:28,960
take shape

00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:30,640
are data corporatives um that are

00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,640
and you know again in the in the labor

00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,520
movement we've seen um some of these

00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,440
driver's seat

00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:37,120
is an example that keeps coming up which

00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:41,120
is a data cooperative

00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:43,760
of drivers um which allows them to see

00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,159
you know what data has been generated by

00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,000
them

00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:48,000
in the course of their work and the

00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,640
objective is to give drivers greater

00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,360
transparency into the data that is being

00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,120
generated

00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,799
on the platforms and also give them a

00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,240
sense of um

00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:57,840
you know like you were saying solana

00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,039
like you know what kind of wages they're

00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,840
earning or how much time they're

00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:01,760
spending

00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:03,120
um when are they being tracked and when

00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,080
they're not being tracked there's a lot

00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,159
of interesting

00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,760
um interpretations at least within

00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:09,919
drivers in terms of like

00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,840
you know if i play a full game on my

00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:13,600
mobile then i'm less likely to get

00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:15,200
rides for instance so everybody

00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,360
interprets um

00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:19,440
that the the way they are controlled by

00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:21,520
data differently so it gives drivers

00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,200
greater visibility into what data is

00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,880
being collected about them

00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,399
and then also simultaneously i guess

00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,520
because sustainability of these models

00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:30,960
is a big question

00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:33,279
it also um you know

00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,480
monetizes this data makes it available

00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:36,799
to municipalities

00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,640
unlocks it for quote-unquote public

00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:40,559
value and distributes

00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,000
um a chunk of the profits back to the

00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:43,679
drivers so it's an

00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,360
interesting model to start thinking

00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:46,880
about it it may not be perfect it may

00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:50,000
not it's just a starting point

00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:53,360
but there are alternatives that empower

00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:56,159
um geek economy workers to be

00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,799
bigger participants in their in their

00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:00,000
data

00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:02,159
lives and sort of move just and you know

00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,120
move up the participation matter not

00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:05,520
just be

00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,720
as as people that are you know sort of

00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,320
being um

00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,840
exploited and manipulated but actually

00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,840
being informed and actually

00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,360
over time having a seat at the table and

00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:15,120
being part of the sort of decision

00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:18,000
making

00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,799
thank you esther yeah this this example

00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,120
that you mentioned

00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:22,960
is is one that we chose to use as a

00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,159
spotlight topic for the internet health

00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:27,679
report

00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:30,480
how how to unlock uh data power

00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:32,320
um using the example of of drivers in

00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,480
this case but also participants

00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:36,640
in the gig economy as they call it but

00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,559
people who use these gig platforms

00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,919
you know it sounds really nice like oh

00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:41,360
well then the workers will have their

00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:43,039
data and then

00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:44,799
they'll be able to use it for lots of

00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:47,039
things again it's like one of these

00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:49,679
things that at the theoretical level

00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:50,399
is is interesting to talk about but then

00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:52,480
when

00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:54,000
um you talk to people who are trying to

00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,960
do this in practice

00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,640
as we do in the health report you

00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:02,399
realize that once you start

00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:04,960
building an app that is meant to collect

00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:07,039
data from lots of different people

00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,480
who are using different platforms and

00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:12,159
different phones

00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:13,679
at different times um you run into all

00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:16,559
these different issues not just

00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:17,120
technical issues of how do you get the

00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:19,520
data

00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:21,360
into which kind of spreadsheet and how

00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:24,880
do you make that data

00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:26,080
um behave in a way that's even useful

00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:29,200
for people to

00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:32,640
to gain learnings from then you also run

00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:34,320
into a lot of legal problems and maybe

00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,360
privacy problems and i know a nuke

00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:38,320
that's something that

00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,960
you're um an expert on and i'd love to

00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:42,240
hear

00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:44,880
um yes your reactions to to the panel

00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:46,720
conversation so far

00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,240
yes thank you so much and thank you for

00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:52,240
having me um

00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:54,640
yeah when i was listening um to all the

00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:56,240
great contributions um and it's been so

00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,080
interesting so far i

00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,480
i think that the thought that popped up

00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:01,679
for me is uh it's really important to

00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,559
start with

00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:06,240
um the question of power and real

00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:08,080
balancing power rather than with the

00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,480
question of data and what i mean by that

00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,360
is

00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,480
the goal is not for workers to get data

00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:15,039
about themselves

00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,760
the goal for workers is to have more

00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,600
power

00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:19,120
so they can stand up to the people that

00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,120
employ them

00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:22,799
and i think we see this happen in a lot

00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:26,320
of conversations about data

00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:28,559
it's um basically that

00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:30,559
the collection of data and the use of

00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:32,960
these various new technologies

00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:34,640
that for instance allow for jobs to be

00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:37,200
cut into smaller jobs

00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:39,360
and to kind of contextualize work so

00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,799
that it becomes easier to swap out one

00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,720
gig worker for another

00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:44,640
which obviously benefits the company way

00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:48,240
more than it does to get worker

00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:50,399
um but those things exist and

00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:52,320
happened in a situation where there was

00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:52,799
already an enormous imbalance of power

00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,039
between

00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:56,399
corporations and workers like that's not

00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:58,399
a new thing that's the thing that

00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:59,440
predates the data that predates these

00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:01,279
technologies

00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,960
what these technologies allow companies

00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:05,279
to do is exploit

00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:07,200
more to have to basically consider

00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:11,519
consolidate their power and

00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:14,320
um extract more value from the workers

00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:15,360
as they go and so the underlying

00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:19,200
question is

00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:21,039
not just how do we make sure that

00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:24,000
this part of the problem is solved and

00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:25,440
that we allow workers to gain access to

00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,399
their data so they can start to

00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,480
understand

00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:30,320
how these algorithms are managing them

00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,039
and how they are making decisions about

00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:33,919
them

00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:34,799
um but we need to also take a step back

00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:37,039
and ask

00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:38,960
hey do we even think it's a good idea

00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:40,159
for corporations to have this much power

00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,640
about their workers

00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:44,640
and if not do we want to maybe organize

00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:46,159
our economy in a different way

00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:48,960
um and there's some very obvious

00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:51,279
examples here of worker co-ops

00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:53,120
where workers share ownership of the

00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:54,720
company rather than the company

00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,320
controlling all the assets and the

00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,880
capital um and

00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:00,720
but there are other examples and and

00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,960
various other models as well

00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,760
um and the reason i bring this up is it

00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:06,320
goes

00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:08,000
it also goes towards how easy it is to

00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:10,320
achieve the data goals

00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,880
um because in a situation where the

00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:14,960
power dynamic is this out of balance

00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,320
it actually becomes really hard to do

00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,880
the things that

00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:20,720
um organizations like worker info

00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:24,000
exchange for instance try to do

00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:25,679
so what they try to do is um fight on

00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,080
behalf of uber workers

00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:29,200
to get their data from uber so that they

00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:31,519
can understand

00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:33,360
how those algorithms are working against

00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:35,440
the workers and then go to court

00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:36,960
to say hey this should never happen

00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,519
someone should never be

00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,080
accused of fraud based on some fuzzy

00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:42,559
data

00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,840
and some algorithm that made a weird

00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:45,760
decision one day

00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:47,519
and that should never happen and you can

00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,080
fight that in court but uber is super

00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:50,240
powerful

00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:52,080
they don't want to give that data and so

00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:54,720
you end up with long prologue

00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,440
chord battles just to get the data out

00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,960
of uber

00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,720
now i'm not saying this isn't important

00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,679
it's super important work and we need to

00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,000
be doing it

00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:04,640
um but we need to see this as part of a

00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:08,320
larger context and not as the

00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:11,040
ultimate goal of data stewardship um

00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:13,200
yeah i will leave here i can talk a lot

00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:16,639
more about this

00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:17,599
how how central is data to the work that

00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:19,280
you're doing

00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:20,639
and data rights i should say data and

00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,639
data rights to the work that you're

00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:24,480
doing at the fair work foundation which

00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:27,839
is so

00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:30,879
focused on yeah helping organize

00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:34,399
organize resistance to

00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:36,399
labor abuse in the gig economy um

00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:37,679
it is very central and i'm going to

00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:40,320
follow up

00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:42,560
from where anuk started the discussion

00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:45,200
basically this unequal relationship

00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:46,399
between the platforms and the workers in

00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:49,679
terms of

00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:52,960
how data is collected and uh the say

00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:55,839
workers have um in what kind of data

00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:58,320
uh it is being collected about them and

00:34:55,839 --> 00:35:00,720
how that data is then used

00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,640
for or against them and one example i

00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:05,040
can give is for instance

00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,079
um there are a couple of platforms that

00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:09,839
we have studied

00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:12,320
um in the past year where

00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:14,480
this power imbalance was so obvious and

00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:16,640
it's scaled up to such an extent that it

00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,640
would not be possible if the platforms

00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:22,240
did not have the state of power

00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:25,920
and the example i'm going to give is

00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:28,160
related to the worker

00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,960
protests last year that happened in

00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:31,680
india

00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,960
especially in bangalore where a couple

00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:35,680
of

00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:37,680
platforms were able to determine which

00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:39,200
workers actually participated in the

00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:41,680
protests based on

00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:43,119
where they were logged in on the day and

00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:47,200
then they were able to

00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:52,320
collectively um either um

00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:55,599
sort of lock them out from the platforms

00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:58,320
or take back their incentives or their

00:35:55,599 --> 00:36:01,520
accrued benefits on the platforms

00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:03,280
regardless of the fact that um

00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:05,760
whether or not they were in that

00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:07,359
location for protesting or they were

00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,359
actually there for work

00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:12,000
or they were happening to be just

00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:15,119
passing out passing by that location

00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:19,280
so this kind of uh power

00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:22,400
and control could not be imagined before

00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:24,000
um because of it it is because of data

00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:27,200
that the

00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:29,760
platforms are able to harness this power

00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:31,599
and it is for um for this reason it is

00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:34,240
central to

00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:36,160
our work as well because um it really

00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:39,359
ties into the fair conditions

00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:40,480
and fair management of um of the

00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:42,480
platforms and of the

00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:44,079
the fair conditions for the workers on

00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:47,359
these platforms

00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:47,839
um and when we're talking about data

00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:51,040
we're

00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:53,599
um very critical about the consent

00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:54,640
uh sort of the the so-called consent

00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:57,680
that the

00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:58,960
workers have when they are signing up to

00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:02,000
these platforms to

00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:05,440
to work on them um this consent is

00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:09,280
um is a very sort of unequal one

00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:11,680
and it's a very um

00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:14,400
sort of questionable one because if a

00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:17,520
worker needs to sign up to a platform to

00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,400
to get work can he or she really

00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:21,520
question

00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:22,079
um whether or not they are they are okay

00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,480
with

00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:26,000
their data being collected in that way

00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,599
um one example

00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,040
one other example i would like to give

00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:31,599
is that um in

00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:32,400
some some countries for instance the

00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:36,079
apps

00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:38,320
that are the worker facing apps

00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:39,280
for signing up to these platforms are

00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:42,400
actually not even

00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:45,599
on the official app stores they are

00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:47,599
in uh sort of unofficial um download

00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:50,640
sites where the workers need to go in

00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:52,000
and download the pla platform apps to to

00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:54,720
sign up to the platforms

00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,280
and enter their data these because they

00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:58,480
are

00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:01,119
on unofficial um sort of app stores

00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:02,000
um there are lots of issues related to

00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:06,160
security

00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:10,400
privacy of data collection and often

00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:13,760
it's very difficult for the workers um

00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:16,560
you know let alone other people who

00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,960
are sort of studying this to understand

00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,440
the

00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,480
repercussions of using these uh

00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:24,079
unofficial

00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:27,839
um data apps because um

00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:27,839
in terms of you know um

00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:32,640
what is and in terms of you know what is

00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:36,160
available for us to understand

00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:39,359
um there's very limited information

00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:41,920
um we can't really track what the

00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:45,200
uh these apps do what kind of data they

00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:47,599
collect once they're downloaded on the

00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:49,359
on workers phones um so it's sort of

00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:51,440
some there's some information that they

00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:52,160
can track certain for instance if the

00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:55,599
workers

00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,839
are uh multiple you know um they're sort

00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:58,320
of

00:38:55,839 --> 00:39:00,240
uh using multiple apps for multiple

00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:04,480
platforms sort of you know they are

00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:06,800
um reacting with many platforms so that

00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:08,480
then they can say no you're not an

00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:10,240
employee or you're not really working on

00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,839
this platform you're working for many

00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:14,720
platforms so we're going to not

00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:18,480
necessarily give you these benefits

00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:20,240
so in terms of this power structure i

00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:23,040
think i will come back to

00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:24,240
the point anuk mentioned the um the

00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:27,599
power imbalance

00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:28,000
is perhaps the key to study in this sort

00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:30,320
of

00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,200
to to look at in this um data

00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:34,640
relationship

00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:36,480
and to understand how uh we can actually

00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:39,680
empower workers because

00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,400
data portability as an idea is a good

00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:43,280
one

00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,839
but what will we then do with that data

00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:47,359
once

00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:50,000
you know um the platform gives it to us

00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:51,119
and can we actually trust the platforms

00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,920
that they're going to give

00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:55,040
us the data that they actually have

00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:58,079
collected about

00:39:55,040 --> 00:40:00,800
us in in its full form because

00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:01,359
um even in the gdpr context there are so

00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,480
many

00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:07,599
sort of um subtext and small font

00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:08,160
details where um the platforms can say

00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:10,720
that

00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:11,680
yes but that part of the data links to a

00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:14,000
confidential

00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:15,200
um data of the platform which we can't

00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,319
disclose

00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:22,240
and um unless

00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:25,440
there is a specific court case

00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:28,400
can workers or um

00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:29,200
unions or research organizations like

00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:32,480
ourselves

00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:34,720
uh can we demand this data and if we do

00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:36,400
can we actually do anything with it so

00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:37,520
you know these questions are still very

00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,079
open-ended

00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:41,359
and i think for context i should say i

00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:43,200
mean people might be

00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:44,960
watching and saying well i'm not a i'm

00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:47,359
not a gig worker or

00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,480
i don't drive for uber why should i care

00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:50,480
about these things

00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:52,079
and i think the thing that i realized

00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:54,160
reading the work of the fair work

00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:56,079
foundation which is extremely global in

00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:57,359
nature and involves researchers all

00:40:56,079 --> 00:41:00,480
around the world

00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:02,079
is that gig platforms are everywhere

00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,839
there isn't any region in the world

00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:07,119
where this isn't huge

00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:09,760
and so the types of practices that you

00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:10,480
may have learned of or heard of from

00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:13,440
uber

00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:14,560
are also employed by companies um that

00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:17,440
have origins

00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:19,040
all over the world so it isn't just a

00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:21,119
silicon valley

00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:23,280
company thing it's something that has

00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:24,880
spread and it's not just about driving

00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,960
as funda explained in the beginning

00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:28,480
it's in lots of different sectors and

00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:31,640
this kind of behavior

00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:32,800
of using data for the essentially the

00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:36,240
commodification

00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:38,319
of labor is something that extends

00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:39,599
not just to the gig economy but to so

00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:41,839
many other parts

00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:44,319
of the economy so you have other types

00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:44,960
of labor now beyond the gig economy that

00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:48,000
are also

00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:50,560
organized in this way um you have

00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,839
you know now in in covid times you have

00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:55,040
companies who are using

00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:57,040
many more surveillance and productivity

00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:59,119
tools to monitor workers

00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:01,040
not just people who are working at home

00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:02,160
on their computers but also warehouse

00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:05,680
workers and

00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:09,359
i mean basically this this way of using

00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:12,480
data to organize labor is something that

00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:15,599
just seeps throughout society

00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:18,079
in in a similar way that we know that

00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:18,960
the way that the big uh internet

00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:20,800
platforms

00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:23,119
or the amazons or the googles of the

00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:26,480
world the way that they deal with

00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:28,400
data influences how people think about

00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:29,760
their opportunities for making money

00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:33,280
online or

00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:35,280
you know it's basically it it seeps into

00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,960
every aspect of our life right now which

00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,160
is why it's so important that we start

00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:41,680
to think about

00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:44,240
alternatives and trying to think of ways

00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:45,359
where alternatives could also begin to

00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:48,240
seep into

00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:49,359
places beyond where they were first um

00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:51,280
intended for

00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:52,640
um so these small examples that we've

00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:54,560
talked about um

00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:55,680
where the the drivers are gathering

00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:59,040
their data in

00:42:55,680 --> 00:43:00,400
one specific part of the world can we

00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:02,720
imagine

00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:05,760
futures where these kinds of things are

00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:08,160
adopted in other contexts as well

00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:11,119
and as i wonder the work that you're

00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:13,119
doing is very much forward thinking

00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:14,240
in terms of trying to think about what

00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:16,400
what the future could

00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:17,839
hold and how you even think of you call

00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:22,160
it data stewardship

00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:25,200
um new ways of of governing data

00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:28,560
what do we do for for become

00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:28,880
more more of a thing that's known no i

00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,480
mean

00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:32,240
again going back to what anu said it is

00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:35,200
about power and i think what the

00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:37,200
what the data economy broadly does is it

00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:38,000
individualizes and atomizes our

00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:41,280
experience

00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:44,640
in in a very clear way so you know in in

00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:46,240
and the workers are an example of of how

00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:48,720
that happens which is that

00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:50,720
you know your shared spaces are lost

00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:51,680
your shared experiences are seemingly

00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:55,119
lost but they're not

00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:57,040
actually lost um and and also um

00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:58,720
you know as anu mentioned and you know

00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:00,720
even the sort of

00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:03,200
cases that are happening where each

00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:06,160
worker is going and trying to

00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:06,880
sort of uh lay claim to their data

00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:09,640
against an

00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:11,359
uber or an ola or grab at an

00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:14,400
individualized level

00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:17,359
so um i think that what

00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:18,079
what ideas of stewardship or models of

00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:20,160
stewardship

00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:21,599
actually do and they're very nascent and

00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:25,040
they're still developing

00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:28,480
is help collectivize that experience and

00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:31,839
you know helps workers or even groups of

00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:34,400
users collectively bargain on

00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:35,680
better data rights and better data

00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:37,920
rights could mean

00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:39,680
you know greater transparency greater

00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:43,599
accountability and these are all

00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:46,400
you know sort of modes or mechanisms to

00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:48,560
rebalance power in a certain kind of way

00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:50,240
and we're seeing this in in all sorts of

00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:51,119
ways you know so driver's seat is one

00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:52,560
example

00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:54,240
um there's a lot of work that's

00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:56,480
happening in the health sector

00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:57,760
which is also you know an area where

00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:00,560
people feel like

00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:02,480
data is being extracted exploited we

00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:04,319
don't necessarily know and also again

00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:05,760
like in the context of gig economy

00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:08,000
workers you're also

00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:09,119
at a complete disadvantage when you're

00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,760
interacting with your healthcare

00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:11,359
provider

00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:13,680
you know you will give them whatever

00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:16,319
data they ask for because you know

00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:18,079
that's what's required of the moment but

00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:19,520
how that data has been used whether it's

00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:21,359
being used for

00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:22,960
issues that you care about research that

00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:23,760
you care about innovation that you may

00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:26,960
care about

00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:29,280
all of that is stuff that is currently

00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:30,960
not something that data subjects or

00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:32,720
principles are a part of

00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:34,400
so there's a lot of work that's also

00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:36,960
happening in the health sector on how to

00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:38,560
organize groups of patients of people of

00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:40,240
interested communities

00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:42,240
around questions of data so that they

00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:44,720
can actively participate

00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:46,480
in how their health data is being used

00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:50,000
but all of this to say that

00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:50,240
to me stewardship and different forms of

00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,520
it

00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:53,920
and data trusts cooperatives unions are

00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:57,920
all

00:45:53,920 --> 00:46:00,560
ways in which uh you you sort of break

00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:01,760
these isolated atomized experiences of

00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:05,359
the gig economy

00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:07,040
and find ways to collectivize and build

00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:08,480
um communities and i know facebook is

00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:10,640
sort of like taking the

00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:11,520
building communities idea away from us a

00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:13,680
little bit but

00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:15,839
you know build communities of data that

00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:18,640
have shared experiences that have shared

00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:19,520
interest you know and and and use

00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:21,920
those

00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:22,960
those communities to bargain to to

00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:25,760
slowly

00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:26,960
reclaim power or try to rebalance power

00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:28,640
in the data economy

00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:30,560
and that can look different things for

00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:33,200
different people right like some people

00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:34,960
may want um greater participation on

00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:37,520
decision making and that's fine

00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:38,880
some people may just want a trusted

00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:41,119
intermediary to decide

00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:42,079
on their behalf and that's also fine but

00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:45,040
giving people the

00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:45,920
option and giving people the the tools

00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:47,760
to engage

00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:49,119
um in the data economy in a more

00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:51,520
equitable and a more

00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:52,160
accessible and in a manner that gives

00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:55,520
them

00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:59,119
greater agency is the is the idea behind

00:46:55,520 --> 00:47:01,280
data stewardship and of course i said

00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:02,240
you know sort of unlock the value of

00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:05,119
data but

00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:06,640
to think of value not just as you know

00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:10,240
monetary value but

00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:12,560
value as user agency value as

00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:14,240
governance you know and transparency

00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:16,319
value as accountability

00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:17,839
um i think those are all important i

00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:19,760
think that when we think of value we

00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:20,240
have a very narrow definition that has

00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:22,079
been

00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:24,559
defined for us by platforms at the

00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:26,319
moment but i think that thinking of

00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:28,079
value as more distributed as more

00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:30,480
democratic is also

00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:31,280
the role of um of data stewards and

00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:33,920
across

00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:35,200
you know disciplines you know

00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:38,160
geographies uh

00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:39,760
and uses um and they can you know have

00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:41,520
different uses in different

00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:43,040
for and you could be as an individual

00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,920
part of different data stewards you

00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:46,319
could be part of

00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:47,599
a data cooperative for your work and you

00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:49,760
could be part of

00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:51,520
another instrument um for another part

00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:53,119
of your life and it should allow for

00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:55,520
that

00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:57,760
and i'm going to turn to you i know you

00:47:55,520 --> 00:48:00,319
have lots to say on this topic

00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:02,160
and we have also on twitter a bit of a

00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:05,839
there was a comment about

00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:07,119
um a favorite topic of yours i know

00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:09,599
related to

00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:10,559
um being paid for data i mean when we

00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:13,280
think about

00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:14,480
value as esther was talking about it and

00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:17,520
we talk about

00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:18,480
data as a common good does that somehow

00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:20,480
contradict

00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:22,079
data as an individual good or something

00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:24,079
that you individually own or as a

00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:28,319
commercial good

00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:31,680
help us untangle this

00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:34,720
oh there's so much to say here um

00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:37,760
let me choose my words wisely um

00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:40,880
yeah so there is a lot of talk about

00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:41,760
oh wait a minute if companies are making

00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:44,160
profiting of

00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:45,839
our data then instead of companies

00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:48,720
profiting of our data

00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:50,800
why don't we get a share of the profits

00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:53,760
um

00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:55,040
and there are situations where that

00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:58,000
seems to make sense

00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:59,680
um i think some examples like driver

00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:02,800
seats for example where they

00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:05,359
collect data on a whole group of drivers

00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:07,359
then make an actual data set out of it

00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:09,119
that's useful for a third party

00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:11,040
so they add value to the data because

00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:13,680
data on its own raw data is

00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:14,160
not super valuable so they actually

00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:15,920
create

00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:17,359
a product out of it and then that

00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:19,119
product is or

00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:20,800
the profits on that product are

00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:23,520
cooperatively owned

00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:25,200
so that for me seems like one of the

00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:28,559
best or the better models

00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:30,720
of earning money for data but it takes

00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:32,640
one step back is really the question

00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:33,119
like what problem are we trying to solve

00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:35,040
here

00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:36,640
are we trying to solve the problem of

00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:37,920
companies are getting money and we are

00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:40,720
not getting any money

00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:43,119
or are we trying to solve the far more

00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:46,400
complicated problems of

00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:49,520
um like first of all this problem of

00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:52,240
the gig economy it is giving

00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:54,240
drivers some data some money for their

00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:56,160
data gonna really solve the problems

00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:58,319
that we've just laid out which are

00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:59,680
far more complicated than oh here's 10

00:49:58,319 --> 00:50:02,480
euros extra a month

00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:02,880
right like it's not gonna fundamentally

00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:04,800
shift

00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:06,400
the imbalance in power that is in

00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:07,359
existence today and that's true in a lot

00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:09,760
of other spaces

00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:11,280
as well so for me it's about that

00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:12,160
question like what is the problem we're

00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,839
trying to solve

00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:16,160
and i see when i look at data

00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:18,480
stewardship so i usually don't

00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:19,599
talk too much about should we get money

00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:21,680
for data or not

00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:22,880
i kind of sidestep that question a

00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:25,599
little bit and ask

00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:27,760
rather like okay how can a data steward

00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:30,800
how can data stewardship models

00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:32,079
help us either collectively get more

00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:34,480
bargaining power

00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:36,319
or also us individually where that makes

00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:37,440
sense because sometimes data really is

00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:40,240
individual

00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:41,839
um individually to make sense of the

00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:45,440
world and help us navigate

00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:47,760
this tricky tricky landscape um

00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:49,440
and i see sort of like yeah i think we

00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:50,960
spend a lot of time figuring out the

00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:53,839
defensive approaches

00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:55,440
but there is another whole other side uh

00:50:53,839 --> 00:50:57,520
to this story where

00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:59,280
rather than just saying okay let's make

00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:02,000
sure all those harms don't happen

00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:04,000
like utopia is not just the absence of

00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,400
harm it's also us collectively figure

00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,319
out

00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:07,680
what the what we want the world to look

00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:09,359
like and it's not just

00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:11,680
what we want the data world to look like

00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:14,400
it's what we want our lives to be

00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:15,440
what do we want our societies to be and

00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:17,520
so

00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:19,440
that question becomes about a lot more

00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:21,760
than who gets value about the data

00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:24,160
that's currently collected it even it

00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:26,160
goes one step before that asking what

00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:28,240
data should even be collected

00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:30,720
but also how do i want to be seen in the

00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:32,720
world what is what data is relevant for

00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:34,160
me rather than relevant to uber

00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:36,160
because one of the questions that isn't

00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:38,400
solved right now is that um

00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:40,319
you could ask uber for your data you

00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:42,559
could get your data from uber

00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:44,480
but that's how uber sees you right

00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:46,800
that's the data that uber filed

00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:48,640
was relevant for uber it's not

00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:50,079
necessarily the data that you think is

00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:53,040
relevant for you for you

00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:54,720
to make your life a better life or for

00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:57,520
your community to make

00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:59,200
it better um and so we're seeing some

00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,920
really cool initiatives around the world

00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:02,960
where

00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:04,319
citizens are collecting data about

00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:06,319
themselves um

00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:07,359
because sensors are increasingly cheaper

00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:10,240
so you can

00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:12,160
send um people out into the world and

00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:14,480
collecting the data that they need

00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:16,160
for their lives and that could look like

00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:19,280
local pollution levels

00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:22,720
measured by within neighborhoods by

00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:23,440
local citizens themselves um that could

00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:26,240
look like

00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:28,160
people in community houses understanding

00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:30,240
how to

00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:32,000
live a better life within the context of

00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:33,599
that house but then there's obviously a

00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,040
real risk that when people start

00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:35,760
collecting that data that they want to

00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:37,680
collect

00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:39,839
that there is still that can still be

00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:41,680
captured and exploited by companies

00:52:39,839 --> 00:52:44,160
and so i think that's an other way for

00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:46,720
data stewardship to be super important

00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:48,640
uh to step in and to be like okay we we

00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:50,720
collect this data we have

00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:52,319
so we have control from like the first

00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:54,319
step from the collecting from the

00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:55,119
designing of the experiments we want to

00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:57,760
do

00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:58,559
uh but then we also find mechanisms to

00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:00,640
ensure that we

00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:02,079
keep control over the data and that we

00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:03,760
have agency to decide

00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:05,839
who gets to see what and under what

00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:07,119
conditions so i know this was a whole

00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:09,920
long story

00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:11,920
but it's really to say like just kind of

00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:14,000
collapsing this entire

00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:15,599
complex debate into should people get

00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:18,640
paid for their data or not

00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:21,200
to me kind of misses the points um

00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:23,359
and just to add as a side note so much

00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:26,079
of the our data is not just about

00:53:23,359 --> 00:53:28,079
one person it's about entire societies

00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:29,119
and so much of the impact of data being

00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:31,839
collected

00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:34,000
in kind of a massive way is collective

00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:35,440
it's felt by society at large it impacts

00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,520
our democracies

00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:39,359
um and so just saying well these

00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:42,079
individuals you get some money for it

00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:44,720
is it's just not comparable to the

00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:47,280
problem we're trying to solve

00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:49,520
thanks very much that was that was quite

00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:52,720
masterful to pack so much

00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:55,760
into into such a brief comment

00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:56,000
um i know you have you have reactions to

00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:58,559
this

00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,800
i'm sure and i'm wondering also as

00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:04,160
somebody who works with a specific

00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:06,319
community or population of workers

00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:07,760
at what point do initiatives like the

00:54:06,319 --> 00:54:09,440
ones that we're talking about

00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:11,280
that are trying to solve the types of

00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:13,680
problems that we're talking about

00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:16,079
how do they become things that people

00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:18,720
themselves are genuinely in control of

00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:20,559
and not just one where a company or an

00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:24,160
organization is saying something

00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:28,400
on behalf of them

00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:30,880
um that's actually a very good question

00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:31,520
and uh it's not it's not an easy one to

00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:36,160
answer

00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:39,280
um as nuke mentioned um the data metrics

00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:40,400
are still defined and controlled by the

00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:43,760
platforms

00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:45,839
and that means that um the value

00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:47,839
that is attributed to different bits of

00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:50,960
data is going to be still

00:54:47,839 --> 00:54:52,480
set by the platforms so how do we sort

00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:55,200
of change

00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:56,319
that mindset you know how do how can

00:54:55,200 --> 00:55:00,000
workers

00:54:56,319 --> 00:55:03,040
um and enter and intervene and say

00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:06,079
no this is actually not um the whole

00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:07,119
story that matters we can rewrite and

00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:09,839
re-narrate

00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:10,640
what is being told about us and one way

00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:12,740
of doing this

00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:13,839
is uh perhaps looking at

00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:17,920
[Music]

00:55:13,839 --> 00:55:18,319
the time uh and have um inform have data

00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:20,799
about

00:55:18,319 --> 00:55:22,000
time record time on these platforms is

00:55:20,799 --> 00:55:25,040
being collected

00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:28,000
and what happens to that time

00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:31,359
and this happens to especially i mean

00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:34,240
we've been talking about delivery and

00:55:31,359 --> 00:55:36,240
taxi ride share workers but especially

00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:38,160
in the cloud work context where the work

00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:40,799
happens online we see this

00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:43,040
um time and time again in micro task

00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:46,319
platforms and macro task platforms

00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:49,760
where each task is

00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:53,359
sort of time measure time stamped

00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:56,640
but then workers time waiting for

00:55:53,359 --> 00:56:00,319
jobs on um bidding for these uh

00:55:56,640 --> 00:56:03,440
jobs or waiting until they get their

00:56:00,319 --> 00:56:06,160
their payments this is not necessarily

00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:07,200
taken into account by their platforms

00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:10,400
even though

00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:12,640
um they do spend time on this

00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:13,680
um so we have been carrying out a cloud

00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:17,040
work survey

00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:19,200
um across the world um and with

00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:21,520
um sever with several hundred workers

00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:24,720
cloud work workers across the world

00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:28,240
and our survey for instance shows that

00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:30,880
um even though

00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:32,640
it changes really between a lot of

00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:35,839
between different platforms

00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:38,480
um still a significant chunk

00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:39,200
of workers time is spent looking for

00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:42,079
jobs

00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:45,440
rather than on the jobs um so for

00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:48,240
instance one way of sort of you know

00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:50,160
disrupting this thinking about how the

00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:50,880
data metrics are established by the

00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:54,799
platforms

00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:58,000
is perhaps workers to um

00:56:54,799 --> 00:57:00,640
create another sort of data metric where

00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,160
um their the amount of time they spend

00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:05,680
on the platforms

00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:07,920
is it also includes their time

00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:09,520
spent looking for jobs or in between

00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:11,040
jobs and this applies to

00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:12,880
again both cloud work and also

00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:14,960
geographically tailored work

00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:17,119
and this is something we've been trying

00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:20,160
to do at fair work as well so

00:57:17,119 --> 00:57:23,119
um our criteria for fair pay

00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:23,920
does include not only time spent doing

00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:26,480
the jobs

00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:27,119
but also in between the jobs so sort of

00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:29,520
you know for

00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:30,799
a delivery worker when they actually log

00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:33,520
into platform

00:57:30,799 --> 00:57:33,920
saying that they're ready to accept jobs

00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:36,640
uh

00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:37,599
until they log out instead of um just

00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:41,359
taking one

00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:43,359
um one sort of um

00:57:41,359 --> 00:57:44,799
food package to somewhere and that's the

00:57:43,359 --> 00:57:47,520
amount they spent on

00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:48,160
a particular ride um the kind of

00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:51,200
thinking

00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:53,200
is actually very simple here you know

00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:55,440
when you go to a restaurant you don't

00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:56,480
expect the restaurant the waitress or a

00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:59,440
waiter in the

00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:00,160
restaurant to be paid only for the time

00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:02,799
they

00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:04,799
bring your food from the kitchen to your

00:58:02,799 --> 00:58:07,760
your

00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:09,359
table you you expect that for the time

00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:10,319
that they are in the restaurant they're

00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:12,559
paid for that

00:58:10,319 --> 00:58:13,920
whereas the gig economy is sort of you

00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:16,000
know um

00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:18,160
because it is compartmentalizing and

00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,839
breaking the tasks into so many

00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:22,880
individual and little

00:58:19,839 --> 00:58:26,480
um time blocks um

00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:28,400
is trying to say that your work

00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:29,839
happens only when you're actually on the

00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:32,880
work rather than

00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:36,880
when you are at work in general

00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:39,520
so um what i'm trying to say

00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:41,200
is that the data metrics need to be

00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:44,240
challenged whether it's

00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:46,319
um the time spent at work or

00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:47,599
whether it's the location data that is

00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:52,000
collected about

00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:54,480
the workers because um there are so many

00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,680
um there are so many examples and

00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:57,760
evidence basically

00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:59,440
that it shows that platforms collect

00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:02,640
data sort of non-stop

00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:05,200
um so that it is impossible to turn

00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:06,480
turn it off that they collect they

00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:08,640
continue

00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:11,040
running in the background as long as

00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:15,040
workers are logged into these platforms

00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:17,920
um or it's about their incentive levels

00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:19,359
as long it's about how many different

00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:21,200
apps they've been working with how long

00:59:19,359 --> 00:59:24,000
they've been on these platforms

00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:25,440
and finally it's their right to be

00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:28,799
forgotten as well

00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:31,760
once they stop working these platforms

00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:33,760
can they actually say no delete my data

00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:36,319
too and i do not want to

00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:37,680
my data to be collected harnessed or

00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:41,680
analyzed

00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:45,040
once i am off from these platforms so

00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:49,599
basically there is a lot of data

00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:52,400
information going out there is out there

00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:52,880
but what the the workers can do with it

00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:56,000
and

00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:58,799
how they can understand

00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:01,119
how these data infrastructures are

00:59:58,799 --> 01:00:04,240
running behind

01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:07,680
and what they can do about it

01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:10,240
is i think it still requires um

01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:10,880
a lot more sort of thinking through and

01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:13,680
also

01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:15,839
a lot more information shared with the

01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:18,079
with the workers as well

01:00:15,839 --> 01:00:19,920
i think some of sever thank you and

01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:23,599
several of the points you raise i think

01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:24,240
also um bring up like a short-term

01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:27,599
memory

01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:30,240
on these topics like we we so

01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:31,839
quickly just take as a given that things

01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:35,040
are the way that they are

01:00:31,839 --> 01:00:35,680
with internet things um you know it's

01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:38,079
only been

01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:38,960
a couple of years since the ubers of the

01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:42,079
world

01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:44,160
arrived it's only been um

01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:45,359
you know not not so long since the

01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:47,599
facebooks of the world

01:00:45,359 --> 01:00:49,760
arrived or the youtubes and we just get

01:00:47,599 --> 01:00:51,200
into this mindset of oh well that's how

01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:54,319
it is that's normal

01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:56,240
and the companies invest a lot of effort

01:00:54,319 --> 01:00:58,319
into making us feel like that's

01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:59,520
normal and that's logical and that's the

01:00:58,319 --> 01:01:01,280
best way

01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:03,040
and so when we're thinking about

01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:05,839
alternatives doing something in an

01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:08,960
entirely different way

01:01:05,839 --> 01:01:11,040
i think yeah how do we how do we

01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:13,119
have a conversation where we don't

01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:15,119
always talk about the bad things that

01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:18,880
the companies are doing but

01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:19,839
begin to direct more focus and attention

01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:21,520
to

01:01:19,839 --> 01:01:22,960
you know thinking about things that we

01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:25,440
could solve

01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:27,520
as esther i know that apti institute

01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:30,400
spends a lot of time thinking about this

01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:31,359
mozilla's own newly launched data

01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:34,079
futures lab

01:01:31,359 --> 01:01:35,680
um also spent a lot of time looking at

01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:38,000
your research and those of

01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:39,520
the handful of other organizations that

01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,920
are looking at this because there really

01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:42,640
aren't

01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:43,200
a lot of groups thinking about this yet

01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:45,040
um

01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:46,640
it's it's an area where there seems to

01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:48,160
be a lot of promise

01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:49,920
but when we looked around the world to

01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:51,440
see who who is working on this who's

01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:54,799
supporting this kind of work

01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:58,000
it's still relatively quite few um

01:01:54,799 --> 01:02:00,079
so what do you think how do we start to

01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:01,680
reframe these things and maybe there are

01:02:00,079 --> 01:02:04,799
initiatives that you've seen

01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:09,280
lately that that kind of

01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:10,880
spark inspire thinking in this direction

01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:12,640
no so i mean you're absolutely right

01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:13,839
it's a very new conversation and all of

01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:15,680
us who also claim to

01:02:13,839 --> 01:02:17,359
be working on it i mean it's only been a

01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:19,039
couple of years of thinking about it so

01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:21,920
we're all learning and

01:02:19,039 --> 01:02:23,039
and that so as apti our role has been

01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:25,359
largely to

01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:26,799
um to learn from the landscape uh you

01:02:25,359 --> 01:02:28,319
know we first tried to define

01:02:26,799 --> 01:02:29,599
what data stewardship is and you know

01:02:28,319 --> 01:02:30,880
everybody who's worked on it will know

01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:32,960
that it's a battlefield

01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:34,000
uh nobody agrees with each other on what

01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:36,400
it is uh

01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,920
but but ever since we've done that we've

01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:39,520
actually started to think about like

01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:41,039
what can we learn from people who are

01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:43,599
actually building this um

01:02:41,039 --> 01:02:45,200
you know the the real models in the wild

01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:46,880
how do we learn from them how do we

01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:48,079
harness that information put it out in

01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:50,799
the public domain

01:02:48,079 --> 01:02:52,160
so that you know there's a greater

01:02:50,799 --> 01:02:54,559
awareness about

01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:56,720
alternatives are possible um there is

01:02:54,559 --> 01:02:58,960
you know you can reimagine this you can

01:02:56,720 --> 01:03:01,039
open up that conversation and there are

01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:02,160
indeed pathways to do that and here's

01:03:01,039 --> 01:03:03,200
how you think about

01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:05,200
the nitty-gritties of the

01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:06,720
decision-making in terms of you know

01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:08,720
what model works what kind of

01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:10,720
decision-making how much participation

01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:13,680
you should give people etc etc

01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:15,200
so that's one part of um what we're

01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:18,240
doing to sort of try to bring this

01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:20,720
to life the other interesting avenue is

01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:21,280
the policy sort of landscape of course

01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:24,480
um

01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:26,720
so you know the the indian um

01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:28,559
non-personal data committee report which

01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:29,680
is a cause of a lot of or sight for a

01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:31,039
lot of discussion

01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:33,280
and there's much that is you know

01:03:31,039 --> 01:03:36,160
unclear and wrong with it but does

01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:37,599
mention community data rights so it's

01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:39,200
one of the first sort of policy

01:03:37,599 --> 01:03:39,760
documents to actually come out and say

01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:42,160
that

01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:43,280
and interestingly also has a very

01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:45,920
complex

01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:46,720
role set out for a quote-unquote data

01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:49,520
trustee that

01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:49,920
helps communities realize these rights

01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:53,119
and

01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:54,400
you know helps draw again the language

01:03:53,119 --> 01:03:57,520
of value

01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:58,160
uh from their data but also to mitigate

01:03:57,520 --> 01:04:00,880
harm

01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:02,480
so it's interesting that um even as the

01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:03,119
sort of research community and the

01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:05,039
actual

01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:06,720
sort of builders of data stewardship

01:04:05,039 --> 01:04:07,359
models are sort of you know tinkering

01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:10,079
about

01:04:07,359 --> 01:04:10,880
there is a recognition on the policy

01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:12,319
level as well

01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:13,680
and of course you know the question of

01:04:12,319 --> 01:04:14,880
data is being approached from many

01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:16,480
different directions we

01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:18,079
are talking about it from a right space

01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:19,200
perspective but there's obviously a huge

01:04:18,079 --> 01:04:21,359
amount of interest

01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:23,119
in data value and sharing from the

01:04:21,359 --> 01:04:24,480
anti-trust and competition perspective

01:04:23,119 --> 01:04:26,480
there's a huge amount of interest

01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:27,520
from the data sovereignity perspective

01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:29,599
so there is

01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:30,640
you know there are different ways of

01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:34,000
approaching

01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:36,160
um the data question the

01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:37,119
the way in which individuals and

01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:40,400
communities can

01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:42,480
can have greater agency over their data

01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:43,520
but it's obviously happening at

01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:45,839
different levels

01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:46,720
but again like i mean it's a very new

01:04:45,839 --> 01:04:49,119
conversation

01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:50,079
uh we've been saying this i know anook

01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:52,559
has been saying this

01:04:50,079 --> 01:04:54,079
but is we need to test more of these

01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:57,280
models and i think

01:04:54,079 --> 01:05:00,319
that the more we build the more we do

01:04:57,280 --> 01:05:02,240
the more we learn um and and and we can

01:05:00,319 --> 01:05:04,079
actually experiment because data is not

01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:05,760
a simple thing worker data is very

01:05:04,079 --> 01:05:08,160
different from you know

01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:09,440
cctv data that is collected in malls or

01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:10,799
wherever so

01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:12,079
you know there are different data types

01:05:10,799 --> 01:05:13,359
there are different concerns there's

01:05:12,079 --> 01:05:16,400
different kinds of values

01:05:13,359 --> 01:05:16,720
questions around it and that needs you

01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:19,119
know

01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:21,119
nuances in the way that we think about

01:05:19,119 --> 01:05:24,319
sort of user

01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:24,960
led user enabled governance of it so i

01:05:24,319 --> 01:05:27,200
think that

01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:28,640
um i mean this is not much of a way do

01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:30,960
we go from your

01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:32,960
answer unfortunately sonata but i think

01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:33,680
that the idea is to do more research to

01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:36,240
more thinking

01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:38,079
and also to constantly be aware of the

01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:38,880
policy developments because invariably

01:05:38,079 --> 01:05:40,480
sometimes

01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:41,920
and particularly when there are so many

01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:43,359
interests at play the policy

01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:45,359
conversation should not get ahead with

01:05:43,359 --> 01:05:47,599
what evidence we have from the ground

01:05:45,359 --> 01:05:48,799
um so i think that all of us in the

01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:50,880
community are now

01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:52,559
sort of busying ourselves to try to

01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:54,319
create evidence and also to see how

01:05:52,559 --> 01:05:55,920
these ideas can be instantiated in

01:05:54,319 --> 01:05:58,720
existing institutions so

01:05:55,920 --> 01:06:00,400
for me i think data or rather the in

01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:03,839
structure of cooperatives

01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:04,240
is a really really ripe um sort of site

01:06:03,839 --> 01:06:06,000
for

01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:08,240
you know embedding some thinking around

01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:10,240
data because they're organized

01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:11,280
um you know groups of people that have

01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:13,039
shared experiences

01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:15,440
on certain parts of their lives and you

01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:17,119
know can you help cooperatives

01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:18,480
start thinking about data i know that

01:06:17,119 --> 01:06:19,119
there's a lot of work happening out of

01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:22,480
europe

01:06:19,119 --> 01:06:24,880
on data unions as well or rather helping

01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:27,440
unions think about data more critically

01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:30,160
so how do we also like leverage existing

01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:32,960
institutions to start having

01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:33,440
more conversations about data rights

01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:35,760
right

01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:36,480
and and that is a challenge of it isn't

01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:39,920
it because the

01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:42,160
the the data uh rights and the legal

01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:42,640
situation differs entirely from place to

01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:45,119
place

01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:46,079
um both on things like cooperatives and

01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:49,839
unions and

01:06:46,079 --> 01:06:51,119
trusts which which are encoded in law

01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:53,920
in different parts of the world but

01:06:51,119 --> 01:06:57,839
other parts not um and not known

01:06:53,920 --> 01:07:00,960
anuk um i think you might end up having

01:06:57,839 --> 01:07:02,960
the last word as as i was talking i was

01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:04,720
wondering you've been involved in a

01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:07,599
number of different experiments

01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:08,640
um on data trusts and different ways of

01:07:07,599 --> 01:07:10,240
using data

01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:11,680
when when you've been involved in

01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:14,720
experiments is there

01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:16,160
have there been ways that your mind was

01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:18,640
shifted or where you learned something

01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:21,520
really significant in a new direction

01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:22,880
um you know thinking thinking how

01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:25,200
innovation and

01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:25,920
investments and innovations might be you

01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:28,000
know what can we

01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:31,599
even expect to learn from them how how

01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:35,680
does it change our perspective on things

01:07:31,599 --> 01:07:36,160
yeah um there's so many learnings so

01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:38,640
i've

01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:39,359
been in the data world for quite a few

01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:44,480
years now

01:07:39,359 --> 01:07:46,400
um and yeah i think i started out with

01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:48,559
thinking about the kind of the

01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:51,119
collective nature of data collection and

01:07:48,559 --> 01:07:54,160
the collective impact of that data

01:07:51,119 --> 01:07:56,799
um and i feel like my learning is going

01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:58,000
kind of circular um and what i mean by

01:07:56,799 --> 01:08:00,000
that is that

01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:03,119
there are moments and periods where i'm

01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:04,960
intensely focused on the data of it all

01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:06,160
of on the questions of what can you do

01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:08,880
with data how does

01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:10,640
how do how does machine learning work

01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:12,480
what is the legal side of this like what

01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:13,280
are the legal rights i'm not a lawyer so

01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:15,599
that was a

01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:16,960
steep learning curve but what it keeps

01:08:15,599 --> 01:08:20,000
coming back to for me

01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:21,920
is that we will never win this war and

01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,560
we will never imagine a better world for

01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:24,880
ourselves

01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:26,960
when it comes to data if we fixate on

01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:29,440
the data we need to tie it to real world

01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:32,560
problems we need to tie it to real world

01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:34,719
imaginations for the future um because

01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:38,480
on its own it's not really a thing

01:08:34,719 --> 01:08:41,359
um and so what i mean by that is

01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:43,440
um yes let's look at worker data but

01:08:41,359 --> 01:08:44,400
let's look at the underlying conditions

01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:47,040
of work

01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:48,799
um and or to reframe it in a very

01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:51,359
popular phrase which is

01:08:48,799 --> 01:08:52,000
surveillance capitalism let's not

01:08:51,359 --> 01:08:54,640
completely

01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:56,960
fixate on the surveillance but also look

01:08:54,640 --> 01:09:00,960
at the underlying capitalism

01:08:56,960 --> 01:09:04,560
um and then to your earlier questions

01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:07,759
um yeah it's hard to imagine

01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:09,759
alternatives like we get very uh

01:09:07,759 --> 01:09:10,960
it's so easy for us to take the world

01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:13,600
for granted

01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:14,159
and not ask ourselves hey what does what

01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:16,799
does a

01:09:14,159 --> 01:09:19,040
different world look like and also then

01:09:16,799 --> 01:09:21,279
allow for many different answers to that

01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:22,799
question and to allow for a world in

01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:23,920
which those different answers can

01:09:22,799 --> 01:09:26,000
co-exist

01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:27,520
those those are really hard things but

01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:29,359
in order to get there we need to at

01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:30,159
least start asking like hey what do we

01:09:29,359 --> 01:09:32,239
actually wanna

01:09:30,159 --> 01:09:33,440
what is the world we wanna live in uh

01:09:32,239 --> 01:09:35,040
what is the world we want to leave

01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:37,839
behind to our children

01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:38,560
um so yeah for me what i come back to is

01:09:37,839 --> 01:09:41,199
this

01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:42,799
kind of rebalancing between defending

01:09:41,199 --> 01:09:45,759
against the worst harms

01:09:42,799 --> 01:09:47,440
making sure that when things like the

01:09:45,759 --> 01:09:49,759
geek economy happen

01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:51,199
and i'm almost like data stewardship can

01:09:49,759 --> 01:09:53,199
help there but also

01:09:51,199 --> 01:09:54,239
we can we should be able to rely on our

01:09:53,199 --> 01:09:56,880
governments

01:09:54,239 --> 01:09:58,560
to say like hey this should never happen

01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:58,880
something should just never happen and

01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:01,440
we

01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:02,000
we can discuss long and hard about data

01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:04,960
stewardship

01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:06,000
models but maybe we just bend those

01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:08,239
things all together

01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:09,040
so that's kind of the make sure that we

01:10:08,239 --> 01:10:10,560
don't

01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:12,560
burn the world where we're trying to

01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:13,840
make a better one but then at the same

01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:15,360
time imagine

01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:17,199
and then try to figure out what are the

01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:19,120
first steps to work building those

01:10:17,199 --> 01:10:19,920
imaginations and learning from those

01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:22,719
steps

01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:23,040
um and to bring it all back to data i

01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:25,280
think

01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:26,800
data stewardship has as a role to play

01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:30,159
here um

01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:31,840
by for one ensuring that people have the

01:10:30,159 --> 01:10:33,040
information and the information is

01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:34,800
symmetry that we're currently

01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:36,480
experiencing where companies have all

01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:37,280
the insights and we have very little

01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:38,880
insights

01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:40,719
that that gets solved somewhat so we

01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:42,480
actually have some agency to start

01:10:40,719 --> 01:10:45,520
imagining these things

01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:47,600
um but at the same time as we start um

01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:50,320
using new technologies for ourselves and

01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:53,360
in a way that we want that we protect

01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:55,440
um the initial intentions of those

01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:56,640
endeavors so that let's say when i start

01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:59,679
an organization

01:10:56,640 --> 01:11:01,679
working for um like

01:10:59,679 --> 01:11:03,520
trying to allow different groups to

01:11:01,679 --> 01:11:05,199
communicate to each other

01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:06,880
and i tell those groups look i'm never

01:11:05,199 --> 01:11:07,920
gonna be evil with your data i share

01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:10,159
your values

01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:12,320
that five years from now someone cannot

01:11:10,159 --> 01:11:14,640
just buy my company and

01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:16,880
um completely change the course right

01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:17,920
like we can build in those protective

01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:20,080
mechanisms and

01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:21,520
data stewardship can help us with that

01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:24,159
so once again

01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:26,480
a whole long monologue um but i hope

01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:27,280
that gives us some idea of what to do

01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:29,760
next

01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:31,679
also i would say if you are looking for

01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:34,480
more concrete ideas

01:11:31,679 --> 01:11:35,520
um head over to the data futures lab

01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:37,360
site on the museum

01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:38,880
site because we've got some actual

01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:41,199
projects that are working on these

01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:43,760
things and in the real world in a very

01:11:41,199 --> 01:11:45,760
concrete way

01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:47,040
thank you so much anuk thank you so much

01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:49,840
to all three speakers

01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:51,199
um definitely follow that work mozilla

01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:53,120
data futures lab

01:11:51,199 --> 01:11:55,280
internet health report fair work

01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:57,920
foundation apti institute

01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:59,840
um keep in touch with the speakers here

01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:00,640
and with each other on this important

01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:03,040
topic

01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:04,640
there's so much to iron out and um it's

01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:06,880
so important for people from

01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:08,000
all walks of life to be talking about

01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:11,120
this and considering

01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:14,239
what what we can do data

01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:17,199
matters uh to creating a better world

01:12:14,239 --> 01:12:19,280
um thank you so much thank you i hope

01:12:17,199 --> 01:12:22,239
you all enjoy mozfest

01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:23,760
this was solana and i'll just say
