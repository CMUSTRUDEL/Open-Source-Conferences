[Music]

travel ways planning that next

00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:56,720
intergalactic trip across the galaxies

00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:59,360
travel routine 36 chambers of comfort

00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,880
grab a wu tang and save those dollar

00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:04,840
bills y'all

00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:07,840
and lastly the real reason we're all

00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,840
here

00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:23,120
everything got frozen and janky and no

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,880
sound wu tang travel ways

00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:27,919
planning that next intergalactic trip

00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,919
across the galaxies

00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,280
so which one can we use

00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:36,400
yeah for a second i heard like two

00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:40,320
things playing at the same time

00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:42,960
yeah and then it just stopped

00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,960
yeah definitely

00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:49,840
routine traveling right now

00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:04,240
right there's no sound now because we're

00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:05,440
trying to fix it so yeah

00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,240
so what should we do should we just use

00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:11,200
this one here is that easier

00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,200
yeah let's use that one

00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:19,840
sorry getting rid of that other one yep

00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:21,919
where should we go from um

00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,960
this one is at four minutes in there so

00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:27,200
let's let's start

00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,200
there somewhere

00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:32,799
um this was the one in the pyramid was

00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:35,840
about a minute so let's start from there

00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:35,840
four minutes into that one okay

00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:39,840
yeah i think so i think we're going

00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:43,200
forward

00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:46,799
welcome counting

00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:59,840
yeah so we're already out

00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:59,840
i think so let's see

00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,919
um

00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,640
do you have any idea what actually

00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,640
happened

00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,760
i got a bit glitchy and then i got

00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:27,840
glitchy on the desktop so

00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:27,840
hold on let me switch computers

00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,440

00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:33,919
what well so i was on the desktop and

00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,840
then

00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:37,520
my stand was going but nobody was moving

00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,919
do we actually know

00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:42,400
um or what occurred to you i guess i

00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:43,679
want to find out yeah

00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,880
the sound just stopped it was like there

00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:48,720
was an echo from somebody named like uh

00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:51,200
something like uh let's see if it's

00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,200
going there

00:22:51,360 --> 00:23:09,039

faith in the future for the weight of

00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:40,400
the wackness can only be defeated

00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:42,640
by dopeness we hope that with our

00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,400
intergalactic humanitarian efforts

00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,919
we can generate enough dopeness for the

00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,520
humans to take home with them

00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:49,039

00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:59,520
rope through the roof

let's get this battle started right

00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:04,799
let's get this battle started quickly

00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:06,640
allow me to introduce fresh off the rap

00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:09,600
battle championships

00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,559
the current reigning rap battle champion

00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:15,279
the one

00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:15,279
the only razor rule for flow but

00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,039
i mean i don't hear anything

00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,840
yo guys it went silent

00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:15,840
but yeah

00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:43,840
all right

00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,960
he's the only one that can hear it i

00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,960
guess yeah

00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,919
i can't hear it

00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:57,840
i think he's getting it

00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,880
it's like you're breaking up

00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:11,760
yeah sorry can you hear no

00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:13,200
i can't hear you but it just sounds like

00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:15,520
we're on the phone and

00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,880
you're breaking up you know what i mean

00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:19,840
yeah just a bad connection

00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,840
but i feel like

00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:25,200
um i feel like darren played it but then

00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:30,159
it falls for everyone

00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:30,159
and then i tried it no sorry

00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:40,799
hold on maybe we should um hold for a

00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:43,279
second and then

00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,279
reset

00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:56,000
do a bit of test and then reset yeah

00:26:52,960 --> 00:27:07,840
i guess we could tell cornelius

00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:07,840
nobody else can hear anyone

00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:35,840
you seem to be the only one that can

00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:35,840
hear this nobody else can hear anything

00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:49,840
hey folks i am here

00:27:54,240 --> 00:28:00,640
oh hey hey what's good right now

00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:02,880
would there be an issue if somebody who

00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,880
played

00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:09,119
[Music]

00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:17,840
like it necessarily wouldn't be the case

00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:17,840
it exactly happened if someone had

00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:21,919
um because normally it should transfer

00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:22,880
ownership to someone in the room but

00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:26,559
maybe there's a

00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,559
guy that might be what happened

00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:31,200
no no sorry you met the very

00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:37,679
backstage what we're going to do is i'm

00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:40,240
going to have jonathan

00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:41,120
reset the sound play it i think what

00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,120
happened was

00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:45,279
probably when you press play when i

00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,880
press play if we get disconnected

00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:48,480
um that'll cause a glitch which will

00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,840
make it reset so

00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,480
jonathan you seem to have a solid

00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,480
connection right

00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:58,960
enjoy that again yeah sorry

00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:00,399
no it's all good um i think i think what

00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,760
might have happened is because if

00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:03,840
darien got disconnected for a moment

00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,120
when i did then it caused the sound to

00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,120
reset

00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,960
and so then some people were getting

00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,399
like their sound like i was having the

00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,440
sound play all the time and so i noticed

00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:13,760
there was a difference

00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,440
so i think if jonathan maybe if you try

00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,720
pressing play on it

00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,720
that'll get it all set for everyone at

00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,080
the same time and then

00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,240
since you have a solid connection just

00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,360
in case you know one of the flow bots

00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,480
it's not going to be on dairy and it's

00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,159
not going to be on

00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:29,279
on me and then hopefully the sound will

00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:29,279
stay solid throughout

00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:33,039
that make sense finding a track that's

00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:35,440
right here in the dj booth

00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:37,200
yeah all right i'm not going to try to

00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:40,240
touch it at all again so you'll have

00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,240
complete control of it

00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:49,919
welcome sentient beings of the universe

00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:51,520
welcome to planet nubian home to a race

00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:55,840
of hip-hop android

00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:55,840
what happened

00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:11,360
no it's definitely

00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:14,080
yeah but you could hear it i could yeah

00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:15,679
yeah great okay when it just played a

00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:19,679
second ago you could both hear it

00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:19,679
okay yeah

00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,000
it's really staticky i know you said

00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,360
it's my internet connection but now i

00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,640
know it's not just me

00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,640
no but i i'm hearing it too

00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:37,840
i can press play on this and run around

00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:37,840
and delete

00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:43,600
people on quest devices yeah but it

00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,159
wasn't

00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,679
like that before now it's better yeah

00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:49,200
you folks ended perfect yesterday so i'm

00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:51,840
not totally sure what's different today

00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,840
than yesterday

00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:56,640
i don't know i know when you have so

00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,399
many hits

00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,679
i thought we'd give it a shot and see

00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:02,840
how it goes and

00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:04,000
if it's a you know disaster then we'll

00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,679
stop

00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,039
yeah could we i'm good sorry could we

00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:11,279
not do it at the beginning though

00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:13,360
we do it where we were cutting out

00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:16,399
i don't know how do you is it hard to do

00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:19,120
the best you can y'all if not hopefully

00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:21,360
i'm just saying that again you know

00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:25,760

another night to stay tuned

00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:16,079
i just said we're gonna you know we're

00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,280
gonna have to delay it we'll reschedule

00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:18,400
for another time don't know what that

00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,960
time is going to be or when it will be

00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:23,119
but

00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:24,560
what i what i would love to do is if

00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:26,319
if it's easy enough everyone could go

00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:28,240
back to the old space

00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:29,839
from yesterday and then we can gather

00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:31,200
that i know you know you wanted a break

00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:32,960
so let's take a five and then

00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,560
go there and then just try to get a

00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:37,599
sense of like

00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:39,119
where things are broken um

00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:41,359
so i will send that email to everyone as

00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:41,359
well

00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:46,079
this is zayna hey

00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:53,599
um

00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:56,319
i might go in on desktop um

00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:59,040
yeah no problem all right christina

00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:59,040
we'll see

00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:03,839
okay

00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,599
okay

00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,560
xena is it something that we can do to

00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:19,040
um uh

00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:19,599
if we re if we do the performance again

00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,760
can we

00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:23,040
pull the rsvp list from tonight and

00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:26,319
reinvite people

00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:28,000
yeah i was gonna say if if if you all

00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:30,960
would like to

00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:33,200
reschedule we can definitely and send

00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:35,200
out communication about that

00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:37,040
um and yeah i think that would be the

00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:39,040
best thing because i think yeah

00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:40,720
you know we've probably lost the people

00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:44,000
that we've lost today

00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:45,599
for sure blair and team can

00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,440
uh figure out what's going on in the

00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:48,720
meantime and correct it

00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,560
and then we can try the performance

00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:53,680
another time yeah

00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:56,800
that sounds good um happy to do that

00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:58,960
um let's see how

00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:00,560
we can send the note about that um and

00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:02,640
then i can connect with

00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:04,160
the team afterwards and we can schedule

00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:07,440
their call

00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:10,560
okay great okay hey all right

00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:12,560
i'm i'm in the room at the moment um

00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:14,240
i i'm not sure exactly what was going on

00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:16,240
today um why it was different than

00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:19,119
yesterday because yesterday

00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:20,720
that seems like the right move right

00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:23,839
yeah yeah

00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:25,040
that sounds good i'm just gonna take the

00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:28,480
headset off and hop

00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:31,119
on email uh

00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:32,400
yeah steam i don't know what time it is

00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:33,839
but i want to be respectful of

00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:38,079
everybody's time

00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:42,079
yeah for sure okay i'll see you in a bit

00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:42,079
see you in a bit okay

00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:50,480
we're not allowed we're hopping out

00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:50,480
we're good yeah

00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:57,760
okay

00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:58,640
hey how's it going i well i obviously um

00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,480
that

00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:02,800
was too bad that things were working

00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:05,680
really strangely i wonder

00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:06,079
i wonder why that was happening it was a

00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:08,480
time

00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:09,599
uh i guess happened a couple times where

00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,839
they

00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:15,440
whoever hit play could continue to hear

00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:15,440
it but the other people couldn't hear it

00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:20,160
any like remedies or anything we should

00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:22,880
try or

00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:23,839
yeah to be honest i'm to be very honest

00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:26,640
i i'm not

00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:28,000
sure exactly what could be causing that

00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:29,920
one thing that did come up from one

00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,680
person was like maybe if the person who

00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:34,240
pressed play

00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:35,839
lost internet connection or disconnected

00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:40,800
somehow

00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:40,800
could possibly have caused some sort of

00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:45,520
it could possibly have had some sort of

00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:48,880
issue um

00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:48,880
let's see i'm just looking at

00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:52,400
the console to see if there's any errors

00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:54,240
right now that might give some sort of

00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:57,119
indication as to what was going on

00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:58,480
um is the world too heavy i tried to

00:44:57,119 --> 00:44:59,520
keep it super light like we made it

00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:00,640
lighter than yesterday

00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:02,800
yeah like that was the weird thing is

00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:05,760
that yesterday it worked pretty

00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:07,440
like quite well um i do wonder was there

00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:09,359
anyone with like a weird

00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:10,560
avatar in the room i don't think so i

00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:12,480
don't think anyone was wearing anything

00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:16,240
that was like

00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:18,480
custom made um i am seeing you wear a

00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:20,480
custom one and it doesn't work like

00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:22,079
i saw some weird little gray square

00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:24,160
people does that mean they had a custom

00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:25,839
avatar that wasn't loading

00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:27,359
no probably not i mean the only thing

00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:28,319
that could possibly happen is that like

00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:30,319
someone uploaded

00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:32,000
and there are things in place to stop

00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:33,280
this and i this is so unusual

00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,599
that i don't think it would happen but

00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:37,839
if someone had like a really high poly

00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:39,200
count avatar that they came in with it

00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:40,480
might make things a bit slower for

00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:44,880
everyone else in the room but

00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:48,079
i didn't see anyone who matched that um

00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:50,880
who matched that description

00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:50,880
let me see

00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:00,880
i'm going to print out the console

00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:02,880
errors that

00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:05,359
you folks had today but i don't i mean i

00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,359
don't know

00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:14,400
i don't know what was causing that

00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:16,079
specific bug that we were experiencing

00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:18,319
i mean i'm pretty sure i'm just gonna

00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:21,440
reschedule and yeah try again

00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:23,760
we know it can work yeah and i saw it it

00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:26,079
was so strange

00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:27,440
um i'll touch base with my team to see

00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:28,079
if they've got any thoughts on this but

00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:31,520
to be honest

00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:32,560
like this like this use case of having

00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:34,240
the audio

00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:36,400
being like the core part of the

00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:38,160
experience

00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:39,680
you know it it's not i don't want to say

00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,160
it's an edge case by any means but it's

00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,839
not

00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:43,599
like something that we get a ton of

00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:45,280
people doing so we haven't been

00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:46,240
troubleshooting it like to the extent

00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:47,200
that maybe like

00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:49,760
you know some of the things that

00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:52,720
happened in every single room happen

00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:53,119
um so anyways i'll pass that on to my

00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,400
team

00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:55,760
please let me know when you folks are

00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:58,560
scheduled for and i'll try to be

00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:58,560
available for it

00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:08,560
all right i am headed out of here thank
