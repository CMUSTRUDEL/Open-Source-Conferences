Publication date: 2019-08-26
Playlist: Emerging Technologies Speaker Series
Description: 
	Join us for a talk and discussion with futurist and game designer Jane McGonigal. She'll be sharing highlights from the EthicalOS toolkit, which was developed by IFTF with the support of the Omidiyar Network.  The toolkit offers a range of approaches for safeguarding ethics and turning ethical opinions into strategic assets in the product development process. Many of these approaches are much more common at Mozilla than other companies. Others we could yet learn from. Since the toolkit's release in August there's been a demand for concrete tools and examples in the wild. We have many such tools and examples at Mozilla, in Emerging Technologies we're excited to host this as a dialogue to highlight those tools and examples of ethical tech development.
