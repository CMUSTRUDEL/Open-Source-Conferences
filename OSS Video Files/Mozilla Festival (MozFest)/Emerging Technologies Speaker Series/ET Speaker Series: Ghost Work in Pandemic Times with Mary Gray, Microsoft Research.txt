Title: ET Speaker Series: Ghost Work in Pandemic Times with Mary Gray, Microsoft Research
Publication date: 2020-05-12
Playlist: Emerging Technologies Speaker Series
Description: 
	Gray will draw from Ghost Work: How to Stop Silicon Valley from Building a New Global Underclass (her 2019 book, coauthored with computer scientist Siddharth Suri), to argue that public health and economic recovery hinge on reckoning with the value of on-demand workers. The talk will outline the rise of on-demand services and the labor conditions and market flows that organize it. She will connect the global shift away from a shared worksite, co-present colleagues, and secure employment status many are experiencing today to the lessons learned from people who have been navigating ghost work conditions for more than a decade. Gray will end with a warning about another form of ghost work on the horizon: If not stopped now, the drive to develop automated contact tracing could reinforce ‘the paradox of automation’s last mile’—a relentless tech optimism that draws our attention to tech innovation as it elides the value of contingent human labor. Weathering the COVID-19 pandemic will require building technologies that assist and amplify rather than erase trusted healthcare workers.   
 
Mary L. Gray is a Senior Principal Researcher at Microsoft Research and an Edward J. Safra Center for Ethics Fellow at Harvard University.

	00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,520
good morning good afternoon good evening

00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,900
my name is Joe Trish Kay I am the

00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,790
principal research scientist here at

00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,070
Mozilla and it is my pleasure right now

00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:18,779
to introduce you to Mary gray from

00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:21,900
Microsoft Research and she also has

00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:24,980
affiliations at a wide variety of other

00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:28,080
places including Harvard and in the end

00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:30,720
I'm particularly excited about seeing

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,460
Mary's work here because I think it

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,780
talks to one of the key themes that I've

00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,090
been trying to bring out in this series

00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:39,390
which is the changing role of open

00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:44,219
source work when Moses started open

00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:45,630
source meant open source code right and

00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:48,000
if you look at the manifesto we

00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:49,860
explicitly say that we believe in open

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,480
source code and that's very valuable and

00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,969
increasingly what we're seeing is a

00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,489
change in how open source work is done

00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:58,710
in that we're incorporating data as part

00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:01,739
of that open source work the most

00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:04,350
visible part for that is the common

00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:06,450
voice work I think but we're seeing that

00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:08,580
throughout the world of particularly of

00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:12,060
an artificial intelligence enabled world

00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:14,130
we're seeing that that role of the human

00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:18,360
worker in creating the datasets from

00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:20,880
which you teach and learn is crucial but

00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,619
often elided in the discussions so I

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,270
think there's the the most apparent

00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:26,069
version of this what if a fail in

00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:31,200
Stanford did creating the image net

00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:34,289
project which was some 40,000 workers I

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,390
think I you you haven't Mary's book on

00:01:34,289 --> 00:01:37,649
this is superb by the way and I will

00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:39,920
plug it because she's probably far too

00:01:37,649 --> 00:01:44,340
polite to do so herself

00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:46,140
but we're seeing that as something that

00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:48,090
we engage with at Mozilla and that the

00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:50,459
juanita open source world has to engage

00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:53,069
with on a regular basis we're seeing

00:01:50,459 --> 00:01:55,050
this around speech recognition we're

00:01:53,069 --> 00:01:59,369
seeing this around text-to-speech as

00:01:55,050 --> 00:02:01,170
well and I think we need to be cognizant

00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:02,849
of that and one of the things I'm

00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:05,970
looking forward to understanding from

00:02:02,849 --> 00:02:09,899
Mary is what the options look like for

00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:12,150
doing open source work in a data-driven

00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:14,129
world where you have these ethical

00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:16,530
underpinnings like what does it mean to

00:02:14,129 --> 00:02:18,680
do Ithaca l' engagement with a crowd

00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:21,590
work or economy so that's the

00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:23,480
question I'm looking forward to finding

00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:24,920
out the punch line at the end but I'm

00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:27,980
gonna stop talking and head over to Mary

00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:32,030
and I will take questions if you're

00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:34,310
inside Mozilla on speaker - series if

00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:37,400
you're outside Mozilla ask me questions

00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:41,060
on Twitter and Joe fish and I look

00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:42,769
forward to I look forward to seeing what

00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:47,120
Mary and everyone else that's the same

00:02:42,769 --> 00:02:49,340
so over to you Josh thank you thank you

00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,250
for the introduction and thanks for the

00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:54,290
invitation to come speak with you and in

00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:56,659
many ways I want to preface this work

00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:58,099
which is based on joint research with

00:02:56,659 --> 00:02:59,959
Siddharth Suri he was a computer

00:02:58,099 --> 00:03:02,870
scientist a colleague here at Microsoft

00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:05,359
Research I want to preface this with

00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:07,189
getting everybody listening to think

00:03:05,359 --> 00:03:09,409
about how much they relate to the

00:03:07,189 --> 00:03:11,599
experience of the workers that I'm about

00:03:09,409 --> 00:03:13,879
to describe to you because in many ways

00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:17,329
when we think about what's the future of

00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:18,859
work what are the experiences of being

00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:21,019
thrust into a world where you're working

00:03:18,859 --> 00:03:23,840
remotely disconnected from your

00:03:21,019 --> 00:03:26,389
colleagues no single worksite that the

00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,430
reality is we've studied a world of

00:03:26,389 --> 00:03:32,449
workers who have been operating this way

00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:34,790
for well over a decade so it's really

00:03:32,449 --> 00:03:37,669
coming to grips with the future work has

00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:40,659
been here for some time and now many

00:03:37,669 --> 00:03:44,510
people who had the privilege of working

00:03:40,659 --> 00:03:49,150
in a traditional formal employment

00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:53,030
setting are experiencing the kind of

00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:56,629
volatility and chaos that can come with

00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:59,000
juggling many tasks and projects and

00:03:56,629 --> 00:04:02,269
managing that with the rest of their

00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:06,319
lives so with that I want to use today a

00:04:02,269 --> 00:04:07,009
connect this broader sense of what does

00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,930
this work

00:04:07,009 --> 00:04:11,269
that that I'm about to describe you what

00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:14,090
does it look like but to hopefully build

00:04:11,269 --> 00:04:15,769
some connection and empathy with what

00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:18,919
everybody is experiencing who's

00:04:15,769 --> 00:04:21,409
listening today and also to to hopefully

00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:23,360
start some discussion around what that

00:04:21,409 --> 00:04:26,570
means for the specific form of

00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:30,139
telehealth which we might call contact

00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:32,080
tracing so with that let me start with a

00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:34,720
definition about

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:39,159
is dose work and what it can teach us

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:41,560
about surviving Kovan 19 in many ways we

00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:45,310
came up with this turn of phrase to be

00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:47,110
able to capture not specific workers but

00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:48,669
their work conditions so I'm going to

00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:49,900
say more about that in a moment but keep

00:04:48,669 --> 00:04:52,690
in mind we're not talking about a

00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:55,419
specific group of people we're talking

00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:59,740
about the work conditions that they're

00:04:55,419 --> 00:05:02,080
living in and specifically we're looking

00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:04,479
at the case of with what we're calling

00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:07,569
information service work knowledge work

00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:10,479
that's that's coursing through on-demand

00:05:07,569 --> 00:05:13,750
platforms so as you said Joe joy -

00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:15,639
there's so much about open source work

00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:18,159
that looks quite a bit like this where

00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:19,690
people are exchanging tasks they've

00:05:18,159 --> 00:05:22,330
their project driven they're coming

00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:25,319
together as teams we wanted to look at a

00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:28,810
world of task based contact driven

00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:32,469
contractor than jobs that are score

00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:35,139
sourced scheduled managed shipped and

00:05:32,469 --> 00:05:36,789
billed at least in part through a

00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:38,830
combination of application programming

00:05:36,789 --> 00:05:41,500
interfaces in the internet now the

00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:45,340
reason we're focusing on this mechanism

00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:48,370
of being able to organize work this way

00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:52,270
is because it turns out there's myriad

00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:54,400
forms of work that are something that

00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:56,770
can be turned into sets of tasks and

00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,469
distributed widely not just open-source

00:05:56,770 --> 00:06:02,469
work but really a range of work that can

00:05:59,469 --> 00:06:05,860
be editing content creation content

00:06:02,469 --> 00:06:09,009
moderation survey taking data entry of

00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:12,159
all kinds data labeling but increasingly

00:06:09,009 --> 00:06:14,949
again telehealth where you're offering

00:06:12,159 --> 00:06:17,409
support navigating somebody through the

00:06:14,949 --> 00:06:21,460
use of a specific new drug all of those

00:06:17,409 --> 00:06:24,190
are examples of a world of services

00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:27,219
meeting information and becoming a form

00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:30,460
of activity of economic activity and

00:06:27,219 --> 00:06:34,050
employing them so what makes this kind

00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:35,319
of work what we consider ghost work are

00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:38,650
settings

00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:41,919
job conditions where the value of the

00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:44,229
person in that loop in contributing to

00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:46,030
it is often an aggregated result an

00:06:44,229 --> 00:06:49,660
aggregated team

00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:52,260
if you will that their value and in some

00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:57,220
cases their in their presence is

00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:59,040
alighted as you as you gestured to or

00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:03,190
it's just ignored its imagined to be

00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:05,830
somewhat immaterial to the the final

00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:08,350
product and so in those situations what

00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:11,740
we see happen over and over again is

00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:16,630
that the people contributing to those

00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:19,690
projects are often dismissed as just

00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:22,150
contract work or are only seen as a

00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:24,580
small piece of the solution and

00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:27,910
certainly a small benefactor of the

00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:30,130
value of their output so there are

00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:32,710
really two streams of work that we want

00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:34,840
to describe here and then I'm going to

00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:37,960
populate it with the people could do

00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:39,580
this work one form of stream one form of

00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:42,190
work we're really familiar with it's

00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:44,410
it's structuring and cleaning data sets

00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:47,350
for artificial intelligence and this is

00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:49,320
really where our project began we began

00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:51,850
specifically trying to understand

00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:54,700
looking at the computer scientists and

00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:56,710
engineers who are building artificial

00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:59,470
intelligence and building out

00:07:56,710 --> 00:08:02,979
algorithmic modeling to see well how do

00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:04,810
they do their work my colleagues said

00:08:02,979 --> 00:08:06,850
Surrey is absolutely familiar with this

00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:09,610
he's a computer scientist I had a

00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:13,120
learning curve so I was learning quickly

00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:15,100
that it turns out that if you want to be

00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:19,090
able to have an automated system that

00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:21,520
does web you know web relevance well web

00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:24,010
link relevance you need enough people

00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:26,800
who are creating the metadata that are

00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:29,530
annotating web links and deciding on

00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:33,070
relevance what should someone who uses a

00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:36,520
certain set of search queries C to be

00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:39,010
able to give you a fairly robust output

00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:41,469
as a consumer so all of the consumer

00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:45,339
facing service products we have from a

00:08:41,469 --> 00:08:48,460
search engine to social media content

00:08:45,339 --> 00:08:51,910
have at some point in their plumbing in

00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:54,880
their history the the work of humans

00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:57,400
cleaning the data sets that are used to

00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,870
be able to train algorithmic decision

00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:02,180
making that can lead to

00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:04,520
Automation and in some cases but I

00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:07,250
highlight a couple of cases where the

00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:10,460
effort to automate a particular process

00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:12,710
often fall short and content review

00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:14,990
content moderation and telehealth are

00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:17,720
two really good examples of that because

00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:21,260
they don't just produce the work that is

00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:24,430
a task of somebody looking at a data set

00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:26,660
or adding metadata labeling to material

00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:29,750
they're actually doing this second

00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:31,820
stream of work this this surprised me

00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:36,460
that there were so many different

00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:39,529
business models across every industry

00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:43,370
every industry that was effectively

00:09:39,529 --> 00:09:47,560
trying to put a human in a certain part

00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:51,620
of the computational loop or part of the

00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:54,529
service to an end customer that included

00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:56,810
really keeping a person available to

00:09:54,529 --> 00:10:00,290
answer questions that the text-based

00:09:56,810 --> 00:10:01,880
chat bot could not answer so the

00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:03,470
examples that we have are coming from

00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:06,170
specific businesses they're really

00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:09,230
stand-ins for the kinds of information

00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:11,029
services that actually rely on as their

00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:13,550
business model keeping a human in the

00:10:11,029 --> 00:10:16,880
loop and I should say there's nothing

00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:20,300
inherently bad or good about either of

00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:22,459
these kinds of workflows either of these

00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:24,740
streams can produce perfectly

00:10:22,459 --> 00:10:28,610
interesting work it can absolutely

00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:30,230
produce income for people who are who

00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:33,170
are seeking work through these streams

00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:37,060
but the problem is that we don't treat

00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:39,620
these streams of work as serious

00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:42,230
employment efforts we don't have any

00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:43,940
regulations to set that standard from

00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:46,610
what does it constitute to ethically

00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:50,180
engage with somebody in task based work

00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:52,550
so examples of human live services from

00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:55,459
generating sales leads so for an example

00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:58,339
a company that we studied that literally

00:10:55,459 --> 00:10:59,779
takes a scrape of all of the contacts

00:10:58,339 --> 00:11:03,260
that might be relevant to a specific

00:10:59,779 --> 00:11:06,170
business let's let's imagine folks who

00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:08,240
build air conditioners and they need to

00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:10,670
be able to figure out how to give their

00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,810
sales people the best list of people to

00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:15,570
call in companies that need to buy

00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:18,540
air conditioners right so in that case

00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:20,670
it turns out the web is kind of full

00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:23,340
junk you you don't want to reach out to

00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:24,750
the vice president of a company to sell

00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:26,520
them an air conditioner you want to

00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:29,370
figure out who's in procurement who's

00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:30,839
the you know who is the lead in their

00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:33,270
office he's going to purchase what you

00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:34,680
have to buy that's true again in every

00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:37,470
single industry that has something to

00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:40,110
sell there's the need to generate the

00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:43,830
right sales lead that's that is a

00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:45,480
fantastic on-demand delivery service

00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:47,670
it's a business-to-business service that

00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:50,880
an average customer doesn't see some

00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:52,560
other examples content moderation I joke

00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,060
all the time that two years ago if I'd

00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,529
said that phrase nobody would have

00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:57,410
understood we're talking about people

00:11:55,529 --> 00:11:59,490
who are sitting in front of screens

00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:03,000
evaluating content that's been flagged

00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:05,880
typically by an end user in any website

00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:09,029
that has user-generated content is going

00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:10,860
to need a workforce of people to review

00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:12,810
content sometimes that can be done

00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:16,440
in-house but depending on the scale of

00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:18,750
your website or social media site you

00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:22,020
need legions of people and Sarah Roberts

00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:24,300
book behind the screen is a fantastic

00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:26,850
book that covers everything you need to

00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:28,800
know about content moderation our focus

00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:30,540
was specifically on workers who are not

00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,520
just doing content moderation but

00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:35,720
content moderation becomes a case of

00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:38,370
this other broader world of work so

00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:41,400
we're looking really at two distinct

00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:44,839
streams but underlying them both is this

00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:49,230
mechanism and it means that you can turn

00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:51,150
tasks into on-demand work or it could

00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:53,220
look like ghost work and this is a

00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:55,920
diagram what does this look like exactly

00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:58,950
it's any business that has a specific

00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:01,260
task that demands attention that can be

00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:03,500
event planning that can be writing a

00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:06,390
newsletter that can be developing code

00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:08,490
that can be responding to a health

00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:11,250
crisis and needing to hire people to

00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:13,620
contact people on a list of contacts to

00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:15,570
find out what kind of exchanges they've

00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:17,970
had in the last two weeks that's not a

00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:21,089
hypothetical so in this case you can

00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:23,520
have any business with a task come to a

00:13:21,089 --> 00:13:26,700
platform and be able to put that task on

00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:28,800
that platform and create a set of

00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:30,630
rulz we all know what algorithms are

00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:34,680
create a set of rules that are going to

00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:37,140
structure the relationship from putting

00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:39,570
a task on a platform to be done to how

00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:41,640
it's executed how much time somebody has

00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:43,590
to execute it paying them for that task

00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:46,920
all of that can be managed

00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:49,230
algorithmically and again hat tip out to

00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:52,290
Alex Rosenberg Rosenblatt who was a

00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:54,630
beautiful book about just algorithmic

00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:57,810
management and what that can can look

00:13:54,630 --> 00:14:00,570
like for uber uber drivers it's it's

00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:03,150
really a similar mechanism and what

00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:05,370
changes is what's that company the black

00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:07,800
box in the middle of the platform what

00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:09,840
is it that they're managing what's what

00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:13,260
is it that they're matching from the

00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:16,050
business demand side to this world of

00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:18,300
supply side of people on the other end

00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:20,670
of a screen who can sign up for an

00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:22,950
account and importantly it's not one

00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:26,280
person signing up for a task the real

00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:29,400
value is in having an abundance of

00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:33,600
people who are available to a business

00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:36,300
that needs to tap into that pool of

00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,520
people that Commons and pull out a

00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:41,400
number of people to get a response to

00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:44,370
the task they they need to get done so

00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:46,550
you know it's critical to realize this

00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:48,900
isn't about a one-to-one relationship

00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:51,720
this is about having a pool of people

00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:54,690
available at any time to be able to do a

00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:56,760
task that myriad businesses can place

00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:59,250
through different you know different

00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:03,060
on-demand platforms that that offer a

00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:05,220
range of markets for the kind of labor

00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:07,770
that they're offering the key thing to

00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:10,860
take away is that it becomes Ghost work

00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:13,740
when we forget about the value of those

00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:18,210
people making themselves available to

00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:21,570
businesses so taking this into account

00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:24,630
like picture that workflow in mind we

00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:26,730
can already imagine who are the key

00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:31,560
service workers coming to the fore

00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:33,540
during kovin 19 we are relying in some

00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:36,480
cases if you're purchasing food on

00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:38,790
somebody delivering it to your door now

00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,210
it's even more likely that you're not

00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:40,950
see

00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:44,250
the person who's delivering your food

00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:46,680
there are myriad tasks that we're

00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:49,980
running through the existing incumbents

00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:51,300
of this platform world and it's clunky

00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:54,090
to call it this but think of it as

00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:56,400
online to offline platform delivery

00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:58,710
service so it means that you're going

00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:00,570
online you're ordering something as a

00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:04,050
consumer or as a business you have a

00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:06,000
demand and you want this particular task

00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:09,390
met by somebody who's on the other side

00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,940
the person on the other side is using

00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:14,490
that platform to access the the work

00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:18,150
that you're putting out on the Internet

00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:21,020
and they're delivering that work to you

00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:24,120
that whether it's getting a you know a

00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:26,130
fast order to you or delivering

00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:28,170
furniture because you didn't have a home

00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:32,460
office set up before Cove in nineteen

00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:35,910
but that's a visible set of services our

00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:37,710
research was touching on the kind of

00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:41,010
information services that are right on

00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:43,380
the edge on the surface of our of our

00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:46,140
awareness in content moderation many of

00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:47,880
us wouldn't have realized the hundreds

00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:50,100
of thousands of people who are engaged

00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:52,740
in content moderation for those two work

00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:54,930
streams both training algorithmic models

00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:56,940
to identify material but importantly

00:16:54,930 --> 00:17:00,840
also kept in the loop to be able to

00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:05,180
review material below the surface is

00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:08,460
this burgeoning world of on-demand

00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:10,890
online offline to online information

00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:13,110
services that means particularly

00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:15,810
business-to-business you as an end

00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:20,040
consumer will absolutely benefit when

00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:22,320
you halt rents you a vehicle and you are

00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:24,480
able to text to their customer service

00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:27,120
and you don't realize that that person

00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:29,370
isn't in a call center they're working

00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:32,660
from home and they're able to respond to

00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:36,290
your query about where you can find

00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:39,680
another u-haul facility to trade out the

00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:43,500
broken-down truck that you have

00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:46,530
Accenture is a major figure in providing

00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:50,490
the kind of data labeling necessary for

00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:52,880
tons of research going into diagnostics

00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:54,560
analyses for example

00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,320
upwork probably many of you familiar

00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:59,600
with it like just realized that there's

00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:02,840
not a lot of distance between somebody

00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:05,090
who's effectively turning to a platform

00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:08,480
be able to see what kinds of tasks and

00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:12,140
projects they can do entirely organized

00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:16,010
around short contracts and the kind of

00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:18,200
work that might be seen like it's so

00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:20,990
remote whether it's doing Amazon

00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:23,210
Mechanical Turk tasks or other kinds of

00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:25,100
image labeling tasks that are the heart

00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:27,800
and soul of image yet they're

00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:31,010
effectively structured they're sourced

00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:32,810
scheduled managed shipped and billed

00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:36,770
through application programming

00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:40,300
interfaces and the internet so think

00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:42,710
about this world not as niche jobs

00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:45,110
literally we're looking at a mechanism

00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:48,650
that dismantles full-time service

00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:51,080
employment writ large and what we're

00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:53,840
probably all quickly learning is how

00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:57,070
much of our work is effectively a series

00:18:53,840 --> 00:19:00,890
of projects and tasks that we can do

00:18:57,070 --> 00:19:04,550
off-site or at home or in some setting

00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:08,690
and that means that they are ripe for

00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:10,700
being able to be disjointed from one

00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:13,670
thing that you know seven things I do

00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:15,350
during the day and turned into a list of

00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:19,160
seven tasks that could be distributed

00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:21,860
again there's no inherent bad or good to

00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:24,140
this aside from the fact that everything

00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:26,260
we've built around stabilizing

00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:29,600
employment was with the assumption that

00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:33,620
full-time employment was the goal and

00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:37,280
was effectively you know the baseline it

00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:39,170
turns out that much of this effort to be

00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:43,310
able to disaggregate tasks and services

00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:45,260
through automation undo much of the

00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:51,020
full-time employment that we've had in

00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:54,290
the past so AI paradoxically cannot

00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:57,380
advance without keeping people in the

00:19:54,290 --> 00:20:00,230
loop but it also doesn't need them

00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:04,070
full-time so that's the struggle here is

00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:06,559
that in treating people as kind of

00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:09,440
contingent only necessary for

00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:12,799
the moment we can often forget they're

00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:14,749
actually still incredibly valuable so

00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:18,259
how are we going to come up with a new

00:20:14,749 --> 00:20:20,470
system economically socially for valuing

00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:23,840
those moments of contributing

00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:26,690
particularly as aggregated sets of

00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:29,659
people coming together contributing to a

00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:32,870
project code is such a great example of

00:20:29,659 --> 00:20:35,389
that and recognize that value and

00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:38,990
stabilize and make sustainable this

00:20:35,389 --> 00:20:41,419
approach to employment we call this the

00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:44,980
paradox of us automations last mile

00:20:41,419 --> 00:20:47,600
so as we're trying to automate some work

00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:50,330
we're literally creating new types of

00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:54,649
work that demand and depend on human

00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:57,080
expertise that matters because work and

00:20:54,649 --> 00:21:00,259
I'm gonna keep hitting the note of like

00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:02,990
contact tracing which involves being in

00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:05,090
constant contact and often being able to

00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:08,629
be empathetic and here somebody's

00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:11,119
concerns or they're hedging about their

00:21:08,629 --> 00:21:14,059
own health status being able to detect

00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:16,580
that and follow up with questions with

00:21:14,059 --> 00:21:18,950
no particular amount of data with no

00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:19,549
priors of that person but to be able to

00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:22,539
intuit

00:21:19,549 --> 00:21:25,789
what is it this person needs every

00:21:22,539 --> 00:21:28,580
business driven by service depends on

00:21:25,789 --> 00:21:31,070
that capacity to suss out what does in

00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:32,960
minute what does another human need that

00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:35,450
is not going to be automated anytime

00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:38,289
soon because that's technically a very

00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:41,659
hard problem it is very hard to

00:21:38,289 --> 00:21:44,960
computationally be able to assess does

00:21:41,659 --> 00:21:47,749
somebody need something and if they do

00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:52,129
need something what that's a deeply

00:21:47,749 --> 00:21:54,909
human capacity that my co-author and I

00:21:52,129 --> 00:21:56,960
would have a constant back-and-forth

00:21:54,909 --> 00:22:01,129
disagreements I believe that's something

00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:03,769
that's that's distinct and quite unique

00:22:01,129 --> 00:22:07,129
to humans and it's not clear to me that

00:22:03,769 --> 00:22:10,279
computation could ever achieve the kind

00:22:07,129 --> 00:22:13,970
of fidelity that you get through human

00:22:10,279 --> 00:22:19,039
exchange so how big was ghostworth Creek

00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:20,260
Ovid 19 by 2017 a full five percent of

00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:21,880
the US popular

00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:25,630
one in 20 people had already done some

00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:28,299
form of online - online paid work that

00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:31,960
was not including people working for

00:22:28,299 --> 00:22:34,779
uber or any of the other delivery

00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:38,860
service services that that are often

00:22:34,779 --> 00:22:40,720
present in in urban settings so keep in

00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:44,559
mind that's significant considering this

00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:46,720
work didn't exist until around 2007

00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:49,450
until we had the development of human

00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:51,820
computation to be able to provide jobs

00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:55,029
and tasks through this distributed

00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:59,049
mechanism the World Bank had projected

00:22:55,029 --> 00:23:02,970
that we would hit a 25 billion dollar

00:22:59,049 --> 00:23:06,539
industry based on this on-demand digital

00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:09,309
online online service delivery

00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:13,720
information services by the end of this

00:23:09,309 --> 00:23:15,940
year so it's not clear that the pandemic

00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:18,429
is going to take that off course and in

00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:20,020
fact if anything it's likely it'll

00:23:18,429 --> 00:23:22,809
continue to grow

00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:27,429
precisely because as businesses are

00:23:22,809 --> 00:23:30,159
going to blow up and implode when they

00:23:27,429 --> 00:23:32,169
go to stabilize they may or may not go -

00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:35,020
back to the same full-time employees

00:23:32,169 --> 00:23:37,179
they had new businesses the most likely

00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:40,929
use on the most common use of this

00:23:37,179 --> 00:23:43,600
mechanism in startups is to speculate to

00:23:40,929 --> 00:23:46,149
spin out any project so we can imagine

00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:49,000
that businesses that are just getting

00:23:46,149 --> 00:23:51,429
their footing when we finally come out

00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,169
of this pandemic are going to be relying

00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:57,220
on reaching out to contract labor

00:23:53,169 --> 00:24:00,220
through these on-demand platforms the

00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:02,440
projected impact again pre Kovan 19 was

00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:05,740
that we would roughly end up with about

00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:07,380
38 percent of jobs gone but importantly

00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:10,299
keep in mind this doesn't mean the

00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:13,990
elimination of that work it means the

00:24:10,299 --> 00:24:16,029
disaggregation of employment so a good

00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:18,610
thirty eight percent of jobs in the

00:24:16,029 --> 00:24:21,460
United States are the kinds of office

00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:23,500
work information service work that can

00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:25,809
be done through a series of projects and

00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:28,780
tasks that do not require one person

00:24:25,809 --> 00:24:31,000
doing them in fact in many cases having

00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:33,570
many people do them and either compete

00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,899
to share their ideas and see which ideas

00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:39,749
or to be able to create these very

00:24:36,899 --> 00:24:42,029
quickly organizing teams around a

00:24:39,749 --> 00:24:44,570
specific project idea that then

00:24:42,029 --> 00:24:48,119
dispersed after that projects completed

00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:49,889
that's a much more accurate read rather

00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:53,340
than thinking the robots are around the

00:24:49,889 --> 00:24:54,779
corner this is not new and I mean that's

00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:58,049
probably one of the most important

00:24:54,779 --> 00:24:59,820
things to keep in mind with this

00:24:58,049 --> 00:25:04,019
discussion there's nothing new about

00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:05,639
using contingent contract work to fill

00:25:04,019 --> 00:25:08,309
in the gaps in the paradox of

00:25:05,639 --> 00:25:10,830
automations last mile to have somebody

00:25:08,309 --> 00:25:15,690
doing the thing that the machine cannot

00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:18,950
do so whether that's piece work thinking

00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:22,109
about human computers in the 50s and 60s

00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:23,909
thinking about the office work that

00:25:22,109 --> 00:25:25,830
comes to the fore in the 70s

00:25:23,909 --> 00:25:29,269
particularly alongside more women

00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:32,849
entering the workplace but also being

00:25:29,269 --> 00:25:37,080
contained and then glass ceiling hitting

00:25:32,849 --> 00:25:40,019
them because they are assumed to be the

00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:42,629
less valuable worker or thinking about

00:25:40,019 --> 00:25:45,059
the outsourcing of labor that comes with

00:25:42,629 --> 00:25:48,179
the rollout of a global Internet

00:25:45,059 --> 00:25:52,019
infrastructure in all these cases the

00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:53,960
ghost' work collisions that come the

00:25:52,019 --> 00:25:57,509
conditions that come with these

00:25:53,960 --> 00:26:00,299
approaches to work have to do with the

00:25:57,509 --> 00:26:03,269
night you know the 1800s having an idea

00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:05,849
of which workers do they need to retain

00:26:03,269 --> 00:26:09,049
it's the full-time assembly line workers

00:26:05,849 --> 00:26:12,509
who tended to be male who tended to be

00:26:09,049 --> 00:26:15,119
white and in many ways it was about

00:26:12,509 --> 00:26:18,570
stabilizing particular workers or

00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:21,179
assuming that any worker who had a

00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:23,489
college degree or who was part of the

00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:26,820
noble professions certainly did not need

00:26:23,489 --> 00:26:28,590
support in the workplace so the policies

00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:31,049
were really built to make sure that

00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:33,570
workers on a factory line didn't lose

00:26:31,049 --> 00:26:36,690
their limbs or with the assumption that

00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:38,369
someone college-educated did not need

00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:43,019
any protections at all but their

00:26:38,369 --> 00:26:45,659
education protected them the other the

00:26:43,019 --> 00:26:47,149
other kind of condition that slowly

00:26:45,659 --> 00:26:49,399
seeped into

00:26:47,149 --> 00:26:52,399
our approach to labor was an assumption

00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:55,339
that temporary staffing and internet

00:26:52,399 --> 00:26:59,269
enabled global supply chains were really

00:26:55,339 --> 00:27:01,429
periphery they were they were necessary

00:26:59,269 --> 00:27:03,049
but they were really not core to what's

00:27:01,429 --> 00:27:05,779
called the return on investment of

00:27:03,049 --> 00:27:09,019
businesses so being able to disaggregate

00:27:05,779 --> 00:27:11,629
pieces of what a company did and handing

00:27:09,019 --> 00:27:13,159
them off to temporary staff there was

00:27:11,629 --> 00:27:14,960
kind of a cultural story we told

00:27:13,159 --> 00:27:16,759
ourselves that those must be the jobs

00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:19,070
that really aren't that important if

00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:21,589
they're not full-time workers making

00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:23,809
kind of a causal link without thinking

00:27:21,589 --> 00:27:26,029
maybe that had more to do with who is

00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:29,059
valued rather than what they were doing

00:27:26,029 --> 00:27:32,080
in those workplaces because by the time

00:27:29,059 --> 00:27:35,539
you get to the 2000s and you see a

00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:39,349
fundamental shift to information service

00:27:35,539 --> 00:27:43,070
economies so that we're 24/7 delivering

00:27:39,349 --> 00:27:46,339
content like this that you know there's

00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:49,639
a constant need of churn in expertise

00:27:46,339 --> 00:27:53,509
for spec projects and for prototyping

00:27:49,639 --> 00:27:55,940
and it's that constant churn not the

00:27:53,509 --> 00:27:58,039
value of the employee or the worker but

00:27:55,940 --> 00:28:00,830
the constant churn that destabilizes

00:27:58,039 --> 00:28:04,009
work environments so that means that you

00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:07,669
don't have the rise in the united states

00:28:04,009 --> 00:28:09,589
of unions and associations that can make

00:28:07,669 --> 00:28:12,320
a case for what kind of standard should

00:28:09,589 --> 00:28:14,859
you set for how you engage people so

00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:19,129
contract based work tends to leave the

00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:22,519
contractor with the least leverage

00:28:19,129 --> 00:28:23,899
unless they are big player so if you're

00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:26,029
tiny and you're working with another

00:28:23,899 --> 00:28:28,070
business another business odds are

00:28:26,029 --> 00:28:31,639
pretty good you don't have much leverage

00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:34,129
to better your employment conditions or

00:28:31,639 --> 00:28:37,029
the pay you get that is absolutely true

00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:40,219
you're looking at self-employed workers

00:28:37,029 --> 00:28:43,549
so take what I've shared with you about

00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:47,089
this history and think about the

00:28:43,549 --> 00:28:48,769
findings we have from looking at this

00:28:47,089 --> 00:28:51,619
world of work that is effectively the

00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:53,779
continuation of contingent workers

00:28:51,619 --> 00:28:55,489
filling in the gaps either training

00:28:53,779 --> 00:28:58,249
artificial intelligence or subbing for

00:28:55,489 --> 00:29:00,780
it when it can't really do the job and

00:28:58,249 --> 00:29:03,630
we wanted to get at these workers

00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:06,330
in a very specific way and understand

00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:08,790
not just the the kind of computational

00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:10,260
approach to what they're doing how often

00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:12,390
are they doing something where are they

00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:13,860
doing it but what's their experience of

00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:15,660
it how do they make meaning out of the

00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:18,300
work that they do

00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:21,900
we found we surveyed thousands of people

00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:23,700
we interviewed hundreds of them we spent

00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:27,300
almost two years doing fieldwork

00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:29,490
observing scores of people's work at

00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:31,740
their own offices and their homes at

00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:34,830
cafes in both the United States and

00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:36,300
India we created we ran behavioral

00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:39,060
experiments to understand how they were

00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:40,500
valuing their time compared to money we

00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:43,530
mapped where they are we looked at

00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:45,720
transactional data the analysis of how

00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:48,540
many of these tasks and projects are

00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:52,080
flowing on the four platforms that we

00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:55,020
studied to get a sense of the shape and

00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:58,500
the space of this world and we're

00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:59,970
drawing effectively on the methodologies

00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:01,260
of both anthropology and computer

00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:04,130
science and trying to bring them

00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:06,840
together so looking at four different

00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:09,870
companies that are basically stand-ins

00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:14,190
for the business models and the sectors

00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:16,560
that are coming to the fore to generate

00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:19,620
this kind of information service work

00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:22,530
we're leaning on their workforces to

00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:27,060
inform as a case of this broader world

00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:29,700
of on-demand work again they're they're

00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:31,680
all over the map but there are certain

00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:34,080
patterns and I'd be happy to talk about

00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:35,940
this and the question the answer there

00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:38,730
are certain patterns to where people are

00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:41,190
able to pick up these kinds of tasks and

00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:43,350
it often is an overlay of where's their

00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:44,880
internet connectivity where are their

00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:46,620
the kind of language skills that are

00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:49,800
valued in these information service

00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:51,810
markets so I want to share with you just

00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:54,120
a couple of the findings from our

00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:56,100
research and then I want to link it to

00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:58,790
this conversation about the value of

00:30:56,100 --> 00:31:02,340
humans in the loop of contact tracing

00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:05,730
what we found very importantly is

00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:08,700
something fairly common across any

00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:11,070
ecosystem particularly social systems

00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:13,779
where there's an open call

00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:15,369
where there is no structured

00:31:13,779 --> 00:31:17,229
function about who can come and go

00:31:15,369 --> 00:31:21,129
whether we're talking about a Facebook

00:31:17,229 --> 00:31:23,830
group Wikipedia or your hometown book

00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:26,859
club you see a similar distribution of

00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:29,440
participation you have about 10% we call

00:31:26,859 --> 00:31:32,710
them always on of people who effectively

00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:35,820
spend 40 to 60 hours a week different

00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:40,269
times of the day and night earning a

00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:41,769
living and four in their terms their

00:31:40,269 --> 00:31:43,960
sense of full-time employment

00:31:41,769 --> 00:31:46,419
and they're cobbling together many

00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:49,479
different platforms to be able to

00:31:46,419 --> 00:31:52,749
produce a stable income stream for what

00:31:49,479 --> 00:31:54,789
will sustain them economically but

00:31:52,749 --> 00:31:56,649
there's a core group we call regulars

00:31:54,789 --> 00:32:00,580
who are about twenty percent depending

00:31:56,649 --> 00:32:03,399
on the platform but about that range who

00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:06,580
are just as importantly available they

00:32:03,399 --> 00:32:09,639
picked a time or a day a set of hours

00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:12,789
and they routinely go back to that time

00:32:09,639 --> 00:32:15,609
in their schedule to be able to pick up

00:32:12,789 --> 00:32:18,580
tasks and projects for the economic game

00:32:15,609 --> 00:32:20,979
and for myriad other reasons as well and

00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:23,379
what's important to understand about

00:32:20,979 --> 00:32:25,749
this group of regulars is that when

00:32:23,379 --> 00:32:28,779
always honors step away

00:32:25,749 --> 00:32:31,029
it's the regulars who fill in so that

00:32:28,779 --> 00:32:33,669
the consumer or business who's hiring

00:32:31,029 --> 00:32:36,219
folks on demand never know the

00:32:33,669 --> 00:32:39,070
difference between somebody who's always

00:32:36,219 --> 00:32:40,509
on and somebody who's regular think of

00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:42,609
it as the equivalent of full-time and

00:32:40,509 --> 00:32:45,639
part-time if you have somebody who's

00:32:42,609 --> 00:32:48,039
part-time imagine if they can execute on

00:32:45,639 --> 00:32:50,469
what you need as effectively as somebody

00:32:48,039 --> 00:32:53,919
who's been in their job for 20 years

00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:55,809
that is precisely what regulars bring to

00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:58,089
the table and they're a critical part of

00:32:55,809 --> 00:33:02,080
this workforce there is no version of

00:32:58,089 --> 00:33:04,359
on-demand labor markets that strips it

00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,919
down to a core group of people who are

00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:08,529
always on who are equivalent of

00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:12,099
full-time employees why because this is

00:33:08,529 --> 00:33:14,919
exhausting work for the most part the

00:33:12,099 --> 00:33:18,279
10% who are doing this have figured out

00:33:14,919 --> 00:33:20,379
and are drawn to and able to make this

00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:23,289
work work for them as their only income

00:33:20,379 --> 00:33:25,450
stream those 20% regulars they have

00:33:23,289 --> 00:33:27,440
other constraints on their time but

00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:29,690
they're equally able to give

00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:32,960
what they have to offer when they're

00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:36,110
available so there isn't a way of

00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:39,350
keeping the value of the spread of

00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:42,529
people involved if you just limit it and

00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:44,899
for Mozilla fan for the Mozilla ng's out

00:33:42,529 --> 00:33:47,389
there think about code you've got the

00:33:44,899 --> 00:33:49,009
folks who were just hardcore always at

00:33:47,389 --> 00:33:50,990
at hammering away and you've got this

00:33:49,009 --> 00:33:52,730
person he's regularly there and they're

00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:55,940
holding down the fort and they bring a

00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:57,379
lot of value there's a last part of this

00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:59,690
curve that's critical the

00:33:57,379 --> 00:34:01,549
experimentalists are people coming in

00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:03,950
and out of these long demand platforms

00:34:01,549 --> 00:34:06,019
trying it out and they have their

00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:09,470
reasons for coming and going often for

00:34:06,019 --> 00:34:11,659
the for the on the workers we were we

00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:13,520
were studying their reasons for leaving

00:34:11,659 --> 00:34:17,810
and thankfully we had a methodology for

00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:19,730
for talking with them was that this work

00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:22,339
was too confusing it was too difficult

00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:24,379
to get a toehold on what exactly could

00:34:22,339 --> 00:34:26,569
they do to be able to increase their

00:34:24,379 --> 00:34:27,919
participation that had everything to do

00:34:26,569 --> 00:34:32,179
with the next data point I'm going to

00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:35,300
share with you so it turns out that this

00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:37,399
Pareto distribution ends up producing a

00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:39,829
lot of different ways of relating to

00:34:37,399 --> 00:34:41,679
your work so when we ask people how do

00:34:39,829 --> 00:34:44,599
you describe what you do to other people

00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:47,629
they ended up having a range of answers

00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:49,669
so in one case a US worker had told me

00:34:47,629 --> 00:34:53,480
you know I work for startup to Silicon

00:34:49,669 --> 00:34:56,000
Valley worker based in India said I'm an

00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:58,040
entrepreneur he specifically was looking

00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,170
up other tasks and sharing them with a

00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:01,210
group of people that he had effectively

00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:05,030
turned in to his side with

00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:06,920
subcontracting company and then a third

00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:09,740
worker we spoke with said they were

00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:11,300
self-employed then they saw what they

00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:13,369
were doing as a way of building out

00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:16,369
their portfolio so that they would be

00:35:13,369 --> 00:35:19,910
able to take what they were learning to

00:35:16,369 --> 00:35:21,650
another job opportunity all three of

00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:24,109
them worked on the same platform all

00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:27,950
three of them did the exact same sorts

00:35:24,109 --> 00:35:31,190
of tasks so this is a huge challenge if

00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:33,890
we're thinking about orienting to one

00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:35,720
kind of worker and addressing them and

00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:38,060
trying to set up what's the social

00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:40,640
contract or say the person who's always

00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:43,760
on or trying to limit

00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:45,800
this this world of work that's an open

00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,720
call to just the people who do it

00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:49,940
sometime

00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:52,130
in fact people worry ant to this work

00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:55,190
depending on what their life looks like

00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:58,820
in what they want not based on what the

00:35:55,190 --> 00:36:00,980
technology offers for them to do or how

00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:05,600
to think about what they're doing right

00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:07,130
so why do people do this work they have

00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:09,590
a range of reasons

00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:13,580
but calling it about seeking flexibility

00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:17,030
could not be more off it's really about

00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:20,330
agency like no matter who we talked with

00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:23,030
the three things we found in common they

00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:24,530
wanted to control their time they had

00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:26,960
schedules that they needed to navigate

00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:29,030
again anybody at home right now can

00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:32,960
relate to what it's like when you have

00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:35,900
elder care or child care and you cannot

00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:38,000
work a nine-to-five job or on somebody

00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:39,980
else's schedule or heaven forbid find

00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,260
out what hours are working next week

00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:45,350
because you have these other obligations

00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:47,360
this has always been true for the people

00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:50,120
who are working contingently in this

00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:52,250
setting they are there in part to be

00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:55,600
able to control their time because of

00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:57,740
the other constraints on their day other

00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:59,780
responsibilities other commitments and

00:36:57,740 --> 00:37:03,320
frankly other things that care about

00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:05,060
than work so the other key reason people

00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:07,460
come to this work they want to control

00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:09,080
what they work on again anybody who

00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:12,670
works on code can absolutely appreciate

00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:15,230
this they want to pursue opportunities

00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:17,900
interests that match what they care

00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:20,330
about so for example thinking about the

00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:22,820
people heavily involved in Amara which

00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:25,250
is a captioning and translation site for

00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:27,920
video many of the people we interviewed

00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:29,600
there who are regulars are interested in

00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:31,220
being there precisely because they want

00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:33,230
to work on their language skills they

00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:35,120
deeply care about their language and

00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:38,030
care about content being translated into

00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:41,390
it and they would rather do that kind of

00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:42,950
work and take a pay cut effectively then

00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:46,070
do other kinds of work that are less

00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:47,840
important to them less meaningful and

00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:51,320
then lastly and this is a really

00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:53,180
interesting dynamic many of people we

00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:53,960
interviewed wanted to control their work

00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:55,520
environment

00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:58,280
under control who they work with and

00:37:55,520 --> 00:38:01,099
that was a direct reflection of feeling

00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:01,730
excluded marginalized disenfranchised

00:38:01,099 --> 00:38:04,430
from

00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:06,920
formal employment they were people who

00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:08,660
had had sexual harassment experiences at

00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:10,670
work there were people who have to

00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:12,140
commute long distances and that's the

00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:15,619
only way they would otherwise get an

00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:19,220
office job or they have to think about

00:38:15,619 --> 00:38:20,990
where they how they identify and what it

00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:23,570
means to be uncomfortable in a work

00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:26,030
setting that that doesn't recognize or

00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:28,670
appreciate their identity so those were

00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:31,369
all reasons that people discussed their

00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:34,450
desire to control who they work with and

00:38:31,369 --> 00:38:37,960
as we're all working remotely right now

00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:40,970
the reality is that many of us are

00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:43,250
seeing our relationships in a new light

00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:45,950
so it shouldn't surprise us that the

00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:50,030
same desire to connect and collaborate

00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:52,099
in specific ways drives this group so

00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:55,250
just a couple of quotes to give you a

00:38:52,099 --> 00:38:58,339
sense of the flavor of what people were

00:38:55,250 --> 00:39:01,339
telling us when Carmela says that she

00:38:58,339 --> 00:39:04,730
sees working on the platform she worked

00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:06,680
on as a way of living her ideal life

00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:08,660
she's not talking about doing that

00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:10,670
specific work she's talking about being

00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:13,880
able to access the kind of work she can

00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:17,119
access doing work on demand and being

00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:19,700
able to continue to do her work as

00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:21,710
choreographer so in all cases the people

00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:24,619
we were talking with they didn't have

00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:27,140
one job they don't have a first or a

00:39:24,619 --> 00:39:29,540
second job they have income streams and

00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:32,420
they have projects they care about and

00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:34,550
in some cases that was also a way of

00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:37,099
economically sustaining themselves in

00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:39,410
other cases they were doing what they

00:39:37,099 --> 00:39:41,869
could to continue to doing the other

00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:45,320
things they cared about so it's a real

00:39:41,869 --> 00:39:46,730
mixture of motivations here and it's

00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:49,280
important to keep that in mind there's

00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:53,300
no one person who said what I'm doing is

00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:55,220
is awful and rote and boring many of

00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:57,170
them talked about feeling like the other

00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:59,780
opportunities available to them are

00:39:57,170 --> 00:40:01,700
quite limited so they were looking for

00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:04,990
work that was going to give them more

00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:07,759
agency control over what they were doing

00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:10,549
so one other data point

00:40:07,759 --> 00:40:14,089
share with you collaboration doesn't go

00:40:10,549 --> 00:40:16,069
away in this world and I think one of

00:40:14,089 --> 00:40:18,859
the things that I found most heartening

00:40:16,069 --> 00:40:21,380
was how much people leaned on each other

00:40:18,859 --> 00:40:23,359
built out their networks in some cases

00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:25,399
over writing the way in which the

00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:27,799
platform itself was trying to derail

00:40:25,399 --> 00:40:30,769
people connecting and they relied on

00:40:27,799 --> 00:40:33,139
those connections to be able to learn

00:40:30,769 --> 00:40:38,409
about how to do their work efficiently

00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:41,959
how to get relief from the the cognitive

00:40:38,409 --> 00:40:44,119
intensity of knowledge work and and

00:40:41,959 --> 00:40:46,339
really just to build up the same concept

00:40:44,119 --> 00:40:49,009
of social connections that any of us

00:40:46,339 --> 00:40:50,959
experienced in our work lives day to day

00:40:49,009 --> 00:40:54,130
if we're in an office setting so what

00:40:50,959 --> 00:40:56,659
you're seeing here is a network map of

00:40:54,130 --> 00:41:00,499
Amazon Mechanical Turk

00:40:56,659 --> 00:41:02,989
workforce and it's easily ten thousand

00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:04,819
strong on any given day but you can see

00:41:02,989 --> 00:41:07,669
by the colored threads there are

00:41:04,819 --> 00:41:09,739
literally no less than certainly more

00:41:07,669 --> 00:41:12,919
that we didn't capture five different

00:41:09,739 --> 00:41:15,049
fora that are places where people go for

00:41:12,919 --> 00:41:17,630
conversation and I'd point you to the

00:41:15,049 --> 00:41:20,179
paper that was led by min minion who was

00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:22,429
one of our collaborators on this

00:41:20,179 --> 00:41:24,949
research it's a beautiful paper be able

00:41:22,429 --> 00:41:26,839
to see the depth and the kinds of

00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:28,849
diverse conversations that people have

00:41:26,839 --> 00:41:30,649
in different settings so think of it as

00:41:28,849 --> 00:41:32,929
you've got a place that you go with your

00:41:30,649 --> 00:41:34,339
buddies after work for a beer and then

00:41:32,929 --> 00:41:36,919
you might have another place that you go

00:41:34,339 --> 00:41:39,799
to to be able to talk shop with people

00:41:36,919 --> 00:41:41,689
who you think are going to be your

00:41:39,799 --> 00:41:43,279
mentors and they might be different

00:41:41,689 --> 00:41:45,109
there might be different settings it

00:41:43,279 --> 00:41:48,219
might be different people the same

00:41:45,109 --> 00:41:52,309
dynamic plays out in these on-demand

00:41:48,219 --> 00:41:57,639
online service information service work

00:41:52,309 --> 00:42:00,829
because jobs so that connection isn't

00:41:57,639 --> 00:42:03,259
trivial and I think all of us can right

00:42:00,829 --> 00:42:05,599
now relate relate to what it is we're

00:42:03,259 --> 00:42:07,609
getting from our colleagues when we're

00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:10,880
able to have a side chat during a

00:42:07,609 --> 00:42:13,249
lecture and we're feeling like we want

00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:15,019
to comment and we we basically want to

00:42:13,249 --> 00:42:18,139
be able to have a little bit of back

00:42:15,019 --> 00:42:20,239
channel everybody in this setting is

00:42:18,139 --> 00:42:21,040
effectively turning to each other for

00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:24,730
that moment

00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:26,170
support and this quote just illustrates

00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:29,170
sometimes it's literally to keep you

00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:30,820
going so you can keep doing your job you

00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:33,190
know hope plugging in your headphones

00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:35,200
and you know being able to talk all

00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:37,050
night to stay awake to keep doing the

00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:39,610
work that you need to do terminal living

00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:41,530
so where do we go from here you know

00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:44,380
this is the overview this is what

00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:47,680
on-demand work looks like it becomes

00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:50,890
ghost work when we as customers and

00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:54,730
those companies don't know how to show

00:42:50,890 --> 00:42:56,560
our value how much we depend on those

00:42:54,730 --> 00:42:59,470
workers when we literally can't

00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:02,110
translate our current contemporary

00:42:59,470 --> 00:43:04,060
approach to supporting work into what it

00:43:02,110 --> 00:43:07,270
looks like to support somebody who's

00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:11,710
working on task by task project by Trump

00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:15,120
project so what we need to learn to do

00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:18,280
is to think about how do we support

00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:20,710
employment if it's organized where

00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:22,690
there's no single worksite now it's the

00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:24,550
time for us to all check in and realize

00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:27,400
none of us are really at the same

00:43:24,550 --> 00:43:29,830
physical work site so what is it that we

00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:32,740
would need to be able to fully bring

00:43:29,830 --> 00:43:35,800
ourselves to a project and task to do

00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:38,350
our best work and if you don't have a

00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:42,240
single employer of record which in the

00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:44,650
United States means you don't have a

00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:47,200
champion for your benefits whether

00:43:44,650 --> 00:43:49,770
that's access to health care or to be

00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:55,360
able to have a manageable approach to

00:43:49,770 --> 00:43:59,380
your retirement funding sick leave child

00:43:55,360 --> 00:44:02,410
care then what would we need to do to

00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:03,880
think about making sure those benefits

00:44:02,410 --> 00:44:05,590
that we associate with full-time

00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:09,250
employment are something that are

00:44:05,590 --> 00:44:12,570
readily readily available to anybody

00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:12,570
who's working

00:44:13,349 --> 00:44:18,359
there's no unifying perfectional

00:44:16,019 --> 00:44:20,940
identity or career here so what does it

00:44:18,359 --> 00:44:24,239
mean if you're working on a project or a

00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:26,309
task but in fact two years from now you

00:44:24,239 --> 00:44:29,430
might be working on different set of

00:44:26,309 --> 00:44:31,950
projects and tasks so being a coder is a

00:44:29,430 --> 00:44:34,710
really interesting identity it's kind of

00:44:31,950 --> 00:44:36,809
a career at some point if you think

00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:38,789
about the history of most software

00:44:36,809 --> 00:44:42,869
development there are different moments

00:44:38,789 --> 00:44:45,180
where the parts of debugging become

00:44:42,869 --> 00:44:48,119
critical to be able to get code out or

00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:50,039
usability testing those may never have

00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:52,859
specific professional identities or

00:44:50,039 --> 00:44:56,640
career tracks they're just as valuable

00:44:52,859 --> 00:44:58,200
to what it is that we do what do we do

00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:01,380
if we have a globally networked

00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:04,099
independent workforce today I think

00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:06,809
we're experiencing exactly that we're

00:45:04,099 --> 00:45:08,789
somewhat dependent in the sense that we

00:45:06,809 --> 00:45:11,369
have employers in some cases you're

00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:13,920
structuring our work in other cases many

00:45:11,369 --> 00:45:16,979
of us are literally rethinking what kind

00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:19,200
of work on today what needs to be done

00:45:16,979 --> 00:45:21,749
today to address the pandemic for

00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:23,039
example for example we don't do that

00:45:21,749 --> 00:45:24,749
work independently

00:45:23,039 --> 00:45:27,359
we are always networking with other

00:45:24,749 --> 00:45:31,349
people to accomplish something so what

00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:34,049
would we need as citizens as fellow

00:45:31,349 --> 00:45:38,460
workers to be able to have support to

00:45:34,049 --> 00:45:39,900
make that sustainable and I think Joe

00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:41,880
Pesci put this on the table the

00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:43,769
beginning of our conversation how do we

00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:47,130
think about an international standard

00:45:43,769 --> 00:45:50,279
for on-demand work so that we know that

00:45:47,130 --> 00:45:53,249
there isn't a country you can take your

00:45:50,279 --> 00:45:56,249
projects and tasks you that undermines

00:45:53,249 --> 00:45:57,989
what other workers around the globe are

00:45:56,249 --> 00:46:01,680
going to need to make their work

00:45:57,989 --> 00:46:04,369
sustainable right now we don't have an

00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:08,819
economic model for how to value

00:46:04,369 --> 00:46:10,769
collective contributions to creating

00:46:08,819 --> 00:46:15,029
projects and tasks we know how to pay

00:46:10,769 --> 00:46:17,160
individuals as employees for a piece of

00:46:15,029 --> 00:46:19,650
their work but if more and more of our

00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:21,839
work effectively becomes disaggregated

00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:24,380
into a series of projects and tasks what

00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:27,030
will it look like to fully be able to

00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:29,640
account for the value

00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:31,740
of a collective effort that's really the

00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:35,460
task before us when we're thinking about

00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:38,340
this mechanism that can source scheduled

00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:40,710
manage chip and Bill tasks and projects

00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:41,460
and pieces in a way the dismantle is a

00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:45,060
full-time job

00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:48,720
and then lastly right now there are no

00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:51,780
laws arguably no laws that govern how to

00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:55,110
manage on-demand employment we have

00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:57,390
classification systems in every country

00:46:55,110 --> 00:46:59,940
the United States has a full-time

00:46:57,390 --> 00:47:03,120
employee classification and effectively

00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:04,800
an other category and we have yet to

00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:07,050
really come to grips with what it means

00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:11,840
to be doing projects and tasks and have

00:47:07,050 --> 00:47:14,220
myriad economic streams that are

00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:17,190
certainly our economic activity that

00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:19,410
look much more like India look much more

00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:22,170
like the rest of the world where there

00:47:19,410 --> 00:47:24,810
is no formal employment but there's tons

00:47:22,170 --> 00:47:28,230
of economic activity and often that work

00:47:24,810 --> 00:47:31,440
is service work so we have before us

00:47:28,230 --> 00:47:34,830
this opportunity to think what kinds of

00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:36,240
laws do we want to govern work for all

00:47:34,830 --> 00:47:39,060
workers no matter of their

00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:41,070
classification so what does this have to

00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:43,350
do a contact tracing and now I want to

00:47:41,070 --> 00:47:46,500
open it up as quickly as possible with

00:47:43,350 --> 00:47:48,360
the time we have left when the

00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:50,640
conversation on automating contact

00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:54,060
tracing started bubbling up about a

00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:56,970
month ago what struck me was that many

00:47:54,060 --> 00:48:00,150
folks in tax in tech were completely

00:47:56,970 --> 00:48:02,550
understandably and beautifully bringing

00:48:00,150 --> 00:48:04,530
what they have to the table which is

00:48:02,550 --> 00:48:07,050
coming up with tech that might solve a

00:48:04,530 --> 00:48:09,780
problem I think the biggest challenge is

00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:12,900
that contact tracing as a way of

00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:15,630
understanding who might be infected and

00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:18,570
then contacting that person and finding

00:48:15,630 --> 00:48:21,180
out who might they having crossed paths

00:48:18,570 --> 00:48:23,520
with engaged with that needs to know

00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:26,460
that they may have been exposed to a

00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:29,520
contagious disease this is a hundred

00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:34,550
years old as a health practice in

00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:37,050
epidemiology it has always relied on

00:48:34,550 --> 00:48:40,530
myriad community health workers

00:48:37,050 --> 00:48:43,350
volunteers professionals in medical

00:48:40,530 --> 00:48:46,110
is racing out quite literally two

00:48:43,350 --> 00:48:47,580
individuals and having a private of an

00:48:46,110 --> 00:48:50,310
intimate conversation with somebody

00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:52,980
about something incredibly scary which

00:48:50,310 --> 00:48:55,320
is potentially having contracted a

00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:58,080
container contagious deadly disease I

00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:59,640
know about this work from the 1990s I

00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:02,940
used to be a community health sir there

00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:05,220
with stoppage project in San Francisco

00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:08,640
that specifically worked with HIV and

00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:12,000
AIDS try to talk with people who might

00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:15,120
not be comfortable sharing their HIV

00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:17,280
status or their sex practices it's

00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:20,520
incredibly challenging work to get

00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:23,100
somebody in a moment where they're we're

00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:26,520
telling them you might have a dangerous

00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:28,770
disease to have the calm and wherewithal

00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:32,220
to sit them down and talk them through

00:49:28,770 --> 00:49:36,330
their calendar so contact tracing can

00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:39,840
absolutely be automated in part it will

00:49:36,330 --> 00:49:42,510
be so wonderful to have machine learning

00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:45,600
that could recognize where are their

00:49:42,510 --> 00:49:49,020
cases bubbling up so that we would know

00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:51,120
which Community Survey contract contact

00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:55,320
tracers community members would be the

00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:57,900
best to route calls to to be able to

00:49:55,320 --> 00:50:01,020
contact people and say okay I'm in your

00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:04,470
community I speak your language I know

00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:08,250
who you are in my neighborhood and I

00:50:04,470 --> 00:50:09,750
want to help you find health support so

00:50:08,250 --> 00:50:11,670
that the toughest part of contact

00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:14,820
tracing is not the data gathering it's

00:50:11,670 --> 00:50:18,180
not data collection it is a moment of

00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:21,360
hard conversations about brokering trust

00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:23,970
between individuals and the hardest part

00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:26,010
of contact tracing it's the moment when

00:50:23,970 --> 00:50:29,160
you have to tell somebody you're sick

00:50:26,010 --> 00:50:31,350
and I need you to go to a quarantine

00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:33,870
center because you live in an

00:50:31,350 --> 00:50:36,410
environment that doesn't afford you the

00:50:33,870 --> 00:50:39,660
luxury the space to self quarantine

00:50:36,410 --> 00:50:43,020
there's no way we can automate that

00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:44,550
process and importantly it's not that

00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:46,440
there isn't a place an absolutely

00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:47,880
privacy should be a priority you just

00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:51,960
had a beautiful fellow talk about this

00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:54,420
two days ago the challenges Trust is the

00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:56,880
higher priority in this

00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:59,599
environment in this equation because at

00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:03,000
some point a health worker needs to know

00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:05,910
who they need to contact to be able to

00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:08,339
reach out to them and get health care to

00:51:05,910 --> 00:51:09,930
them that's how this process works

00:51:08,339 --> 00:51:14,880
everywhere around the world where we've

00:51:09,930 --> 00:51:16,440
combated a contagious disease and my my

00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:19,079
concern is that we're building

00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:22,740
technology in the abstract as though it

00:51:19,079 --> 00:51:25,319
could fit in some way with this process

00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:28,200
that's a deeply human process and I'm

00:51:25,319 --> 00:51:30,750
putting out an urgent call to everybody

00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:33,599
listening watching if you do

00:51:30,750 --> 00:51:35,400
human-computer interaction if you know

00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:38,849
how to think about systems that are

00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:41,010
assistive and supportive we need you we

00:51:38,849 --> 00:51:42,900
need you to come to the floor so that we

00:51:41,010 --> 00:51:46,470
can move forward I'm building out the

00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:49,890
tools that contact tracers mean so with

00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:54,270
that we'll me and and open it up for

00:51:49,890 --> 00:51:57,240
some conversation awesome Meredith thank

00:51:54,270 --> 00:52:02,220
you very much I think I probably speak

00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:03,390
for everyone in which the implications

00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:05,700
does the work that you're talking about

00:52:03,390 --> 00:52:08,250
are so enormous and so huge that I keep

00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:09,510
tripping over sort of I want to ask a

00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:11,250
question and then I'm like ah but the

00:52:09,510 --> 00:52:14,160
meta question are but the meta question

00:52:11,250 --> 00:52:16,260
and so I keep sort of getting lost in

00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:18,359
that I want to start by giving a couple

00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:21,329
of questions which came through on

00:52:18,359 --> 00:52:25,500
Twitter our first one is from Wendy

00:52:21,329 --> 00:52:27,589
Norris who's a boulder and her question

00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:31,559
I think talks a lot to one of the

00:52:27,589 --> 00:52:34,020
questions that we have Mozilla I brought

00:52:31,559 --> 00:52:36,180
up common voice as an example of or

00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:39,420
possibly a counterexample when we

00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:41,069
started this and she asks is volunteers

00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:42,690
social good motivated human

00:52:41,069 --> 00:52:44,670
computational work like digital

00:52:42,690 --> 00:52:47,280
humanitarian crisis response or citizen

00:52:44,670 --> 00:52:49,170
science is that also ghost work or is

00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:51,599
this fundamentally about the

00:52:49,170 --> 00:52:53,040
entanglement of money and labor and

00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:55,380
power and is that the differentiation

00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:58,970
that you're trying together I love this

00:52:55,380 --> 00:53:01,559
question because I think in many ways

00:52:58,970 --> 00:53:03,450
the simple answer is I almost wish we

00:53:01,559 --> 00:53:05,280
hadn't put ghost work out there as a

00:53:03,450 --> 00:53:07,440
term because it can be a bit distracting

00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:09,540
yeah it is meant

00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:11,400
to very much connect the world of

00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:15,210
citizen science is familiar to all of us

00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:17,910
who do crowdsourcing and think about a

00:53:15,210 --> 00:53:21,240
kind of collective approach to projects

00:53:17,910 --> 00:53:24,870
and to recognize we often have a mix of

00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:28,440
volunteers and paid work in in the mitts

00:53:24,870 --> 00:53:30,330
of those projects and tasks ghost work

00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:32,490
is meant to call out what happens when

00:53:30,330 --> 00:53:34,440
we stop valuing the range of

00:53:32,490 --> 00:53:36,810
contributions and then start creating

00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:39,480
hierarchies of who's more important than

00:53:36,810 --> 00:53:41,580
someone else so it you know me as

00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:44,070
Wikipedia as an example we have so much

00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:46,200
good research on Wikipedia and we tend

00:53:44,070 --> 00:53:49,320
to think about Wikipedians and editors

00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:52,190
holding this very specific role they're

00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:55,220
the pinnacle and we tend to think about

00:53:52,190 --> 00:53:55,220
you know

00:53:56,429 --> 00:54:00,929
time on edit

00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:08,130
and I don't tend to think what would you

00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:12,920
do if you didn't have that critter

00:54:08,130 --> 00:54:14,800
distribute John of people who do want

00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:16,869
often

00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:21,859
yes

00:54:16,869 --> 00:54:24,980
it wouldn't exist it's so hard for us to

00:54:21,859 --> 00:54:27,920
fully take in wow I am just as reliant

00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:30,829
on somebody who's not doing too much but

00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:33,550
but contributing as the you know the

00:54:30,829 --> 00:54:33,550
Star editor

00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:40,560
and we could be evident were differently

00:54:38,070 --> 00:54:44,280
indebted to them that were equally and

00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:46,560
added to them yeah that's a nice segue

00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:48,930
into the second question I want to frame

00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:50,430
it with original with with my notes on a

00:54:48,930 --> 00:54:52,740
question and then I'm gonna go into one

00:54:50,430 --> 00:54:54,240
that someone else asked and that's the

00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:55,710
question about minimum wage and you I

00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:58,100
think you alluded to this in talking

00:54:55,710 --> 00:55:02,130
particularly about the global question

00:54:58,100 --> 00:55:05,610
and I think there is a core sort of very

00:55:02,130 --> 00:55:08,070
practical question which is should I

00:55:05,610 --> 00:55:10,910
ethically is speaking as someone living

00:55:08,070 --> 00:55:10,910
in California

00:55:14,119 --> 00:55:19,440
should I be attempting to do the if I'm

00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:21,359
using such ghost workers such

00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:25,130
crowdsourcing work to generate the

00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:25,130
intellectual property that I

00:55:28,510 --> 00:55:35,180
by you should we be trying to hit a

00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:38,600
minimum way

00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:41,330
and what the assumptions there around

00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:46,730
minimum wage I had a conversation in

00:55:41,330 --> 00:55:49,360
December with myself and our principal

00:55:46,730 --> 00:55:49,360
Forsyte

00:55:49,539 --> 00:55:54,950
slant

00:55:51,830 --> 00:55:56,950
this principal foresight researcher

00:55:54,950 --> 00:56:00,950
until I forget exactly what the title is

00:55:56,950 --> 00:56:02,000
Avery and we were talking to the CEO of

00:56:00,950 --> 00:56:05,210
Reve calm

00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:07,880
Jason chick Allah now and he was making

00:56:05,210 --> 00:56:10,900
the point that for a lot of his workers

00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:10,900
my don't want it I'm not trying to

00:56:12,230 --> 00:56:14,560
then door

00:56:14,590 --> 00:56:19,350
frame it I'm just

00:56:17,610 --> 00:56:22,650
coming the

00:56:19,350 --> 00:56:24,330
the framing he was making a point for a

00:56:22,650 --> 00:56:27,600
lot of the workers who work on Rev comm

00:56:24,330 --> 00:56:29,610
doing a transcription of audio they are

00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:31,560
disabled and he felt that they were able

00:56:29,610 --> 00:56:33,620
to

00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:36,480
this

00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:39,220
we'll make revenue

00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:44,829
make money through

00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:47,050
rev com that may have been below minimum

00:56:44,829 --> 00:56:47,680
wage in terms of shared dollars per hour

00:56:47,050 --> 00:56:50,290
right

00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:52,890
but given the availability of work for

00:56:50,290 --> 00:56:52,890
someone who's to say

00:56:56,480 --> 00:57:00,320
not it

00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:03,830
we'll sleep

00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:05,390
the home that this was you know it falls

00:57:03,830 --> 00:57:08,030
strongly in me better than nothing

00:57:05,390 --> 00:57:09,740
category he was actually doing a sort of

00:57:08,030 --> 00:57:12,610
public service by this and I mean I'm

00:57:09,740 --> 00:57:12,610
like like answer

00:57:12,890 --> 00:57:17,960
a bunch of

00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:19,630
famous hip

00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:21,680
but that

00:57:19,630 --> 00:57:24,500
sort of the framing

00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:26,569
I thought was important yeah and Aaron

00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:29,329
Quigley who is I believe in Scotland

00:57:26,569 --> 00:57:31,750
being continually just delayed on his

00:57:29,329 --> 00:57:31,750
way to see

00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:36,019
Neal a stomach

00:57:37,530 --> 00:57:41,539
the way that

00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:43,099
he framed this question

00:57:41,539 --> 00:57:45,109
Jan was Taurus where the groups of

00:57:43,099 --> 00:57:47,119
pursued low wage cases against platform

00:57:45,109 --> 00:57:49,130
owners to recognize their workers output

00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:51,279
work which is protected in law so I

00:57:49,130 --> 00:57:51,279
think

00:57:52,119 --> 00:57:54,900
both the

00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:59,930
little question here

00:57:57,850 --> 00:58:01,910
and then also

00:57:59,930 --> 00:58:05,150
the ethical question

00:58:01,910 --> 00:58:07,760
so said that that whole chunk to you is

00:58:05,150 --> 00:58:09,620
a big one yeah no I mean I think one of

00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:12,160
the biggest challenges is that if we

00:58:09,620 --> 00:58:12,160
think about

00:58:13,190 --> 00:58:16,450
the structure

00:58:21,070 --> 00:58:27,430
wages whether they're aller hourly or

00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:30,400
salaries there's a certain assumption

00:58:27,430 --> 00:58:33,120
about and I think we have to we have to

00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:33,120
really surface

00:58:33,550 --> 00:58:36,540
the assumption

00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:44,900
there is an employer

00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:46,910
there's one employer and we also make an

00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:51,070
assumption that there's a certain number

00:58:46,910 --> 00:58:51,070
of hours that we can equate with

00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:57,080
all of

00:58:54,570 --> 00:58:59,560
full out

00:58:57,080 --> 00:59:05,050
but that's nice

00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:07,570
maseri so necessary for someone to have

00:59:05,050 --> 00:59:08,880
the right to lay claim to a certain

00:59:07,570 --> 00:59:11,929
level of

00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:11,929
[Music]

00:59:13,470 --> 00:59:16,310
Norma quartern

00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:22,619
and I think

00:59:20,069 --> 00:59:25,440
it's fascinating to me about on-demand

00:59:22,619 --> 00:59:28,680
work and this mechanism for distributing

00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:32,519
work is it blows all of that up it

00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:35,940
literally it relies on a model of the

00:59:32,519 --> 00:59:39,959
business model but also a technological

00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:43,799
model of aggregation yeah so that it's a

00:59:39,959 --> 00:59:45,479
whole point is that I am not that

00:59:43,799 --> 00:59:47,130
concerned with getting any one result

00:59:45,479 --> 00:59:49,440
I'm really concerned with getting

00:59:47,130 --> 00:59:52,829
weighted results or being able to see

00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:56,369
many examples in the benefit of these

00:59:52,829 --> 00:59:58,829
platforms is that I am drawing on this

00:59:56,369 --> 01:00:01,469
pool this Commons so what are the

00:59:58,829 --> 01:00:05,039
economic implications of that that means

01:00:01,469 --> 01:00:07,949
I can no longer easily sort through who

01:00:05,039 --> 01:00:10,289
deserves minimum wage and who would pay

01:00:07,949 --> 01:00:12,059
for it I literally have to move to this

01:00:10,289 --> 01:00:13,799
model what I think is really productive

01:00:12,059 --> 01:00:18,269
of cost sharing

01:00:13,799 --> 01:00:22,739
you have many firms benefiting from the

01:00:18,269 --> 01:00:24,359
availability of a commons of workers let

01:00:22,739 --> 01:00:26,910
me say that again and considering how

01:00:24,359 --> 01:00:29,759
our economy literally for the last in

01:00:26,910 --> 01:00:31,979
the United States the last ten years

01:00:29,759 --> 01:00:35,609
depending on the Economist you believe

01:00:31,979 --> 01:00:38,719
in read that most of our employment has

01:00:35,609 --> 01:00:41,969
come from temp work it's come from

01:00:38,719 --> 01:00:43,739
contractor and work if we know that for

01:00:41,969 --> 01:00:46,079
the most part sets of firms are

01:00:43,739 --> 01:00:49,680
benefiting from every two or three years

01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:52,140
changing out their workforce then no one

01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:55,619
employer is benefiting from this system

01:00:52,140 --> 01:00:57,779
all of them are and so what would it

01:00:55,619 --> 01:01:01,799
mean to think about cost sharing that

01:00:57,779 --> 01:01:04,489
puts the expense of underwriting the

01:01:01,799 --> 01:01:07,489
availability of this pool of workers

01:01:04,489 --> 01:01:07,489
across

01:01:09,509 --> 01:01:12,289
lawyers

01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:17,790
rather

01:01:14,550 --> 01:01:21,240
than saying this employer is responsible

01:01:17,790 --> 01:01:23,730
right now right now we really do work as

01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:26,700
though and everything is built to incent

01:01:23,730 --> 01:01:29,970
working toward as an employer you are

01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:31,980
only responsible for your employee that

01:01:29,970 --> 01:01:34,610
made a lot of sense if an employer was

01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:34,610
retaining

01:01:35,580 --> 01:01:42,970
ploy II

01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:45,610
for 20-plus years that makes no sense in

01:01:42,970 --> 01:01:47,140
a world where literally every hour you

01:01:45,610 --> 01:01:50,610
might be drawing on different sets of

01:01:47,140 --> 01:01:50,610
workers to produce that

01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:57,180
you

01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:57,180
for the question

01:01:58,220 --> 01:02:10,780
in ways that specifically to me then the

01:02:03,289 --> 01:02:10,780
argument becomes we clearly need a floor

01:02:11,780 --> 01:02:13,840
you

01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:16,560
and

01:02:16,970 --> 01:02:22,299
it could Inari

01:02:19,390 --> 01:02:25,210
don't we make in the book we call it a

01:02:22,299 --> 01:02:28,619
retainer it makes a ton of sense to make

01:02:25,210 --> 01:02:31,000
sure everybody has access to a base wage

01:02:28,619 --> 01:02:33,490
because in fact you're trying to retain

01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:35,380
people to be available to you so if you

01:02:33,490 --> 01:02:37,809
want them to be available to you not

01:02:35,380 --> 01:02:41,260
today but tomorrow what do you do if

01:02:37,809 --> 01:02:42,789
you're trying if you need a lawyer and I

01:02:41,260 --> 01:02:45,970
think this is what's ironic cuz we have

01:02:42,789 --> 01:02:48,400
models for this it's it's it means that

01:02:45,970 --> 01:02:50,170
if I want a lawyer tomorrow I'm going to

01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:53,140
pay a retainer today so I can get to

01:02:50,170 --> 01:02:56,680
them tomorrow employers should be doing

01:02:53,140 --> 01:03:00,369
the exact same thing of workforces they

01:02:56,680 --> 01:03:03,460
want to access so that could look like

01:03:00,369 --> 01:03:06,640
saying and this is this to me is why

01:03:03,460 --> 01:03:08,589
this is a global conversation it could

01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:11,319
look like saying you know when I'm

01:03:08,589 --> 01:03:13,440
paying somebody in the Czech Republic

01:03:11,319 --> 01:03:15,730
for this work that needs to be done

01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:19,990
assuming that living in the Czech

01:03:15,730 --> 01:03:23,380
Republic is what I have to evaluate in

01:03:19,990 --> 01:03:25,900
terms of what kind of money I pay that

01:03:23,380 --> 01:03:27,940
makes no sense that makes no sense if

01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:29,740
I'm imagining the work that somebody's

01:03:27,940 --> 01:03:31,210
doing the Czech Republic is the

01:03:29,740 --> 01:03:32,380
equivalent of work that I might be

01:03:31,210 --> 01:03:34,539
getting from somebody living in

01:03:32,380 --> 01:03:37,809
Louisville Kentucky so we can have an

01:03:34,539 --> 01:03:40,630
honest conversation and I you know I'll

01:03:37,809 --> 01:03:42,670
say very plainly an honest conversation

01:03:40,630 --> 01:03:46,769
about how we still allow labor arbitrage

01:03:42,670 --> 01:03:47,980
which is effectively the fallout of

01:03:46,769 --> 01:03:51,960
colonialism

01:03:47,980 --> 01:03:55,150
it's the perpetuation of the capacity of

01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:58,259
an imperialist state being able to go

01:03:55,150 --> 01:04:01,750
somewhere else and draw labor cheaply

01:03:58,259 --> 01:04:04,529
that's all it is you know any of the

01:04:01,750 --> 01:04:07,990
conditions that make life cheaper or

01:04:04,529 --> 01:04:09,809
employment cheaper labor cheaper in the

01:04:07,990 --> 01:04:13,390
Philippines versus the United States

01:04:09,809 --> 01:04:15,789
that's not coincidence so how do we come

01:04:13,390 --> 01:04:18,190
to grips with oh now we're in a world

01:04:15,789 --> 01:04:21,119
where what somebody's doing particular

01:04:18,190 --> 01:04:21,119
we're talking about

01:04:22,150 --> 01:04:24,569
um

01:04:24,740 --> 01:04:31,310
often work that requires localization

01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:33,770
where the value is somebody knows the

01:04:31,310 --> 01:04:36,490
language culturally or literally and

01:04:33,770 --> 01:04:36,490
what

01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:42,230
paying them

01:04:39,450 --> 01:04:42,230
to do

01:04:42,290 --> 01:04:49,500
this help me

01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:52,860
open market so that's the place where I

01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:56,970
think we do not yet have the economic

01:04:52,860 --> 01:05:00,570
models that can direct us in how would

01:04:56,970 --> 01:05:03,090
we create those standards and wage

01:05:00,570 --> 01:05:05,760
systems around that but I will just one

01:05:03,090 --> 01:05:09,600
last point on this we also have to stop

01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:11,760
looking to markets to solve this problem

01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:12,960
you know contract first you check them

01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:14,730
out you see if they work

01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:16,500
or you keep it on spec because you don't

01:05:14,730 --> 01:05:19,920
know if you're gonna actually get off

01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:21,450
the ground and you don't really hire

01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:23,670
anybody full-time until you'd have to

01:05:21,450 --> 01:05:27,210
like is that not the default model

01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:30,630
attack it is so you know many companies

01:05:27,210 --> 01:05:32,910
operate the same way and it has circled

01:05:30,630 --> 01:05:34,500
around to really limit their effects for

01:05:32,910 --> 01:05:34,920
extended periods of time when they want

01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:37,590
to

01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:40,340
so I mentally believe this is a moment

01:05:37,590 --> 01:05:43,320
to be able to say all companies

01:05:40,340 --> 01:05:45,600
benefiting from the availability of this

01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:48,510
Commons this workforce pay your fair

01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:52,140
share that includes public sector in

01:05:48,510 --> 01:05:55,890
them that that includes workers so we're

01:05:52,140 --> 01:05:59,810
just not dieting we're not sharing in in

01:05:55,890 --> 01:05:59,810
the costs and the benefits equally

01:06:00,490 --> 01:06:05,580
but we could I'd like yes exactly

01:06:05,790 --> 01:06:12,220
yes there was a nice comment that

01:06:10,780 --> 01:06:13,960
someone put about I really appreciate

01:06:12,220 --> 01:06:15,010
all the systems historical and present

01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:16,750
that Mary is bringing into this

01:06:15,010 --> 01:06:17,800
discussion unapologetically and I'm like

01:06:16,750 --> 01:06:21,150
yes that's exactly it

01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:23,950
I mean the fundamental assumption that

01:06:21,150 --> 01:06:25,510
the the fundamental assumption behind a

01:06:23,950 --> 01:06:28,660
minimum wage is that you can multiply it

01:06:25,510 --> 01:06:31,630
by 40 right like and if we take away

01:06:28,660 --> 01:06:35,349
that assumption all of a sudden the the

01:06:31,630 --> 01:06:39,460
math becomes very very different but I'd

01:06:35,349 --> 01:06:41,470
like to continue with with there's two

01:06:39,460 --> 01:06:43,030
more questions that have popped up that

01:06:41,470 --> 01:06:44,710
I think are irrelevant enough if that's

01:06:43,030 --> 01:06:47,400
okay

01:06:44,710 --> 01:06:47,400
with you

01:06:57,200 --> 01:07:07,500
the e the next question which is the

01:07:05,220 --> 01:07:09,920
biggest long-term risk for the eroding

01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:09,920
of working

01:07:10,180 --> 01:07:13,520
condition

01:07:11,950 --> 01:07:17,970
tunes

01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:19,950
is it the different standard

01:07:17,970 --> 01:07:22,380
it's between

01:07:19,950 --> 01:07:24,270
country's or a steady stream of new

01:07:22,380 --> 01:07:26,340
workers willing to start out almost for

01:07:24,270 --> 01:07:29,840
free to get a foothold to get exposure

01:07:26,340 --> 01:07:29,840
and I think that talks to your

01:07:30,070 --> 01:07:34,090
your point we are about the different

01:07:32,650 --> 01:07:37,350
reasons that people were doing things

01:07:34,090 --> 01:07:37,350
when you have these

01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:41,049
three

01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:43,000
Bulls have been entrepreneurs and

01:07:41,049 --> 01:07:45,250
working for a start-up in Silicon Valley

01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:48,730
and self-employed building skills for my

01:07:45,250 --> 01:07:52,589
business and I'm reminded of the perhaps

01:07:48,730 --> 01:07:52,589
apocryphal conversation that JFK

01:07:53,130 --> 01:07:58,859
and you have

01:07:55,690 --> 01:07:58,859
with the janitor

01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:08,580
NASA in 1962 with

01:08:06,330 --> 01:08:11,000
some JFK ask the janitor hey what are

01:08:08,580 --> 01:08:14,020
you doing and

01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:15,849
he's like I'm help

01:08:14,020 --> 01:08:18,350
we put a mantle

01:08:15,849 --> 01:08:20,380
a moon

01:08:18,350 --> 01:08:20,380
Oh

01:08:20,850 --> 01:08:26,440
and

01:08:22,839 --> 01:08:28,299
and there is something I'm particular

01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:29,259
mission driven organization like Mozilla

01:08:28,299 --> 01:08:32,739
I mean I think there are there are

01:08:29,259 --> 01:08:35,639
obviously other implications there but I

01:08:32,739 --> 01:08:35,639
think that role

01:08:36,980 --> 01:08:44,699
the agency and

01:08:41,370 --> 01:08:47,489
I mean I think the store

01:08:44,699 --> 01:08:50,670
to the volunteer question that someone

01:08:47,489 --> 01:08:52,259
that Wendy Norris asked earlier what

01:08:50,670 --> 01:08:55,250
does it mean when someone is recording

01:08:52,259 --> 01:08:55,250
their language

01:08:56,889 --> 01:09:03,699
particularly

01:08:58,940 --> 01:09:03,699
it's sort of school language

01:09:03,750 --> 01:09:12,569
dror or to suggest that it's either a

01:09:08,190 --> 01:09:15,299
matter of getting all employees are all

01:09:12,569 --> 01:09:19,950
employers all firms companies to agree

01:09:15,299 --> 01:09:22,890
on you know raising the floor or its

01:09:19,950 --> 01:09:24,569
workers fault when they push push each

01:09:22,890 --> 01:09:27,210
other down below the floor

01:09:24,569 --> 01:09:29,759
that's not where wage setting it should

01:09:27,210 --> 01:09:32,819
happen it should happen as a matter of

01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:35,850
policy and regulation so again we have

01:09:32,819 --> 01:09:38,970
minimum wage precisely as a measure to

01:09:35,850 --> 01:09:42,319
say no company should get away with

01:09:38,970 --> 01:09:45,120
pricing things so that it means that

01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:46,470
someone would feel either coerced or

01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:48,630
they literally have no other choices

01:09:46,470 --> 01:09:50,910
because they live in a what's called a

01:09:48,630 --> 01:09:53,850
monopsony where there's really only one

01:09:50,910 --> 01:09:57,390
company town who is there as a as an

01:09:53,850 --> 01:09:57,900
employer setting you know setting the

01:09:57,390 --> 01:10:00,180
bar

01:09:57,900 --> 01:10:03,810
it is literally to say everybody

01:10:00,180 --> 01:10:06,690
deserves a certain amount of recognition

01:10:03,810 --> 01:10:10,470
for the work they do our problem is that

01:10:06,690 --> 01:10:14,550
we are working with a factory floor

01:10:10,470 --> 01:10:17,190
model for how to set that floor how to

01:10:14,550 --> 01:10:20,100
set that base wage so the base wage

01:10:17,190 --> 01:10:23,340
could look like you know any working

01:10:20,100 --> 01:10:25,140
adult and they have families to support

01:10:23,340 --> 01:10:25,830
but any working adult what do they need

01:10:25,140 --> 01:10:28,590
the work

01:10:25,830 --> 01:10:31,470
they do need they do need health care it

01:10:28,590 --> 01:10:34,200
turns out and in fact it will destroy us

01:10:31,470 --> 01:10:35,820
all that we don't all have access to

01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:41,940
health care

01:10:35,820 --> 01:10:44,070
. everybody needs access to family leave

01:10:41,940 --> 01:10:46,320
sick leave a chance to step away from

01:10:44,070 --> 01:10:47,910
their work because in fact you can't be

01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:48,620
effective working if you don't step away

01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:50,970
from it

01:10:48,620 --> 01:10:54,180
everybody needs access to a plan that

01:10:50,970 --> 01:10:56,160
helps them save for retirement because

01:10:54,180 --> 01:10:59,520
we can do that more efficiently together

01:10:56,160 --> 01:11:01,950
then separately everybody deserves

01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:04,430
access and really everybody benefits

01:11:01,950 --> 01:11:07,170
from access to continuing education

01:11:04,430 --> 01:11:08,910
those are some basics we outline it in

01:11:07,170 --> 01:11:10,890
the book like those are basic things

01:11:08,910 --> 01:11:13,950
that every working adult needs to be

01:11:10,890 --> 01:11:17,400
able to contribute so that means if they

01:11:13,950 --> 01:11:20,130
had those pieces of the puzzle that were

01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:22,470
part of and funded by every single

01:11:20,130 --> 01:11:24,720
company that wants to draw a value from

01:11:22,470 --> 01:11:27,660
a worker they had to pay up to make sure

01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:30,390
that was available to the worker coming

01:11:27,660 --> 01:11:31,860
after them right they're gonna drain

01:11:30,390 --> 01:11:34,640
that resource they've been fill it back

01:11:31,860 --> 01:11:38,910
up then we could start talking about

01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:40,890
setting wages in a marketplace because

01:11:38,910 --> 01:11:43,470
right now we're we're treating wages as

01:11:40,890 --> 01:11:47,970
though it's somehow set by the market as

01:11:43,470 --> 01:11:51,620
opposed to history what do I pay a

01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:54,870
particular person who who's the janitor

01:11:51,620 --> 01:11:56,370
instead of the rocket scientist like

01:11:54,870 --> 01:11:59,220
those are moments where we should step

01:11:56,370 --> 01:12:01,620
back and see wages are never set by the

01:11:59,220 --> 01:12:03,300
market in and of itself they're set by

01:12:01,620 --> 01:12:06,450
all of our cultural assumptions about

01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:09,590
who's valuable otherwise we would be

01:12:06,450 --> 01:12:13,020
paying teachers and childcare workers

01:12:09,590 --> 01:12:14,880
through the roof or we'd have to admit

01:12:13,020 --> 01:12:17,400
we don't care very much at all about

01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:19,050
children one of the two one of the two

01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:21,900
things is going on with their they're

01:12:19,050 --> 01:12:25,080
paid so poorly so it really means let's

01:12:21,900 --> 01:12:28,260
stop blaming workers as the reason their

01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:31,110
wages are low and stop looking to firms

01:12:28,260 --> 01:12:34,290
just somehow altruistically set wages

01:12:31,110 --> 01:12:37,140
for everyone and start saying what do we

01:12:34,290 --> 01:12:40,830
expect every worker to have when they

01:12:37,140 --> 01:12:44,810
walk in a door and cost-share pay for it

01:12:40,830 --> 01:12:44,810
because they need that to do good work

01:12:46,770 --> 01:12:51,940
I'm tempted to to wrap up but I have one

01:12:50,290 --> 01:12:53,770
more question which which sort of brings

01:12:51,940 --> 01:12:57,280
it back to sort of the day-to-day

01:12:53,770 --> 01:12:59,170
business of doing what we do and this is

01:12:57,280 --> 01:13:01,720
from one of our researchers in San

01:12:59,170 --> 01:13:03,550
Francisco area and she writes I'm a user

01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:05,550
researcher I think I've paid research

01:13:03,550 --> 01:13:07,840
participants paid panel survey

01:13:05,550 --> 01:13:10,060
respondents user testers recruited

01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:13,210
interviewees are sometimes participating

01:13:10,060 --> 01:13:15,550
as ghost workers as customers of vendors

01:13:13,210 --> 01:13:17,860
who do this recruiting what can we do

01:13:15,550 --> 01:13:19,870
right now to address the issues that

01:13:17,860 --> 01:13:22,300
you've brought up today I think right

01:13:19,870 --> 01:13:25,210
now we have to agree we need an industry

01:13:22,300 --> 01:13:26,560
standard as a starting point to say what

01:13:25,210 --> 01:13:29,530
do we want to expect of each other

01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:31,480
because we know we see bad actors we

01:13:29,530 --> 01:13:35,380
know the bad actors in these

01:13:31,480 --> 01:13:37,240
environments who are shady are not you

01:13:35,380 --> 01:13:38,470
know basic things we need we should be

01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:40,930
transparent about what we're asking

01:13:38,470 --> 01:13:42,580
somebody to do we should recognize they

01:13:40,930 --> 01:13:46,270
produce value that might have

01:13:42,580 --> 01:13:48,010
implications for for intellectual

01:13:46,270 --> 01:13:49,180
property and those people have a right

01:13:48,010 --> 01:13:52,960
to benefit from their intellectual

01:13:49,180 --> 01:13:56,100
property we have the need to

01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:57,910
collectively decide what are the

01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:58,840
expectations we're gonna hold each other

01:13:57,910 --> 01:14:01,330
and hold each other to those

01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:04,090
expectations and next stop we should be

01:14:01,330 --> 01:14:07,750
asking to be regulated so that everybody

01:14:04,090 --> 01:14:09,850
has to play by the same rules so the

01:14:07,750 --> 01:14:10,990
thing that we can do today and then I'll

01:14:09,850 --> 01:14:14,680
ask you tomorrow

01:14:10,990 --> 01:14:16,950
to join me is start ticking off what

01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:20,010
would you want to be the standards if

01:14:16,950 --> 01:14:23,710
you were being hired to do this work

01:14:20,010 --> 01:14:25,450
what would you need to have in place to

01:14:23,710 --> 01:14:27,820
come back tomorrow to do this work

01:14:25,450 --> 01:14:30,760
because that is the way in which we can

01:14:27,820 --> 01:14:33,880
measure how much we value this right it

01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:35,800
is a way a proxy for well if I was doing

01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:38,020
this and I needed to come back tomorrow

01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:40,240
what would I need let's start working

01:14:38,020 --> 01:14:41,770
out what that price looks like and at no

01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:43,450
point and this is I think the most

01:14:41,770 --> 01:14:45,430
important point and no point should we

01:14:43,450 --> 01:14:47,320
be stopping ourselves and say that's too

01:14:45,430 --> 01:14:49,800
expensive

01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:52,030
because the thing we're not working with

01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:54,579
we're working with an old way of

01:14:52,030 --> 01:14:57,130
thinking about this and we need to start

01:14:54,579 --> 01:15:00,849
approaching this as what do we know

01:14:57,130 --> 01:15:02,679
workers need to come back tomorrow and

01:15:00,849 --> 01:15:05,020
to value the work they're doing so the

01:15:02,679 --> 01:15:06,790
thing you can do today is think about

01:15:05,020 --> 01:15:09,369
what are those things you're doing today

01:15:06,790 --> 01:15:11,739
that are your best practices what are

01:15:09,369 --> 01:15:15,250
the shady practices and what are we

01:15:11,739 --> 01:15:18,369
going to collectively hold ourselves to

01:15:15,250 --> 01:15:20,650
as a benchmark for these are the things

01:15:18,369 --> 01:15:21,969
you do when you're hiring somebody let

01:15:20,650 --> 01:15:24,940
me give you this sounds like a wild

01:15:21,969 --> 01:15:28,329
analogy but there was no moment in which

01:15:24,940 --> 01:15:29,860
the market said you know child labor we

01:15:28,329 --> 01:15:32,139
should get rid of that because it's just

01:15:29,860 --> 01:15:33,969
it's just not pretty it wasn't the

01:15:32,139 --> 01:15:35,920
market did that did that and we still

01:15:33,969 --> 01:15:41,440
have child labor today but it was

01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:44,469
genuinely society and workers and people

01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:46,810
within companies saying I don't feel

01:15:44,469 --> 01:15:50,409
right about this it's not right to do

01:15:46,810 --> 01:15:54,159
this and money be damned because at some

01:15:50,409 --> 01:15:57,699
point denigrating people whether you

01:15:54,159 --> 01:15:59,889
make money off that or not it denigrates

01:15:57,699 --> 01:16:01,480
all of us so we have to collectively

01:15:59,889 --> 01:16:02,949
come together and say what are the

01:16:01,480 --> 01:16:05,190
what's the new benchmark we're going to

01:16:02,949 --> 01:16:05,190
set

01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:13,830
I love that as an example and I love the

01:16:09,390 --> 01:16:17,850
child labor example as a precursor as a

01:16:13,830 --> 01:16:19,740
as an exemplar all right I think we

01:16:17,850 --> 01:16:21,360
should stop at that point I want to

01:16:19,740 --> 01:16:22,980
mention we've had a couple of glitches

01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:26,970
on the feed if you're watching on

01:16:22,980 --> 01:16:29,700
YouTube or mo we'll be replacing the

01:16:26,970 --> 01:16:31,380
glitched video with the live one for

01:16:29,700 --> 01:16:33,740
various reasons there's an ISP in

01:16:31,380 --> 01:16:35,910
Florida which is causing some problems I

01:16:33,740 --> 01:16:39,960
don't even want to go into the details

01:16:35,910 --> 01:16:42,690
about why that but on the the video feed

01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:44,070
will put up and in case people were

01:16:42,690 --> 01:16:47,400
missing some of the stuff in the last 20

01:16:44,070 --> 01:16:49,170
minutes or so so Mary I'd like to thank

01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:51,000
you very much and I'd like to thank all

01:16:49,170 --> 01:16:53,730
of you listening for your questions and

01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:55,110
engagement and things like that thank

01:16:53,730 --> 01:16:57,740
you very much thank you

01:16:55,110 --> 01:16:57,740
take care okay

01:17:04,090 --> 01:17:06,150
