Title: ET Speaker Series - Bionic Tools for Documenting Code - Andrew Head, UC Berkeley

Description: 
	Writing programming documentation is challenging, time-intensive, and fundamentally creative. In this talk, I introduce bionic documentation tools---tools that leverage code analysis to capture, shape, amplify, and share developer insight. I describe two tools that provide new ways for programmers to write and propagate documentation. The first tool finds code examples in tutorial pages and generates explanations of their tricky syntax. The second helps programmers extract self-contained, executable code examples that capture the essence of important patterns in their complex code. These tools build on techniques from program slicing to natural language generation, to gosh-darn simple hand-written rules. Our usability studies indicate the tools are useful. I believe they will ultimately help programmers capture and share programming knowledge otherwise locked away in their minds and code.
