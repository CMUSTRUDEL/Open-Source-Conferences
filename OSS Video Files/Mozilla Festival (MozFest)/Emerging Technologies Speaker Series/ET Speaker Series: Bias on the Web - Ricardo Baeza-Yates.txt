Description: 
	Bias on the Web
Ricardo Baeza-Yates, NTENT & Northeastern Univ. at Silicon Valley

Abstract: 
The Web is the most powerful communication medium and the largest public data repository that humankind has created. Its content ranges from great reference sources such as Wikipedia to ugly fake news. Indeed, social (digital) media is just an amplifying mirror of ourselves. Hence, the main challenge of search engines and other websites that rely on web data is to assess the quality of such data. However, as all people have their own biases, web content as well as our web interactions are tainted with many biases. Data bias includes redundancy and spam, while interaction bias includes activity and presentation bias. In addition, sometimes algorithms add bias, particularly in the context of search and recommendation systems. As bias generates bias, we stress the importance of de-biasing data as well as using the context and other techniques such as explore & exploit, to break the filter bubble. The main goal of this talk is to make people aware of the different biases that affect all of us on the Web. Awareness is the first step to be able to fight and reduce the vicious cycle of web bias. For more details see the article of same title in Communications of ACM, June 2018.

	00:00:01,639 --> 00:00:06,210
good morning good afternoon good evening

00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:08,160
my name is Joe HK I'm principal research

00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:10,429
scientist at Mozilla and today it's my

00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,410
pleasure to introduce you to Ricardo

00:00:10,429 --> 00:00:15,870
bate Cieza no I got it wrong

00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:20,400
bay is a Yates I'm sorry I have known

00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:22,800
Ricardo for 10 or 15 years now including

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,330
time in which he was my grand boss and

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,920
one of the things I think is really

00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:29,670
exciting about the work that Ricardo

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:32,309
does is that it combines a very deep

00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:34,710
technical understanding of the issues

00:00:32,309 --> 00:00:38,219
that end up impacting us on an everyday

00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:39,989
basis both as users of the web and as a

00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:42,030
company who is really actively trying to

00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:46,020
address that but also these issues of

00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:48,899
bias and looking at how that bias

00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:49,920
impacts that experience but what I like

00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:51,780
about is a particular approach is

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,070
because of this deep technical knowledge

00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,570
there are other people who are working

00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:55,559
on bias on the web there are other

00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:57,210
people who are working on these

00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:59,160
questions and that's very important work

00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:00,539
but very few of them come at this

00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,550
question with this deep technical

00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:03,960
understanding of the issues and I think

00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:05,460
that's what's quite so important both

00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,140
for Mozilla and for people working on

00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:10,170
the web in general so I'm really excited

00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:12,150
by this we'll take questions at the end

00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:15,420
if you're within Mozilla and we'll take

00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:18,509
them on slack you can join me on speak -

00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:21,570
tag speaker series or if you tweet at me

00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:24,270
at at Joe fish then I'll take questions

00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:27,509
on Twitter as well if you're gonna be

00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:29,130
either commenting or questioning on

00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:32,130
Twitter then please use our hashtag

00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:34,110
hashtag Mozilla speakers that'll help us

00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:35,340
make sure we see what's going on and

00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:37,439
everyone else can see what's going on as

00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:39,329
well so I'm very much looking forward to

00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,939
this Ricardo thank you very much

00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:44,090
over to you thank you your fish for the

00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:47,700
invitation is a pleasure to be here

00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:50,790
talking about bias the first body you

00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:52,890
will notice is geographic data your

00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:56,100
graphical bias on my background so you

00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:59,250
will see different changes and they are

00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:02,310
from a single country so I had been

00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:04,710
talking about bias on the web from I see

00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:08,369
in 2016 and this is an updated version

00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:13,380
of the original talk and also I

00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:18,810
published an article in in June of

00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:21,000
mm 18 in cm that basically summarizes

00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:22,800
all most of the content here but there's

00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,550
some new content that that is not there

00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:29,250
and and it's really interesting that

00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:31,650
that when I finally came up with this

00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:35,250
talk I realized to have been working on

00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:38,940
bias for more than 12 years and maybe

00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:41,220
even was trendy and even people was

00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:44,940
talking about bias I was interested in

00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:51,480
these deviations of systems and people

00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:54,570
in in the web so let's start with

00:02:51,480 --> 00:03:00,870
defining what is bias so we have the

00:02:54,570 --> 00:03:02,880
same understanding and many ways one

00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:05,190
possible one is to differentiate between

00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:07,710
a statistical culture and comedy bias or

00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:10,740
statistical biases what we usually

00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:13,770
understand bias in science for basically

00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:16,320
you have a measurement like here is like

00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:18,030
a normal distribution and then this is

00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:21,630
an imposition of the measure because of

00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:24,930
the measurement itself but also a

00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:27,630
bezel-set bias on towards the real value

00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:29,520
and this will be the inaccuracy for

00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:33,690
example let's say you do take your

00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:37,440
weight every day in a scale or the scan

00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:39,920
will be 1 pounds more 1 pounds less all

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,330
the time because of these ballots of

00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:46,590
course you would prefer one of them in

00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:49,560
this example cultural bias so cultural

00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:52,860
bias is all our background and it's

00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:55,110
basically based on our dedication the

00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:57,120
country will leave the language will

00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:59,550
speak is encoded in the language I will

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,730
mention a few examples later and this is

00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:05,550
basically shared by many people that

00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:07,560
have the same culture and the last one

00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:12,200
is committed balance so cou this bias is

00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:15,570
basically your own personal bias that

00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:20,459
affect your judgment and there are so

00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:23,010
many that that this will be hard to talk

00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:27,030
only about that but for example these

00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:29,670
are the 20 top committed biases that

00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:32,100
make your decisions wrong and one this

00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:34,680
is very important with confirmation bias

00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:36,960
the confirmation bias is something that

00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:39,480
you'll see that agrees with your values

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,850
and your belief and then you believe

00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:44,790
it's true only because is basically

00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:46,800
confirming your beliefs but of course

00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:49,620
not always true and this is the main

00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,630
reason behind fake news they exploit

00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:54,510
confirmation bias but there are many

00:04:51,630 --> 00:05:00,360
more there almost 200 committed biases

00:04:54,510 --> 00:05:04,590
you can draw and codes of all possible

00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:07,710
bias even with different classes of that

00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:09,630
and there's nothing wrong with bias so

00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:11,100
we have a bias to think that this

00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:13,080
something negative but this is nothing

00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:15,510
wrong with by a teaser but we only talk

00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:17,820
about bias when it's negative and we

00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:21,210
need to remember that but there are many

00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:23,400
good biases probably we are alive

00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:26,010
because of some biases that we have deep

00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:28,430
inside us in for example danger

00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:30,750
situations or other and other conditions

00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:32,550
so what are the motivations behind these

00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:34,650
thoughts so there are three motivations

00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:36,630
and they're not in their order that that

00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:38,490
basically motivated me but I think this

00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:47,400
is the right order for the truck so the

00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:49,020
first one is in the way and if we talk

00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,240
about that we talk first about

00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:53,220
inequality of internet access so for

00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,900
example from 99 percent in Iceland to

00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:56,970
less than 8 percent it's also done on

00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:59,669
North Korea industry its analysis we

00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:01,560
don't know exactly how much it is or

00:05:59,669 --> 00:06:02,970
content inequality across languages I

00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,490
would not be told these numbers that for

00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:08,789
example our most web sites are English

00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:12,630
although is not languages for behalf of

00:06:08,789 --> 00:06:15,660
the humanity or seems like Mandarin for

00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:18,479
example not the same number of sites

00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:21,180
with respect to English done to the

00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:22,919
people that live in China and the same

00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:26,640
we can say for many other one which is

00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:29,729
for example about of the 7,000 languages

00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:32,850
that are live today only about 5% of

00:06:29,729 --> 00:06:36,030
them have a Wikipedia so that's the 95

00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:37,449
percent of cultural knowledge and bias

00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:41,740
that is

00:06:37,449 --> 00:06:45,490
basically not being recorded we will get

00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:48,430
back to this topic later today but this

00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:52,059
is very important the content in the

00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:54,219
website is optimized for local purposes

00:06:52,059 --> 00:06:55,960
and not really for people so they're

00:06:54,219 --> 00:06:58,120
optimized for government for business

00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:01,029
publication but not really for what you

00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:03,069
need all the time and there is a bias

00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:06,520
also on content quality and I will

00:07:03,069 --> 00:07:09,219
mention a few examples later so the

00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:11,589
second motivation is the impact that

00:07:09,219 --> 00:07:12,909
these biases on the web have on searcher

00:07:11,589 --> 00:07:15,659
recommender systems and you know

00:07:12,909 --> 00:07:18,460
certainly one exists an open mind

00:07:15,659 --> 00:07:25,990
research especially information

00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:28,300
retrieval system today are optimize it

00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:30,550
by using implicit user feedback every

00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:33,520
click you do every month moving to do

00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:36,430
every transaction you make it's

00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:39,520
basically as a signal for the system and

00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:40,839
user is a positive signal so basically

00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:46,180
if you do something that means that you

00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:48,580
are interested however then we are

00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:51,399
partially biased by the choices of these

00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:52,539
systems would to us and I will get back

00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:54,909
to this because I think it's a

00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:59,289
fundamental problem on our system today

00:07:54,909 --> 00:08:01,479
is basically exposure balance you can

00:07:59,289 --> 00:08:03,610
only choose from a very limited amount

00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:07,319
of possibilities and there are many many

00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:10,990
more and then you have problems with

00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:12,810
learning systems that basically fines to

00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:15,819
vote Marc solutions because they're

00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:17,560
watching this virtual world and this

00:08:15,819 --> 00:08:19,689
means that they are not only fills a

00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:21,580
bubble for people but also they are

00:08:19,689 --> 00:08:24,300
filter bubble for systems and I will

00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:27,699
talk up a little bit about that up there

00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:29,490
and maybe these systems are competing

00:08:27,699 --> 00:08:32,529
among themselves they are learning

00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:35,909
basically how to beat themselves that

00:08:32,529 --> 00:08:37,779
depends for example you have a the same

00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:39,130
optimization function all across a

00:08:37,779 --> 00:08:42,699
company or they are different depending

00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:45,550
on the on their on the role and the

00:08:42,699 --> 00:08:47,380
typical example is for example user

00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:49,480
experience versus monetization

00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:50,710
so some a group is trying to get more

00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,270
revenue

00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:54,270
another group is going to get more

00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:56,320
audience and more engagement and

00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:59,280
basically sometimes they're fighting

00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:05,470
each other because they are not having

00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:08,650
consensus on what to optimize and the

00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:16,390
last one has to do with this job for you

00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:18,100
will please read it um in this case this

00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:19,690
job is easy to prove that it's a fake

00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:22,540
news because there is some consulted

00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:25,660
between internet and instant so this is

00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:27,310
not true he never said that but matin is

00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:31,570
from much harder to know if it's true or

00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:35,350
not and this is the last motivation fake

00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:39,130
content and bias for example here you

00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:40,920
can see the traffic sources of this

00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:46,000
information in the United States and

00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:50,620
according to a sista is 42% coming from

00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,840
social networks 30% is direct 20 percent

00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:57,310
comes from search and fat persons can

00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:58,930
also be fairer and this is in 2017 and

00:09:57,310 --> 00:10:00,580
also see if you can track for example

00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:03,760
poor leader and federal with clj

00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:07,330
whatsapp messenger telegram and other

00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,800
chat platforms is much higher today but

00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:13,600
cannot be measured because you don't

00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:16,360
have access to the date and the same you

00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:19,300
can get if you do let's say a survey and

00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:22,810
here for example what is what people

00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:27,700
think also control 17 about its

00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:29,260
resources search or bias or not under

00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:31,030
these have to do with the spread of this

00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:32,830
information I will not read these quotes

00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:39,040
from here you have New York Times

00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:42,550
political or stand and here is for

00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:44,080
example again data from Statistics

00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:46,090
responsible for spreading this

00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:48,670
information like fake social media

00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:52,540
accounts politicians presidents Russian

00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:54,640
government and so on so a lot of sources

00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:58,150
and it's very hard each day is harder to

00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:59,980
realize for this tool and what is not

00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:02,589
and for example the US government is

00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:05,680
moving to address bias in the network

00:11:02,589 --> 00:11:08,070
and this was prepared before yesterday

00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:10,600
that even when you have more news about

00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:14,710
addressing bias in the network and also

00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:17,260
in social networks and basically if the

00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:20,140
question at the any school owns the

00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:22,210
truth who don't have to decide that the

00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:25,029
platform or for example the people

00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:28,089
reading the platform and it's very hard

00:11:25,029 --> 00:11:30,580
to have a real answer because in many

00:11:28,089 --> 00:11:34,270
topics we know that we shouldn't trust

00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:36,010
the platform in the sense that there are

00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:39,690
things that we cannot talk about like it

00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:43,300
for example natesan or classism

00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:46,660
so after this introduction I hope is

00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:48,070
clear that human data has bias and here

00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:49,450
I put observational you want data

00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:51,640
because of course if you do an

00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:53,830
experiment with humans you can get a

00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:55,750
different answer but of course you

00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:58,690
shouldn't do experiment with humans and

00:11:55,750 --> 00:12:00,730
there are many documentaries about a few

00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:03,339
times for even some universities did

00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:07,380
experiment with human and I'm not

00:12:03,339 --> 00:12:10,360
talking only about say political issues

00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:12,010
so which cultural biases are out there

00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:15,270
so there are many I will not read them

00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:18,940
here the main ones is just my own list

00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:22,380
but you can put any topic and you will

00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:25,510
find some bias sir it sadistic elias's

00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:27,850
as I said this depends on the

00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:30,040
measurement techniques but here in the

00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:32,320
web for example how you gather the data

00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:34,720
are you crawler data are you sample the

00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,520
data how much you use you may have

00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,470
beliefs issues for example something was

00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:41,170
true when year ago about two days for

00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:43,390
two we have completeness issues of

00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:44,920
course you have noise and you have a

00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:47,019
spot

00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:49,119
and finally we have quality biases and I

00:12:47,019 --> 00:12:52,029
said before that 200 of them we can't

00:12:49,119 --> 00:12:58,089
put a list of 200 so we will capture all

00:12:52,029 --> 00:12:59,549
this in one main name we will call it

00:12:58,089 --> 00:13:04,029
self selection

00:12:59,549 --> 00:13:05,949
so basically is your own bias when you

00:13:04,029 --> 00:13:07,239
do things and we will put all that

00:13:05,949 --> 00:13:10,509
together and we'll get back to this

00:13:07,239 --> 00:13:12,429
later so a lot of people has addressed

00:13:10,509 --> 00:13:14,259
that main cultural biases like

00:13:12,429 --> 00:13:18,339
especially gender bias and racial bias

00:13:14,259 --> 00:13:20,559
and for example you take Twitter data to

00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:24,999
the data if by the S to the another

00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:27,939
Mormon is biased to H towards or people

00:13:24,999 --> 00:13:31,449
older than 30 geographically bias for

00:13:27,939 --> 00:13:33,220
example in the u.s. is graphically

00:13:31,449 --> 00:13:36,279
biased to what people eat like the East

00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:38,470
Coast and the West Coast educational

00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:41,589
bias disease people typically have been

00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:43,989
through university economic bias do you

00:13:41,589 --> 00:13:45,639
need money to have a free time a good

00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:48,069
smartphone with internet connection and

00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:49,929
so on and of course you are a big geek

00:13:48,069 --> 00:13:51,730
because you lack the knowledge and you

00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:54,160
have to be in Twitter so you have this

00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:56,049
theological bias too so for example if

00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,809
you use to the data and you don't

00:13:56,049 --> 00:14:00,910
remember these six biases the probably

00:13:58,809 --> 00:14:03,160
the result will only reflect the opinion

00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:05,980
of these kind of people which is a

00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:07,689
minority in any country and also

00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:10,269
remember that for example Twitter

00:14:07,689 --> 00:14:13,269
doesn't have a large penetration in most

00:14:10,269 --> 00:14:17,649
countries for example 20% would be a

00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:21,819
typical so there is addition problems

00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:24,549
when you try to measure bias and also

00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:26,589
when you measure it and what I'm trying

00:14:24,549 --> 00:14:29,919
to do in this talk is an attempt of an

00:14:26,589 --> 00:14:32,829
unbiased personal view on biasing

00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:36,669
systems in work systems and of course

00:14:32,829 --> 00:14:37,720
this is the personal use of to be

00:14:36,669 --> 00:14:39,759
completely unbiased

00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:41,169
it was one main problem with biases is

00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:44,289
that they are unconscious we don't

00:14:41,169 --> 00:14:48,039
notice them when we make these for

00:14:44,289 --> 00:14:49,449
example on the bias tape so those are

00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:52,989
with a non-technical question that has

00:14:49,449 --> 00:14:54,819
been very important in the last years is

00:14:52,989 --> 00:14:56,799
that you have an album any algorithm

00:14:54,819 --> 00:14:58,270
doesn't have to be an eye a I are boring

00:14:56,799 --> 00:14:59,620
but basically my children

00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:03,670
based algorithm will be the main issue

00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:06,070
here because it depends on the data you

00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:08,240
we used to chain it but you have base

00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:10,069
bias data too

00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:13,879
if any put and then you need to ask the

00:15:10,069 --> 00:15:16,790
question is this out in neutral is this

00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:18,679
album fair and the first problem is to

00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:20,179
define what it means to be neutral for

00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:23,089
example what means in your cavity in

00:15:20,179 --> 00:15:26,720
Wikipedia it's a lot of work going on on

00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:29,509
that or for example what is a fair out

00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:34,360
word you know fairness by definition is

00:15:29,509 --> 00:15:36,800
very hard to capture so most of the time

00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:38,600
computer scientists don't even make the

00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:42,350
question and then they have the same

00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:44,990
bias and basically it's an example of

00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:47,149
garbage in that watch out that you

00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:50,629
should be quoted so we have wrong data

00:15:47,149 --> 00:15:53,029
we get the wrong result now one

00:15:50,629 --> 00:15:54,679
possibility to try to add this for these

00:15:53,029 --> 00:15:58,730
big fears to remember this a nice

00:15:54,679 --> 00:16:00,649
cartoon coming from the web that

00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:03,199
basically shows an example of a quality

00:16:00,649 --> 00:16:05,300
equity and justice and this is the

00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:07,429
different but for example equality every

00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:10,040
say everyone gets the same but then the

00:16:07,429 --> 00:16:12,319
child can't see the game equity you do

00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:15,079
some affirmative action and that's has

00:16:12,319 --> 00:16:22,459
been done with gender and minorities and

00:16:15,079 --> 00:16:24,649
then you get some equity to remove the

00:16:22,459 --> 00:16:26,299
obstacle that makes necessary our

00:16:24,649 --> 00:16:28,399
affirmative actions for example

00:16:26,299 --> 00:16:31,579
remove gender bias remove racial bias

00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:34,749
and that takes a long time and still

00:16:31,579 --> 00:16:34,749
we're working on that now

00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:40,040
what is the answer that well the answer

00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:42,320
is not always it depends on what you're

00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:47,090
trying to do for example maybe you are

00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:50,560
trying to measure bias and then of

00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:54,710
course you want to have the bias there

00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:57,860
and also the answer is just if you hand

00:16:54,710 --> 00:17:01,490
people do you need to take care of bias

00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:04,280
if your application will hand people for

00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:06,829
example if you are deciding if a person

00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:08,420
will get a loan in a bank or for example

00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:09,740
if a person will get a position and

00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:13,250
company and so on there are many

00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:15,500
examples where is not even ethical to

00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:19,910
use an algorithm and we haven't agreed

00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:22,459
on that yet so there are see ways to to

00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:24,819
tackle the problems this these

00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:24,819
possibilities

00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:37,470
device the input to the harboring or

00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:40,290
device the output and I will not cover

00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:46,440
them here if this would be too much but

00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:48,210
we will get back to this later so very

00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:51,150
important what we are trying to deal

00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:53,760
with here is bias awareness because the

00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:55,010
first problem you need to solve is

00:17:53,760 --> 00:18:04,470
awareness

00:17:55,010 --> 00:18:09,630
okay so in 2017 with more than three

00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:14,400
years ago the ACM us policy committee

00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:16,440
where I participate now this statement

00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,080
about the 7 properties and Algren should

00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:20,640
fulfill like I will not with them but we

00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:24,930
are talking about here about the first

00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:26,490
one so basically about awareness but

00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:28,230
there are many missing much for example

00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:30,240
accountability very important one and

00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:31,980
for example in Spanish there is no word

00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,920
for accountability we need to use 2

00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:39,240
workers I think there are some bias in

00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:42,030
the language and here we need to

00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:43,890
remember that system do not need to be

00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:47,190
perfect they just need to be better than

00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:48,870
us so we we shouldn't ask perfection we

00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:52,230
should ask for things that are better

00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:54,270
than us and basically the problem today

00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:56,700
is that don't album fulfills the 7

00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:59,490
properties and not even one property is

00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:06,600
easy to fulfill and this means to change

00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:08,520
the whole system of how we do suffer so

00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:12,720
let's start with covering all the bias

00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:19,590
in the web so the first one will be

00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:21,600
right so they Tobias is our what's

00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:23,429
encoded already in the date and most ADA

00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:26,780
come from Newman's this comes from us

00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:29,340
the first one the main one is web spam

00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:31,620
but we will not talk about whether stop

00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:33,750
so they a lot of work on that and and

00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:35,730
maybe what we mentioned at the end but

00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:37,919
that would be a different talk we want

00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:43,230
to talk about biases are more subtle and

00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:44,039
you maybe don't know so let's see a few

00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:48,919
examples

00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:50,730
this one is economic by the still links

00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:53,940
this is something that maybe you

00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:57,530
shouldn't do but we did it in in in a

00:19:53,940 --> 00:20:02,700
study that more than ten years old about

00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:06,860
basically comparing exports with number

00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:10,620
of linked domains from a Spain and to

00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:13,200
Spain exports and basically you seek

00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:17,429
here at correlation collection of point

00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:21,539
eight but basically you can infer maybe

00:20:17,429 --> 00:20:23,250
that correlation depends on the economic

00:20:21,539 --> 00:20:26,669
trade between countries and that affects

00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:31,440
the links that you find the way so here

00:20:26,669 --> 00:20:36,480
we have some outliers like TK t o SN T C

00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:38,940
and you may look later where are all

00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,950
these places but basically all these

00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:44,190
places are as more countries or colonies

00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:47,250
that solve their right to use the domain

00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:49,440
name for that side fifty million dollars

00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:56,610
instead of using it because not all

00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:58,650
still worried to get some money we did

00:20:56,610 --> 00:21:02,370
the same with five countries and we

00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:04,470
found that more developed the country

00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:06,150
largely the coronation so even though

00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:08,880
it's a stronger signal that this is

00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:11,600
correlated to Akana

00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:14,460
let's see an excel another example of

00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:17,430
cultural bias in the web so these are

00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:19,110
graphs of the size of pages in websites

00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:21,450
and you see that they are very similar

00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:24,420
the only difference is the average is a

00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:27,590
bit lower in Korea in South Korea and I

00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:29,850
will tell later why that happens but

00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:32,870
basically here you see the famous

00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:35,790
minimal effort law of 16 so basically

00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:38,340
this is very happy to do a very large

00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:40,440
page people will not do it and also at

00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:43,470
the end what you find is page is done by

00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:44,670
by software not by people however you

00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:46,730
feel that they beginning there is

00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:49,520
another force

00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:52,820
that is a pulsing minimal effort and I

00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:55,430
call it the Shane law so basically you

00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:58,820
feel some shame of writing a very small

00:21:55,430 --> 00:22:01,850
webpage like two lines three lines this

00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:04,490
is one some some kilobytes or maybe half

00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:06,680
a page and then until proven you reach

00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:08,540
like one page you'll forget this is an

00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:10,790
asset and then the minimal effort law

00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:12,830
kicks in and this is a typical example

00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:15,050
of how we do work we do work until we

00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:19,670
try and satisfy and then we try to avoid

00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:22,250
it because it's enough right do find

00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:24,290
this everywhere for something other

00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:27,320
measures but the last one here is images

00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:30,200
in pages and you see that you find the

00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:32,990
same in Brazil Chile and Greece you have

00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:34,430
like three modules per page in factorial

00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:37,130
you have 12 this is a cultural

00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:39,160
difference and this is why you have less

00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:41,390
text because you have more images

00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:46,130
stained is like a special case because

00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:47,960
they are like only text it most pages no

00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:49,840
extension for that but maybe it's

00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:51,890
another another creature difference

00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:54,620
let's see another example about a

00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:57,050
language so this company language

00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:59,600
connect claim that if you take the top

00:22:57,050 --> 00:23:01,850
one minute websites 55 percent of them

00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:04,130
are in English we cannot check this list

00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:06,020
we don't have the 1 million websites and

00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:07,310
we can even have you order the top 1

00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:11,570
minute what size but I believe this is

00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:14,840
more or less correct about half of the

00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:18,260
web bad websites are doing now what is

00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:20,030
the bias here what the biosphere implies

00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:21,680
what is the right reference and many

00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:23,450
times in bias problem we don't have the

00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:25,760
right reference for example one

00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:28,070
reference could be okay let's take how

00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:31,070
many people speaks every language in a

00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:33,740
native wedding so for example English

00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:35,750
number three jello here and of course

00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:38,990
it's less than 10% so the bias would be

00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:41,090
like a five times more more well maybe

00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:42,980
this is not correct and we should take

00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:45,880
only the people that have access to

00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:51,320
Internet and then okay this is a better

00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:53,960
but then it have to be different factors

00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:55,700
to bias between these two numbers or

00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:58,730
some people may say well but you should

00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:59,480
take they put the people I understand

00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:00,800
you have

00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:03,050
to take what is the content of the web

00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:05,450
and here we can argue and if you take

00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:06,620
the of the web English 27 percent

00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:08,570
of the content according to these

00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:09,500
statistics and then again we've had a

00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:12,890
factor of two

00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:14,960
so still we have a language rights let's

00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:16,640
take another example this is one is in

00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:20,060
translation I'm sure you have used this

00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:21,520
many times and for example I will write

00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:24,470
he say babysitter she's a doctor

00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:28,010
translated to Turkish I don't know any

00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:30,980
Turkish so I cut and paste here and I

00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:33,200
can set it back to english and then oh

00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:36,950
now she's the babysitter and he's the

00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:39,470
doctor so these are only some Google say

00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:41,810
Google fix at these about 1/2 year ago

00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:44,020
if you put just a single sentence but if

00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:46,730
you put two sentences still was working

00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:49,040
available so you can try with your own

00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:51,140
language also worked in Farsi but what's

00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:53,780
the issue here why the gender was

00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:56,900
changed well in Turkish there's no

00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:59,770
gender in pronounce so you see that here

00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:03,110
is a bead Oh beautiful the translator

00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:05,900
cannot understand if this is a woman or

00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:08,390
a man and then when they do that we do

00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:10,850
the translation back we get the opposite

00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:14,210
because the system has learned this from

00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:16,220
the text the text is gender bias either

00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:18,230
if you take Nobel's news that's a matter

00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:20,180
the text text in the web you will find

00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:23,330
the gender bias in that and there are

00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:25,070
many examples of that and my second last

00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:26,600
example is also about gender bias but

00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:29,390
this is just the biasing content this is

00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:34,880
from one of my former PT students and

00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:37,820
here is the biographies of women sorted

00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:40,280
by H in Wikipedia you see that that

00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:43,150
after maybe the French Revolution so for

00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:46,580
fear we can do some historical inference

00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:49,850
gender bias has decreased so a quality

00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:51,809
egalitarian and we are getting to almost

00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:55,739
twenty four percent

00:25:51,809 --> 00:25:58,799
so if I present still lower than for

00:25:55,739 --> 00:26:02,460
example 50% so you can say it is nothing

00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:06,119
special here this just systemic bias but

00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:08,340
the truth here is same much important

00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:10,499
bias that is hidden in the process and

00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:13,469
of course will be obvious after I tell

00:26:10,499 --> 00:26:17,909
you what is this well most editors in

00:26:13,469 --> 00:26:20,940
Wikipedia are men there's another bias

00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:23,099
here because you don't have to put your

00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:25,289
gender it's not compulsory in Wikipedia

00:26:23,099 --> 00:26:31,830
so maybe this number of women that write

00:26:25,289 --> 00:26:34,559
about people is bias to lower bound but

00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:38,190
probably will be like 15% for example

00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:41,549
but 50% is very far away from 50% and

00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:45,029
it's also far away from 24% so clearly

00:26:41,549 --> 00:26:49,229
this bias here and we need more writers

00:26:45,029 --> 00:26:52,769
in Wikipedia dry women ok that was the

00:26:49,229 --> 00:26:55,019
first part the second one I call it

00:26:52,769 --> 00:26:56,849
activity bias and this will be a

00:26:55,019 --> 00:27:00,659
participation bias according to do so

00:26:56,849 --> 00:27:04,889
basically will not do the same in the

00:27:00,659 --> 00:27:07,349
web so there are some passive people

00:27:04,889 --> 00:27:11,190
they just look workers according to

00:27:07,349 --> 00:27:13,769
Wilson and also there are some people

00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:18,179
that RT it but they do much more than

00:27:13,769 --> 00:27:20,729
others so let's see how many active

00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:23,879
users that may be our only 10% of the

00:27:20,729 --> 00:27:25,799
users produce 50% of the content so we

00:27:23,879 --> 00:27:29,309
are asking about more like the mock

00:27:25,799 --> 00:27:31,559
receipt of the content and we look at

00:27:29,309 --> 00:27:34,349
four different data sets a small one

00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:37,529
from Facebook and there we found that

00:27:34,349 --> 00:27:40,109
seven percent of the people posted half

00:27:37,529 --> 00:27:41,849
of the plant and this is the meaning of

00:27:40,109 --> 00:27:44,999
this graph seven percent of the people

00:27:41,849 --> 00:27:47,969
do one half and ninety seven eighty

00:27:44,999 --> 00:27:50,460
percent of the people do the other we

00:27:47,969 --> 00:27:52,619
also look at the Amazon reviews and the

00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:55,700
Amazon the bills we found that four

00:27:52,619 --> 00:27:59,029
percent did

00:27:55,700 --> 00:28:02,450
half of the reviews and 96 percent did

00:27:59,029 --> 00:28:05,539
the rest and these are large data set

00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:10,399
that has been collected by Stanford and

00:28:05,539 --> 00:28:13,970
we look at that because we thought that

00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:15,590
was too much liars how four percent of

00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:19,460
the people can write half of the reviews

00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:21,620
and one months after we publish this

00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:24,250
later with another one of my follow PD

00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:24,250
students the other

00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:30,910
found out that Amazon started to few fig

00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:33,610
reviewers so this happened in October

00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:35,830
2015 we published in 2015 we don't know

00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:39,700
it because of the paper we can't prove

00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:41,380
that causality but what's after this

00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:44,230
continue in 2016

00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:48,190
and continue 2019 and even if you go

00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:50,650
today you will see more news about fake

00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:53,440
reveals but be careful when you see too

00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:57,310
many five-star reviews especially if

00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:59,380
there are no other types of videos then

00:28:57,310 --> 00:29:02,830
we look at Twitter we were able to you

00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:06,760
to to to do this in a very large

00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:09,580
collection of 2011 2009 that is

00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:11,770
available from the past and then we

00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:15,310
found that 2% of the people did half of

00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:17,620
the trees it's nothing strange this is

00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:19,600
called ego the reason many people can

00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:23,010
have to wake up every morning and tweet

00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:25,030
something and that's right Vegas and

00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:26,740
finally we use all the data from

00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:28,780
Wikipedia which is available all the

00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:30,850
access data to tweedy PDF available all

00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:32,950
all the logs and then you find that

00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:34,840
about 2000 people did half of the

00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:37,120
English Wikipedia the first version and

00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:38,950
maybe thanks to these people we have a

00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:41,370
Wikipedia today because no one

00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:44,530
contributed to something that's half

00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:46,570
empty or half empty you need to have

00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:49,360
people that oddly see it have four

00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:53,290
that's another buyer how do you see

00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:54,820
things half empty or half full another

00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:58,810
thing that we did with dinner which I

00:29:54,820 --> 00:30:02,200
think the important question for me is

00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:04,920
how much content no one ever sees or

00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:07,630
very little people sees like your blog

00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:10,630
and I call this the diesel desert and

00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:13,020
from this study we found two two bounds

00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:16,240
then an upper bound of 31 percent

00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:19,300
basically articles in Wikipedia that in

00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:21,600
months were changed or were added and

00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:24,190
then in the next month of once all

00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:26,620
because this number will depend on the

00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:29,860
time period that you are studying and

00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:32,230
also we found that more than one percent

00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:34,540
of the tweets is done by people that

00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:36,400
don't have any follower organized these

00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:37,640
people understand how to either work but

00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:40,309
is like going to the

00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:42,260
this on his screen so it may be good for

00:30:40,309 --> 00:30:44,960
you is a cathartic experience but no one

00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:48,830
is listening to you so let's go to the

00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:51,400
third bias now we take data from the web

00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:55,040
we run it through one of these a nice

00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:57,890
system like a wet system recommender

00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:59,570
system whatever you are doing and then

00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:01,460
the first problem is something by us I

00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:02,929
will not talk much about this but if you

00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:04,880
don't do the right something you will

00:31:02,929 --> 00:31:07,010
get the wrong result and one of the main

00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:09,830
thing is that how much data you get to

00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:12,049
sample depending on what what what do

00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:14,000
you want to feel because we are usually

00:31:12,049 --> 00:31:16,340
working with either a very close to zero

00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,929
and then when you have priority very

00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:20,090
close to see the laterals effect click

00:31:17,929 --> 00:31:22,100
then you need to gather much more data

00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:23,870
than for example for example the

00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:28,730
standard error formula will give you

00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:31,160
that will basically not estimate well

00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:35,690
will be a super summation of the right

00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:37,760
sample sets and then you may have a bias

00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:39,799
that is added by their algorithm and

00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:41,809
here very important for when I say

00:31:39,799 --> 00:31:43,520
algorithmic bias I'm not offering about

00:31:41,809 --> 00:31:44,840
data bias and people get these two

00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:47,450
things together and see it's very

00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:49,940
important when they work about bias to

00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:52,370
have the source of the bias very clear

00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:54,380
and for being a rhythmic bias is where

00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:57,049
the source of the bias is the algorithm

00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:59,990
itself not the data and I will mention a

00:31:57,049 --> 00:32:02,090
few examples so let's start with the

00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:03,710
first example like this with B that

00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:06,860
strength and rhythmic by extreme

00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:08,900
original bias let's say you have a

00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:12,380
system like free cap or you can upload

00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:16,340
the picture and then write tax Oh

00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:19,370
so for example you write London are and

00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:23,960
things we do differ for picture of of

00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:26,120
London from the north bank and then you

00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:27,860
are you know about these things so you

00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:29,600
say I will help people I will write a

00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:32,750
nice for the filtering recommended

00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:34,400
system and basically yes and tax using

00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:36,110
calculus of tax and then I suggest is

00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:38,510
very nice tax that many of them I write

00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:42,980
is a very old example we did a jocular

00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:45,080
and then we can update a notation who's

00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:46,610
the problem with the system the problem

00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:49,429
with the system is that people will use

00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:51,290
it and then next time I will put only

00:32:49,429 --> 00:32:52,910
non the line and if I

00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:54,560
little bit about deep learning si well

00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:56,570
deep learning already and also the tax I

00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:58,070
don't need to put anything and then I

00:32:56,570 --> 00:33:00,110
put I don't put any tax I get

00:32:58,070 --> 00:33:01,730
recommendations even I sell trader I I

00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:03,260
don't need even even to click in the

00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:05,270
recommendation the system will come up

00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:07,670
with the right hands what's the problem

00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:09,800
with this well the problem with this is

00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:13,160
that this is a frog funny and if you're

00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:15,680
funny we can only improve if you have

00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:17,300
the attackin from people but basically

00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:19,100
if the system is doing everything

00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:22,280
there's no more data coming from people

00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:24,830
and this is like very slow here kitty if

00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:25,850
you know this part needs technique to

00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:28,840
commit suicide

00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:31,670
so this the algorithm is killing itself

00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:32,840
so please if you have for fun of it

00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:34,630
don't mess with it

00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:37,190
don't do this this should be forbidden

00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:39,760
by the still computer scientists do it

00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:42,440
delicious did this that was a mistake

00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:43,910
you need data coming from people and

00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:45,590
then you need to live with minimal

00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:48,020
efforts not too much data but that's the

00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:50,330
only way to do it now you can use this

00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:52,880
tax for searching so for example you can

00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:57,920
do for query expansion this is a good

00:33:52,880 --> 00:34:00,440
use for this kind of thing ok and then

00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:02,000
let's get to the to the main problem

00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:03,800
with our a big bias and it will be a

00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,930
class of into a rhythmic bias I'll call

00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:08,210
it interaction balance so here HCl

00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:11,150
people please this may be the most

00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:13,130
important part of the talk it's for me

00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:14,870
and here of course you have people

00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:16,669
interacting with this and you have some

00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:19,370
self-selection bias on between the

00:34:16,669 --> 00:34:22,310
people so this is a combination of the

00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:25,139
bias coming from data from the our brain

00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:27,200
and from you

00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:27,200
you

00:34:27,829 --> 00:34:33,290
so to make sure we understand this idea

00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:33,290
please read this

00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:44,620
and I want to post a question now I want

00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:46,919
to know if anyone can tell me what I

00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:46,919
like

00:34:49,169 --> 00:34:54,740
and I will wait like a few seconds to

00:34:51,299 --> 00:34:58,260
see if someone can tell me what I like

00:34:54,740 --> 00:35:02,549
in the meantime I will change my

00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:04,950
background so you have a another view of

00:35:02,549 --> 00:35:07,010
the geographic bias

00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:07,010
you

00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:17,770
or anyone got the after I noticed that I

00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:22,230
I noticed it but I want to see if anyone

00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:25,060
else did first I'm not saying yes okay

00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:29,020
well I hear that you love geography yes

00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:30,790
so I read very fast verified but both

00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:32,620
people even when they read very fast

00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:35,650
would not read everything and basically

00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:37,810
this is just to make a point proof I

00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:39,490
would talk not we got two other people

00:35:37,810 --> 00:35:42,820
got geography and someone else suggested

00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:44,800
Spain so so again there you know yeah

00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:47,410
but the pictures behind me are not the

00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:51,900
same so that was wrong answer hahaha

00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:56,080
okay okay so this is this is the problem

00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:59,050
believe it or not the user design of the

00:35:56,080 --> 00:36:03,250
interface and and the interaction itself

00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:05,190
has a lot of biases and here you mature

00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:07,690
you know this pages and maybe an old

00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:09,760
screen for the state but here I can show

00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:13,990
you all the problems in this page and

00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:16,560
and in any other e-commerce website so

00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:19,410
the first one and the main one is

00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:22,750
presentation or it's partial balance

00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:24,880
basically here I depend see another bias

00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:31,240
I'd like to play tennis on to watch

00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:35,590
tennis and then basically I'm seen only

00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:38,770
like three items or maybe four five do

00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:41,410
you know how many there are below 10,000

00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:43,450
20,000 first we don't know and second

00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:46,600
this is a very small fraction it's not

00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:49,030
the tip of the iceberg if the ice cube

00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:50,860
on the top of the tip of the iceberg so

00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:53,770
we're seeing just a little bit of all

00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:56,320
possible things you can see then you

00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:59,890
have position balance so position buyer

00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:01,569
is that you are basically

00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:03,220
in this page and because of cultural

00:37:01,569 --> 00:37:06,190
bias if you are in the Western world you

00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:07,900
will read first from left to right and

00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:10,380
from top to bottom so the first thing

00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:13,990
you will look at is this corner the

00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:16,720
top-left corner and then one particular

00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:19,029
case of position bias is ranking bias so

00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:21,190
basically you click more on number one

00:37:19,029 --> 00:37:22,839
only because it's in number one because

00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:24,809
the system is telling you that is better

00:37:22,839 --> 00:37:30,240
and your trusted the system but maybe

00:37:24,809 --> 00:37:34,420
who knows another one is social bias

00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:36,490
basically you will be biased to the

00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:38,470
judgment of other people or even to your

00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:40,569
friends if you have a referral social

00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:42,430
bias is very strong we do not have sinks

00:37:40,569 --> 00:37:45,970
depending on what other people think and

00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:47,650
not what we think and then we have other

00:37:45,970 --> 00:37:49,690
interaction balance for example some

00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:52,900
people will never scroll and see the

00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:55,599
other items in this page or maybe some

00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:56,829
people have other issues like visual

00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:01,089
issues like for example they are

00:37:56,829 --> 00:38:05,470
electronic or they are dyslexic and then

00:38:01,089 --> 00:38:08,170
then they see things as you see and more

00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:11,589
problem is that is a cascade of biases

00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:14,650
so for example here I have a list of

00:38:11,589 --> 00:38:17,529
possibilities so presentation bias

00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:19,569
affects everything interaction bias

00:38:17,529 --> 00:38:21,400
effects for example click bias there's

00:38:19,569 --> 00:38:24,700
some people that needs to click and then

00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:27,880
then this is not the system is your bias

00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:29,470
and also people need to for example to

00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:32,230
move the mouse so some people read

00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:34,180
moving the mouse so this another self

00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:36,069
selection bias is coming from you so

00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:38,230
here is the combination from the biases

00:38:36,069 --> 00:38:42,009
that come from system and the buyer has

00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:43,779
it come from people and here you can see

00:38:42,009 --> 00:38:47,440
this in practice also these are some

00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:50,289
studies using eye tracking and a heat

00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:52,539
map and you see that in 2005 most people

00:38:50,289 --> 00:38:54,519
will start in this corner but when

00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:57,400
Google started with a universal search

00:38:54,519 --> 00:39:00,069
and had other kind of answers on the on

00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:01,930
the first page then people have started

00:39:00,069 --> 00:39:04,480
to look at images because images attract

00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:07,329
our attention so you see that here not

00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:09,059
only on the top left corner but also on

00:39:07,329 --> 00:39:13,380
on other seats

00:39:09,059 --> 00:39:17,209
now if you put this and see the data

00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:19,799
this is an example of a typical click

00:39:17,209 --> 00:39:22,650
distribution you will see the number one

00:39:19,799 --> 00:39:26,219
is like almost in this example more than

00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:27,989
40% of the clicks part of the problem is

00:39:26,219 --> 00:39:32,339
for is called navigational queries maybe

00:39:27,989 --> 00:39:34,589
I should call this is part of your sit

00:39:32,339 --> 00:39:38,419
flow of your minimal effort log instead

00:39:34,589 --> 00:39:42,509
of writing the website you want to

00:39:38,419 --> 00:39:45,150
basically look at you do a search these

00:39:42,509 --> 00:39:47,219
are about 15% of the queries today now

00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:50,849
we take this 50% out we still have

00:39:47,219 --> 00:39:53,219
almost 30% here which is a lot and this

00:39:50,849 --> 00:39:56,489
is where the ranking biased and so this

00:39:53,219 --> 00:39:58,529
is the ranking bias and here in the

00:39:56,489 --> 00:40:01,499
position 10 you find some another

00:39:58,529 --> 00:40:02,819
example of interaction bias some

00:40:01,499 --> 00:40:04,619
engineer in the first search engine

00:40:02,819 --> 00:40:07,289
homework what was the first search

00:40:04,619 --> 00:40:08,969
engine decided that we need to fear is

00:40:07,289 --> 00:40:10,559
false 10 by 10 by 10

00:40:08,969 --> 00:40:13,979
why not the size of the screen or

00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:18,079
whatever clearly must be an engineer all

00:40:13,979 --> 00:40:18,079
right so that's another bias

00:40:19,189 --> 00:40:30,229
now if we put this data in a block graph

00:40:23,669 --> 00:40:33,599
on the kicks rate value graph on the run

00:40:30,229 --> 00:40:36,959
basically we will see something like

00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:38,789
this with three different lines because

00:40:36,959 --> 00:40:41,669
of this interaction bias every 10

00:40:38,789 --> 00:40:45,119
results however what we will really like

00:40:41,669 --> 00:40:47,429
to know is the two it's a true

00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:48,779
distribution something like this that

00:40:47,429 --> 00:40:50,699
doesn't depend on interaction and

00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:52,019
doesn't depend really on the order so

00:40:50,699 --> 00:40:54,179
the first one doesn't get more clicks

00:40:52,019 --> 00:40:56,429
and F would actually publish the only

00:40:54,179 --> 00:41:01,109
two papers known as far as I know that

00:40:56,429 --> 00:41:04,019
basically the bias these things sort of

00:41:01,109 --> 00:41:09,140
not two three and one got the best paper

00:41:04,019 --> 00:41:09,140
award in wisdom 2010 the last one now

00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:13,930
there are

00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:15,910
to deal with this for example you can if

00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:19,329
you know a bit more you can use machine

00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:21,519
learning to rank and then you can do put

00:41:19,329 --> 00:41:25,589
bias inside and this was another best

00:41:21,519 --> 00:41:25,589
paper award from Cornell in 2017

00:41:26,770 --> 00:41:32,630
also we had done for work with another

00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:37,010
of my former PhD student that now is in

00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:38,480
Spain kind of Castillo and one of his pc

00:41:37,010 --> 00:41:40,520
students on Farrington's

00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:42,440
and when I put these three examples

00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:44,150
because these are see examples of how to

00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:46,010
deal with the problem so the first one

00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:49,520
is the buy of the input get what are

00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:51,050
there the right clicks the second

00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:52,760
possibilities to tune the RN to deal

00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:54,890
with bias this is the second case and

00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:56,810
the last one is you can do by us the

00:41:54,890 --> 00:42:00,830
output is the case of this fair rankings

00:41:56,810 --> 00:42:03,500
paper that I mentioned okay we are

00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:07,130
almost ending and we need to basically

00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:10,180
to look at the final part is the

00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:10,180
feedback loop to

00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:15,310
the system and here you have two types

00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:17,500
of second-order bias one that has to do

00:42:15,310 --> 00:42:19,119
with personalization and one that has to

00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:21,880
do with putting content back into the

00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:24,760
web let's start with that so let's say

00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:28,200
you're writing your next blog entry you

00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:30,910
know that content is redundant and maybe

00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:33,310
you will find things that are correlated

00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:36,040
but you don't care you don't know and

00:42:33,310 --> 00:42:40,150
then you create a new page you search

00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:43,810
for something you take three pieces of

00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:46,210
the first results we would have ranking

00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:50,319
by us and then we put these three pieces

00:42:46,210 --> 00:42:52,329
on the new page of course we we are not

00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:54,310
doing patrician so we will quote these

00:42:52,329 --> 00:42:56,710
put the author here and put a link back

00:42:54,310 --> 00:42:58,960
to the source so this would be like

00:42:56,710 --> 00:43:00,940
proper research and now you feel some

00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:03,190
shame because nothing from you in this

00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:06,700
then you put some content here no now

00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:09,819
it's nicely together tight and then you

00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:12,010
feel some pride and then ego comes in

00:43:09,819 --> 00:43:13,960
and you put your name and then you

00:43:12,010 --> 00:43:16,839
publish this part into the web what's

00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:20,380
the problem the problem of the is that

00:43:16,839 --> 00:43:23,230
this content depends on the ranking

00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:25,720
function of this search engine so

00:43:23,230 --> 00:43:27,819
basically you are reinforcing the belief

00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:31,510
to this search engine that this content

00:43:27,819 --> 00:43:34,359
is really good even its effectiveness so

00:43:31,510 --> 00:43:36,760
in this paper that we published 12 years

00:43:34,359 --> 00:43:41,230
ago and this was maybe my first bias

00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:42,550
paper with a null from a student we

00:43:41,230 --> 00:43:43,000
chose that the redundancy was much

00:43:42,550 --> 00:43:46,119
larger

00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,170
we found the ancestors of every web page

00:43:46,119 --> 00:43:49,089
and that's why it's called the

00:43:47,170 --> 00:43:51,130
geological tree of the web so basically

00:43:49,089 --> 00:43:52,960
you have all these ancestor to a page

00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:56,200
and then you can see from where

00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:56,740
something came okay and what is the

00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:59,220
other case

00:43:56,740 --> 00:44:01,960
well personalization I know if you have

00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:03,910
learned about the filter bubble but

00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:05,440
basically it may be inode or fished from

00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:08,440
a long time but they will never be able

00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:10,290
to becoming something to him that is new

00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:12,970
to him because it's not in the data and

00:44:10,290 --> 00:44:16,030
then he will add it but it's new source

00:44:12,970 --> 00:44:18,430
which I don't know but this like this

00:44:16,030 --> 00:44:20,980
movie that surely you have seen this

00:44:18,430 --> 00:44:22,869
movie maybe not with the book but it's

00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:23,320
like The Truman Show this person was

00:44:22,869 --> 00:44:25,540
very high

00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:27,670
we live in a bubble until he knew there

00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:29,140
was in a bubble and then some people

00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:31,570
wants to get out of the bubble some

00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:32,140
other people want to leave want to stay

00:44:31,570 --> 00:44:35,290
in the bubble

00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:38,790
that's about solutions to break the

00:44:35,290 --> 00:44:41,170
bubble diversity novelty serendipity

00:44:38,790 --> 00:44:43,000
even something I call my dark side and

00:44:41,170 --> 00:44:45,790
we like to see the most different person

00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,970
from me when I'm watching news not

00:44:45,790 --> 00:44:51,540
because I want to see the news of that

00:44:47,970 --> 00:44:54,340
person because I know how far I am from

00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:57,150
people because I think we have the bias

00:44:54,340 --> 00:45:00,760
that people is closer to us and we think

00:44:57,150 --> 00:45:07,560
that every election I think proves us

00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:07,560
wrong so and this is a very important

00:45:07,910 --> 00:45:13,339
corollary of what I said before if

00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:15,170
people is in a battle then the system is

00:45:13,339 --> 00:45:18,260
also in a battle but it's a much larger

00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:20,180
battle but still a Babel so even though

00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:22,369
short-term video to musician you have a

00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:24,500
partial knowledge of the world maybe you

00:45:22,369 --> 00:45:26,569
don't explore too much things that that

00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:28,099
you feel they are not interesting or you

00:45:26,569 --> 00:45:30,530
don't find the right people that will

00:45:28,099 --> 00:45:33,589
click in for example in an ad or in a or

00:45:30,530 --> 00:45:36,530
buy another item and then you never do

00:45:33,589 --> 00:45:38,690
long-term revenue optimization and this

00:45:36,530 --> 00:45:40,940
has a very important impact in the long

00:45:38,690 --> 00:45:43,490
run because basically you have unfair

00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:45,650
markets and and fair markets are not

00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:47,390
healthy and that implies that if you

00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:49,880
don't have a fair market maybe in the

00:45:47,390 --> 00:45:52,819
future you will fail because you are

00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:54,680
basically working too much in the field

00:45:52,819 --> 00:45:57,170
of the distribution and too little on

00:45:54,680 --> 00:46:01,609
the wrong type and we have some early

00:45:57,170 --> 00:46:04,730
results I hope to publish this result

00:46:01,609 --> 00:46:08,049
this year on basically that we need to

00:46:04,730 --> 00:46:10,039
explore born to basically do a long term

00:46:08,049 --> 00:46:12,890
optimization so we need to invest today

00:46:10,039 --> 00:46:17,569
to do better tomorrow like most people

00:46:12,890 --> 00:46:21,140
do and what we are doing in intent with

00:46:17,569 --> 00:46:23,839
this problem we are launching very soon

00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:25,970
a new spot from that basically tries to

00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:29,270
assess the credibility of the

00:46:25,970 --> 00:46:33,799
information and basically to give just

00:46:29,270 --> 00:46:37,339
some awareness to people of if they have

00:46:33,799 --> 00:46:42,079
to check the facts or not so we used

00:46:37,339 --> 00:46:44,900
three levels and many different

00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:46,970
algorithms like here you have an example

00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:48,920
on the right so it is bad it's a green

00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:51,380
green means that it's a well-written

00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:53,900
article and comes from credible source

00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:57,470
and usually hard to miss that this one

00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:59,480
are truth steals may be some bias but as

00:46:57,470 --> 00:47:02,869
still the content seems to be truthful

00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:05,150
you have medium credibility the journal

00:47:02,869 --> 00:47:08,569
ones the basically are less reliable and

00:47:05,150 --> 00:47:10,940
these are two might be worth reading but

00:47:08,569 --> 00:47:12,589
you need to be careful because if you

00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:14,420
find that the revisit maybe is

00:47:12,589 --> 00:47:16,970
confirmation bias and it's not really

00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:19,579
true and basically the red ones are

00:47:16,970 --> 00:47:21,640
these are like warnings maybe this is

00:47:19,579 --> 00:47:23,619
completely false this is afrin news

00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:27,099
and for example here you can read the

00:47:23,619 --> 00:47:31,510
nice taxonomy of seven types of this

00:47:27,099 --> 00:47:34,359
information that first draft has okay

00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:37,029
220 last five minutes sorry that took

00:47:34,359 --> 00:47:39,369
longer than expected the web works

00:47:37,029 --> 00:47:39,970
thanks to bias and I said bias is also

00:47:39,369 --> 00:47:42,309
positive

00:47:39,970 --> 00:47:44,319
like caching worked because of bias

00:47:42,309 --> 00:47:46,119
because of activity bias and because of

00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:49,109
your own cell selection bastards and

00:47:46,119 --> 00:47:51,609
selection bias so what is the message

00:47:49,109 --> 00:47:54,369
the message is that you need to be aware

00:47:51,609 --> 00:47:57,849
of our own biases you need to stop this

00:47:54,369 --> 00:47:59,710
vicious cycle of bias in the web and the

00:47:57,849 --> 00:48:01,900
many research problem you are interested

00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:07,150
you can contact me I think there are

00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:11,559
many many interesting problems now if we

00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:13,329
do like a recap here by matching all

00:48:11,559 --> 00:48:15,160
this bias dimension to statistical

00:48:13,329 --> 00:48:16,720
culture and committed since that

00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:19,329
activity bias is all culture and

00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:21,309
committed what about the rest the rest

00:48:19,329 --> 00:48:22,660
seems to have a statistical component

00:48:21,309 --> 00:48:25,210
culture component and committed

00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:28,509
component but what about a rigid bias

00:48:25,210 --> 00:48:30,819
itself if we have a system written only

00:48:28,509 --> 00:48:33,039
by women and another one only written by

00:48:30,819 --> 00:48:34,690
men will they will be intrinsically

00:48:33,039 --> 00:48:36,400
different no one has done this

00:48:34,690 --> 00:48:39,940
experiment yet in something that should

00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:43,630
be done by a socialist but we can look

00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:47,380
at this very interesting experiment done

00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:50,440
in 2015 by the center for open science

00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:54,089
in Virginia where they gave people all

00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:55,599
the data about the most famous soccer

00:48:54,089 --> 00:48:59,289
competition in the world

00:48:55,599 --> 00:49:01,930
and they asked them do coral players get

00:48:59,289 --> 00:49:05,019
more red cards and white players yes or

00:49:01,930 --> 00:49:09,519
no so there is a bias or not and this

00:49:05,019 --> 00:49:12,970
was answered by 29 teams with 61 peoples

00:49:09,519 --> 00:49:14,950
of two three people in average and they

00:49:12,970 --> 00:49:17,559
were probably meant twenty said yes and

00:49:14,950 --> 00:49:19,720
nine said no we couldn't prove anybody's

00:49:17,559 --> 00:49:21,400
but the most interesting thing for me

00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:24,279
was not that they didn't agree I think

00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:28,180
that almost expected the most

00:49:24,279 --> 00:49:30,099
interesting thing did something

00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:32,500
different so here if you know a bit

00:49:30,099 --> 00:49:34,539
about the statistically they're equally

00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:35,570
likely the hypothesis line that shows of

00:49:34,539 --> 00:49:36,800
this bias or not

00:49:35,570 --> 00:49:38,930
and you can see that almost all the

00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:41,270
teams prove there wasn't ballast but

00:49:38,930 --> 00:49:43,370
some of them couldn't infer it because

00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:45,290
the the conference level interval was

00:49:43,370 --> 00:49:47,960
too large even this one that was the

00:49:45,290 --> 00:49:50,450
best proof for bias some group did

00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:54,010
induce conference levels so maybe they

00:49:50,450 --> 00:49:57,410
don't know chorus this how to did well

00:49:54,010 --> 00:49:59,720
but this shows the diversity of people

00:49:57,410 --> 00:50:02,240
so next time that you have a very

00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:04,130
important problem do you need to have

00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:07,370
different teams to solve it because

00:50:04,130 --> 00:50:09,380
otherwise some teams will will work

00:50:07,370 --> 00:50:13,490
together and then they will bias it

00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:17,480
themselves so the pendant is good to see

00:50:13,490 --> 00:50:20,270
different solutions so I put on my

00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:21,770
worries today you can read the joke it's

00:50:20,270 --> 00:50:26,600
not artificial intelligence

00:50:21,770 --> 00:50:28,940
it's still natural intelligence as why

00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:31,280
well because otherwise this will happen

00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:33,800
well the robot comes to computer says

00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:35,870
prove you are not a human and the robot

00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:37,520
says there are no more humans and the

00:50:35,870 --> 00:50:40,880
computer says correct and they both

00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:44,260
laugh and they will laugh not because

00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:47,570
robots kill humans because basically

00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:52,100
humans kill themselves and this is the

00:50:47,570 --> 00:50:55,910
problem so I hope suddenly we have an

00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:57,980
alien ship coming like a arrival and

00:50:55,910 --> 00:51:01,610
then we have to talk because that's the

00:50:57,980 --> 00:51:04,310
only way to survive so white people sing

00:51:01,610 --> 00:51:06,530
questions I will put three quotes which

00:51:04,310 --> 00:51:08,510
I think are very important for this

00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:12,230
topic the first one is an attribution to

00:51:08,510 --> 00:51:14,480
to a prime minister done by mark twain

00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:16,400
in his biographies that there are three

00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:19,130
kinds of lies lies damned lies and

00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:21,050
statistics but Martin was wrong in the

00:51:19,130 --> 00:51:24,250
tribution so I guess this is was allowed

00:51:21,050 --> 00:51:28,880
to which is alleged paradox

00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:31,730
something that in the sixties another

00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:33,410
price of economics said total the data

00:51:31,730 --> 00:51:36,110
enough and it will confess to anything

00:51:33,410 --> 00:51:39,210
this this is back to the example of of

00:51:36,110 --> 00:51:42,300
the bias study

00:51:39,210 --> 00:51:44,940
and finally from Juba Ferrari they all

00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:47,369
sort of sapiens and 25 lessons for the

00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:48,960
21st century the issues people to

00:51:47,369 --> 00:51:51,210
manipulate are the ones that believe

00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:53,070
that cannot be manipulated so next time

00:51:51,210 --> 00:51:56,520
did watch something that you agree with

00:51:53,070 --> 00:51:58,440
please remember this quote so I can take

00:51:56,520 --> 00:52:02,070
questions are also bias crystal and in

00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:03,810
that case please expect biased answers

00:52:02,070 --> 00:52:06,960
first off Ricardo thank you very much

00:52:03,810 --> 00:52:08,070
that was super fascinating one I hope

00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:10,080
you can share the slides for this

00:52:08,070 --> 00:52:11,280
because there's so much stuff in there

00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:13,050
that there's all these things that I'm

00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:14,880
like still sort of processing things you

00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:17,670
said earlier now if you need the flies

00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:19,910
that contribute great that would be

00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:23,910
superb and there's a long that be super

00:52:19,910 --> 00:52:26,040
we have a couple of questions

00:52:23,910 --> 00:52:28,020
the first one is very mozillian question

00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:31,020
but I think it's relevant to a lot of

00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:32,369
related stuff at Mozilla we often want

00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:34,500
to take a sample of web pages

00:52:32,369 --> 00:52:35,930
representative of what people visit

00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:38,640
rather than just what's out there

00:52:35,930 --> 00:52:40,680
starting with a list of the top domains

00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:42,330
then considering only those sites home

00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:44,910
pages isn't a very good method for that

00:52:42,330 --> 00:52:46,380
and spying on our users we also feel as

00:52:44,910 --> 00:52:47,730
a bit off the table right like that's

00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:51,810
something that we don't really want to

00:52:47,730 --> 00:52:53,490
be doing do you have any tips and I

00:52:51,810 --> 00:52:54,839
should meant that from Felix Lawrence

00:52:53,490 --> 00:52:56,420
who asked that particular one who is one

00:52:54,839 --> 00:52:57,690
of our data science people in Vancouver

00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:59,820
yes

00:52:57,690 --> 00:53:02,790
so yeah very important question because

00:52:59,820 --> 00:53:08,820
I think you're you're biasing the data

00:53:02,790 --> 00:53:13,530
to yourself yeah so so basically you

00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:16,980
need to to consider for example you need

00:53:13,530 --> 00:53:19,020
to find that what is the right way to

00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:22,200
devise that so basically will be similar

00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:24,300
to the click example so they say you

00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:26,010
want to see okay how much of the head I

00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:27,750
need to sample and how much of the tail

00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:30,030
I need to sample how much of the tour's

00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:34,349
I need to sample but basically you have

00:53:30,030 --> 00:53:35,910
a much more fair distribution in your

00:53:34,349 --> 00:53:37,800
case might be very difficult to do

00:53:35,910 --> 00:53:40,050
because it's content and it's a bias to

00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:42,960
search and many other things but you can

00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:46,260
do some IB testing basically changing

00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:48,510
changing the distribution and basically

00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:50,789
in some sense if you change the

00:53:48,510 --> 00:53:54,209
distribution and what you get

00:53:50,789 --> 00:53:56,549
later what you see people seen is

00:53:54,209 --> 00:53:58,349
basically the same distribution but

00:53:56,549 --> 00:54:00,779
let's say you have only a few classes

00:53:58,349 --> 00:54:02,579
then you have the right the right

00:54:00,779 --> 00:54:05,849
numbers so basically you it's like a

00:54:02,579 --> 00:54:09,539
fixed point algorithm when you find when

00:54:05,849 --> 00:54:10,769
you match the reality and this would be

00:54:09,539 --> 00:54:12,029
very important because then you can

00:54:10,769 --> 00:54:14,369
improve for example you can improve

00:54:12,029 --> 00:54:16,979
ranking with this in this way so in some

00:54:14,369 --> 00:54:19,559
sense what clique the balancing does is

00:54:16,979 --> 00:54:22,469
improving ranking and you should do the

00:54:19,559 --> 00:54:24,029
same here to other techniques to do it I

00:54:22,469 --> 00:54:25,769
think it will be more costly because

00:54:24,029 --> 00:54:28,650
maybe you need some some do

00:54:25,769 --> 00:54:30,900
manipulations but but I think if you

00:54:28,650 --> 00:54:34,049
read the three papers III mentioned here

00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:35,609
about click the biasing and also this

00:54:34,049 --> 00:54:37,650
idea of a fixed point our in there

00:54:35,609 --> 00:54:40,890
haven't seen it but there will be nice

00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:43,829
study to do you can you can get a much

00:54:40,890 --> 00:54:45,809
better sampling at least you know in

00:54:43,829 --> 00:54:47,669
which direction you need to go this is

00:54:45,809 --> 00:54:49,739
very important sometimes you don't know

00:54:47,669 --> 00:54:51,689
which side you're biased you know the

00:54:49,739 --> 00:54:55,739
site you need to go to more to the tour

00:54:51,689 --> 00:54:57,809
today yeah there's something nice about

00:54:55,739 --> 00:54:59,400
an answer which it relies on like great

00:54:57,809 --> 00:55:00,900
ok complete the feedback loop and then

00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:02,339
see if it looks like it's most right

00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:05,069
like there's something that feels like a

00:55:02,339 --> 00:55:09,059
good answer another question here from

00:55:05,069 --> 00:55:13,199
Bianca Bianca's in well usually she's in

00:55:09,059 --> 00:55:14,789
our Mountain View office and she asks

00:55:13,199 --> 00:55:17,669
what's the alternative to a fork

00:55:14,789 --> 00:55:19,019
summoning foot sorry that she got it

00:55:17,669 --> 00:55:20,369
right I always get that word wrong I'm

00:55:19,019 --> 00:55:22,199
gonna try again what is the alternative

00:55:20,369 --> 00:55:24,599
to a folksonomy

00:55:22,199 --> 00:55:26,400
for the example the image uploaded to

00:55:24,599 --> 00:55:27,779
rank system with the suggested tank so

00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:31,559
if you put the tags in and you in the

00:55:27,779 --> 00:55:33,509
unity spies what's a good way around so

00:55:31,559 --> 00:55:35,819
there's no good way around it but but

00:55:33,509 --> 00:55:38,939
you can you can use the tax that I said

00:55:35,819 --> 00:55:42,599
to improve search so because basically

00:55:38,939 --> 00:55:46,229
you are trying to to enlarge your tag

00:55:42,599 --> 00:55:48,539
distribution to to help other people but

00:55:46,229 --> 00:55:52,229
the other way to do that is basically to

00:55:48,539 --> 00:55:55,199
basically use this thesis error after a

00:55:52,229 --> 00:55:57,749
quick expansion technique to help some

00:55:55,199 --> 00:55:59,909
search but if you tell people to

00:55:57,749 --> 00:56:02,279
annotate basically you are killing the

00:55:59,909 --> 00:56:04,369
person on very slowly but you're killing

00:56:02,279 --> 00:56:04,369
it

00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:08,900
say okay we'll help people and only we

00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:10,700
will use the data coming from people but

00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:13,130
it's still the problem that no know much

00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:14,630
new data will come and especially maybe

00:56:13,130 --> 00:56:16,640
in the cases that you want the data to

00:56:14,630 --> 00:56:19,430
can see also biasing the process itself

00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:22,130
of which which images will get more tax

00:56:19,430 --> 00:56:26,270
or not maybe some images will get no tax

00:56:22,130 --> 00:56:27,920
at all and then some classes of some

00:56:26,270 --> 00:56:29,510
tests of labels will be worse than other

00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:31,310
types of labels and also you don't want

00:56:29,510 --> 00:56:35,540
to add these kinds of biases in your

00:56:31,310 --> 00:56:37,280
system one more question is when it's

00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:38,960
also from feeling Florence so they

00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:42,320
decided one of our data scientists in

00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:44,540
Vancouver and at some point should you

00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:45,859
give up trying to devise your training

00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:48,020
set from the predictions of your old

00:56:45,859 --> 00:56:49,820
models and instead try and find other

00:56:48,020 --> 00:56:51,560
ways of optimizing the system so

00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:53,540
artificially boosting products do you

00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:55,460
think would succeed to see if that boost

00:56:53,540 --> 00:57:00,410
ends up in model retraining feedback

00:56:55,460 --> 00:57:06,680
loop in principle yes but the question

00:57:00,410 --> 00:57:09,320
is if that v is that idea using data and

00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:12,830
then using data we are back to the

00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:14,570
problem so we have biasing data so so I

00:57:12,830 --> 00:57:16,730
would prefer something like my first

00:57:14,570 --> 00:57:18,200
answer that if you can have like a fixed

00:57:16,730 --> 00:57:21,770
point algorithm but you can do like a

00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:25,280
small ad test in the test and see what

00:57:21,770 --> 00:57:27,050
is the reaction of people and of course

00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:28,640
you can do this we said also different

00:57:27,050 --> 00:57:31,910
samples of people so you don't you are

00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:35,720
not biased to example maybe you will see

00:57:31,910 --> 00:57:38,480
the the right way to go but again I

00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:41,270
think that the the first step is first

00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:43,280
you know if there is a pilots second if

00:57:41,270 --> 00:57:45,260
to know the direction of the bias so for

00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:47,450
example in the example you need to go to

00:57:45,260 --> 00:57:49,580
more to the tail and this is very

00:57:47,450 --> 00:57:51,530
important also when you sample query

00:57:49,580 --> 00:57:54,680
logs I have a paper on how to sample

00:57:51,530 --> 00:57:56,990
properly query logs not only the way to

00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:59,180
sample distribution but also the way to

00:57:56,990 --> 00:58:01,099
sample the size because this is very

00:57:59,180 --> 00:58:04,160
important if you are looking for

00:58:01,099 --> 00:58:05,750
something that is not common the size of

00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:08,180
your sample will be like one order

00:58:05,750 --> 00:58:09,890
magnitude bigger at least and maybe two

00:58:08,180 --> 00:58:12,260
orders of magnitude bigger at least and

00:58:09,890 --> 00:58:14,630
the standard error formula so you need

00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:16,160
to be very careful many times people do

00:58:14,630 --> 00:58:17,850
the wrong sample they don't see for them

00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:21,600
trying to look for and then they

00:58:17,850 --> 00:58:23,640
inferred that that's not common which is

00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:26,370
a when you're looking for seemed to

00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:29,880
happen one every ten thousand times one

00:58:26,370 --> 00:58:32,400
every ten thousand times maybe you need

00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:35,510
to have like a hundred million in the

00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:40,170
sample and but I have a formula

00:58:35,510 --> 00:58:41,700
corrected formula for that I'm gonna dig

00:58:40,170 --> 00:58:44,730
up that paper I look forward to figuring

00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:47,460
that one out but and I will put it on

00:58:44,730 --> 00:58:49,350
appropriate channels I have another

00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:52,980
question that came in from YouTube this

00:58:49,350 --> 00:58:57,090
is from the divine androgyne awakening

00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:59,130
LGBTQ and they asked question what then

00:58:57,090 --> 00:59:01,770
is the most foolproof way to get to the

00:58:59,130 --> 00:59:03,840
closest thing to unbiased truth is there

00:59:01,770 --> 00:59:06,330
a way to validate source bias for

00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:08,400
example the Washington Post being owned

00:59:06,330 --> 00:59:10,800
by an Amazon owner would automatically

00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:14,520
notice any note anything about Amazon

00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:16,350
having popular possible bias so I guess

00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:18,180
this boils down to do you believe that

00:59:16,350 --> 00:59:19,560
there that the truth is out there right

00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:25,770
do you believe that there is such a

00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:30,030
thing as unbiased with scientists

00:59:25,770 --> 00:59:33,660
so let me disclose my limitations to

00:59:30,030 --> 00:59:35,160
answer this question this is a lot a

00:59:33,660 --> 00:59:39,630
question for me is a question for a

00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:41,700
philosopher right I think it first would

00:59:39,630 --> 00:59:44,930
eat to the side that the culture so the

00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:48,480
answer will depend on the culture I

00:59:44,930 --> 00:59:50,730
believe that that for some things that

00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:53,640
are very basic we said we can agree on

00:59:50,730 --> 00:59:55,710
some truth not like human rights for

00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:59,880
example is something that we'd have a

00:59:55,710 --> 01:00:02,700
good agreed is true for everyone but for

00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:04,710
example of course I think there in any

01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:07,830
media disbalance so I don't believe in

01:00:04,710 --> 01:00:10,020
and meet and biased media but the first

01:00:07,830 --> 01:00:11,730
thing is to acknowledge that bias for

01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:14,250
example to our knowledge somewhere says

01:00:11,730 --> 01:00:16,860
remember for example in the case of

01:00:14,250 --> 01:00:19,770
washing the pot will be remember we are

01:00:16,860 --> 01:00:21,210
owned by Amazon and this flow of that so

01:00:19,770 --> 01:00:23,700
if you disclose all your

01:00:21,210 --> 01:00:26,040
conflict-of-interest is the first step

01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:30,200
to to address balance if you don't

01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:34,370
disclose then I will say okay

01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:35,690
I can't just bully this this information

01:00:34,370 --> 01:00:38,870
because they are not disclosing all

01:00:35,690 --> 01:00:41,840
their conflicts we should disclose all

01:00:38,870 --> 01:00:43,790
our coffee because even that may help us

01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:49,190
to find biases that we are not aware of

01:00:43,790 --> 01:00:51,980
so I had done consciously that the last

01:00:49,190 --> 01:00:53,900
three years and I have changed even my

01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:57,550
language to respect to gender for

01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:59,990
example bias and try to to be aware of

01:00:57,550 --> 01:01:02,360
things that most people are not aware of

01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:05,330
and they appreciate it oh I never

01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:06,800
noticed that I said that because it's

01:01:05,330 --> 01:01:09,530
unconscious and isn't the main problem

01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:11,570
with bias another problem there it's

01:01:09,530 --> 01:01:14,090
also related to the question is do you

01:01:11,570 --> 01:01:16,940
want to fix that or not I feel it is the

01:01:14,090 --> 01:01:18,860
main problem if some people like to have

01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:21,350
the bias because then bias allows to

01:01:18,860 --> 01:01:26,620
manipulate other people the question is

01:01:21,350 --> 01:01:26,620
why I want to solve it if with this way

01:01:34,450 --> 01:01:37,970
so we're a bit over time but I'm gonna

01:01:36,590 --> 01:01:39,950
keep going because we have a couple of

01:01:37,970 --> 01:01:42,890
more interesting questions but I want to

01:01:39,950 --> 01:01:46,430
hear about I don't we're not that

01:01:42,890 --> 01:01:49,910
pressed and this but so the first

01:01:46,430 --> 01:01:51,980
question is from Ian Wesley Smith and

01:01:49,910 --> 01:01:53,180
he's amazingly in who's at pocket I

01:01:51,980 --> 01:01:56,270
think he's in San Francisco but I

01:01:53,180 --> 01:01:58,070
wouldn't reject and he asks about myths

01:01:56,270 --> 01:01:59,210
and disinformation a bit I mean that's a

01:01:58,070 --> 01:02:01,670
topic that we've addressed in this

01:01:59,210 --> 01:02:03,530
speaker series before we had some

01:02:01,670 --> 01:02:06,050
fascinating presentations from Kate

01:02:03,530 --> 01:02:07,310
starboard for example and talking about

01:02:06,050 --> 01:02:09,770
some of the work that she's done on that

01:02:07,310 --> 01:02:11,570
but this gets back to this same question

01:02:09,770 --> 01:02:14,720
what can we do when people don't agree

01:02:11,570 --> 01:02:16,220
what is true especially when we don't

01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:24,070
want users to end up in her filter

01:02:16,220 --> 01:02:28,250
bubble questions are good questions and

01:02:24,070 --> 01:02:30,470
well one of the words of one of my

01:02:28,250 --> 01:02:32,270
former PD sue they mention it well Wendy

01:02:30,470 --> 01:02:34,940
mentioned this here was for example to

01:02:32,270 --> 01:02:36,830
try to post different bills because when

01:02:34,940 --> 01:02:38,330
do you try to expose different views and

01:02:36,830 --> 01:02:42,560
people are willing to read the other

01:02:38,330 --> 01:02:43,670
view then maybe the least they will try

01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:46,550
to to

01:02:43,670 --> 01:02:49,430
to analyze the problem more objectively

01:02:46,550 --> 01:02:51,830
and we found that that was possible to

01:02:49,430 --> 01:02:55,250
do that using a common topics for

01:02:51,830 --> 01:02:58,600
example maybe two people disagree deeply

01:02:55,250 --> 01:03:02,180
about an issue but they lab the same

01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:05,420
football team or the same basketball

01:03:02,180 --> 01:03:08,410
team and they're willing to talk about

01:03:05,420 --> 01:03:10,760
this with a bear or watching the game

01:03:08,410 --> 01:03:12,620
however we found that for politics that

01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:14,510
was not possible so for other topic was

01:03:12,620 --> 01:03:16,400
possible politics was not politically

01:03:14,510 --> 01:03:20,660
something very deeply rooted and the

01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:23,480
civilization everywhere I will say that

01:03:20,660 --> 01:03:25,810
if you had to expose other views try to

01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:28,600
make people more aware

01:03:25,810 --> 01:03:32,000
doot-doot-doot interfaces that are more

01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:34,310
interactive for example i means to be

01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:36,140
able to change the point of view in the

01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:38,350
interface that can give me something

01:03:36,140 --> 01:03:40,940
more to write something more to the left

01:03:38,350 --> 01:03:43,310
show me where I am in whatever I'm

01:03:40,940 --> 01:03:45,530
reading so feedback to the users so give

01:03:43,310 --> 01:03:48,800
the user more control not all users are

01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:50,810
excluded and that will help because then

01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:53,270
at least some people will have more

01:03:50,810 --> 01:03:56,180
control on that and especially if you

01:03:53,270 --> 01:03:57,800
believe this last quote that if you

01:03:56,180 --> 01:04:02,000
believe that cannot be manipulated

01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:04,550
you should be very like careful like

01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:07,400
struggle to see ok

01:04:04,550 --> 01:04:09,590
I've been believe that in the future AI

01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:12,080
will help us with that so we have like a

01:04:09,590 --> 01:04:14,390
system that will tell you be careful

01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:16,730
maybe here they're trying to manipulate

01:04:14,390 --> 01:04:18,260
and also late late in the night the

01:04:16,730 --> 01:04:21,470
system will say ok you manipulate the

01:04:18,260 --> 01:04:23,090
two people to today so so if we have

01:04:21,470 --> 01:04:25,370
that feedback I think that that would be

01:04:23,090 --> 01:04:29,720
helpful so please do system with more

01:04:25,370 --> 01:04:32,650
feedback and interaction I agree

01:04:29,720 --> 01:04:32,650
entirely I like that

01:04:33,350 --> 01:04:38,490
so I have one more question and this is

01:04:36,060 --> 01:04:39,870
another question from Bianca and this

01:04:38,490 --> 01:04:41,880
talks back it goes back to the very

01:04:39,870 --> 01:04:43,800
beginning of your talk when she talked

01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:45,270
about webspam is having bias on the web

01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:45,930
that obviously wasn't the focus for your

01:04:45,270 --> 01:04:47,370
presentation

01:04:45,930 --> 01:04:50,340
can you talk a little bit about that

01:04:47,370 --> 01:04:51,660
what do you consider web spam to be and

01:04:50,340 --> 01:04:53,550
can you elaborate a little bit on what

01:04:51,660 --> 01:04:58,170
bias exists there and how that impacts

01:04:53,550 --> 01:05:00,870
the web so what is fun is basically all

01:04:58,170 --> 01:05:03,140
bias because if content or links or even

01:05:00,870 --> 01:05:06,810
clicks that does have an economic think

01:05:03,140 --> 01:05:10,380
basically economic at the end economic

01:05:06,810 --> 01:05:12,450
goal to divert traffic to your site so

01:05:10,380 --> 01:05:15,830
you or you can have clicks for a four

01:05:12,450 --> 01:05:19,830
acts and then you get money using that

01:05:15,830 --> 01:05:22,470
4:30 bution so basically for me where

01:05:19,830 --> 01:05:25,410
the fund is all this class of fun that

01:05:22,470 --> 01:05:27,570
that has this goal of basically

01:05:25,410 --> 01:05:29,970
deceiving search engines and deceiving

01:05:27,570 --> 01:05:33,000
another system to get people to click on

01:05:29,970 --> 01:05:34,770
the wrong path now there's a lot of work

01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:37,860
on that that this was a lot of work

01:05:34,770 --> 01:05:45,750
especially on on the on the mm and how

01:05:37,860 --> 01:05:48,030
to detect it and order like that and I

01:05:45,750 --> 01:05:50,040
think that's at least I feel that that's

01:05:48,030 --> 01:05:51,930
already part of the of the system so

01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:54,600
also Chinese do a lot with well spam

01:05:51,930 --> 01:05:56,790
because also social networks like BOTS

01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:59,580
and all these this would be for me also

01:05:56,790 --> 01:06:01,530
web spam and would be part of they would

01:05:59,580 --> 01:06:04,380
be signal to expand in in sign up

01:06:01,530 --> 01:06:06,500
everything that is a box so the lot of

01:06:04,380 --> 01:06:10,230
work on that a lot of research and and I

01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:11,910
can do like a full talk about that only

01:06:10,230 --> 01:06:14,100
that topic so that's why I do you want

01:06:11,910 --> 01:06:18,840
to get deep on that because I think

01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:21,000
people also say we're a web spam but I

01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:22,260
think people is not aware of almost all

01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:24,330
the buyers that have mentioned in this

01:06:22,260 --> 01:06:26,850
talk I did is this is what I'm trying to

01:06:24,330 --> 01:06:29,310
do here like make you aware the next

01:06:26,850 --> 01:06:31,740
time your system should consider these

01:06:29,310 --> 01:06:34,200
other balances that not only affect

01:06:31,740 --> 01:06:37,350
minorities they affect all people this

01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:39,470
is also very important like interaction

01:06:37,350 --> 01:06:42,780
balance is for all people not only for

01:06:39,470 --> 01:06:45,880
for for some people like women or sale

01:06:42,780 --> 01:06:48,550
minorities this is to the market

01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:50,650
potency now we have a problem that

01:06:48,550 --> 01:06:52,030
interaction bias also affects people in

01:06:50,650 --> 01:06:57,540
different way like people with dyslexia

01:06:52,030 --> 01:06:57,540
people with visual issues and so on

01:06:57,900 --> 01:07:04,960
awesome thank you very much if this was

01:07:02,650 --> 01:07:06,580
a an in-person talk you would be having

01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:07,930
rapturous applause right now but

01:07:06,580 --> 01:07:10,420
unfortunately all you get is me saying

01:07:07,930 --> 01:07:11,860

01:07:10,420 --> 01:07:16,570
