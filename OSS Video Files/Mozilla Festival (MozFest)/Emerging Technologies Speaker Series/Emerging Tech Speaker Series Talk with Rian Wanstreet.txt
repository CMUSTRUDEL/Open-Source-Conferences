Title: Emerging Tech Speaker Series Talk with Rian Wanstreet
Publication date: 2019-08-26
Playlist: Emerging Technologies Speaker Series
Description: 
	Precision Agriculture, or high tech farming, is being heralded as a panacea solution to the ever-growing demands of an increasing global population - but the speed with which these technologies are being adopted should give anyone familiar with the Internet of Things pause. Data-driven algorithmic decisions are supplanting generational human knowledge, and grave security issues leave our food supply at-risk. 

For those concerned about data justice this is also problematic, as agreements about data availability, liability, ownership, privacy, access, and openness are being encoded in systems created largely without public input.  Farmers are aware of the potential for exploitation, and there is a growing insurgency against proprietary systems. This is evident in their involvement in the Right to Repair fight playing out in state legislatures.  

This is an opportunity for the open source community, as alternative technologies and platforms are being developed which provide farmers the ability to farm outside of walled gardens. From open source seed initiatives, to open farm technologies, to data platform cooperatives, there is a small, but growing, collaborative movement that recognizes that farmers are at a critical moment: they can  help to establish tools that advance freedom, or accept machines that foster dependencies.

In this talk, University of Washington PhD student Rian Wanstreet will discuss the the growth of precision agriculture across the globe, and the risks and opportunities it presents.

to share open this latest edition of the

00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:08,340
emerging tech speakers series ion thank

00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:11,280
you to the emerging tech team for

00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:13,410
hosting this sponsoring this our talk

00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,719
today is the rise in smart farm machines

00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:18,300
have prepared a lock-in threatens

00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:21,050
farmers and national security and how

00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,949
open-source can potentially save us all

00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:25,199
it's my pleasure and privilege to

00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:28,349
introduce today's speaker Ryan Mont

00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,269
Street a PhD student at the University

00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:32,640
of Washington and my former colleague at

00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:34,800
access now where she ran the Wrights

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,770
Khan program and started accesses small

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,780
grants program Ryan's been focusing on

00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:42,180
studying the impact of new technologies

00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,379
on the agricultural sector she's

00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:46,530
particularly concerned about the trend

00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:47,700
toward big data surveillance platforms

00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:49,379
in the industry and sees the growing

00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,300
interest in open source and platform

00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:52,829
cooperatives as an opportunity for

00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:55,410
farmers on a global scale to design

00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:57,510
their own data destinies when I was

00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:59,340
talking to Ryan ahead of this talk

00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:01,010
she was explained to me something I

00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:04,229
hadn't thought about before about how

00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:06,450
hacks on today's modern agricultural

00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:08,400
infrastructure and equipment could

00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:11,130
potentially lead to a little salting of

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,860
the earth as payloads of drones and

00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:16,290
other farming equipment get released by

00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:19,290
potentially by state actors and other

00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:21,150
malicious actors and I think this raises

00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:24,150
real questions for Society for

00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:26,580
technology for national security and I'm

00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,810
happy to have her with us today to talk

00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:30,930
to us about some of these emerging

00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:32,460
issues and merging threats please join

00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:34,680
me in welcoming her we will take

00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:37,770
questions after Ryan's presentation on

00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:40,049
the emerging technologies slack Channel

00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:43,259
for those of you resilience on the

00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:44,310
audience that's hashtag et again my

00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:50,909
pledge and pillage and welcome Ryan

00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:52,590
thank you hi thank you so much for

00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:55,619
having me I'm really excited to be here

00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:57,600
today I got to speak a couple days ago

00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:59,670
at the oyster presentation and one of

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,340
the most difficult things I'm having to

00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:04,290
consolidate your research into 10

00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,729
minutes is you have to decontextualize a

00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:08,160
lot of things and I don't have to do

00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:10,289
that here I'm so I'm very excited to be

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,360
able to flush out some of these very

00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:12,990
important issues and to be a part of

00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:18,150
this

00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:19,200
communities so let's get started are you

00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:21,450
having trouble

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,160
that's the question a John Deere rep

00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:25,050
asked a man named Chuck beaver Meyer

00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,580
when they called him during a sleet

00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:27,750
storm

00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:30,120
Chuck had been having problems getting

00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:31,680
through the earth he didn't seem to be

00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,540
getting as much power through the engine

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,640
and it turned out that that's what

00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:37,710
exactly what was happening John Deere's

00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,720
sensors had recognized that there was

00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:42,930
some kind of problem with the air intake

00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:45,030
and so for for Chuck's safety they had

00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:48,000
actually started to throttle the engine

00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:49,440
now I tell this story like Jacques was

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,540
obviously freaked out but I tell this

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,880
story because it's actually really

00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:56,340
emblematic of just how carefully

00:02:53,880 --> 00:03:00,090
machines on farms can be controlled and

00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:02,280
monitored now now that tractor is part

00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:04,200
of precision agriculture and that's what

00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:07,050
I'm going to be talking about today what

00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:10,020
it is how prevalent it is what's driving

00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:11,850
its uptake some of the problems that it

00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:14,700
presents and how people are trying to

00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:16,440
deal with these problems it should know

00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:18,870
that this is a really brief overview of

00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:21,810
a huge topic and also it's really

00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:23,880
heavily us focused and largely deals

00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:26,340
with big act but this is a very global

00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:30,450
phenomenon and also deals with farms

00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:31,830
small medium sized etc so but if you're

00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:34,290
interested in talking about any of those

00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:36,390
issues I am an academic and I'm happily

00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:39,030
- I'm happy to talk about any of that at

00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:41,670
great length and in great detail so

00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:44,520
quite simply precision agriculture is

00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:46,860
when farmers can take information from

00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:48,690
historical records from satellites from

00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:50,460
yield monitors from sensors on their

00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:52,680
machines and create what's called

00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:54,510
prescriptions and these prescriptions

00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,030
can tell a farmer or the farmers

00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:59,790
machines themselves things like where to

00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:01,350
plant how deep a seed should go how much

00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:03,360
water to put in the ground how much

00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:05,880
where to put the fertilizer or the

00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:09,950
phosphorus and it's being marketed as

00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:13,320
being more efficient more cost-effective

00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:15,360
more sustainable and there's some some

00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:17,520
evidence that this is true so some

00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,989
farmers that are have implemented these

00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:21,720
things have reported that they're using

00:04:18,989 --> 00:04:24,150
less water for example and of course if

00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:26,120
you're using robots instead of laborers

00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:28,760
ostensibly you have

00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:30,650
labor costs right and I do have to admit

00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:33,350
that there are a lot of really cool

00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:36,620
robots in this space so I wanted to show

00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:38,780
you just a couple up on the top you have

00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:40,880
a John Deere driverless tractor and

00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:42,680
that's actually the least cool thing on

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,660
this slide but I did want to put it up

00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:46,820
here to acknowledge that John Deere at

00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:48,889
least a year or two ago was the largest

00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:51,260
purveyor of automated vehicles on the

00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:54,410
planet they were way ahead in this space

00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:58,430
before way mo before Google on the right

00:04:54,410 --> 00:05:00,710
you have a yes is a the strawberry

00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:03,020
picker and fruit and vegetable BOTS are

00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:04,699
becoming incredibly prevalent incredibly

00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:08,150
quickly and that's because of labor

00:05:04,699 --> 00:05:11,000
needs on the bottom you have the

00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:13,880
Prospero BOTS now they're cool they work

00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,610
it together like like bugs at like in an

00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:19,820
ant colony and they tend to individual

00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:21,680
seeds and plants now on the other side

00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:24,789
you have the Horta box that's my

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:27,440
personal favorite you know they seek out

00:05:24,789 --> 00:05:29,479
individual weeds and can apply herbicide

00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,039
directly but it's also equipped with a

00:05:29,479 --> 00:05:32,810
little something extra

00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:35,960
it actually has lasers and a

00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:40,849
flamethrower for some really tenacious

00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:44,300
weeds I guess so behind the growth of

00:05:40,849 --> 00:05:46,970
this sector is a fact you'll hear over

00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:50,060
and over again in almost every article

00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:52,010
you read we have 9 we're gonna have 9

00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:54,889
billion people we have to feed by the

00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:57,470
year 2050 and it's true we do have a

00:05:54,889 --> 00:05:59,479
growing population and growing alongside

00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:01,550
of it is the precision agriculture

00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:04,639
market I do have to say I'm from

00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:06,470
Missouri I have farmers of my family and

00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,449
before I started this research I had no

00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:11,080
idea how prevalent some of this had

00:06:08,449 --> 00:06:17,750
become on America's farmland and

00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:19,760
globally as well the in 2016 this market

00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:22,970
was worth about three billion dollars

00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:25,430
and a very low ball estimate of what it

00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:27,860
might be worth in 2021 is around

00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:29,900
nineteen billion dollars some people say

00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:33,139
that that's what it just the robotics

00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:37,669
arm of this might be worth in 2021 it's

00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:38,160
been since 12 2012 its investment has

00:06:37,669 --> 00:06:41,400
grown

00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:43,680
20 percent every year so that might be a

00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:46,110
reason that so many people are eager to

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,460
get into this industry so you have

00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:50,430
players that everybody is gonna

00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:52,710
recognize right like John Deere Monsanto

00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:55,560
and these companies have invested really

00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:58,110
early and very quickly in data analytics

00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,910
but you also have new folks getting in

00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:02,550
like IBM and Microsoft

00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:04,050
I'm venture capitalist many whom are

00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:06,660
involved in the tech industry like

00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:08,700
Google Ventures and this is a global

00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:12,090
phenomenon although North America has

00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:14,340
had we've adopted it more quickly we

00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:17,300
have about 50% of the market currently

00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:21,690
the highest growth is anticipated to be

00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:24,990
in Asia in Russia in China and Brazil

00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:28,620
has a very thriving market so that's a

00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:31,260
very broad overview of this bustling

00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:33,480
market basically we're in the midst of a

00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:35,430
fourth agricultural revolution big data

00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:37,860
in tech is gonna save the world from

00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:40,620
famine and by the way a lot of people

00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:43,170
are gonna make a lot of money so what

00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:46,950
could be wrong with this right well

00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:48,450
obviously there are some catches and

00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:51,180
we're gonna talk about a few of them

00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:52,920
like first there's the problems with big

00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:54,750
data and many of these are gonna be very

00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:58,919
familiar to the folks in that are

00:07:54,750 --> 00:08:00,810
listening to this talk so some of the

00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:03,180
problems are like how is it being

00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:05,550
monetized who owns it who has access to

00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:07,320
it I'm very curious about how the

00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:09,840
algorithms are being written that are

00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:11,130
creating these prescriptions farmers are

00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,550
really concerned about this topic

00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:16,530
they're in a relatively small pool and

00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:18,870
so not only is there information

00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:22,020
potentially worth more but they're also

00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:23,700
more easily identifiable and they really

00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:26,850
want to know how could this information

00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:29,040
potentially be used against them so can

00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:31,710
the government access this data could

00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:34,700
their landlords and if these algorithms

00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:37,740
which have very keen predictive

00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:40,380
capabilities say that they're not

00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:40,830
growing as much corn as they're supposed

00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,660
to

00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:45,150
can their landlords kick them off their

00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:47,370
land and speaking of predictive

00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:49,610
capabilities could anyone use that

00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:51,279
information to play the market and

00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:53,050
fundamentally for

00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:55,029
really want to know like why should

00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:57,430
someone else make money off the data

00:08:55,029 --> 00:08:59,560
that they're generating so in the

00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:02,560
cybersecurity realm like anyone familiar

00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:04,360
with the Internet of Things at all knows

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:07,360
about the problems with smart with smart

00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:09,459
devices farm is bigger farmers biggest

00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,470
fear is that they're gonna walk outside

00:09:09,459 --> 00:09:13,779
one day and their tractors are gonna be

00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:17,259
bricked this is a really well-documented

00:09:13,779 --> 00:09:22,180
concern I have a slightly larger concern

00:09:17,259 --> 00:09:24,579
a couple of larger concerns what would

00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:27,430
happen if somebody decided to go after

00:09:24,579 --> 00:09:29,379
an entire network so say a malicious

00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:31,569
state actor decided that they wanted to

00:09:29,379 --> 00:09:34,269
hack John Deere's entire network or

00:09:31,569 --> 00:09:37,629
Monsanto's entire platform would it be

00:09:34,269 --> 00:09:39,579
possible to stop an entire part or like

00:09:37,629 --> 00:09:43,449
part of America's harvest from coming in

00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:47,170
could you hack like a drone fleet to

00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:51,040
drop entire plate payloads of phosphorus

00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:53,769
or herbicides like over a riverbeds for

00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:56,769
example so this sounds kind of crazy I

00:09:53,769 --> 00:09:58,930
know but the FBI is very aware of the

00:09:56,769 --> 00:10:02,079
potential for attacks in this area so in

00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:03,850
2016 they sent out a bulletin to front

00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:06,189
the farming community and they were like

00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:08,259
hey guys we're really excited that

00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:10,240
you're buying into these technologies we

00:10:08,259 --> 00:10:13,420
think it's gonna make your your work

00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:15,459
more efficient but like by the way you

00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:17,649
should know that you're now really

00:10:15,459 --> 00:10:20,170
vulnerable to ransomware and like

00:10:17,649 --> 00:10:22,449
bt-dubs if you're involved in GMO crops

00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:26,170
like hacktivists might just come after

00:10:22,449 --> 00:10:28,420
you now their recommendation for farmers

00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:30,790
was that they'd become more active in

00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:33,459
their own cybersecurity that they teach

00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:35,649
themselves about social engineering but

00:10:33,459 --> 00:10:38,679
they start monitoring their outgoing

00:10:35,649 --> 00:10:41,649
data and block unknown I Peter addresses

00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:43,569
too close Onion unused ports to utilize

00:10:41,649 --> 00:10:45,490
VPNs and to start using two-factor

00:10:43,569 --> 00:10:47,199
authentication and to make sure that

00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:49,209
everyone on their farms are doing the

00:10:47,199 --> 00:10:51,490
same thing and that's really valuable

00:10:49,209 --> 00:10:53,499
suggestions right but it's a pretty

00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:54,699
heavy lift I don't even know how to do

00:10:53,499 --> 00:10:58,120
half those things and I'm pretty

00:10:54,699 --> 00:11:00,250
technically savvy so potentially

00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:02,470
increasing the likelihood of

00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:04,059
cybersecurity attacks is the

00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:04,910
dependencies that farmers are starting

00:11:04,059 --> 00:11:09,200
to

00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:10,880
develop on proprietary software so once

00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:14,090
a company decides that they no longer

00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:15,560
want to provide software updates for

00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:17,870
some of the tools that they're they're

00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:21,440
pushing out or maybe the company goes

00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:23,300
you know goes bust what happens are they

00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,820
just gonna be perpetually vulnerable to

00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:28,940
outside attacks does it necessitate

00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:31,310
buying entirely new machines you can

00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:33,200
also imagine the financial dependencies

00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:35,030
this would create as a very few farmers

00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,950
can afford to buy things like new

00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:40,790
tractors outright these things can cost

00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:42,650
half a million dollars of course I think

00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:45,020
that that's actually what some companies

00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:47,360
that's exactly but some companies might

00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:50,060
want so John Deere for example is

00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:52,490
actually a lender in this space so not

00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:53,840
only are they selling these tractors but

00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:56,330
they're the ones that are lending the

00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:59,890
money so it creates this entire cycle of

00:11:56,330 --> 00:12:03,590
never-ending financial dependencies so

00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:06,590
Big Data cybersecurity threats software

00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:08,900
and financial dependencies these are

00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:12,080
just a few of the issues of concern but

00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:13,460
before I get to before I move on to how

00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:15,170
people are responding to some of these

00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:18,740
threats I want to take a brief detour

00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:21,140
and outline some of the less tangible

00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:24,430
concerns that are more directly tied to

00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:27,440
some of my research for example as

00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:29,960
you're talking to people in the in

00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:32,090
industry and in government they'll say

00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:35,030
like of course cybersecurity is an issue

00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:36,740
and we're talking about it of course you

00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:39,350
know we have to deal with data privacy

00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:41,870
and security but like we don't have time

00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:43,760
to stop we have to adopt these

00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:46,220
technologies as quickly as possible

00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:48,440
quickly as possible the gravity of the

00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:50,510
threat facing our our planet is too

00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:53,090
important because didn't you know we

00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:55,330
have 9 billion miles we have to feed by

00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:59,150
00:12:55,330 --> 00:13:01,880
the threat of famine has been wielded in

00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:04,250
the u.s. to encourage the implementation

00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:06,980
of new technologies since the Industrial

00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:09,680
Revolution it is a perpetual boogeyman

00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:13,520
and it's one that I frankly find hard to

00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:16,880
take seriously when a full 73% of our

00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:18,220
farmland is used for the purposes of

00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,700
raising ethanol and

00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:23,950
cattle so in the future if you hear

00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:25,360
these kind of arguments made like I

00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:26,860
think it's really important for us to

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,840
push back against some of the cyber

00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:31,540
bullying at best it's a

00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:35,170
misrepresentation of facts or misguided

00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:38,020
techno utopianism and at worst it's kind

00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:40,120
of a Craven we need to encourage farmers

00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:43,510
to buy in tech technology they may not

00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:45,850
need these are market choices so if I

00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:47,620
had more time I'd also challenge some of

00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:50,620
the claims being made about efficiency

00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:52,930
cost effectiveness and sustainability I

00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:54,490
think that you could legitimately cast

00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:56,860
some doubts about profit net

00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:58,690
profitability when you calculate the

00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:00,220
costs of many of these machines we've

00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:03,040
already talked about how expensive they

00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:06,250
are there's been all further there's

00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:10,090
been little analysis done on the long

00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:12,820
term an overall impact of the transition

00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:15,880
from manual to technical labor so you

00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:17,560
may have less laborers on the farm

00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:19,360
picking these strawberries but what does

00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:21,280
it mean when you have all of these new

00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,170
robots and costs and people having to

00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:25,810
deal with closing these ports and and

00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:31,900
and a new labor in that rep and in that

00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:33,490
realm and finally I personally find it a

00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:37,240
little hard to believe that a

00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:40,420
corporation that sells herbicide will be

00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:43,570
willing to prescribe less and less of

00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:45,430
their own product over the long term but

00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:48,220
I grew up in Missouri and my neighbor

00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:49,840
was Monsanto so maybe that has just made

00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:52,270
me a little suspicious of companies

00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:54,730
certain companies but let's switch to

00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:56,470
remedy is fright because there are

00:14:54,730 --> 00:15:00,010
actually a lot of really cool things

00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:03,940
happening in this space so in the area

00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:05,560
of data a few years ago because this was

00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:07,630
already starting to become kind of

00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:09,750
questions that farmers were asking the

00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:12,820
American Farm Bureau created a set of

00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:14,770
non-binding Data principles and some

00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:17,940
corporations signed very quickly and

00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:20,020
some even became certified saying they

00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:23,170
certified they were they were following

00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:26,530
all of the principles now the problem is

00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:28,810
is that these principles heavily benefit

00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:31,030
corporations so exploitative language

00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:32,970
can easily be enshrined in

00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:35,950
the end-user license agreements that are

00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:40,000
that are passed on to farmers so for

00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:43,240
example providers can still easily sell

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,370
data that they collect from their from

00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:48,550
their users in third-party to

00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:50,920
third-party contractors in turnkey to

00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:53,380
agree and user license agreement so

00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:55,210
these farmers are agreeing to contracts

00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:57,100
without ever even seeing them they just

00:15:55,210 --> 00:16:00,520
turn a key in their tractors and they've

00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:03,790
said yes so this is part of the reason I

00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:06,280
think that you're seeing nonprofit data

00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:08,740
groups that are trying to fill a space

00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:11,560
one of the first ones that came up was

00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:13,930
the open AG data Alliance and their goal

00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:15,550
was to combat the growing restrictions

00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:18,130
presented by the walled gardens of

00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:20,560
proprietary systems now this group is

00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:22,480
still present and people are still

00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,980
working on it although you wouldn't be

00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:27,190
able to tell if you went to their

00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:28,660
website or to their social media I think

00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:30,190
there was a couple problems that ran

00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:32,470
into but a lot of it had to do with

00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:34,589
trust so the court the climate

00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:37,180
corporation which was one of the first

00:16:34,589 --> 00:16:39,940
signers and originally originators of

00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:43,180
the Alliance was bought my bought by

00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:46,210
Monsanto who also joined an alliance and

00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:48,640
to say that Monsanto has a somewhat of a

00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:50,080
reputation amongst farmers might be a

00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:52,930
little bit of an understatement

00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:56,170
and that's typical in this field you see

00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:58,150
new entities that gain a reputation and

00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:59,920
farmers get excited about it and join it

00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:02,560
and then all of the sudden those things

00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:04,030
are bought by corporations that maybe

00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,370
farmers don't really want a relationship

00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:09,760
with and so that's why I think you've

00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:11,829
also had secondary groups that have

00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:14,230
started to form like the agricultural

00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:16,540
data coalition which is an NGO that

00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:18,819
wants to be a neutral independent farmer

00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:21,490
centric data repository now their

00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:24,970
tagline is that their farm data is

00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:26,439
farmer controlled which I have a hard

00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:28,449
time believing because their board is

00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:31,150
largely made up of lawyers lands East

00:17:28,449 --> 00:17:32,890
University academics and agribusiness

00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:35,590
professionals so I worry with kasher a

00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:37,570
little bit there the last one that I

00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:39,550
wanted to mention is something it's

00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:41,970
actually a platform cooperative I'm kind

00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:43,510
of excited about it it is actually 100%

00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:45,790
farmer led

00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:47,980
farmer owned or at least almost 100

00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:50,370
percent of their board is farmers they

00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:52,810
not only want to be a neutral repository

00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:54,720
but they once you create an analytical

00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:58,180
platform and so they partnered with IBM

00:17:54,720 --> 00:18:00,010
but both the ADC the AG coalition and

00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:02,050
the growers information cooperative are

00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:03,300
relatively new so we really have to see

00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:05,920
where they go

00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:09,010
you also have commercial enterprises

00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:11,560
that are setting themselves up as like

00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:14,410
farmer centric farmer friendly data

00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:17,200
forward alternatives to some of the

00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:19,270
proprietary systems so one in particular

00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,370
has gained a lot of buzz in the

00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:23,920
community it's called farm Roble it's a

00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:25,780
it's based on open source software and

00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:28,600
they do analytics but their real

00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:31,540
innovation is that they've figured out a

00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:34,300
way to allow farmers to sell back the

00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:35,980
data that they're generating to other

00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:37,210
analytical companies and that's

00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:39,340
something that farmers are really

00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:43,030
excited about because they want control

00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:44,920
of the data that they're generating so I

00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:48,220
should mention that there's also been

00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:50,560
some pressure in Congress to classify AG

00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:52,840
data similarly to how medical data is

00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:55,030
classified and there's actually been

00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:57,720
hearings on this but everyone agrees

00:18:55,030 --> 00:19:01,750
that such a remedy is quite a ways off

00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:03,910
and they're all there is actually some

00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:05,440
some working groups that's dealing or

00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:09,220
like talking about some of the larger

00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:10,630
cybersecurity issues as well so I think

00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:12,730
it's important to talk about the right

00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:15,700
to repair fight as well which might seem

00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:19,060
like a tangential issue but farmers have

00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:22,390
become kind of surprisingly a almost the

00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:23,740
face of this fight in some ways and if

00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:25,420
you're not familiar with rights repair

00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:27,760
it's basically a movement that's trying

00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:30,730
to ensure that folks have the right to

00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:32,290
modify or fix or you know do what they

00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:35,740
want with their technical or mechanical

00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:37,150
equipment now farmers have gotten

00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:39,370
involved because they're really not

00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:41,500
happy with being told that they don't

00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:44,680
have the right to fix their machines to

00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:47,110
modify their tractors and I think once

00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:48,940
the realization set in for them when

00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:51,220
they bought these new like high-tech

00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:54,030
machines that they would need to talk to

00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:55,940
a dealer to even diagnose a problem

00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:58,820
dealers who could be

00:19:55,940 --> 00:20:00,980
hundreds of miles away many began to

00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:03,500
look for alternative ways to get around

00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:06,200
those issues some of them began to hack

00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:08,720
their own tractors some even began to go

00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:12,379
to shady forums and download like

00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:14,870
Ukrainian software as workarounds now I

00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:16,399
I am tempted to psyche I think it's

00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:19,070
tempting to celebrate these actions

00:20:16,399 --> 00:20:21,049
right I'm certainly very grateful for

00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:23,210
farmers visibility and the right for a

00:20:21,049 --> 00:20:25,370
pair of fight I am a huge supporter of

00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:29,480
rights repair but I have a couple of

00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:31,190
caveats with this while farmers might

00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:34,070
want to preserve their rights repair

00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:36,139
there's been some disconnect with them

00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:37,309
joining the larger movement and there's

00:20:36,139 --> 00:20:40,220
a good reason for this

00:20:37,309 --> 00:20:42,259
so in Nebraska for example one of the

00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:44,059
first things that happened when the

00:20:42,259 --> 00:20:48,080
first bill was proposed right to repair

00:20:44,059 --> 00:20:51,200
bill was proposed was Apple and 1880

00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:53,389
lobbyists flooded what did the

00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:56,029
Statehouse and obviously that's spooked

00:20:53,389 --> 00:20:57,799
the farmers and so that's why you see in

00:20:56,029 --> 00:20:59,779
a couple states and I think there's like

00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:02,120
18 or 19 states that are considering

00:20:59,779 --> 00:21:04,039
these bills at this point a couple

00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:06,379
states are only considering right to

00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:07,940
repair for agricultural equipment now

00:21:06,379 --> 00:21:10,970
the second thing I wanted to mention is

00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:13,970
that Ukrainian software that they're

00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:16,009
downloading right that's a little

00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:18,200
sketchy like what else is on that

00:21:16,009 --> 00:21:20,769
software like what else could be on that

00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:23,480
software like is it possible to have

00:21:20,769 --> 00:21:25,399
malware that can be activated at a later

00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:27,110
date I'm actually working with a

00:21:25,399 --> 00:21:29,299
research scientist and the security and

00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:31,070
privacy lab at u-dub and if we can

00:21:29,299 --> 00:21:33,289
marshal some resources it's something

00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:36,139
we'd really like to investigate so I

00:21:33,289 --> 00:21:38,990
think rights repair is in some ways a

00:21:36,139 --> 00:21:42,070
battle about software dependencies and

00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:44,409
certainly in the AG AG sector it is

00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:47,960
indicative of a growing insurgency

00:21:44,409 --> 00:21:50,750
against proprietary systems and you're

00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:53,299
certainly seeing momentum in the open

00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:56,659
source space at large in the AG sector

00:21:53,299 --> 00:21:59,690
that are trying to encounter entrenched

00:21:56,659 --> 00:22:02,120
corporate interests although perhaps

00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:04,159
unsurprisingly they're running into

00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:06,379
problems with scale and some with

00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:08,880
industry capture so I wanted to mention

00:22:06,379 --> 00:22:11,220
like both what's happening

00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,380
the open-source tools sector and then

00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:15,720
the software some of you might be

00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:19,610
familiar with the open source ecology

00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:23,040
movement or civilization in a box

00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:25,860
they've begun prototyping tractors

00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:29,940
combines etc some of them that only have

00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:31,920
a hundred parts there's farm hack that's

00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:34,980
a community of collaborators that have

00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:37,110
been working to develop a open-source

00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:38,310
library of farming tools and knowledge

00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:41,130
and they've been working together since

00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:44,340
2011 and then even on the commercial

00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:46,920
side you have a a couple folks that are

00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:49,230
building like open-source tractors one

00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:52,320
at least called the ogen that cost less

00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:54,930
than $13,000 the problem with all of

00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:56,100
these tools is that they're mostly meant

00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:59,220
for smaller farms

00:22:56,100 --> 00:23:01,770
there's not many alternatives for the

00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:04,920
for the larger enterprises that mostly

00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:06,030
dominate the u.s. system and that might

00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:08,070
mean that some of the greatest

00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:10,410
innovations you see in this area are

00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:12,900
going to be in nations that don't have

00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:14,190
mega farms and actually that's largely

00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:15,870
turning out to be true there's some

00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:19,080
really cool things happening in places

00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:21,480
like Indonesia for example but luckily

00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:23,670
there are some some great innovations in

00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:26,370
the software space so for example you

00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:28,200
have farm OS which is a web-based app

00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:30,990
for farm management and does all the

00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:34,230
analytics and that's based on Drupal you

00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:36,120
also have a the University of California

00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:38,610
in Santa Barbara is developing an

00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:40,740
open-source analytical program called

00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:43,050
smart farm and I'm really interested to

00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:45,300
see where this goes because it has a

00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:47,970
distributed architecture and it's

00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:49,410
analytics is all done on the farm so

00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:52,830
they're working to create a private

00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:53,880
Black's black boxed cloud and I think

00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:56,250
that that's something that I haven't

00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:58,350
seen really talked about anywhere else

00:23:56,250 --> 00:24:00,920
now there's a handful of other ones but

00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:04,470
I just wanted to mention a couple so

00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:07,260
this all leads me to my last point and

00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:11,310
this has gone very quickly I mentioned

00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:13,110
earlier that's that I had no idea of all

00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:15,060
of these technologies being adopted in

00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:16,920
this space and I think that that's

00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:18,720
pretty common based upon my

00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:21,690
conversations with folks

00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,370
in the tech policy sector it's easy to

00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:26,640
forget that some of the tools and the

00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:28,950
policies that that we work on largely on

00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:31,830
the coast and in urban spaces have such

00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:34,500
real impacts in sectors that maybe we

00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:37,650
don't see and think about a lot but the

00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:40,650
same issues that we talk about like in

00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:43,080
this building on Twitter in all of our

00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:45,920
conference conferences surveillance

00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:47,940
platforms surveillance capitalism

00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:52,020
consolidation of power by corporations

00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:53,880
the problems with the IOT and how it

00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:55,980
poses threats to the security and

00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:58,860
privacy these things are quickly

00:24:55,980 --> 00:25:01,700
becoming as prevalent on our farms as

00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:05,250
they are already on our phones and

00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:08,070
there's a deep desire amongst many in

00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:10,650
the AG community to be a part of this

00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:13,410
technological and data ecosystem they

00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:15,510
see the potential benefits but they want

00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:18,480
to do it in a way that allows them to

00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:21,060
maintain their agency and independence

00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,530
and I think that there's there's still

00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:25,230
time for this to happen this is an

00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:26,730
industry that hasn't quite solidified to

00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:29,310
a point where it's being dominated by

00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:32,250
one or two corporations and policies are

00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:33,810
still very much in development and there

00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:35,490
are people on the ground does as you've

00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:37,500
seen that are that are already working

00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:39,960
to develop open and secure alternatives

00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:42,330
that can not only just keep the internet

00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:45,000
healthy but night might actually help

00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:46,620
keep our planet healthy and I suspect

00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,510
that that's something that people in

00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:51,420
this organization are uniquely

00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:52,890
interested in doing but I think we

00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:55,200
should start working on this as soon as

00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:57,540
possible because that tipping point is

00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:00,030
right around the corner and we might not

00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:10,410
have such opportunities tomorrow thank

00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:13,410
you so thanks Ryan that was fascinating

00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:14,610
and already we've had one person say

00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:16,740
that they're going to talk to their

00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:18,150
farmer friends and family about

00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:22,080
disabling some of that Ukrainian

00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:25,080
software so again we're gonna be taking

00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:27,420
questions in the hash tag et slack

00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:31,290
channel for those of you who are in a

00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:32,629
Commons there are those nifty boxes you

00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:35,369
can throw it with mics

00:26:32,629 --> 00:26:38,399
grace you wanna do you have a question

00:26:35,369 --> 00:26:40,169
Chris great maybe you can model the

00:26:38,399 --> 00:26:41,549
behavior we're looking for I will I'll

00:26:40,169 --> 00:26:43,320
use in if you could introduce yourself

00:26:41,549 --> 00:26:44,909
that'd be great thank you okay and thank

00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:46,769
you Ron it's very interesting I'm Chris

00:26:44,909 --> 00:26:48,330
Riley I'm here in San Francisco for

00:26:46,769 --> 00:26:51,209
those watching on video

00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:52,559
I run the policy team there's a lot in

00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:55,259
here and it's really interesting to see

00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:56,909
how the wonky issues that I and my team

00:26:55,259 --> 00:26:58,499
work on like copyright policy and

00:26:56,909 --> 00:27:00,269
competition policy and cybersecurity and

00:26:58,499 --> 00:27:02,639
so forth have these kind of very

00:27:00,269 --> 00:27:05,549
proximate real-world impacts you're

00:27:02,639 --> 00:27:08,849
trying to tell a positive story but I'm

00:27:05,549 --> 00:27:12,209
still seeing evolution of technology

00:27:08,849 --> 00:27:13,559
like AI feeling like it's going to

00:27:12,209 --> 00:27:15,119
further on level the playing field

00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:20,219
between large agriculture corporations

00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:22,619
and small farmers how how can we how can

00:27:20,219 --> 00:27:24,749
we hope to really get out ahead of that

00:27:22,619 --> 00:27:27,589
and at a time when particularly policy

00:27:24,749 --> 00:27:29,549
and law around AI are still very very

00:27:27,589 --> 00:27:32,309
unformed and the norms around us are

00:27:29,549 --> 00:27:35,279
very informed is there a way to bring in

00:27:32,309 --> 00:27:37,200
the agriculture conversation into the AI

00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:38,639
conversation to try to help because it's

00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,799
not just in agriculture obviously we

00:27:38,639 --> 00:27:42,539
want to to shape a future of AI that

00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:44,459
helps small businesses across the board

00:27:42,539 --> 00:27:48,299
not just large businesses get into that

00:27:44,459 --> 00:27:50,039
and and also I mean I'm here in San

00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:53,369
Francisco where where we just signed up

00:27:50,039 --> 00:27:55,289
for a co-op delivering us locally grown

00:27:53,369 --> 00:27:57,029
small producer fruits and vegetables

00:27:55,289 --> 00:27:59,099
like there's there's a movement there

00:27:57,029 --> 00:28:00,119
that doesn't connect with the technology

00:27:59,099 --> 00:28:01,409
and I think what you're doing is really

00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:04,379
interesting that it sits in there like

00:28:01,409 --> 00:28:05,820
what can we do on on the policy wonks

00:28:04,379 --> 00:28:07,499
side to help bridge that divide a little

00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:10,889
bit more and try to level that playing

00:28:07,499 --> 00:28:14,700
field more I didn't really give you a

00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:17,729
whole lot of little broaden yes I'll try

00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:20,549
to I'll try to answer as best I think I

00:28:17,729 --> 00:28:22,109
can I think that there's a I think

00:28:20,549 --> 00:28:25,320
there's a couple opportunities like one

00:28:22,109 --> 00:28:27,629
just because this even though like yes

00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:30,679
these like people are already talking

00:28:27,629 --> 00:28:32,999
about a AI policies in their talk but

00:28:30,679 --> 00:28:34,979
the industry and agriculture is still

00:28:32,999 --> 00:28:36,869
very much growing like it's still very

00:28:34,979 --> 00:28:38,729
much decent and so yes you have these

00:28:36,869 --> 00:28:41,609
entrenched corporations that are already

00:28:38,729 --> 00:28:44,399
very much start like dominating in other

00:28:41,609 --> 00:28:46,050
ways but there's still opportunities to

00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:49,020
kind of get involved now be

00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:51,630
this new area hasn't quite yet been

00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:53,730
developed so that's why I think that

00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:55,500
there's like it's kind of a unique

00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:58,550
opportunity to where that tipping point

00:28:55,500 --> 00:29:02,790
hasn't happened yet I also think that

00:28:58,550 --> 00:29:06,210
right now a lot of the support for

00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:07,530
research the support for well the

00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:09,600
support for research first of all is

00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:12,900
coming from corporations like John Deere

00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:14,700
Monsanto and so if there's support that

00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:16,170
starts coming from other elements that

00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:19,020
maybe have different perspectives that

00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:21,240
might help like combat some of that a

00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:23,940
little bit and also bring different

00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:25,800
perspectives that might open open up

00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:30,360
some of the opportunities and also

00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:32,220
spread spread concepts of possibilities

00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:38,120
that there are alternatives to these

00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:42,090
models etc I also think that there's

00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:44,510
maybe less of a recognition that like

00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:46,800
people were already starting to doubt

00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:50,010
they were already starting to question

00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:52,440
the their relationships with a lot of

00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:54,900
these corporations even before these

00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:58,580
data issues were coming up so apparently

00:29:54,900 --> 00:30:01,290
one of the biggest surprises to

00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:02,550
corporations like I keep saying Monsanto

00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:03,929
and deer but obviously they're not the

00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:07,679
only ones in the field I don't want to

00:30:03,929 --> 00:30:10,530
only pick on them is that when they

00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:15,620
first started to ask their customers to

00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:18,690
sign on to these agreements is that

00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:20,700
farmers were like we don't want to do

00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:24,179
this like we don't trust you and that

00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:25,679
really took these corporations back they

00:30:24,179 --> 00:30:28,710
thought that they just had the implicit

00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:30,330
consent and Trust and absolute like you

00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:32,370
know what we have we're buddies guys

00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:34,050
what's this deal so I think there's

00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:36,840
already like an understanding and a

00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:39,030
growing like fear of being caught in

00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:41,760
this these relationships that they don't

00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:45,840
want to be but there's there's a lack of

00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:48,929
understanding about other options and

00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:50,940
there's lack of other viable options and

00:30:48,929 --> 00:30:56,760
so the more that we can raise awareness

00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:59,140
of opportunities and yeah and and make

00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:01,540
those opportunities viable

00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:03,700
I think more people will be will want to

00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:08,920
join than and be part of it than you

00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:11,230
think okay good I also now want to

00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:13,090
organize a small independent farmers

00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:14,800
fly-in day to talk to Congress if

00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:16,210
there's ever a I legislation that's been

00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:18,160
considered to help make sure that it

00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:20,110
works for everybody yeah it's so much

00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:22,420
fun that would work well there's

00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:24,370
actually and I think in spare you

00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:27,760
there's a consumer hearing on the

00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:29,520
internet of things and I think that it

00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:32,980
would be great to get farmers to

00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:34,720
participate in that discussion if that's

00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:36,790
possible and there's definitely like

00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:39,210
there's a robust in some of the areas

00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:42,610
that have had the heaviest adoption of

00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:45,190
some of these systems you also starting

00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:49,960
to see the heaviest pushback against

00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:53,260
those systems the demand for some of

00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:56,020
these larger tractors and and larger

00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:58,270
smart devices is actually decreasing as

00:31:56,020 --> 00:32:01,510
people are looking to go back to some of

00:31:58,270 --> 00:32:04,060
the older tractors my partial fear

00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:06,330
though is that you'll start to see some

00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:08,680
of these machines being pushed on

00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:10,660
countries like I know that there's a lot

00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:12,610
of agricultural secretaries coming in

00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:14,860
from from different places around the

00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:16,780
world who see this as a way to like jump

00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:18,640
start their own agricultural economy and

00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:20,410
I kind of hear they're gonna get trapped

00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:22,800
into systems without really

00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:26,080
understanding the repercussions as well

00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:28,780
so we have a couple questions that come

00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:33,070
in online but mark we have a note that

00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:36,450
err Mozilla dropped so AV ops if you're

00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:38,380
watching or not is taking a look at that

00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:40,060
so I want to pick up on something you

00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:42,820
just said one of our questions for asked

00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:44,860
about you're talking about how deer and

00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:46,570
other folks were we're surprised that

00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:49,690
folks didn't sort of intuitively trust

00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:51,430
them one of our questions asks how does

00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:53,170
trust work differently in open farming

00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:54,640
platform properties versus these more

00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:56,830
Enterprise 11-ish ative and what are

00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,810
sort of the mechanisms and you know

00:32:56,830 --> 00:33:01,420
tools and efforts that are done to build

00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:04,150
trust differently in those two sort of

00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:05,890
broad categories and systems and

00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:08,170
organizations I don't know if I can

00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:10,420
fully answer that fully because I think

00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:12,100
that there's it's a little difficult

00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:14,049
because you have corporations

00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:15,820
are billing themselves as new and and

00:33:14,049 --> 00:33:17,679
trustworthy and on all the sudden people

00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:19,990
turn around and they're now customers

00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:21,700
and Monsanto again but that's why I

00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:23,380
that's why I'm very keen to see what

00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:25,720
happens with like the platform

00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:27,429
cooperatives for example or the NGOs for

00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:29,440
example as opposed to the more corporate

00:33:27,429 --> 00:33:36,309
side but of course those are going to

00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:38,260
run into like to scale and shoes and so

00:33:36,309 --> 00:33:40,870
to a certain extent those those those

00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:42,700
more NGO entities are a little too new

00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:44,950
for me to really identify and I also

00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:47,350
haven't had much of an opportunity to

00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:49,510
look into what their bylaws look like to

00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:51,760
actually see how they consider

00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:53,110
themselves like what their cooperative

00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,580
structure really looks like like there

00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:57,850
are a couple cooperatives that are out

00:33:54,580 --> 00:34:01,740
there that already exist that I don't

00:33:57,850 --> 00:34:01,740
think should rightly be able to call me

00:34:02,429 --> 00:34:14,050
but I I mean I do think that they're all

00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:15,669
even with the there there are certain

00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:19,899
companies even than our trying to put

00:34:15,669 --> 00:34:21,730
like farmer forward concepts even within

00:34:19,899 --> 00:34:25,440
their like their mission statements and

00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:27,280
I think that is also a way forward cool

00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:30,250
we have another question sort of going

00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:31,359
back to the IOT certification sort of

00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:34,750
marks that we were just talking about

00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:36,340
the questioner master the efforts to

00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:38,200
establish IOT certification marks for

00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:40,300
targeted consumer products do these

00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:42,639
efforts apply to the agricultural sector

00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:44,230
have you seen already some of these sort

00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:46,600
of certification schemes licensing

00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:48,730
schemes consumer labeling that we've

00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:50,770
sort of seen discussed in the IOT you

00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:53,139
know consumer space also applied to AG

00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:55,780
Dec I mean I think that you're starting

00:34:53,139 --> 00:34:58,270
to bleed over but I'm not sure to the

00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:59,770
degree that they're like its required or

00:34:58,270 --> 00:35:02,200
necessary but that's a great question

00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:02,710
and I should I should learn more about

00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,510
it

00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:06,220
my father was an academic would say

00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:09,130
that's a create homework question is a

00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:11,590
great homework question yes another

00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:14,530
question have you seen any connections

00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:16,210
between district competition policy

00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:17,950
conversation that we've seen around you

00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:21,550
know some of the largest tech companies

00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:24,400
and the lack of competition in the big

00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:25,990
AG tech space and do you think there are

00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,430
benefits or concerns the

00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:32,350
having trying to sort of merge those

00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:33,930
conversations so we we've always had a

00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:36,369
lot of public discourse around

00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:38,490
competition threats to the increasing

00:35:36,369 --> 00:35:42,840
consolidation of power almost Google

00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:44,920
Apple Facebook Amazon yourself so forth

00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:49,210
we know that there's sort of a lack of

00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:51,400
competition in big AG tech yeah as well

00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:55,510
some of these open source far more

00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:57,220
collective operations notwithstanding do

00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:58,900
you have you seen these conversations

00:35:57,220 --> 00:36:00,190
sort of being merged anywhere and do you

00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:02,350
think they should be or do you think

00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:04,330
there are benefits or risks or concerns

00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:06,670
around that well I think in the same way

00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:13,869
that mergers and acquisitions are kind

00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:15,940
of the agricultural space and it's

00:36:13,869 --> 00:36:17,080
certainly I mean you just saw there and

00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:19,240
and Monsanto

00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:22,450
well that's a merger and acquisition I

00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:25,119
still am a little confused by that but

00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:27,640
that that absolutely typifies what's

00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:29,830
happening in the AG space and you have

00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:32,230
industry leaders that are trying to

00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:35,820
gobble up every single startup that has

00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:37,930
any interesting idea they possibly can

00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:40,450
we chatted a little bit about this

00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:41,859
actually previously I personally am

00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:43,960
concerned about it because I feel like

00:36:41,859 --> 00:36:46,450
it ends up trapping farmers and

00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:48,760
relationships that they were explicitly

00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:51,130
trying to get out of like they didn't

00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:52,930
want to have like there's I've seen

00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:54,550
articles and and interviews with farmers

00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:56,619
were like I chose this because I didn't

00:36:54,550 --> 00:37:00,300
want to be with Company X and now I'm

00:36:56,619 --> 00:37:04,119
with company X again like fantastic but

00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:07,480
you know there are also benefits like

00:37:04,119 --> 00:37:08,950
partners partnerships work because you

00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:11,350
need these different software as a

00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:15,400
platform store together but I do think

00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:16,930
that the more you have consolidation the

00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,850
more you're gonna have these software

00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:22,720
and financial dependencies that people

00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:23,890
will not be able to get out of and at

00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:26,290
what point do you have to acknowledge

00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:28,240
that we don't have like ownership or

00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:33,640
like even a capitalist system it's more

00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:34,810
like feudalism so another question has

00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:36,940
to do sort of a fair bit of financial

00:37:34,810 --> 00:37:39,160
incentives to keep things closed here

00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:39,579
you know if you're a John Deere of the

00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:44,289
world

00:37:39,579 --> 00:37:46,599
yeah how do you how do we promote open

00:37:44,289 --> 00:37:48,160
practices and open policies against that

00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:51,430
sort of budget and financial incentives

00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:54,819
of those very large players yeah I mean

00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:57,130
the way that the way that the people are

00:37:54,819 --> 00:38:00,190
doing it that are trying to do it is to

00:37:57,130 --> 00:38:02,170
build themselves as like we are not here

00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:04,509
to own your data we're not going to try

00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:06,039
to take advantage of your data or sell

00:38:04,509 --> 00:38:08,130
your data we're putting that in your

00:38:06,039 --> 00:38:13,209
hands so they're building themselves

00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:16,539
specifically eyes like the anti like the

00:38:13,209 --> 00:38:18,190
anti proprietary bull garden systems and

00:38:16,539 --> 00:38:21,459
that comes with some drawbacks right

00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:23,559
because like part of the benefits of

00:38:21,459 --> 00:38:25,749
deer in Monsanto's platforms is that

00:38:23,559 --> 00:38:27,729
they are taking in information from so

00:38:25,749 --> 00:38:29,529
many different places and their

00:38:27,729 --> 00:38:33,249
analytical systems are incredibly robust

00:38:29,529 --> 00:38:35,890
because of it so the more that you can

00:38:33,249 --> 00:38:37,569
get people to sign on see those

00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:39,039
different types of open source platforms

00:38:37,569 --> 00:38:41,109
the better those analytics will become

00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:44,199
and you do have a lot of open source

00:38:41,109 --> 00:38:46,569
like data sets from the USDA for example

00:38:44,199 --> 00:38:48,130
that helps with that but farmers are

00:38:46,569 --> 00:38:50,319
also very aware even the ones that are

00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:53,199
joining in those open sourced like the

00:38:50,319 --> 00:38:55,809
newer alternatives that if enough

00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:57,190
farmers don't go over that way they're

00:38:55,809 --> 00:38:58,869
gonna have to go back to their

00:38:57,190 --> 00:39:03,849
proprietary models because it'll be

00:38:58,869 --> 00:39:08,410
better in their long-term interests so

00:39:03,849 --> 00:39:09,999
another question what are the

00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:12,160
legislative solutions that you'd like to

00:39:09,999 --> 00:39:15,729
see to respond to the threats you've

00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:17,400
talked about yeah so first of all I

00:39:15,729 --> 00:39:19,959
think like the right to repair

00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:22,749
initiatives are pretty important but

00:39:19,959 --> 00:39:28,779
they are kind of a parallel issue right

00:39:22,749 --> 00:39:32,079
I think working on like Internet of

00:39:28,779 --> 00:39:34,119
Things that some of the initiatives that

00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:36,400
are already being discussed like to make

00:39:34,119 --> 00:39:37,989
Internet of Things more consumer

00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:41,799
friendly and also just like consumer

00:39:37,989 --> 00:39:46,660
safe is important I'm a little bit wary

00:39:41,799 --> 00:39:49,299
of I'm a little bit wary of over

00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:50,559
regulating certain areas because I think

00:39:49,299 --> 00:39:53,020
that that actually might entrench

00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:55,000
interests further but I do

00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:58,050
once you encourage policies to be

00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:01,780
developed that will actually help

00:39:58,050 --> 00:40:03,960
platforms grow like nonprofit platforms

00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:06,430
grow etc and part of that might be

00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:08,860
taking away the financial incentives

00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:10,990
that like things in the farm bill give

00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:15,220
to proprietary systems so for example

00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:17,170
you have like precision agriculture is

00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:20,800
being heavily heavily pushed forward by

00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:24,700
the USDA and they will give tax bonuses

00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:26,380
or you know tax incentives to farmers

00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:28,330
that adopt what's called variable rate

00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:30,580
technologies and they'll give like an

00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:34,270
extra 20 cents I'm making these yet but

00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:37,420
this is an example 20 cents per acre to

00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:38,290
those that have guidestar technologies

00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:41,770
from John Deere

00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:44,920
that's like that's 50 like who 7 cents

00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:47,530
more than anyone that uses not open

00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:49,390
source technology why is that different

00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:51,220
you're like why are they why are they

00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:52,060
preferencing that that proprietary

00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:53,710
software

00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:55,240
unlike the probably gonna say it's

00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:58,000
because the subscription novels but

00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:59,580
really they're they're subsidizing a

00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:03,370
proprietary network so I think

00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:05,320
eliminating some of those differences or

00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:09,210
even starting to preference some of the

00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:13,180
like the open source systems would be a

00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:14,590
first start that I would like to see do

00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:16,260
we have questions and some of the other

00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:21,250
Commons

00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:25,740
what's it okay

00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:25,740
yes Hospital

00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:35,049
hi oh my gosh I'm I'm Jessica and my

00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:37,359
question is a little bit off the policy

00:41:35,049 --> 00:41:38,799
topic I come from an impact investment

00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:39,730
social entrepreneurial background and I

00:41:38,799 --> 00:41:42,010
know quite a few people who are

00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:45,130
interested in agricultural in general as

00:41:42,010 --> 00:41:48,069
a topic I don't know to what extent

00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:50,740
people are aware of this it might be

00:41:48,069 --> 00:41:52,599
they're all over it might be that's far

00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:54,700
afield but might I have guess I have two

00:41:52,599 --> 00:41:56,440
parts of this one is do you talk in the

00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:57,819
house circles very often in the second

00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,329
is do you have is there an annotated

00:41:57,819 --> 00:42:00,339
list

00:41:58,329 --> 00:42:03,160
annotated list or bibliography somewhere

00:42:00,339 --> 00:42:04,660
of current investment opportunities is

00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:07,750
there an ecosystem that's already being

00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:09,640
built around some of the support for

00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:11,829
some of these new technologies I mean

00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:14,589
other than obviously open sourced

00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:17,619
Internet of Things platforms but you

00:42:14,589 --> 00:42:18,670
know some of the applications thereof is

00:42:17,619 --> 00:42:22,210
that something that's online and

00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:27,160
available that I could maybe send out I

00:42:22,210 --> 00:42:29,170
mean I've certainly started a it is not

00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:34,900
it's not formalized list let's put it

00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:36,640
that way but I'm happy to start it could

00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:39,910
be a cool open source project it could

00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:41,559
be a cool I think you would I think it

00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:43,390
would take some time to develop one that

00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:45,910
is fairly robust because a lot of them

00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:48,309
are quite small and like you have the

00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:52,269
like the the difference between the

00:42:48,309 --> 00:42:54,190
hardware and the software right and a

00:42:52,269 --> 00:42:55,539
lot of them are they're just in

00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:57,369
development stages or they're very

00:42:55,539 --> 00:42:58,630
nascent and they're only being localized

00:42:57,369 --> 00:42:59,920
different places and I think there's

00:42:58,630 --> 00:43:01,779
also a question of the stuff that's

00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:03,579
being developed in the US versus the

00:43:01,779 --> 00:43:05,980
stuff that's being developed outside of

00:43:03,579 --> 00:43:09,099
the US which there's a lot of robust

00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:11,769
projects outside of the US that that

00:43:09,099 --> 00:43:13,569
deserve a lot of credit which I didn't

00:43:11,769 --> 00:43:17,589
have time to get into you hear

00:43:13,569 --> 00:43:22,059
but like as as you saw like investment

00:43:17,589 --> 00:43:24,130
in this sector is insane so I don't see

00:43:22,059 --> 00:43:29,829
any reason why not why people wouldn't

00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:33,089
be interested in I want to pick up on

00:43:29,829 --> 00:43:36,730
that little moderators prerogative here

00:43:33,089 --> 00:43:38,230
so you know you said that there we know

00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:39,400
in the u.s. there are certain entrenched

00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:41,500
interests

00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:43,359
certain incentive structure certain

00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:45,400
legislation that empowers those actors

00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:47,349
is there an air else in the world that

00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:49,059
is doing this well that is sort of a

00:43:47,349 --> 00:43:51,369
good example that we can point to some

00:43:49,059 --> 00:43:52,420
best practice that we can look at where

00:43:51,369 --> 00:43:58,089
you're not seeing some of these

00:43:52,420 --> 00:44:02,890
confluence of factors that's a great

00:43:58,089 --> 00:44:05,980
question I mean it's hard to I'm gonna

00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:09,220
say no because precision agriculture is

00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:11,910
still so new right that some people

00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:13,619
might be doing it more deliberately I

00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:16,599
mean

00:44:13,619 --> 00:44:19,440
I'm gonna bring up China right now and

00:44:16,599 --> 00:44:21,819
this is a weird thing China is actually

00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:24,640
incredibly heavily invested in

00:44:21,819 --> 00:44:30,279
everyone's agriculture and they oh

00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:30,910
they're like partial owner of they're in

00:44:30,279 --> 00:44:32,170
it to win it

00:44:30,910 --> 00:44:35,319
everywhere but they don't allow

00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:37,270
investment anywhere else like there no

00:44:35,319 --> 00:44:39,069
one from any other country is allowed to

00:44:37,270 --> 00:44:41,440
invest in their agriculture they don't

00:44:39,069 --> 00:44:44,529
allow GMO crops just to be grown really

00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:49,390
big a very loud they barely allow any

00:44:44,529 --> 00:44:53,260
GMO crops to be to be sold in their

00:44:49,390 --> 00:44:56,380
country but they have absolutely like

00:44:53,260 --> 00:45:01,390
prioritized to be fast forwarding of

00:44:56,380 --> 00:45:04,619
kind of like efficiently well of trying

00:45:01,390 --> 00:45:07,210
to update their agricultural systems I

00:45:04,619 --> 00:45:09,160
don't know yet quite nobody knows what

00:45:07,210 --> 00:45:12,760
that looks like yeah but they're they're

00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:14,680
working very hard to to develop it in in

00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:16,210
in a sustainable way and you have to

00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:18,490
give them credit is that they're they're

00:45:16,210 --> 00:45:20,500
prioritizing sustainability in a way

00:45:18,490 --> 00:45:22,930
that I don't think many people are so

00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:29,680
the fact that they're kind of moving

00:45:22,930 --> 00:45:31,510
away from like overly over-dependence on

00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:33,039
herbicides and phosphorus and stuff is

00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:34,450
really interesting so I'm I'm very

00:45:33,039 --> 00:45:37,750
curious to see where they go

00:45:34,450 --> 00:45:40,630
I know it's really like a it's a weird

00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:41,920
thing to bring them but I don't know I

00:45:40,630 --> 00:45:44,079
like one of the countries I'm actually

00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:45,910
worried about its Brazil because they've

00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:48,520
pretty much just like adopted wholesale

00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:53,170
the the model that were we're pushing

00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:58,420
for here in a bad way yes

00:45:53,170 --> 00:45:59,980
yeah we have another question you

00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:02,260
mentioned scale and consolidation on

00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:04,119
farms is one of the variables here could

00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:06,040
you expand on that more in my past life

00:46:04,119 --> 00:46:07,720
when I was very close to the stuff the

00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:09,819
incentives towards large scale and

00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:10,930
monocultural are other long-term issues

00:46:09,819 --> 00:46:12,730
that intersect with precision

00:46:10,930 --> 00:46:17,410
agricultural systems but not the sort of

00:46:12,730 --> 00:46:20,410
direct cause here yeah so that's still

00:46:17,410 --> 00:46:24,359
the case like the push towards

00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:26,319
monoculture and the push towards like

00:46:24,359 --> 00:46:31,480
consolidation of farms is still

00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:33,579
absolutely 100% the case in the US and

00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:35,740
it's also being pushed or through

00:46:33,579 --> 00:46:37,990
precision agriculture like that's one of

00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:40,299
the reasons that farmers are so afraid

00:46:37,990 --> 00:46:42,700
of their landlords having access to this

00:46:40,299 --> 00:46:45,220
data for example because they're afraid

00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:47,020
that if the landlords can see that

00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:48,220
they're not growing as much as they

00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:50,079
should they'll just kick them off their

00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:51,760
land and their neighbors or their if

00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:52,150
their neighbors can have access to that

00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:54,819
data

00:46:52,150 --> 00:46:59,440
that they'll make a bid for that land

00:46:54,819 --> 00:47:06,970
and then adopt the then take over that

00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:09,339
land I think the question is like how do

00:47:06,970 --> 00:47:13,660
these two issues relate like scale I

00:47:09,339 --> 00:47:17,980
think it's hard to develop especially

00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:21,069
with hardware the type of devices you

00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:25,150
would need to tackle some of the issues

00:47:21,069 --> 00:47:27,040
on these large scale farms I mean you do

00:47:25,150 --> 00:47:30,160
have the development of some really cool

00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:32,440
like robots and stuff like that as i as

00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:34,900
i illustrated and they might be able to

00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:36,819
tackle some of the problems but they're

00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:39,400
not gonna be able to deal with like the

00:47:36,819 --> 00:47:42,280
large amounts of like combines and large

00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:45,280
tractors that like deer and collins in

00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:48,970
case have really kind of solidified the

00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:53,710
market on so i don't know i don't know

00:47:48,970 --> 00:47:57,280
how to combat that you talked earlier

00:47:53,710 --> 00:48:00,130
about hyperbole in this you got a lot of

00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:03,190
snaps and kudos for that online the

00:48:00,130 --> 00:48:05,109
slack channel what are the biggest myths

00:48:03,190 --> 00:48:06,130
that you'd like to see died in this

00:48:05,109 --> 00:48:11,259
space

00:48:06,130 --> 00:48:15,069
I look slim it's like three okay I mean

00:48:11,259 --> 00:48:18,430
the first one is about the famine thing

00:48:15,069 --> 00:48:21,519
and I I'm not trying to deny that we

00:48:18,430 --> 00:48:25,200
have a growing population but I like the

00:48:21,519 --> 00:48:28,599
degree to which I have seen evidence of

00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:32,069
the US government and big corporations

00:48:28,599 --> 00:48:34,450
pushing this concept of like oh like

00:48:32,069 --> 00:48:36,130
everybody's gonna die if we don't adopt

00:48:34,450 --> 00:48:38,200
these technologies you have to do it now

00:48:36,130 --> 00:48:43,319
like there's posters that I've uncovered

00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:45,309
like the USDA has incredible tag lines I

00:48:43,319 --> 00:48:46,690
it's a weird thing because like of

00:48:45,309 --> 00:48:48,430
course you want to make sure everybody

00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:50,650
gets fed feel like come on like that

00:48:48,430 --> 00:48:53,799
we're we're we're subsidizing and

00:48:50,650 --> 00:48:57,309
ethanol so that's that is the big one

00:48:53,799 --> 00:49:01,299
I'd like to you to really I like to see

00:48:57,309 --> 00:49:02,769
that one die um in other areas would you

00:49:01,299 --> 00:49:05,710
say you have binders full of big egg

00:49:02,769 --> 00:49:08,680
parts of Canada I do like I have quite a

00:49:05,710 --> 00:49:12,519
bit of a guy propaganda and it's there

00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:16,479
there's a lot of I think a lot of it's

00:49:12,519 --> 00:49:18,239
not just big it's also USDA and like its

00:49:16,479 --> 00:49:23,579
I'm sure a lot of it's very well-meaning

00:49:18,239 --> 00:49:27,969
I think but there's there's definitely a

00:49:23,579 --> 00:49:30,309
marriage between government and big

00:49:27,969 --> 00:49:38,319
corporation in a lot of this this area

00:49:30,309 --> 00:49:42,249
so the second thing that I would like to

00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:44,979
see die is that something has to be like

00:49:42,249 --> 00:49:47,130
I don't even know if this fits but I'm

00:49:44,979 --> 00:49:50,259
really sick of the efficiency argument

00:49:47,130 --> 00:49:53,979
that something has to be super efficient

00:49:50,259 --> 00:49:56,769
in order to be like worthwhile and

00:49:53,979 --> 00:49:58,960
especially when it comes to like the

00:49:56,769 --> 00:50:01,329
implementation of like switching over to

00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:04,180
Big Data like that's a that they match

00:50:01,329 --> 00:50:06,039
those two things consistently like oh

00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:07,269
the reason we should like trust Big Data

00:50:06,039 --> 00:50:09,549
is because it's gonna make everything

00:50:07,269 --> 00:50:12,009
more efficient well that like is it's

00:50:09,549 --> 00:50:14,170
dismisses like half of the problems of

00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:16,180
using big data in an hour

00:50:14,170 --> 00:50:17,740
and I think that that's a problem you

00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:21,430
see with almost every industry that's

00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:23,559
talking about big data uses but the

00:50:21,430 --> 00:50:25,329
agricultural system in general has

00:50:23,559 --> 00:50:29,079
always had a problem with like pushing

00:50:25,329 --> 00:50:35,260
forward with efficiency so I guess

00:50:29,079 --> 00:50:37,270
that's my second one yeah let's do we

00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:44,700
have any other questions either online

00:50:37,270 --> 00:50:46,510
or in any of the comments going once

00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:48,069
going twice

00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:59,079
alright what's your third myth that you

00:50:48,069 --> 00:51:01,000
want to see die this is okay so the

00:50:59,079 --> 00:51:03,880
majority of farms on America are still

00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:05,710
owned by families like which I know is

00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:07,599
kind of strange I think that's the myth

00:51:05,710 --> 00:51:08,530
oh that's the fact that's the myth oh no

00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:10,960
that's fact

00:51:08,530 --> 00:51:12,910
so in life sorry like that is a true

00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:16,329
statement and I think that there's like

00:51:12,910 --> 00:51:18,430
almost an idea that like the family farm

00:51:16,329 --> 00:51:19,750
has died and the problem is like most

00:51:18,430 --> 00:51:20,799
family farms in America are like

00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:24,039
freaking huge

00:51:20,799 --> 00:51:26,920
like so like they're like mogul farms at

00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:28,779
this point you know but like so some of

00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:31,539
the farmers are the ones that are the

00:51:28,779 --> 00:51:34,359
most concerned about the estate tax in

00:51:31,539 --> 00:51:37,869
America like they're very very like in

00:51:34,359 --> 00:51:39,730
that battle and so you hear this this

00:51:37,869 --> 00:51:43,960
myth or you hear this statement that

00:51:39,730 --> 00:51:45,369
family farms have died and small farms

00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:47,260
have died like smaller firms have

00:51:45,369 --> 00:51:49,960
smaller family farms a lot of them have

00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:52,510
been absorbed in and died in and like

00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:56,079
farmers are constantly on the nice edge

00:51:52,510 --> 00:52:00,010
of like profit margins in this industry

00:51:56,079 --> 00:52:03,039
is very small and there's a lot of

00:52:00,010 --> 00:52:06,069
reasons for that but to say that like

00:52:03,039 --> 00:52:09,640
the family farm is dead is is to ignore

00:52:06,069 --> 00:52:12,849
a very very big truth and it also gives

00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:14,619
I think a lot of power to certain

00:52:12,849 --> 00:52:16,599
parties when they can respond like look

00:52:14,619 --> 00:52:19,900
at all the stats I have that true that

00:52:16,599 --> 00:52:23,049
this isn't true awesome thank you so

00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:25,960
thanks Ryan for this insightful and

00:52:23,049 --> 00:52:27,440
informative talk I really enjoy coming

00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:28,940
here thanks to our colleague

00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:31,550

00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:34,550
talk and thanks to all of you watching

00:52:31,550 --> 00:52:37,160
in the Commons and online this talk has

00:52:34,550 --> 00:52:40,460
been recorded and will be available to

00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:43,520
watch later on air MO and a YouTube I

00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:44,240
think and thank you all for coming and
