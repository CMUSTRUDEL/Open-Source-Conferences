Title: ET Speaker Series - How do we shape the voice landscape over the next 5 years?
Publication date: 2020-05-12
Playlist: Emerging Technologies Speaker Series
Description: 
	When we investigate the evolution of open source voice technologies, two 'waves' become evident. We sit on the cusp of a "third wave" of open source voice - an inflection point of technologies, communities, business models, drivers, stakeholders and languages. In this presentation, Kathy Reid outlines the three-wave approach to open source voice, highlighting where its come from, a current state of play, and outlines several possible arcs that it could follow. Each of these trajectories has an associated set of conditions - and actions that need to be taken to see the trajectory materialize into reality. 

While this talk focuses on Voice, the research approach, the understandings of the ecosystem and the process of open source project assessment have relevance across Mozilla.
