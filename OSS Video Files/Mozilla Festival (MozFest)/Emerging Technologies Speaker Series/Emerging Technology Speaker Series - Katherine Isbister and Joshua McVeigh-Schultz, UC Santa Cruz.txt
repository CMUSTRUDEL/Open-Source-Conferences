Title: Emerging Technology Speaker Series - Katherine Isbister and Joshua McVeigh-Schultz, UC Santa Cruz
Publication date: 2019-08-26
Playlist: Emerging Technologies Speaker Series
Description: 
	With support from Mozilla, the research team at UC Santa Cruz's Social Emotional Technology Lab has been studying design factors that lead to positive social encounters and engagement in Virtual Reality. Today we present results and insights from conducting interviews with designers from major and nascent Social VR platforms, toward shaping a broadly accessible and inviting platform for the future. We also discuss ongoing studies and research-through-design prototyping activities. 

Katherine Isbister is a full professor in the University of California, Santa Cruz's Department of Computational Media, where she directs the Social Emotional Technology Lab, and the Center for Computational Experience. Her research combines technical prototyping and evaluative research to advance the state of the art in human computer interaction. Recent projects include hand-held objects (tangible computing) designed to help regulate mood and attention, wearables to augment feelings of connection and co-presence, and a gesture-based door entry authentication system that uses biometrics, among others. She is the author of more than 100 peer-reviewed publications. Isbister’s most recent book from MIT Press is How Games Move Us: Emotion by Design. Her research has been covered in Wired, Scientific American, and many other venues. She was a recipient of MIT Technology Review's Young Innovator Award, and is an ACM Distinguished Scientist. 

Joshua McVeigh-Schulz is an Assistant Professor in the School of Design at San Francisco State University. He an interactive media designer and researcher with a PhD from USC’s School of Cinematic Arts, where his dissertation explored the intersection between ritual and speculative design. His hybrid background intersects fields of HCI, anthropology, media studies, and design research. Recent projects and publications include topics of social VR, immersive design fiction, speculative ritual design, and vernacular accordance theory. He is the recipient of an Intel PhD fellowship, and he has conducted research at MSR and Intel Labs. The work presented was conducted while he was a postdoctoral researcher at UCSC's Social Emotional Technology Lab.

	00:00:04,339 --> 00:00:09,480
good morning good afternoon good evening

00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,830
my name is Joe HK I am principal

00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,309
research scientist and emerging

00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:17,340
technologies group and one of the things

00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:20,039
that I do as part of that is to fund is

00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:22,170
to wrangle the mozilla research grants

00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:26,039
which I talked to some of you about in

00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:29,400
the Mozilla monthly meeting about a

00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:31,410
month ago one of the grants that we've

00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:34,469
awarded within the last couple of years

00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:38,550
is to Kathryn s Vista at the University

00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:40,590
of UC Santa Cruz and one of the

00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:41,940
opportunities we have is to have these

00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,710
people come in and talk to us about the

00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,690
work that they've been doing so today I

00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:48,360
have Katherine Esther and judgment face

00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:49,950
shots both at UC Santa Cruz and what

00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,510
they've been doing and what they will be

00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:53,190
talking about is figuring out how to do

00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,140
pro social interaction and virtual

00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:57,390
reality they're gonna tell you about

00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:59,219
that I won't give my usual gloss on what

00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:02,070
that actually means because I think

00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:03,949
you'll probably do a better job but I do

00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:07,320
think it's a really important example of

00:01:03,949 --> 00:01:09,570
some of the ways we're trying to work

00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,610
towards a strategy at Mozilla of really

00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:13,920
thinking about what we need to do next

00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:15,600
right we know what the mission is but

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,580
the internet is evolving and we need to

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,439
be building product and thinking about

00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:21,750
questions that happen about how the

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,400
Internet is going to be changing I think

00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:25,439
this is a fabulous example of really

00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,600
putting our money where our mouth is and

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,860
saying no we want to invest in this and

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,390
we want to understand what this looks

00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:36,000
like so without any further ado

00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:38,009
Katherine is mister thank you all right

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,409
thanks for that wonderful introduction

00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:42,899
Joe fish so Josh and I are very excited

00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:44,670
to be here today to give you an overview

00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:46,439
of this work and even though I'm

00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:48,149
standing here on the podium I have to

00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:51,000
say that a large part of this work was

00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:52,920
driven by Josh while he was a postdoc in

00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,899
my lab he actually managed to get

00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,180
himself a tenure track job after leaving

00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:59,490
us and is now at San Francisco State

00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:01,140
which is fantastic and I just want to

00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:03,119
echo what Jeff has said and thank

00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:05,610
Mozilla very much for helping us to

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,350
conduct this work we really appreciate

00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:10,349
it and it's great to be here to talk

00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:11,940
more about it so before I get into the

00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:13,050
heart of the talk I wanted to tell you

00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,790
all a little bit

00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:16,460
about the social-emotional technology

00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:18,660
lab which is where this all took place

00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:20,490
so we're located in the School of

00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:22,260
Engineering and we're actually just over

00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:24,000
the hill at the coast so a lot of people

00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:25,710
have this idea that Santa Cruz is maybe

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,570
you know right next to Santa Barbara or

00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:28,980
something but for those of you who are

00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:31,620
you know all over the world I just want

00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:33,150
to say we're really close by and we're

00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:36,780
next to the water so sometimes we even

00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:38,790
go out as a team and go kayaking so my

00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:40,920
team is very interdisciplinary we have a

00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:42,570
mix of students from computational media

00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,240
which is my home department but also

00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:46,920
computer science psychology and an MFA

00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:49,470
program called digital arts and new

00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:51,030
media and the mission of our lab is to

00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:53,280
design implement and study

00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:55,770
human-computer interaction technologies

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,950
that enhance physical social and

00:02:55,770 --> 00:03:01,530
emotional experiences so essentially

00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:04,470
we're combining designing and making

00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:07,020
with studying things out in the field in

00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:08,760
a rigorous way and so some of the

00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:11,400
examples of the kinds of things we make

00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:13,920
we make wearables that augment social

00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:17,520
interaction this is a shot of a

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:19,050
live-action roleplay weekend where we

00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:21,750
augmented it with wearables but we also

00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:24,600
do it for everyday meetings the middle

00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:27,510
shot is a creature that helps kids to

00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:29,220
self-regulate they soothe the creature

00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:30,660
it gives them haptic feedback and that

00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:32,520
helps them calm down so that's a

00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:35,280
partnership with a non-profit we worked

00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:37,800
with and then on the far right is a game

00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:41,010
over the internet that uses biofeedback

00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:42,510
signals to run a canoe it's called in

00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:45,600
the same boat and basically you and a

00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:48,030
partner are dodging obstacles with your

00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,770
your own physical feedback to the system

00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:51,870
so in all cases

00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:54,060
I'm the unifying thread of our work is

00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:56,760
really thinking deeply about how

00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:58,620
technology can augment how we engage

00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:01,050
with each other and also how it can

00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:02,550
support us emotionally so no matter what

00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:05,730
we build those are kind of I would say

00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:07,320
our core values and so that really

00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:10,350
aligns well with the project that we're

00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:12,420
speaking about today so we got funding

00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:14,130
support to tackle the question of how to

00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:16,830
understand and shape the future of

00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:19,950
social vr and both Josh and I agree that

00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:22,350
at this at this time this technology is

00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:24,210
still in a period of ecological

00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:26,260
diversification if you will so we

00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:27,610
haven't completely locked down

00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:29,860
all the standards and patterns of

00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:31,810
behavior so there's a chance for both

00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:33,790
designers and researchers to really have

00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:36,880
a big impact on where all this is going

00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:38,680
and we believe that platforms like this

00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,860
could have just as much of an impact as

00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:45,700
the current social media platforms and

00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:47,710
video conferencing systems maybe even

00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:49,420
more so if climate change means that

00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:51,700
we're going to travel less there may be

00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:54,190
even more pressure on systems like this

00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:56,380
to be so well designed that they can

00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:58,210
really support deep interpersonal

00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:00,160
connection and communication so that we

00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:03,130
don't all have to you know waste a lot

00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,140
of carbon so ultimately we feel there's

00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:07,710
an important role for researchers and

00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:10,600
designers like yourselves to play in

00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:13,360
shaping what happens in these systems

00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:15,060
and bringing our values about what kind

00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,200
of community and what kind of

00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:19,570
connections we want to happen in these

00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:21,550
systems into what we do and we love

00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:23,020
Mozilla's values around these kinds of

00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:25,980
questions and issues and so we're really

00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:28,510
excited to get to work with you on this

00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:30,270
so our approach as I said is this kind

00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:32,770
of research through design approach and

00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:34,930
we had three different prongs that we

00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:36,130
wanted to do we're very ambitious in our

00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:38,170
lab row so great to do all these things

00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:41,350
in one year so we haven't finished all

00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:43,780
these things but the plan was we're

00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:46,840
gonna do a deep dive in studying social

00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:48,430
vr the landscape as it is now you know

00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,320
talking to designers developers

00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:52,870
community managers we're also gonna do a

00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:55,360
user study with people who are in these

00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:56,680
platforms every day and then finally we

00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,570
wanted to do this research through

00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:00,070
design approach building prototypes and

00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:02,920
testing out some of the things that we

00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:04,660
observed and interesting corners of

00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:09,040
design spaces that maybe aren't being

00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:10,720
explored so well just yet so the work

00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,790
that we'll present today is taken from

00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,650
that first goal which has resulted

00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:16,270
actually already which I find really

00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:18,310
impressive for the students they have

00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:20,890
had two full papers at top-tier

00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:23,860
conferences out of this work so we just

00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:25,030
presented at CAI which is you know if

00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:29,110
you don't know CAI it's the top

00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:31,630
conference in HCI and Josh was the lead

00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:33,280
author on that paper and then Anya who

00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:35,020
was a PhD student who worked with us on

00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,700
this project is going to be presenting

00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:38,009
another paper at designing interactive

00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:40,169
systems in San

00:06:38,009 --> 00:06:41,729
iego later this month so if anybody

00:06:40,169 --> 00:06:43,889
happens to be at dis you should go see

00:06:41,729 --> 00:06:45,180
anya talk about the paper and give her a

00:06:43,889 --> 00:06:47,550
big whoop

00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:50,279
yeah so I would also like to mention

00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:53,249
that Josh gave a presentation this past

00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:54,719
year at BRDC so for those of you may not

00:06:53,249 --> 00:06:56,969
know the game developers conference

00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:59,550
happens every year in San Francisco and

00:06:56,969 --> 00:07:01,800
they fairly recently instituted this VR

00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:04,529
Developers Conference alongside it and

00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,969
Josh wrote and had a talk accepted to

00:07:04,529 --> 00:07:07,469
this forum which is fantastic because

00:07:05,969 --> 00:07:09,990
this is more of an industry focused

00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:14,219
venue so we're getting the word out

00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:16,830
about things that we've done okay so

00:07:14,219 --> 00:07:18,089
let's dive into the research I'm going

00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:20,399
to talk about the work that we did with

00:07:18,089 --> 00:07:23,219
interviewing people who work in the

00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:26,009
field of social vr so our team started

00:07:23,219 --> 00:07:27,930
out with three driving questions one how

00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:30,029
to design choices shape Pro social

00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:32,669
interaction in social vr so what are the

00:07:30,029 --> 00:07:34,259
key factors there to what important

00:07:32,669 --> 00:07:35,939
design lessons have already been learned

00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:38,099
so can we consolidate and share those

00:07:35,939 --> 00:07:39,869
learnings out and then three how do

00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:42,419
creators of social vr whether they're

00:07:39,869 --> 00:07:44,459
developers designers or other experts

00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:46,169
who work on these applications approach

00:07:44,459 --> 00:07:48,059
and prioritize these sorts of design

00:07:46,169 --> 00:07:52,379
choices and how do their approaches

00:07:48,059 --> 00:07:54,779
relate to one another so we interviewed

00:07:52,379 --> 00:07:56,279
experts in the field some of which are

00:07:54,779 --> 00:07:59,819
probably listening in to this

00:07:56,279 --> 00:08:02,099
conversation we gathered a total of 11

00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:04,709
social vr industry experts working

00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:06,240
across six different applications now

00:08:04,709 --> 00:08:08,219
for Facebook spaces we called

00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,870
information from existing write-ups and

00:08:08,219 --> 00:08:12,029
publicly available design reports

00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:13,529
because we had a little problem moving

00:08:12,029 --> 00:08:16,319
through the corporate information

00:08:13,529 --> 00:08:17,969
barrier there but fortunately there's a

00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,519
lot of vetted information out there in

00:08:17,969 --> 00:08:22,229
the world but fantastically for the rest

00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:24,120
of the platforms we had a lot of access

00:08:22,229 --> 00:08:26,580
and since our interviewees are

00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:28,139
themselves experts in this area we

00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,759
wanted them to be recognized for their

00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:31,909
intellectual contributions so we made a

00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,019
spatial special case to our University

00:08:31,909 --> 00:08:35,550
internal review board like we all have

00:08:34,019 --> 00:08:37,829
to go through these reviews of our

00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:39,419
studies that we didn't have to dia

00:08:37,829 --> 00:08:40,740
naanum eyes because we actually wanted

00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:42,779
to share well these are these fantastic

00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:44,579
people who told us really valuable

00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:48,389
things about their work practice so

00:08:44,579 --> 00:08:50,910
there they are in terms of a demographic

00:08:48,389 --> 00:08:53,130
breakdown of who we talked to

00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:55,200
it was largely even by gender most of

00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:56,700
our interviewees lived in North America

00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,500
but there were a couple from Europe and

00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:01,620
they were in a wide range of

00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:04,200
professional positions ranging from UX

00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:06,360
designer to programmer to co-founder to

00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,890
Community Support Coordinator so we

00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,360
weren't sort of saying only Burlingham

00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:10,500
speak to designers we're saying we're

00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,390
going to speak to people who are

00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:17,850
tackling this and working with these

00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:19,410
active questions in various roles so the

00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:21,420
way that the interviews took place it

00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:24,570
was tag team pairs I believe usually it

00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:27,090
was Josh and Anya basically and so one

00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:29,460
person would actually be in VR talking

00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:31,170
to the interviewee the other person

00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:32,940
would be outside VR because it was a lot

00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:34,590
easier for them to manage taking notes

00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:36,800
and guiding the questions and that sort

00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:36,800
of thing

00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:43,860
so we get into the coding strategy more

00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:45,450
in the two paper so and that's not maybe

00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:48,000
necessarily something you all are so

00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:51,000
interested in but essentially we took an

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,800
open coding approach looking for themes

00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,990
just trying to be as open-minded as

00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:58,020
possible heading into the data and then

00:09:54,990 --> 00:10:00,150
once some themes were gathered there was

00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:01,890
a secondary coding to map areas of

00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:03,120
commonality and areas of difference is

00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:05,190
starting to look for clusters of

00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,350
information and then there was a final

00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:09,480
coding pass to surface high level

00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:12,120
groupings of design perspectives and and

00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:14,190
that process surfaced the results that

00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,020
I'm going to share with you and I'm glad

00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:17,910
to circulate the two papers if people

00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:20,330
want to dive into it later I can make

00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:23,670
sure to get the efficient Miriam

00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:26,520
okay so this is going to be old news

00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:28,410
people in the hub's team all of these

00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:30,720
field sites but in case there are people

00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:32,280
on this call nothing to do with social

00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:37,470
VR I want to briefly go through the

00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:39,720
different field sites so rec room is an

00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:42,060
activity focused application that's

00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:44,250
aesthetically modeled on a kind of 80s

00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:45,720
rec center for people who are alive

00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:48,090
during that time period or watch TV

00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:49,710
about that time period and there are

00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:52,500
more focused activities that branch off

00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:54,360
from the main lobby area alt space VR

00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,370
supports a range of devices and

00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,870
initially billed itself as a social vr

00:10:56,370 --> 00:11:00,120
platform for others to design

00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:04,040
experiences and they emphasize strong

00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:04,040
community engagement through live events

00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:08,720
- Ella tea is a platform whose founders

00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:11,089
include Linden Labs Philip Rosedale of

00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,310
Second Life and it underscores in world

00:11:11,089 --> 00:11:16,160
construction tools and large-scale

00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:18,230
public events and performances Facebook

00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,730
spaces focuses on supporting virtual

00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:22,040
interactions between people who are

00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:24,230
already friends on Facebook and so

00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:26,329
interactions are localized and they have

00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:29,839
this metaphor of a shared roundtable and

00:11:26,329 --> 00:11:31,130
users choose avatars based loosely it

00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:34,760
would seem sometimes when you're in

00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:37,220
there on their Facebook photos the art

00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:40,399
chat is known for what some users

00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:42,170
described as a Wild West ethos it has at

00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,850
times struggled with harassment but it's

00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:46,430
also a unique home for creative

00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:49,339
expression identity play and embodied

00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:51,050
memes any Landis is kind of different

00:11:49,339 --> 00:11:53,600
from other social vr environments in

00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:56,510
that it doesn't allow importing of 3d

00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,339
models instead all environments objects

00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:59,959
avatars and interactions have been

00:11:58,339 --> 00:12:01,730
authored from scratch by a small

00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:03,260
community of committed users which

00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:06,290
creates a very different visual

00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:08,990
characters things and finally as you all

00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:11,270
know Mozilla hubs is a lightweight

00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:13,670
social vrm needing space tool for web PR

00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:15,620
and hub supports a wide range of

00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:17,600
hardware options and users can bring in

00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:20,000
media from the web including images and

00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,440
3d models so those were our field sites

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,990
obviously you know can't cover

00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,880
everything but we tried to cover as wide

00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:28,339
a sloth as the different kinds of social

00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:32,180
vr applications as we're present at the

00:12:28,339 --> 00:12:34,850
time of the research so this slide is is

00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:37,089
a nod to people more in the HCI

00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:39,950
community who sometimes say things like

00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:41,630
why would you talk to the designers why

00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:45,589
aren't you talking directly to the users

00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:48,320
and to which we reply hey you know

00:12:45,589 --> 00:12:50,300
designers talk to users they are

00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,399
synthesizing all of this incredibly

00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:54,829
valuable information like their

00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:57,170
empiricists about their own applications

00:12:54,829 --> 00:12:58,880
you know it's a kind of evolve or die

00:12:57,170 --> 00:13:01,490
environment out there in the commercial

00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,529
world so these are some of the different

00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:05,540
ways that our various informants said to

00:13:03,529 --> 00:13:07,670
us hey this is how we actually access

00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:11,390
information about our users this board

00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:13,430
to indicate rigor in our process so

00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:15,800
before I continue does anybody have any

00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:16,529
questions about loosely about the

00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:23,369
process

00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:25,229
that we took here no okay all right so

00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:29,489
I'm gonna tell you a little bit about

00:13:25,229 --> 00:13:32,309
what we found so if you recall our first

00:13:29,489 --> 00:13:34,769
research question was how design choices

00:13:32,309 --> 00:13:36,809
shape per social interaction so in other

00:13:34,769 --> 00:13:38,929
words how do our expert informants think

00:13:36,809 --> 00:13:41,869
about this question and what are the key

00:13:38,929 --> 00:13:44,599
factors from their perspective

00:13:41,869 --> 00:13:47,069
there were several dominant themes

00:13:44,599 --> 00:13:49,109
especially among the large open

00:13:47,069 --> 00:13:50,369
platforms where a user is likely to

00:13:49,109 --> 00:13:52,619
encounter strangers

00:13:50,369 --> 00:13:55,199
we found convergence involving the role

00:13:52,619 --> 00:13:57,299
of place in space strategies for shaping

00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:59,399
social norms embodiment and social

00:13:57,299 --> 00:14:00,569
mechanics and onboarding is social

00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:02,099
buffering and I'll dive into some of

00:14:00,569 --> 00:14:04,229
those points in more detail in a moment

00:14:02,099 --> 00:14:06,089
however we also observe fairly

00:14:04,229 --> 00:14:08,819
substantial divergence in terms of

00:14:06,089 --> 00:14:11,129
particular choices underlying these

00:14:08,819 --> 00:14:13,049
broad design objectives and also as you

00:14:11,129 --> 00:14:14,939
might expect we saw a stark contrast

00:14:13,049 --> 00:14:16,339
between socials for open worlds where

00:14:14,939 --> 00:14:18,719
you're likely to interact with strangers

00:14:16,339 --> 00:14:22,109
versus more closed platforms such as

00:14:18,719 --> 00:14:23,819
hubs and Facebook spaces so in those

00:14:22,109 --> 00:14:26,429
environments we noticed less focused on

00:14:23,819 --> 00:14:28,499
safety and security and more interest in

00:14:26,429 --> 00:14:30,779
design goals associated with supporting

00:14:28,499 --> 00:14:32,879
device interoperability empowering

00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:34,889
multiple participation modalities and

00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:37,379
bridging social encounters in VR with

00:14:34,889 --> 00:14:38,579
the outside world so connecting and so

00:14:37,379 --> 00:14:40,709
I'll dive into these things a little bit

00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:43,319
more deeply now I want to point out

00:14:40,709 --> 00:14:45,209
because sometimes in technology we tend

00:14:43,319 --> 00:14:46,769
to be a historical and we kind of fly

00:14:45,209 --> 00:14:48,629
forwards and we don't do the Walter

00:14:46,769 --> 00:14:51,359
Benjamin angel flying backwards looking

00:14:48,629 --> 00:14:52,979
at the past kind of thing but when

00:14:51,359 --> 00:14:54,389
you're an academic it's really important

00:14:52,979 --> 00:14:55,979
that you situate what you've done and

00:14:54,389 --> 00:14:57,629
what's come before it's not a bad thing

00:14:55,979 --> 00:14:59,399
to do as a designer either because you

00:14:57,629 --> 00:15:01,549
can avoid reinventing the wheel and you

00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:04,049
can use someone else's excellent wheels

00:15:01,549 --> 00:15:05,639
so one thing of course that we noticed

00:15:04,049 --> 00:15:06,629
is the more things change the more they

00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:09,269
stay the same

00:15:06,629 --> 00:15:12,119
so shaping social interaction in social

00:15:09,269 --> 00:15:14,429
vr does reflect in part familiar themes

00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:17,519
from earlier research from people in HCI

00:15:14,429 --> 00:15:20,399
and adjacent communities for example

00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:22,649
there was a huge wave of research on

00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:25,559
collaborative virtual environments or

00:15:22,649 --> 00:15:27,720
CVEs as people call them in the 1990s a

00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:29,100
lot of what they say still very much

00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,960
holds true and these are real

00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:34,110
great references to dig up if you

00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:36,030
haven't looked at them already then also

00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:38,520
there's a lot of really excellent

00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:40,800
academic writing on screen based virtual

00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:43,050
worlds and a lot of really deep and

00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,730
sensitive ethnographic work starting

00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:48,180
from the early 2000s and really moving

00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:50,400
into today so these are sources that we

00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:53,970
drew upon and thinking about you know

00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:59,820
what is reimagining n and what is unique

00:15:53,970 --> 00:16:01,410
to being an embodied we are so much like

00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:03,900
earlier research on these prior

00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:05,760
technologies we found that key factors

00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:08,880
in supporting Pro social interaction in

00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:11,400
social vr include utilizing place and

00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:13,950
spaces to shape the social frame and

00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:16,230
prime certain kinds of behavior using

00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:18,390
activities catalysts and familiar

00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:20,940
icebreakers to focus shared attention

00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:23,070
and developing proactive techniques of

00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:25,320
community engagement as a way of seating

00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:28,560
culture beyond reactive forms of

00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:29,730
community moderation right so just to

00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,640
get into a couple of these a little bit

00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:33,990
more thinking about social catalysts and

00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:37,230
I'll give you some quotes from people we

00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:39,090
interviewed rec rooms Adam dormi a noted

00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:40,710
the importance of quote stuff laying

00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:43,230
around that you can fool with unquote

00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:45,510
which serve as social lubricants in the

00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:47,880
rec center such as a ping-pong table

00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:50,760
dodge balls basketballs and traffic

00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:52,170
cones an alt space also creates social

00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,420
catalysts that they describe as

00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:56,190
environmental icebreakers also based

00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:59,070
interviewees also noted the importance

00:16:56,190 --> 00:17:01,740
of icebreaker activities associated with

00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:03,570
their campfire attraction so things like

00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:05,340
a marshmallow and you can grill burgers

00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:07,380
for each other and we have little fire

00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:09,420
crackers you can put in the fire and

00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:11,580
just kind of have them explode

00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:13,410
but despite the appeal of these sorts of

00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:15,210
catalysts on a more cautionary note

00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:17,070
Rikka feared Younce and notice that

00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:19,440
noted that objects like guns and knives

00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:21,930
can also play the role of negative

00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:23,520
social catalysts in VR chat you know and

00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:25,230
this goes all the way back to things

00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,580
like embodied cognition this is a very

00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:29,160
old and well-known thing from

00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:30,840
anthropology as well that giving people

00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,700
things to do and things to do together

00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:37,920
profoundly affects what it occurs to

00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:39,930
them to do right so as a step beyond

00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:42,000
social catalyst you can think more about

00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:42,630
integrated experiences which focus

00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
attention on

00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:46,890
shared activities so Community Support

00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,590
Coordinator Tamra Hughes of rec room

00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:51,390
noted that the activities are all sorts

00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:52,860
of social sort of social lubricants the

00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:54,300
activities are there to help people get

00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:56,970
over the awkwardness and talking to

00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:59,580
strangers so it's not just what I think

00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:01,830
to do alone it's like how can you set an

00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:04,050
activity into the middle of people that

00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:05,940
causes them to move through strange

00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:07,800
earnest or awkwardness and even in a

00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:09,390
platform like hubs where some people

00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,800
know each other maybe a few people don't

00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:12,630
these things are still relevant right

00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:14,070
and thinking about that at this high

00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:19,590
level helps you to think well about

00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:21,540
design so another one of these themes is

00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:23,790
place in space as social frame and

00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:25,320
several designers discuss the importance

00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:27,570
of architectural features in the

00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:29,970
environment so again rika field johnson

00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:31,890
who designs from the arch at preferred

00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:33,510
outside environments that provide cover

00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:35,580
with trees and other permeable

00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:38,130
structures to make people more feel more

00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:40,320
secure so just this primitive notion

00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:42,150
they have this giant gaping sky and you

00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:44,370
have no protection against your back

00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:46,830
you're gonna feel subtly psychologically

00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:48,840
vulnerable right and in a sense learning

00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:51,660
from architects and learning from people

00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:53,130
who design communities from a structural

00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:55,620
point of view to put these things in

00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:58,500
place and Evan's war is a mixed reality

00:18:55,620 --> 00:19:00,630
designer a tall space VR similarly noted

00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:02,460
the role that cantilevered overhangs can

00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:04,260
play and calming some deep part of our

00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:07,260
biology that fears things coming from

00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:09,450
above which I find that fascinating

00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:11,100
what is that Oh Jumanji the second

00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:12,690
Jumanji I was just watching with my kid

00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:14,610
and people fall out of the sky after

00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:18,290
they die in the game and very disturbing

00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:20,190
don't want that happen okay so

00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:22,110
architectural layout of the space can

00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:24,210
also have a more local effect on how

00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:26,280
people orient to one another for example

00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:28,680
Facebook spaces product designers

00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:30,510
settled on a circular table to emphasize

00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:33,180
the shared islands necessary for

00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:34,980
conversation and Ishita Kapoor a senior

00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:36,600
product manager at all space noted a

00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:38,670
similar social gathering role that the

00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:43,050
campfire can play in drawing people

00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:44,940
around shared spatial landmarks and as

00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:47,640
Corey Nolan of Requiem puts it in a

00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:50,790
sense rooms or behavior right so

00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:52,560
speaking of rec room rec room developers

00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:54,510
and community managers talked a lot

00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:55,470
about a particular example in their

00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:57,660
world

00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:59,580
so they had an auditorium room that was

00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:00,840
designed for QA sessions between the

00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:03,480
player community and the rec room

00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:05,550
developers and Tamara Hughes a Community

00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:07,140
Support Coordinator for rec room noted

00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:08,910
the early iterations of this space

00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:10,800
lacked seating and levels and that it

00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:12,630
was quote a madhouse because people

00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:14,340
would just stand at the front as a

00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:15,930
result they put in seating to make it

00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:17,910
feel more like a theater space which

00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:18,630
encouraged users to sit down and be

00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:20,970
quiet

00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:23,100
they also enabled the couches to be

00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:25,280
teleport targets which would position

00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:27,450
your avatar in a seated position and

00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,280
finally they added the privileged roles

00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:31,260
for speakers on the stage versus the

00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:33,420
audience that is in the audience however

00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:35,190
can speak audibly if they were handed a

00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:39,180
microphone and here's where we kind of

00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:40,950
move from familiar to kind of wacky so

00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:43,890
here's a close-up of the microphone you

00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:46,020
can also see a giant cat non-player

00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:48,390
character that they added later that

00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:50,670
looks at whoever currently has the

00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:52,620
microphone so in other words it sits on

00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:53,790
the stage and stares in the direction of

00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:55,680
the microphone well building

00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:57,300
participants so other attendees can

00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:59,910
track on who's speaking at any given

00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:01,650
time so what we really love about how

00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:03,570
bizarre this example is and we think

00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:05,640
it's illustrative in the designers start

00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:07,440
with this familiar scaffolding but then

00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:10,020
there are these new affordances of space

00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:12,090
in social vr that they very cleverly use

00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:14,640
to start augmenting and stretching our

00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:16,470
expectations of the possible and the

00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,150
result is new kinds of social behaviors

00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:20,310
such as the tracking of the gaze of a

00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:21,840
giant cat that sits on a stage works

00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:25,260
perfectly well given the affordance of

00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:27,450
this world right okay so that kind of

00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:29,010
transition as well to the fact that some

00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:32,280
things really are different about

00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:36,050
designing for being social in VR these

00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:38,570
include the importance of the body right

00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:41,550
embodied immersion and an egocentric

00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:43,560
perspective in VR increases

00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:44,900
opportunities for peril as well as for

00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:47,340
connections so it's a double-edged sword

00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:49,350
there are also opportunities for

00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:51,870
augmenting being social that we think

00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:54,180
arise out of this strange form of being

00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:56,310
Co present and finally there are new

00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:58,320
areas of user creativity as participants

00:21:56,310 --> 00:22:00,540
in these worlds make sense of and tinker

00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:02,220
with the rules of social engagement and

00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:04,950
embodied interaction in this new medium

00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:06,360
so there's a kind of culture of culture

00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:08,679
happening here it's like a little

00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:11,049
sourdough starter of strange news

00:22:08,679 --> 00:22:13,749
Norm's happening so I don't have time to

00:22:11,049 --> 00:22:14,980
dive deeply into these topics I would

00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:16,840
encourage you to check them out in the

00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:19,059
paper but I'll touch on some

00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:20,710
illustrative examples and as we explore

00:22:19,059 --> 00:22:22,090
these examples I want to remind you of

00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:24,580
research question 2 because we're

00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:26,139
starting to move into that territory by

00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:28,299
calling particular attention to design

00:22:26,139 --> 00:22:30,730
lessons that reflect new categories of

00:22:28,299 --> 00:22:35,649
design challenge related to embodied

00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:38,169
immersion so harassment obviously exists

00:22:35,649 --> 00:22:40,330
in you know 2d or pseudo 3d screen based

00:22:38,169 --> 00:22:42,789
worlds and people have written about it

00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:44,499
but the sense of presence in VR makes

00:22:42,789 --> 00:22:48,639
invasions of perfect personal space

00:22:44,499 --> 00:22:51,070
particularly fraught all of the social

00:22:48,639 --> 00:22:53,440
VR creators we spoke to discussed design

00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:55,149
techniques intended to manage proxemics

00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,220
which is you know how close people are

00:22:55,149 --> 00:22:59,070
in social situations and how to think

00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:01,480
about protecting people's personal space

00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:03,669
from most this amounted to a personal

00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:05,409
space bubble when the personal space

00:23:03,669 --> 00:23:07,119
bubble is activated and another user

00:23:05,409 --> 00:23:08,740
gets too close it's too close their

00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:11,499
avatar will begin to disappear at the

00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:13,330
overlap nearly all of the applications

00:23:11,499 --> 00:23:14,860
we examine employed some form of

00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:17,200
personal space management in this way

00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:19,090
rec-room however has a particularly

00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,249
unique way of handling personal space

00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:23,440
management that addresses the important

00:23:21,249 --> 00:23:25,179
role a teleportation plays in disrupting

00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,190
social proxemics so you know obviously

00:23:25,179 --> 00:23:28,629
normally in everyday life you amble up

00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:30,399
to people and there are a lot of chances

00:23:28,629 --> 00:23:32,259
for people to kind of subtly manage how

00:23:30,399 --> 00:23:34,749
close you're gonna get teleporting kind

00:23:32,259 --> 00:23:36,639
of tanks that so in rec-room when a user

00:23:34,749 --> 00:23:38,980
attempts to teleport into another users

00:23:36,639 --> 00:23:41,860
personal space bubble they instead will

00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:44,200
see there - teleport preview turning

00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:45,909
from green to red so that just indicates

00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,230
up you can't teleport there because

00:23:45,909 --> 00:23:48,789
you're gonna land at somebody's bubble

00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:51,220
and this approach prevents users from

00:23:48,789 --> 00:23:54,580
abruptly appearing out of thin air in

00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:56,529
the personal space of others nearly all

00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:58,600
the applications we examined utilized

00:23:56,529 --> 00:24:00,820
tools for muting blocking or reporting

00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:02,230
other users that a user could activate

00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:04,809
in the moments they were being harassed

00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:06,490
or felt unsafe with someone for most of

00:24:04,809 --> 00:24:08,110
the applications however this occurred

00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:10,690
when a user would point at the offending

00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:13,659
party pull up a by duration menu select

00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:15,369
block or mute that can take a little

00:24:13,659 --> 00:24:16,330
while and if you're a newbie you and

00:24:15,369 --> 00:24:18,910
you're you know being

00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:20,830
you know pseudo sexually attacked or you

00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:22,630
know threatened with a fake knife it's

00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:23,080
it's really frightening to figure that

00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:24,640
one out

00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:26,800
rec-room offered a particularly

00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,060
interesting twist by enabling users to

00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,710
simply hold their hands up to the

00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:32,560
harasser with a talk to the hand gesture

00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:34,300
which is intuitive and fast right and

00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:37,480
takes care of the kid takes care of the

00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:39,790
issue okay so that's kind of thinking

00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:43,210
about harassment obviously less of an

00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:44,590
issue in peer moderated environments

00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:48,010
like hubs with something that we saw a

00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:50,260
lot in this broad landscape analysis we

00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:51,850
also saw that a number of applications

00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:53,860
have developed communication features

00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:56,380
that support pro-social interaction

00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:58,210
really interesting new ways so product

00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:59,920
manager for alts based Sudha Kapoor

00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:02,560
notes that in alts based people are

00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:04,480
quote using emojis in some ways as

00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:06,850
substitutes for gestures like a hand

00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,500
raised or hand claps especially when

00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:10,270
audiences are engaging with speakers

00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:11,830
such as in town hall events you can sort

00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:14,860
of see you know this notion of floating

00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:17,140
emojis in VR chat embodied social

00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:19,330
rituals have also been invented by users

00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:21,130
and in rec room and Facebook spaces

00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:23,230
controller input can change your avatars

00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:24,730
expressions there's a lot of play with

00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:27,730
how to get more expressiveness in these

00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:30,100
systems and in other cases new kinds of

00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:32,230
embodied communication rituals come from

00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:34,150
the bottom up from the user base so for

00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:36,640
instance Ricky Johnson a content creator

00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:38,710
free our chat noted the importance of

00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,330
gestures like reciprocal head padding as

00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:43,090
an important way to communicate

00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:45,100
affection since hugs are less so

00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:47,050
satisfying ritual envy are due to a lack

00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:48,700
of physical feedback so something that

00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:50,410
would be extremely patronizing in real

00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:52,300
life imagine a fight came and padded all

00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:54,130
your heads as a way to say hello works

00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:55,510
really well in VR and it's something

00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:57,100
that has come from the bottom up as

00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:58,780
users sort of figure out how to operate

00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:01,750
these virtual bodies and figure out

00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:03,220
what's satisfying and Josh also talked a

00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:05,890
lot about the emergence of feeding

00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:07,930
rituals in VR chat where one avatar will

00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:09,610
pretend to feed another which I find

00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:10,600
also really fascinating since of course

00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:12,790
you can't you know

00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:14,890
taste our digested but maybe that maybe

00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:17,440
that's a good thing all right

00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:19,480
so while we go much deeper in our Chi

00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:21,160
paper in particular explaining the more

00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:22,750
granular ways we've compared and

00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:25,240
contrasted the approaches of all the

00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:26,800
creators we talked to it is worth

00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:28,000
addressing one really significant

00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:30,110
distinction that emerged from our

00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,850
interviews so far we've primary

00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:33,380
only talked about social vr for open

00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:35,299
worlds where you meet others but of

00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:37,309
course another important category is

00:26:35,299 --> 00:26:39,200
closed world environments with people

00:26:37,309 --> 00:26:40,340
you already know and we found that

00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,380
creators in the second category

00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:45,070
prioritized a very different list of

00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:47,870
things compared to those in the first

00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:50,510
unlike the open world environments like

00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:53,150
alts based and eland VR chat - Elodie

00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:54,890
and rec room Facebook spaces and hubs

00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:57,770
were both closed environments for people

00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:59,660
who knew one another your lead developer

00:26:57,770 --> 00:27:01,460
at the time I don't know and you know

00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:04,520
things change so fast so I'm not going

00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:06,620
to say Greg noted that the social vr

00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:08,570
ecosystem in general has tended to have

00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:10,309
a design biased towards encounters with

00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:12,260
strangers and this means that most

00:27:10,309 --> 00:27:14,809
applications in the ecosystem tend to

00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:16,760
privileged aspects like blocking muting

00:27:14,809 --> 00:27:18,230
reporting other moderation features some

00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:20,270
of the things we just talked about it

00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:22,880
also means that onboarding tends to

00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:25,490
focus on creating private and safe

00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:27,169
experiences so people aren't just

00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:29,419
dropped into the Wild West of random

00:27:27,169 --> 00:27:31,250
encounters as opposed to assuming that

00:27:29,419 --> 00:27:32,540
onboarding is happening as a social

00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:34,130
experience with one friend or colleague

00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:35,960
guiding another which is what typically

00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:39,230
happens in these invite worlds

00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:40,700
so instead creators at hubs and Facebook

00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:43,580
spaces had a different set of priorities

00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:46,280
for example placing particular emphasis

00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:48,380
on bridging vr with the outside world as

00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:50,390
in the case of Facebook spaces where

00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:52,270
users can broadcast live to their news

00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:54,919
feed or call friends and be a messenger

00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:56,900
Mozilla hubs as you know by contrast

00:27:54,919 --> 00:27:59,240
focuses more on bringing the web into

00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:02,390
social vr a phenomenon you've described

00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:04,429
in terms of porosity of media insofar as

00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:05,960
images and 3d models from the web can

00:28:04,429 --> 00:28:09,650
easily be searched and brought into hubs

00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:11,450
in an ad hoc and improvised way an issue

00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:13,760
that carried across both open and closed

00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:15,980
world social vr was how to think well

00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:19,160
about onboarding users I'm not going to

00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:21,710
talk so much about how that happens in

00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:23,570
open spaces but interestingly in both

00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:25,280
types of worlds a number of respondents

00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:27,559
emphasize the role that learning from

00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:28,820
others can play during onboarding so

00:28:27,559 --> 00:28:32,210
this is an important thing to think

00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:34,250
about any land relies a lot on peer

00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:37,250
learning as does Facebook spaces and

00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:39,679
hubs and again Greg observe that our

00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:41,059
entry flow embraces the fact that users

00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:42,350
will be able to coordinate that entry

00:28:41,059 --> 00:28:43,970
with someone else

00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:47,090
knows how things work who already has

00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:48,679
some prior experience and since these

00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:50,330
people gave you the link to hubs then

00:28:48,679 --> 00:28:52,640
they by definition already have some

00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:55,400
experience and can help be your teacher

00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:57,020
so for Facebook spaces some new users

00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:59,120
are being introduced to the application

00:28:57,020 --> 00:29:01,160
through the t2d Facebook environment

00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,809
when their friends broadcasts Facebook

00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:04,940
spaces through Facebook live or call a

00:29:02,809 --> 00:29:06,950
friend via messenger so in this way

00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:09,530
aspects of onboarding may already be

00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:11,570
occurring before a new user even owns or

00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:13,190
puts on a headset and that's a really

00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:16,700
interesting set of design consideration

00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:18,289
for someone who's new to this so Josh

00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:19,700
created these high-level landscape

00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:21,980
analysis slides that we wanted to

00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:23,870
include before moving over to the

00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:25,549
overview of the final design framework

00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:28,220
we came up with so I'm gonna let him

00:29:25,549 --> 00:29:30,980
explain these charts and also he put

00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:32,570
together an analysis of Mozilla hubs

00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:34,600
areas of strengths in areas for future

00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:40,370
innovation so Josh you wanna jump up and

00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:43,460
take over here all right so we also have

00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:44,809
another set of charts that Anya created

00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:47,690
that we will be able to show today but

00:29:44,809 --> 00:29:49,789
we can those are specific to the Avatar

00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:50,330
study but we can provide those on

00:29:49,789 --> 00:29:53,299
request

00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:55,700
so this landscape analysis focused

00:29:53,299 --> 00:29:57,530
specifically on differentiators among

00:29:55,700 --> 00:30:00,380
the applications that we studied so

00:29:57,530 --> 00:30:02,090
there's more details here that that are

00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:03,409
sort of left out but specifically around

00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:06,620
areas of convergence these are more

00:30:03,409 --> 00:30:08,150
areas of divergence right so one of the

00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:09,710
one area of differentiation that really

00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:10,909
jumped out at us was in how the

00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:12,860
different applications are hindering

00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:14,720
handling moderation so again this is for

00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:16,549
the applications that are primarily

00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,630
focused on the sort of big open world

00:30:16,549 --> 00:30:19,820
where you might be encountering

00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:21,169
strangers right that's where harassment

00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:22,610
tends to happen that's where moderation

00:30:21,169 --> 00:30:23,929
is really important and when we found

00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:25,580
that to split between application

00:30:23,929 --> 00:30:28,010
creators who emphasized human

00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:31,039
involvement in moderation as a really

00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:32,960
key part of how they're approaching its

00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:34,880
conflicts between users versus those

00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:37,070
that really relies heavily on automation

00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:40,340
which is not to say that you know

00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:41,960
different that for example rec-room

00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:43,909
doesn't involve some aspect of

00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:46,970
automation but they are comparatively

00:30:43,909 --> 00:30:49,179
more likely to rely on a human human

00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:51,919
touch in sort of handling user conflicts

00:30:49,179 --> 00:30:53,880
another area I'll speak to briefly is

00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:56,640
friending so

00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:58,530
there was a big challenge for a lot of

00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:01,650
these creators and how to handle the

00:30:58,530 --> 00:31:03,900
issue of shaking a hand which often is

00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:05,490
sort of this is based off of Snow Crash

00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:08,040
actually the idea that you'd shake

00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:10,140
somebody's hand and then you

00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:12,030
automatically become friends right well

00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:14,310
that creates all sorts of complicated

00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:15,930
issues where maybe you want to shake

00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:17,730
their hands because it's obligatory an

00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:19,260
obligatory ritual but you don't actually

00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:20,430
want them to know where you are at all

00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:21,540
times because that's what it implies

00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:23,370
when you are friends with somebody in

00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:26,190
social BR in one of these large worlds

00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:27,570
so we broke it down or we broke down

00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:28,980
this category in terms of which

00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:32,310
applications we're using that kind of

00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:35,310
handshake driven mechanic and then also

00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:37,350
which applications were requiring a kind

00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:38,780
of obligatory symmetric friendship when

00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:41,220
you do friends someone versus

00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:43,410
applications that allow for asymmetric

00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:44,850
friendships so like I choose to be your

00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:46,770
friend because I sent you a request but

00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:48,570
you haven't replied yet so we have

00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:50,070
different kinds of affordances based off

00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:56,280
of symmetric versus asymmetric

00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:58,590
friendship in those cases so yeah moving

00:31:56,280 --> 00:32:00,000
on another area of differentiation was

00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:02,490
long dimensions of place and space

00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,290
design and a detail that I'll call out

00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:06,390
here is that almost all of the

00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:09,570
applications that we looked at hoverin

00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:11,610
have been responding to user generate or

00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:13,680
demand from users for increased

00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:15,150
opportunities to create their own custom

00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:17,010
environments and I think Mozilla hubs

00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:18,480
spoke offers a particularly unique

00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:20,700
approach to this opportunity I'll speak

00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,680
to that in a moment all of the

00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:24,510
applications we looked at strategic Lee

00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:26,700
positioned social catalysts which

00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:29,670
Katherine mentioned so these are social

00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:31,560
lubricants in VR and these include

00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:33,240
objects like the rubber duck in Mozilla

00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:34,980
hubs as well as more fixed art

00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:37,140
architectural features like the campfire

00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:38,460
and alt space VR and I think this is an

00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:40,320
area where we're seeing applications

00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:42,750
increasingly differentiate from one

00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:44,490
another not based on whether they have a

00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:46,440
social catalyst as a sort of key feature

00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:47,910
but on how the social catalysts are

00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:50,820
deployed and positioned especially for

00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:52,800
new users and another detail Cod is at

00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:54,300
the bottom of this chart here Mozilla

00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:56,340
hubs was the only application that

00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:57,390
didn't require a unique user identity

00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:59,760
and I think it's a particularly

00:32:57,390 --> 00:33:01,320
interesting factor when you pair it with

00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:03,090
other factors like device

00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:06,970
interoperability now comment on that

00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:08,770
more in a second so

00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:10,540
based on analysis I wanted to briefly

00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:13,060
speak to some of our earlier takeaways

00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:16,000
on Mozilla hubs areas of comparative

00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:17,170
strength so web eNOS is one topic that

00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,570
was near and dear to the mixed reality

00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:21,700
team that we spoke to at Mozilla that is

00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:24,130
essentially the idea that the spirit of

00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:26,290
ad hoc kind of transfer of assets from

00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:28,990
one part of the web to another can be

00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:31,510
brought into the world of VR so bringing

00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:34,300
web assets into VR and vice-versa

00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:37,150
another area of competitive advantage is

00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:40,000
that Mozilla is spoke application is Inc

00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:42,190
is it has an extremely low bar of entry

00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,290
for users to engage in custom world

00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:45,430
creation um although I think I'll add

00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:47,680
the caveat here that there are

00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:49,060
opportunities I think to improve the UX

00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:51,700
that I'd be happy to speak with the team

00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:55,330
about later and I mentioned this unique

00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:58,330
combination of the not requiring a login

00:33:55,330 --> 00:34:00,490
or unique ID and device interoperability

00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:01,960
or agnosticism and I think this has some

00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:04,690
really profound applications because

00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:07,480
users are not locked into that single ID

00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:10,510
it means that they can be jumping on to

00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:13,870
a or jumping into a VR environment or a

00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:15,010
hubs environment with multiple devices

00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:16,990
simultaneously and this actually

00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:19,720
happened during the interviews that we

00:34:16,990 --> 00:34:21,700
were conducting with the the hub's team

00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:25,570
where there was multiple devices

00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:27,640
floating around and because there wasn't

00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:29,170
this assumption that you had to log in

00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:31,300
each time you could kind of hand off a

00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:32,890
headset right it created for some

00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:34,840
interesting challenges where for like I

00:34:32,890 --> 00:34:37,390
think Miriam I think for a while you had

00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:39,220
like John's headset or something like

00:34:37,390 --> 00:34:41,560
that but like be very quickly like

00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:43,570
figured out who was who right and I

00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:45,880
think this this is also interesting when

00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:49,180
you think about what it would mean to

00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:51,160
have two devices that are both being

00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:53,110
used by a single user deployed

00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:54,970
simultaneously so for example in hmd and

00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:55,480
a mobile phone and I'll speak to that in

00:34:54,970 --> 00:34:57,370
a second

00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:59,500
and then finally the standardization

00:34:57,370 --> 00:35:00,940
around and Anya's should really be the

00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:02,440
one to speak to this but I think there's

00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:04,450
an interesting point here the

00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:06,130
standardization of avatars around a kind

00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:07,060
of robot theme present some really

00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:09,580
interesting opportunities I'm

00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:11,320
specifically related to embodied

00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:13,390
communicative affordances that may be

00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:16,420
kind of unique to robots as a design

00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:19,890
metaphor so I'll dive into that a little

00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:19,890
bit here so

00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:25,420
first if you're thinking about kind of

00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:27,220
robot themed emotive systems right

00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:29,710
robots are sort of different from humans

00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:32,410
in some in some profound ways right

00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:36,040
like we accept that like objects might

00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:37,360
pop out of robots or that they're they

00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:40,450
might have a different kind of gesture

00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:42,460
driven expressive system right so I'm

00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:44,350
using this Inspector Gadget sort of

00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:46,450
metaphor here of this idea that like

00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:49,150
robotic Liam might come out of an avatar

00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:51,880
right and that people would sort of find

00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:54,220
that kind of not necessarily familiar

00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:55,420
but it's not it's not going to sort of

00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:58,030
jar people out of their assumptions

00:35:55,420 --> 00:36:00,010
about what an avatar can do so you know

00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:02,470
for example one of the the challenges

00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:04,000
that our research team encountered when

00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:06,100
we were using Mozilla hubs just sort of

00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,450
casually among ourselves is that if you

00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:09,490
want to have a kind of shared

00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:10,900
conversation in that environment but

00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:12,160
it's also a kind of explorable

00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:14,650
environment it's very easy to kind of

00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:17,680
lose track of where people are so you

00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:20,230
know having some kind of extension from

00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:21,580
the robot avatar body that like reaches

00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:22,840
out like if it's a robotic arm that

00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:24,610
reaches that and like tap somebody on

00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:27,100
the shoulder right a way of kind of

00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:30,130
hailing each other in that world it

00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:32,230
might be possible with a robotic limb

00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:33,490
extension that wouldn't be possible or

00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:36,330
wouldn't make as much sense to people

00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:38,590
sort of from a kind of humanoid avatar

00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:40,000
perspective so I think there's a lot to

00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:44,320
like impact that this is like very sort

00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,550
of you know early idea ideation on this

00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,050
topic but I think it's probably an

00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:48,970
interesting one to play with an I'm

00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:50,140
guessing that the Mozilla the mixed

00:36:48,970 --> 00:36:53,170
reality team has thought about this a

00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:55,120
lot and then finally um just to speak a

00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:56,800
little bit more to this hmd plus mobile

00:36:55,120 --> 00:37:00,610
phone as kind of window into physical

00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:02,590
world theme so there was a an experiment

00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:06,070
from the Google daydream folks a while

00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:07,510
back where they had inside of tilt brush

00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:11,110
had created this ability to kind of

00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:13,630
paint a window to a video feed that

00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:16,720
allowed you to kind of share the outside

00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:19,840
or physical world with the VR world

00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:21,760
right and I think increasingly there

00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:25,540
will be opportunities to bring in kind

00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:28,210
of mobile phone video feeds into from

00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:29,650
from the physical environment into VR so

00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:31,960
for example if I was going to jump into

00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:33,310
social VR as a kind of alternative to

00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:35,560
Skype or FaceTime with

00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:38,110
my parents they would want to see my

00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:40,540
newborn baby right and it's pretty hard

00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:43,450
to bring my newborn baby into VR but if

00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:46,360
there was a simple way to offer a kind

00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:48,250
of window into the physical world with a

00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:49,630
mobile phone that would allow this to

00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:50,710
happen again this is probably something

00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:53,020
that your team has thought a lot about

00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:55,930
but I think Mozilla hubs is really

00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:58,270
uniquely positioned because of the not

00:37:55,930 --> 00:38:00,190
requiring people to have a common login

00:37:58,270 --> 00:38:02,860
they're uniquely positioned to allow

00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:04,690
people to kind of flexibly combine

00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:06,970
devices in an ad hoc way and I think

00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:08,680
that's a really unique differentiator so

00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:15,910
with that I'm gonna hand it off to

00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:18,970
Kathryn again all right okay so the

00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:20,710
framework so as we move toward creating

00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:23,080
a preliminary design framework as you

00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:25,300
would expect as we said already some

00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:27,610
things have been true of prior social

00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:29,140
virtual environments in the interest of

00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:31,390
time I'm not going to dive deeply into

00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:32,920
those they're in both the papers I can

00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:34,570
mail them out and you can unpack them

00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:37,390
later we can talk about it after this

00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:39,340
presentation instead I'm just going to

00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:41,890
focus a little bit on these two major

00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:43,900
categories of social VR experiences with

00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:46,360
an emphasis on what's unique about

00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:48,130
designing for embodied immersion so

00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:49,570
let's consider open worlds first and

00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:52,000
kind of bolded some of the points that

00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:54,760
we want to bring forward so we think the

00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:57,070
primary thing is the physical immediacy

00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:59,800
of social vr it leads to a hype

00:38:57,070 --> 00:39:02,620
importance of offering a safe onboarding

00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:05,350
experience and it also lends a lot more

00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:07,030
power to embodied social catalysts that

00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:09,520
serve as icebreakers so you're much more

00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:11,440
deeply in your body so these kinds of

00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:13,480
design choices have a much bigger impact

00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:15,970
on how people feel how they relate to

00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:17,920
one another so they become an incredibly

00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:20,200
important part of the designers toolkit

00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:22,750
for creating positive social engagement

00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:24,820
we also think it's vital to give people

00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:27,490
quick intuitive and physical ways to

00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:29,530
manage strangers I suspect that extends

00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:32,170
all the way into quick intuitive

00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:34,240
physical ways of managing interpersonal

00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:36,490
interaction in general not all of which

00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:38,590
have to completely ape what happens in

00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:40,900
the real world but can be very creative

00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:42,640
takes on what's powerful about the

00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:45,370
medium that allows the kind of subtle

00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:46,240
social interplay people do particularly

00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:48,550
with nonverbal

00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:50,560
Q's right so you think about somebody

00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:52,420
who's trying to leave a meeting without

00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:54,520
being rude and they do a lot of kind of

00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:56,170
orienting and kind of backing away sorts

00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:58,510
of things some of that you can already

00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:59,560
do with the affordances you have that

00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:00,730
you could augment that in really

00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:03,010
interesting ways

00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:04,780
okay so let's consider closed world

00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:07,210
social VR experiences with people you

00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:09,400
already know from our interviews the key

00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:12,900
factors seem to be taking into account

00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:15,430
peer learning and keeping in mind also

00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:18,339
not just that somebody's coming in with

00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:20,170
somebody else but also how this

00:40:18,339 --> 00:40:21,250
experience is going to bridge between VR

00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:23,710
and the outside world

00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:25,810
there's this more permeable situation

00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:28,450
happening so things like device to

00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:30,160
interoperability and being fully

00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:32,740
apprised of that there may be very

00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:34,270
asymmetric kinds of communication and

00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:36,030
interaction happening because you're

00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:38,500
allowing this kind of interoperability

00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:41,800
so I want to note here that in the disk

00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:44,980
paper Anya also covers some ways in

00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:47,580
which she thinks because you're so

00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:50,650
embodied in both kinds of worlds that

00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:52,780
it's better to think of avatar systems

00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:54,609
rather than the design of avatars and

00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:56,619
isolation and she's a really nice

00:40:54,609 --> 00:40:57,220
breakdown of different factors to

00:40:56,619 --> 00:40:59,589
consider

00:40:57,220 --> 00:41:01,540
you know how avatars interact how they

00:40:59,589 --> 00:41:03,580
interact with the space you know the

00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:05,530
customizability opportunities for

00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:08,440
avatars and how that all meshes together

00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:10,270
to create an avatar system that is going

00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:12,760
to enable the kinds of social expression

00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:14,770
and interaction that you want so I would

00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:18,640
point you to that paper for more about

00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:20,050
that so obviously this was just you know

00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:22,510
I showed you this three-prong research

00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:24,910
this is just prong one we're still going

00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:26,380
on this we have a ton of questions as we

00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:28,660
follow up the first phase of this work

00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:30,310
the next phase is the summer they're

00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:32,380
going to be interviews with users of the

00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:34,180
various systems and all along we've also

00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:36,520
been doing research through design

00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:38,680
prototyping so here are some of the

00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:40,839
questions that are in our minds you know

00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:42,700
do these categories also hold true for

00:41:40,839 --> 00:41:45,010
users how do users think about this and

00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:48,400
they label things in different ways and

00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:51,040
how should designers and how can they

00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:53,020
respond to users expectation of agency

00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:56,020
right and shaping their own experience

00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:58,420
and then we're really interested in how

00:41:56,020 --> 00:42:00,880
we can drop research through design

00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:02,799
into the space like designing new

00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:04,359
possibility spaces for interaction than

00:42:02,799 --> 00:42:06,849
testing them out in the lab as the way

00:42:04,359 --> 00:42:10,480
another way of communicating back so for

00:42:06,849 --> 00:42:12,750
example the summer we're actually doing

00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:15,160
prototypes of different ways that

00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:17,260
conversational balance can be maintained

00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:20,619
in social vr and we're going to run a

00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:23,200
study of two different strategies one of

00:42:20,619 --> 00:42:26,170
which is very fanciful with people in

00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:29,559
our lab to see whether we can actually

00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:31,359
improve upon face to face conversation

00:42:29,559 --> 00:42:35,260
balance which is an ongoing struggle as

00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:36,640
we all know so I mean ideally maybe we

00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:38,980
get to the point where people are like

00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:40,690
let's take it into VR because they

00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:43,420
appreciate the mediation and

00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:45,490
augmentation tools that you know wrap

00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:47,589
around them like a gentle hug and help

00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:49,569
deal with sort of rough social issues

00:42:47,589 --> 00:42:51,099
that are everyday problems in human

00:42:49,569 --> 00:42:52,720
interaction right so we could get to a

00:42:51,099 --> 00:42:54,430
point where it's not just because people

00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:56,500
want to reduce their carbon footprint

00:42:54,430 --> 00:42:58,690
it's because they really enjoy being

00:42:56,500 --> 00:43:00,819
augmented by the technology in a

00:42:58,690 --> 00:43:03,730
graceful way that improves their social

00:43:00,819 --> 00:43:05,769
interaction so okay so that's what we

00:43:03,730 --> 00:43:07,059
had prepared for today we're glad to

00:43:05,769 --> 00:43:09,369
answer your questions we want to thank

00:43:07,059 --> 00:43:11,289
you again for your support and a special

00:43:09,369 --> 00:43:13,450
shout out to Joe fish and Miriam and all

00:43:11,289 --> 00:43:14,920
the people on the hub's team who you

00:43:13,450 --> 00:43:17,170
know we're patient with us and let us

00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:18,339
interview you and come and visit and we

00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:20,380
also want to say we'd love to keep

00:43:18,339 --> 00:43:20,829
working together so that's all we've got

00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:22,960
for today

00:43:20,829 --> 00:43:27,389
thank you

00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:27,389
[Applause]

00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:07,020
as we add features anyway to for us to

00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:09,080
change our dots on the diagram of what

00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:13,920
we support what we don't support

00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:16,680
absolutely right so you're asking us to

00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:19,830
that we are there particularly like give

00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:22,260
you back dates about what we've done or

00:44:19,830 --> 00:44:24,150
not done as this yes as information

00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:27,450
changes here like yeah absolutely do you

00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:30,090
plan to keep this up to date or you know

00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:31,890
yeah I think you know the last time we

00:44:30,090 --> 00:44:34,109
visited you know there were areas where

00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:35,640
like already I think mine you should one

00:44:34,109 --> 00:44:36,990
of these charts and already things had

00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:39,119
changed yeah

00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:42,800
one of the areas where it's interesting

00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:44,850
to sort of see these charts evolve is

00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:47,790
you know for example if you go to the

00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:50,190
next one on place in space right so when

00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:52,920
we started this research project not all

00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:55,470
of the applications had a an

00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:58,440
introductory public lobby not all of the

00:44:55,470 --> 00:45:00,030
applications had a private space to get

00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:01,380
started right and there's been a lot of

00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:03,840
convergence so it's interesting not only

00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:06,690
seeing like where do you apply on these

00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:08,580
sorts of charts but also where as where

00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:11,490
is their movement to convergence around

00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:13,650
design standards and are those design

00:45:11,490 --> 00:45:15,720
standards really being reflected on

00:45:13,650 --> 00:45:17,160
right in some cases I think there's a

00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:18,840
rationale to why there's movement in a

00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:19,770
particular direction in other cases I

00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:21,690
think if there's a little bit of a herd

00:45:19,770 --> 00:45:23,010
mentality so I'm yeah I'm really

00:45:21,690 --> 00:45:24,990
interested in sort of how these change

00:45:23,010 --> 00:45:27,240
and so yeah I'd love to stay in touch

00:45:24,990 --> 00:45:28,380
and particularly if there's if we have

00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:29,880
something kind of that you feel is

00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:32,100
inaccurate in way that we're presenting

00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:33,900
mozilla helps let us know and I just

00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:36,540
want to call it at this point one of our

00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:42,770
prior references which is Celia Pierce's

00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:46,050
book please even quickly find it yeah

00:45:42,770 --> 00:45:48,000
communities of play so fascinating she

00:45:46,050 --> 00:45:50,010
tracks these people who were in Peru and

00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,780
then it gets closed down and they start

00:45:50,010 --> 00:45:53,400
trying to recreate the experience they

00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:55,260
used to have in ruin like Second Life

00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:57,630
and other forums eventually they get

00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:59,310
hold of it the company says here fine

00:45:57,630 --> 00:46:01,680
you can just you know here's an instance

00:45:59,310 --> 00:46:04,770
of ooh go play in it and it's like this

00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:06,540
deep ethnography into how like tribes of

00:46:04,770 --> 00:46:08,070
people move across platforms just to

00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:10,440
speak to what Josh is saying like I'm

00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:12,220
also fascinated about the communities of

00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:13,750
practice within hubs

00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:16,840
how they evolved and I'd love to hear

00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:21,550
about that and that continues it's a

00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:23,680
great read so I'd like to follow can you

00:46:21,550 --> 00:46:28,810
go back to that fascinating chart I love

00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:31,320
that chart yes yes yes checked partly

00:46:28,810 --> 00:46:35,980
because I mean it's such as

00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:37,200
substantiation of knowledge here right

00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:39,490
you know when sort of people like old

00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:40,900
look like for me when people go what did

00:46:39,490 --> 00:46:44,140
you get out of sponsoring this research

00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:46,810
but like huh right one of these that's

00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:49,840
interesting is what the how this

00:46:46,810 --> 00:46:51,970
developed as a list of things right and

00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:53,710
whether these are the right things and

00:46:51,970 --> 00:46:57,280
what the prior work is that went into

00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:58,660
these for example you criticized the

00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:01,900
notion of symmetric friendship in your

00:46:58,660 --> 00:47:03,460
talk right like that's the fair I think

00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:05,950
of that as the Facebook model because

00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:07,810
you know Facebook assumed that

00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:09,250
friendship is a sort of you know either

00:47:07,810 --> 00:47:11,109
you are a friends or you're not friends

00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:13,480
right and you compare that to other

00:47:11,109 --> 00:47:14,950
models of relationships which I'm old

00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:17,440
enough to think of as the livejournal

00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:19,060
model right where you can or cannot

00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:20,950
follow people and they can and cannot

00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:22,119
follow you right and the idea that not

00:47:20,950 --> 00:47:24,730
all friendships are necessarily

00:47:22,119 --> 00:47:26,320
symmetric so can you talk a little bit

00:47:24,730 --> 00:47:27,640
but I mean obviously some of this just

00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:30,190
came out of the research because that's

00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:31,900
the way these things do is this the

00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:34,480
right set of things how did you arrive

00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:36,550
it and what might it mean to think about

00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:38,980
these particularly I think when you

00:47:36,550 --> 00:47:41,740
frame it as VR landscape analysis if you

00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:47,290
were to frame it as pro-social landscape

00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:49,660
analysis yeah yeah so you know I think

00:47:47,290 --> 00:47:51,280
one of the the I sort of spoke to this

00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:53,619
in the previous question as well but um

00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:55,270
one of the things we discovered was we

00:47:53,619 --> 00:47:58,109
were we were doing this research at a

00:47:55,270 --> 00:48:01,020
time when there was a lot of kind of

00:47:58,109 --> 00:48:03,040
discovering of best practices and

00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:04,900
applications adopting practices that

00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:07,480
other applications were we're choosing

00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:09,730
so I you know in terms of what factors I

00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:10,780
feel like I'm sort of privileges where

00:48:09,730 --> 00:48:14,080
there still is a certain amount of

00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:15,520
differentiation but you'll see certain

00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:18,280
things like personal space bubbles

00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:20,380
there's like wide saturation right so

00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:23,440
you know we didn't necessarily want to

00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:25,710
have a landscape analysis that was just

00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:27,869
all the bubbles were checkmark

00:48:25,710 --> 00:48:30,000
right I like everything system yeah so

00:48:27,869 --> 00:48:31,650
you know I think I think and and and

00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:35,580
then the other the the detail I think is

00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:37,080
missing here is the the kind of it's a

00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:39,750
little bit hard to do in a binary chart

00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:41,339
like this but that there's very

00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:43,230
different kind of metaphors of what it

00:48:41,339 --> 00:48:46,380
means to be social in these different

00:48:43,230 --> 00:48:48,330
applications and that to me maybe there

00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:51,630
is a way to sort of present that in a

00:48:48,330 --> 00:48:53,160
kind of landscape analysis chart but to

00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:56,400
me that's one of the most interesting

00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:58,800
kind of underlying differentiators right

00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:05,640
so you know some of that if you go to

00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:07,920
the the next one yeah so you get a

00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:10,619
little bit of that in for example like

00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:12,750
place space unified theme like rec room

00:49:10,619 --> 00:49:16,470
is basis basis of their entire world off

00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:18,720
a 1987 rec center right there the only

00:49:16,470 --> 00:49:23,520
one that is like has a consistent

00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:27,119
unified aesthetic throughout but I think

00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:30,540
despite that the the sort of there's a

00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:32,460
lot of nuance in sort of what I mean by

00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:34,710
not having a unified theme right because

00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:37,940
Facebook spaces has a unified design

00:49:34,710 --> 00:49:40,830
aesthetic even if the theme itself is

00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:42,480
can be swapped based off of like what

00:49:40,830 --> 00:49:43,830
kind of background image you choose to

00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:47,099
have for your Facebook spaces

00:49:43,830 --> 00:49:48,570
environment yeah I'm not sure if I'm

00:49:47,099 --> 00:49:51,210
answering your question - exactly but

00:49:48,570 --> 00:49:52,830
yeah chip in - which is that if you

00:49:51,210 --> 00:49:55,109
think about it this is like the

00:49:52,830 --> 00:49:56,970
benevolent top-down view from designers

00:49:55,109 --> 00:49:58,230
I mean some we had some community

00:49:56,970 --> 00:50:00,720
managers who are doing kind of like

00:49:58,230 --> 00:50:02,130
ragtag everyday life in these worlds but

00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:04,320
I think it will be really interesting to

00:50:02,130 --> 00:50:05,339
see when we're speaking directly with

00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:07,920
users

00:50:05,339 --> 00:50:11,099
you know what's their mental model you

00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:12,780
know of what the important features are

00:50:11,099 --> 00:50:14,250
and how they think about these things

00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:18,000
and meshing these two things together

00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:21,420
right there's so many ways to slice it

00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:23,410
yeah yeah can I do one follow no you go

00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:25,700
first you do

00:50:23,410 --> 00:50:28,760
like totally derail it in a different

00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:31,910
direction um my question was around kind

00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:35,119
of the like global the global impact of

00:50:31,910 --> 00:50:37,100
some of these decisions my familiarity

00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:39,080
with a lot of these platforms is that

00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:42,830
they are being developed in the US or

00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:44,660
Europe and that may not be representing

00:50:42,830 --> 00:50:46,640
a global population the demographics of

00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:48,740
maybe both the teams creating them and

00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:50,750
the users may not represent a global

00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:54,260
demographic do you suspect that these

00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:56,180
landscape analyses change if we start

00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:59,360
thinking about platforms as they would

00:50:56,180 --> 00:51:00,830
apply to having like a more diverse set

00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:02,750
or does that come into any of these

00:51:00,830 --> 00:51:04,160
questions at all or what designers are

00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:05,420
thinking about this I don't think we've

00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:06,890
tapped that but I want to share a really

00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:09,860
interesting anecdote from one of my

00:51:06,890 --> 00:51:12,110
students who's from Iran she just did a

00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:14,420
comparison between Facebook behavior

00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:16,490
from people in her home country and then

00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:18,530
like the kind of code switching they do

00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:20,330
in when they're trying to dealing with

00:51:18,530 --> 00:51:23,720
people who are international and she

00:51:20,330 --> 00:51:25,520
said that Iranians like everything that

00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:28,760
is posted by a person because that shows

00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:31,040
respect so you have to like everything

00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:32,690
the person posts and she said sometimes

00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:34,810
people have multiple accounts so they

00:51:32,690 --> 00:51:37,250
can do more kind of naturalistic

00:51:34,810 --> 00:51:39,290
international style Facebook behavior

00:51:37,250 --> 00:51:42,380
and only like things they want to kind

00:51:39,290 --> 00:51:45,230
of up vote so it's super clear to me

00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:46,970
that there are culturally specific norms

00:51:45,230 --> 00:51:49,550
that get translated into these

00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:51,260
environments you know I think it'd be

00:51:49,550 --> 00:51:53,540
fantastic to study anything that's

00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:56,300
bubbling up in other communities but

00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:57,890
just not not something we got to well in

00:51:56,300 --> 00:52:00,020
the I mean as Kathryn mentioned that one

00:51:57,890 --> 00:52:03,380
of the key areas of difference is that

00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:06,920
you know yes we had all these platforms

00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:08,780
that were volumetric social environments

00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:10,609
like Second Life but what's different

00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:14,740
now is this sense of embodiment right

00:52:10,609 --> 00:52:16,750
the egocentric immersion and so

00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:19,220
different cultural differences around

00:52:16,750 --> 00:52:20,720
proxemics and what it means to be close

00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:23,810
to someone in personal space and yeah

00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:25,609
how you approach people those now but up

00:52:23,810 --> 00:52:27,680
against things like new affordances of

00:52:25,609 --> 00:52:29,690
teleportation right so like the way that

00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:32,270
you calibrate for example something like

00:52:29,690 --> 00:52:34,369
how far you can tell it teleport has

00:52:32,270 --> 00:52:35,869
profound impacts on how people like

00:52:34,369 --> 00:52:37,999
self-report around feelings

00:52:35,869 --> 00:52:39,140
loneliness right so if you can be in the

00:52:37,999 --> 00:52:41,539
middle of conversation with someone and

00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:43,430
then suddenly they disappear it really

00:52:41,539 --> 00:52:44,930
matters if they disappear completely or

00:52:43,430 --> 00:52:46,400
if they're sort of like slightly far

00:52:44,930 --> 00:52:47,690
away and then they can see you again and

00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:51,079
come back right so those sorts of things

00:52:47,690 --> 00:52:53,450
become important yeah and then in terms

00:52:51,079 --> 00:52:55,519
of you know will this change over time

00:52:53,450 --> 00:52:58,519
or will sort of analyses like this

00:52:55,519 --> 00:53:00,680
change over time as more people adopt

00:52:58,519 --> 00:53:03,319
these platforms I mean yeah he said the

00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:05,200
obvious answer I guess is probably yes I

00:53:03,319 --> 00:53:08,119
think we're sort of on the precipice of

00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:10,220
all-in-one inside-out tracking devices

00:53:08,119 --> 00:53:13,579
like oculus quest and we'll see what how

00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:15,200
that changes the market but yeah we we

00:53:13,579 --> 00:53:16,880
maybe we're sort of at an interesting

00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:18,529
moment where a lot of the social VR

00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:20,210
applications are kind of trying to

00:53:18,529 --> 00:53:21,890
retract a little bit because they feel

00:53:20,210 --> 00:53:25,369
like they over invested before the

00:53:21,890 --> 00:53:28,549
device market had caught up so we may

00:53:25,369 --> 00:53:30,829
see you know after next Christmas season

00:53:28,549 --> 00:53:32,690
we may see that change again right so

00:53:30,829 --> 00:53:34,789
you I'm sure you know people on your

00:53:32,690 --> 00:53:36,680
team probably know more about this this

00:53:34,789 --> 00:53:38,539
kind of market analysis than I do but

00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:40,400
yeah interesting talk about it and do

00:53:38,539 --> 00:53:42,769
you guys know the story about the mobile

00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:44,809
phone cameras like the early study of

00:53:42,769 --> 00:53:46,880
those so like all the engineers in Japan

00:53:44,809 --> 00:53:48,559
were like fixated on getting high pixel

00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:49,970
count and like that it had to get to a

00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:51,289
certain threshold before like

00:53:49,970 --> 00:53:52,880
photographers would really want to use

00:53:51,289 --> 00:53:55,099
them and then when they started

00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:57,410
releasing them out in the ecosystem what

00:53:55,099 --> 00:53:59,239
happen is it was teen girls taking like

00:53:57,410 --> 00:54:02,239
cute little photos who could have cared

00:53:59,239 --> 00:54:04,309
less about resolution so I think you

00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:06,829
know you need to think of it as keeping

00:54:04,309 --> 00:54:08,539
a close eye on weird practices that

00:54:06,829 --> 00:54:10,579
emerge and just scaffolding out

00:54:08,539 --> 00:54:12,499
affordances for those strange practices

00:54:10,579 --> 00:54:14,599
and I mean I think you're really well

00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:18,079
situated to take advantage of strange

00:54:14,599 --> 00:54:19,910
spaces so I mean personally as a scholar

00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:21,380
look taking the long view of these

00:54:19,910 --> 00:54:24,170
platforms I would encourage you to

00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:26,720
really double down on really interesting

00:54:24,170 --> 00:54:28,940
and unique behaviors you see emerging in

00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:30,410
your communities and just scaffolding

00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:32,029
out little platforms for them to

00:54:30,410 --> 00:54:36,710
continue those things and I mean that

00:54:32,029 --> 00:54:38,690
way you lead instead of follow right can

00:54:36,710 --> 00:54:42,190
I do one quick follow-up on that which

00:54:38,690 --> 00:54:46,150
is if you think about this in the in the

00:54:42,190 --> 00:54:48,170
space of other ways that people have

00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:49,039
interactions on the internet and I think

00:54:48,170 --> 00:54:51,109
about search engine

00:54:49,039 --> 00:54:52,309
it's raining and at the beginning we

00:54:51,109 --> 00:54:54,259
there was a whole bunch of

00:54:52,309 --> 00:54:55,609
general-purpose search engines and

00:54:54,259 --> 00:54:57,739
obviously search is dominated by

00:54:55,609 --> 00:54:58,939
general-purpose search engines what's

00:54:57,739 --> 00:55:01,459
interesting is that they haven't

00:54:58,939 --> 00:55:03,380
entirely eliminated specific purpose

00:55:01,459 --> 00:55:05,299
search engines right if I want to know

00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:06,619
who it is who just showed up on the

00:55:05,299 --> 00:55:08,779
screen in killing Eve I'm like I

00:55:06,619 --> 00:55:10,729
recognize that one from somewhere then

00:55:08,779 --> 00:55:13,309
I'm gonna go to IMDB and I'm gonna look

00:55:10,729 --> 00:55:15,259
that up there right and we can point to

00:55:13,309 --> 00:55:16,999
other examples right Ravelry like

00:55:15,259 --> 00:55:19,759
pinterest there are sort of specific

00:55:16,999 --> 00:55:21,859
things are particularly good yeah well

00:55:19,759 --> 00:55:24,249
you do pull out this emphasis on games

00:55:21,859 --> 00:55:30,890
as being one particular category here

00:55:24,249 --> 00:55:33,140
are you starting to see more specific VR

00:55:30,890 --> 00:55:35,689
space of verticals or are we all sort of

00:55:33,140 --> 00:55:37,309
in the oh these are for like hanging out

00:55:35,689 --> 00:55:39,589
and killing time with your friends kind

00:55:37,309 --> 00:55:41,599
of thing and I'm massively generalizing

00:55:39,589 --> 00:55:44,539
there but but do you see that that sort

00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:45,319
of fragmentation or or well so what do

00:55:44,539 --> 00:55:46,669
you call it when you're trying to be

00:55:45,319 --> 00:55:49,609
nice about fragmentation right like

00:55:46,669 --> 00:55:51,259
leaning into opportunities mm-hmm what

00:55:49,609 --> 00:55:51,799
do you mean by the the vertical in the

00:55:51,259 --> 00:55:55,039
sense

00:55:51,799 --> 00:55:58,249
yeah like games or you know office work

00:55:55,039 --> 00:56:00,529
space highly realistic conversations I

00:55:58,249 --> 00:56:02,509
mean I think there's a deeper sea change

00:56:00,529 --> 00:56:04,039
going on right now I don't know if

00:56:02,509 --> 00:56:06,199
anybody saw the piece in The New York

00:56:04,039 --> 00:56:09,049
Times about like screen time is obsolete

00:56:06,199 --> 00:56:11,539
because now we're moving through the

00:56:09,049 --> 00:56:13,999
screen ecosystems and we're

00:56:11,539 --> 00:56:16,729
fundamentally reshaping how we're social

00:56:13,999 --> 00:56:18,409
with each other so I think it's while

00:56:16,729 --> 00:56:20,419
it's useful from like kind of a markets

00:56:18,409 --> 00:56:21,979
perspective to think about segments I

00:56:20,419 --> 00:56:26,359
think it's also really interesting to

00:56:21,979 --> 00:56:29,359
think about being there in a weird way

00:56:26,359 --> 00:56:32,299
our social interaction is being to use a

00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:36,309
horrible word disrupted and so like

00:56:32,299 --> 00:56:39,739
understanding how that's happening and

00:56:36,309 --> 00:56:42,409
what people want in terms of easy and

00:56:39,739 --> 00:56:45,529
ready communication and then how does

00:56:42,409 --> 00:56:49,069
the technology really adeptly augment

00:56:45,529 --> 00:56:51,679
that will be I think the next big thing

00:56:49,069 --> 00:56:53,749
right so I'm not even thinking that you

00:56:51,679 --> 00:56:55,489
you all don't need to be nice you can be

00:56:53,749 --> 00:56:57,829
huge if you fit if you know if you

00:56:55,489 --> 00:56:59,020
figure out and identify and kind of

00:56:57,829 --> 00:57:02,570
double down on that

00:56:59,020 --> 00:57:06,590
you may have more to say about different

00:57:02,570 --> 00:57:08,450
niches and you know do you see you know

00:57:06,590 --> 00:57:10,340
specializations happening in the VR

00:57:08,450 --> 00:57:12,170
landscape the social BR yeah I mean so

00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:13,670
when we started this one of our goals

00:57:12,170 --> 00:57:15,500
was to sort of capture the diversity

00:57:13,670 --> 00:57:17,360
while it still existed with this

00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:20,210
assumption that what happens in the

00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:22,010
social of the our world and may echo

00:57:20,210 --> 00:57:25,180
what happened in the kind of 2d social

00:57:22,010 --> 00:57:27,530
media world that you know sort of like a

00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:28,820
forest growing right like you start out

00:57:27,530 --> 00:57:30,140
with all this diversity and then these

00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:33,470
tall trees grow and kind of crowd

00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:36,410
everything else out so you know it seems

00:57:33,470 --> 00:57:39,350
like at least right now the tall trees

00:57:36,410 --> 00:57:42,650
are the are chat for open world

00:57:39,350 --> 00:57:45,140
environments and kind of and there's

00:57:42,650 --> 00:57:47,450
still a lot of diversity for the kind of

00:57:45,140 --> 00:57:50,300
VR with with people you already know

00:57:47,450 --> 00:57:51,740
right I'm sure that Facebook would

00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:56,120
prefer that everybody use Facebook

00:57:51,740 --> 00:57:58,430
spaces but so far that that's been more

00:57:56,120 --> 00:58:00,680
of an experiment I think on their part

00:57:58,430 --> 00:58:02,990
than a something that has sort of really

00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:07,070
captured or that they've intended to

00:58:02,990 --> 00:58:09,350
capture a major market share so yeah I

00:58:07,070 --> 00:58:11,690
think that there's I think there's a lot

00:58:09,350 --> 00:58:13,160
to learn from the diversity and

00:58:11,690 --> 00:58:15,620
especially when the diversities user

00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:18,830
driven one of the things that really

00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:22,190
jumped out at us was I mentioned user

00:58:18,830 --> 00:58:25,550
demand for cost the ability to create

00:58:22,190 --> 00:58:27,440
custom environments so a place like rec

00:58:25,550 --> 00:58:30,440
room where they really didn't see that

00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:32,750
as their their role in providing that

00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:35,540
kind of affordance they were really

00:58:32,750 --> 00:58:37,250
surprised to find that their users cared

00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:39,650
a whole lot about creating like these

00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:40,970
custom party rooms they do it even when

00:58:39,650 --> 00:58:42,980
they would just disappear before he

00:58:40,970 --> 00:58:45,740
could save them at all it was kind of

00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:48,200
elaborate mandala sandcastle type things

00:58:45,740 --> 00:58:49,670
yeah so so in an environment where there

00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:51,050
was a lot of kind of top-down control of

00:58:49,670 --> 00:58:54,170
the aesthetic and the kind of themes of

00:58:51,050 --> 00:58:55,970
this like rec center the users still

00:58:54,170 --> 00:58:57,560
wanted to kind of go off and create

00:58:55,970 --> 00:58:58,760
their own environments with their own

00:58:57,560 --> 00:59:01,940
sort of social role stats in those

00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:03,800
environments and I so yeah there's a lot

00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:06,200
of kind of weak signals that that tell

00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:06,650
you that may be portent of things to

00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:07,730
come

00:59:06,650 --> 00:59:10,130
right I think any land is another really

00:59:07,730 --> 00:59:11,640
great example where small user group but

00:59:10,130 --> 00:59:14,400
man are they devoted

00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:17,010
there's people that spend like 18 hours

00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:18,390
at a time in any land and will like go

00:59:17,010 --> 00:59:19,770
to sleep in any land and you'll like

00:59:18,390 --> 00:59:23,070
walk over and see an avatar and they're

00:59:19,770 --> 00:59:24,720
sleeping and then they will wake up in

00:59:23,070 --> 00:59:27,230
any land right I mean like people that

00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:29,040
are really devoted and creating really

00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:30,690
bizarre and interesting user-generated

00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:32,430
content right like they figured out

00:59:30,690 --> 00:59:34,500
using the in world coding system how to

00:59:32,430 --> 00:59:36,990
do AI K on avatars and then all of a

00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:40,650
sudden all the avatars had inverse

00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:42,540
kinematics right so this is user the

00:59:40,650 --> 00:59:43,590
user generated innovation right so I

00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:45,180
think there's a lot of examples like

00:59:43,590 --> 00:59:46,410
that and one other thing I mean

00:59:45,180 --> 00:59:48,030
Catherine mentioned like the sort of

00:59:46,410 --> 00:59:50,730
next step in this process for us is to

00:59:48,030 --> 00:59:53,040
is to really hone in on the user

00:59:50,730 --> 00:59:54,300
research component of this project and

00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:55,260
so I'm really excited to talk to him as

00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:56,580
a little help to users and sort of

00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:58,290
figure out what are the kind of unique

00:59:56,580 --> 00:59:59,940
user generated innovations that are

00:59:58,290 --> 01:00:03,420
emerging from how they're using the

00:59:59,940 --> 01:00:04,950
product all right can everybody join me

01:00:03,420 --> 01:00:07,420
in thanking Catherine Joseph for a

01:00:04,950 --> 01:00:11,769
fascinating talk

01:00:07,420 --> 01:00:11,769
