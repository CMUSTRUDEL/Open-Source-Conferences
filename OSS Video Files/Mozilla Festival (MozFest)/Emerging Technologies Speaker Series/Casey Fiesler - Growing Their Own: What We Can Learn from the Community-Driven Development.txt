good morning good afternoon good evening

00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:10,019
my name is Joe fish I'm principal

00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:12,570
research scientist neeti and I have the

00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:14,910
great pleasure of in being able to

00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:16,529
introduce Casey feeler today Casey is a

00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,660
professor at cu-boulder

00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:20,220
and I've been trying to get an

00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:23,699
opportunity to bring her in and talk to

00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:24,930
Mozilla for about two years now she's

00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:27,240
not a whole bunch of really interesting

00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:28,980
work in addition to a whole bunch of

00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,599
this sort of human-computer interaction

00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,460
work around communities and how people

00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:35,399
think about that she also has a law

00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:38,489
degree before that so she has a whole

00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:41,100
side of her work around privacy ethics

00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:42,570
questions like that and the legal side

00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,930
of these things and I think that

00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:47,280
combination really talks to dos the

00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:48,690
stuff that Mozilla cares about right

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,300
it's also the stuff that we think is

00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:53,670
important in the world and I think her

00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:56,160
insights are gonna have ramifications

00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:57,510
across the company I particularly am

00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,820
excited about this work and I

00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:01,829
particularly asked her to do this work

00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:05,970
about ao3 our favorite of our own

00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:08,760
because it was it's such a successful

00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:12,030
community right it's so good at bringing

00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:14,340
in contributors and building something

00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:16,320
out of that that that massive community

00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,049
and again to me this seems like exactly

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,610
the sort of thing that we wanted to see

00:01:18,049 --> 00:01:22,770
we wanted to do at Mozilla we want to

00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:24,270
learn from it Mozilla so okay so I'm

00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:29,270
gonna stop talking to over to you but

00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:31,799
thank you very much for coming thank you

00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:34,170
so I'm really excited to be here and I'm

00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:36,210
particularly excited to talk to Mozilla

00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:39,180
about our kind of our own because I've

00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:40,619
always thought that some of the great

00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,939
things about this community really

00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:49,740
resonate with the values and goals of

00:01:43,939 --> 00:01:52,320
Mozilla and so I have been studying this

00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:53,040
particular community for quite a while

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,360
now

00:01:53,040 --> 00:02:00,780
let me do some some definitional work

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,040
first so first of all if you have never

00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,829
heard of fanfiction

00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:07,170
what I mean by fanfiction are people who

00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:11,280
are writing stories about Harry Potter

00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:12,670
and Star Trek and continuing adventures

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,290
and romantic relations

00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:15,750
between characters you never thought

00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:18,850
would get together in this kind of thing

00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:20,350
I've actually been looking at these

00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:24,490
communities in the context of the

00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:27,819
internet since the early 2000s when I

00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:29,740
first started studying HCI and I also

00:02:27,819 --> 00:02:31,480
was a big part at part of this community

00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:33,100
so one of my first experiences with the

00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:34,930
internet was that I discovered Star Trek

00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:38,290
fan fiction on Usenet when I was a

00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:40,780
teenager and I've always found this

00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:43,360
community to be really remarkable both

00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:45,550
in terms of the massive amounts of

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:50,440
user-generated content that it's

00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:53,590
creating and also the general positive

00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:54,940
atmosphere of the social community which

00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:57,910
i think is quite different than a lot of

00:02:54,940 --> 00:03:01,330
things we see online today another

00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:03,790
important thing to know about the fan

00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:05,050
fiction community and also other kinds

00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:07,959
of fan works in this community like

00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:11,320
remix videos and art is that this did

00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:13,870
not begin with the internet so you can

00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:16,720
trace fanfiction back to Star Trek

00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:18,430
themes or even earlier I mean you can

00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,040
really go back to like Jane Austen

00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:23,440
Sherlock Holmes the book clubs but what

00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:26,049
we think of as traditional media fandom

00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,600
today really took off with Star Trek and

00:03:26,049 --> 00:03:30,100
so people were making fanzines and

00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,829
stapling them together and mailing them

00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:36,810
to each other for a very long time and

00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:40,480
then Usenet became quite a popular

00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:43,239
platform and it really changed the

00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,730
community allowed it to disseminate very

00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:49,360
broadly and to bring a lot more people

00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:51,370
together the community has migrated

00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,670
across many different online platforms

00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:58,120
over time yahoo groups were quite

00:03:54,670 --> 00:04:01,030
popular in the early 2000s and then led

00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:04,440
journal was a hugely popular platform

00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:07,900
for this community in the mid-2000s

00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:10,030
and I want to focus on that for a moment

00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:12,660
because I am basically tracing the

00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:15,220
history of our kind of our own here and

00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:19,329
LiveJournal is really important because

00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:21,220
in 2007 two things

00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:24,580
happened regarding LiveJournal that

00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:27,699
ended up kicking off a larger movement

00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:29,979
in the community so the first one was

00:04:27,699 --> 00:04:33,090
that livejournal made some policy

00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:35,560
changes but the fandom community saw as

00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:38,409
unwelcoming to their community it had to

00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:42,550
do with definitions of adult content for

00:04:38,409 --> 00:04:45,969
one day um but more egregiously than

00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:50,379
that the platform just deleted a huge

00:04:45,969 --> 00:04:54,039
swath of fandom related journals without

00:04:50,379 --> 00:04:56,169
any warning and this was called strike

00:04:54,039 --> 00:04:59,080
through 2007 and the community it was

00:04:56,169 --> 00:05:01,960
this really big deal and they saw this

00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:05,370
as a sign that the platforms that they

00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:07,210
were using were not built for it then

00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:10,060
something else happened around the same

00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:13,840
time so this was right when YouTube was

00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:15,940
getting really popular and I can imagine

00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:19,029
that around this time there were a lot

00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:22,029
of VC meetings trying to build the next

00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:28,289
YouTube right user-generated content was

00:05:22,029 --> 00:05:31,779
really taken off and there was a brief

00:05:28,289 --> 00:05:34,449
venture to try to commercialize fan

00:05:31,779 --> 00:05:38,589
fiction so there was a website created

00:05:34,449 --> 00:05:39,129
called fan Lib and the idea was oh my

00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:41,169
gosh

00:05:39,129 --> 00:05:43,029
all of these women have been creating

00:05:41,169 --> 00:05:44,680
fan fiction for the past thirty years

00:05:43,029 --> 00:05:48,669
and no one's been making money off of it

00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:50,979
how can we make money off of this and

00:05:48,669 --> 00:05:54,310
and as I as I just mentioned

00:05:50,979 --> 00:05:57,599
women but traditionally the demographics

00:05:54,310 --> 00:06:01,449
of a fan fiction community has been

00:05:57,599 --> 00:06:02,830
hugely women and as you can see they did

00:06:01,449 --> 00:06:06,069
not have a great idea for their

00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:09,460
demographic because they adhere like

00:06:06,069 --> 00:06:11,229
shows a man getting getting muscles

00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:14,169
because he starts posting his fan

00:06:11,229 --> 00:06:15,759
fiction on on fan live I guess there

00:06:14,169 --> 00:06:17,560
wasn't there was not a single woman

00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:22,050
involved in the creation of the site not

00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:24,610
on the board etc and it also really

00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:26,770
butted up against the strong social

00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:30,219
norms of the community against

00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:32,770
commercializing my dissertation work was

00:06:30,219 --> 00:06:35,080
actually about copyright and remix

00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:37,449
so a lot of what I what I looked at were

00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:39,099
the the gift economy of fandom and the

00:06:37,449 --> 00:06:41,229
norms are on copyright anyway it suffice

00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:44,530
it to say this was this was also not

00:06:41,229 --> 00:06:47,199
built for them so there was this idea in

00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:49,720
the community that the platform's they

00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,490
were using didn't welcome them that

00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:55,360
other platforms were coming and trying

00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:59,680
to exploit them and so around that same

00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:02,919
time someone wrote a blog post

00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:06,849
well this on LiveJournal of course and

00:07:02,919 --> 00:07:09,159
basically said I know we have project

00:07:06,849 --> 00:07:12,669
managers in this community and coders

00:07:09,159 --> 00:07:14,860
and designers can't we do this seriously

00:07:12,669 --> 00:07:16,780
we can come up with a site that we miles

00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:18,460
better and more attractive to fanfic

00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:21,310
writers and readers than anything out

00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:27,220
there because we actually use it we need

00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:29,800
a central archive of our own for those

00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:32,139
of you who might be familiar with her

00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,789
this is actually the science fiction

00:07:32,139 --> 00:07:37,570
writer Naomi Novik

00:07:33,789 --> 00:07:40,150
she was also getting a PhD in computer

00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:41,919
science for a while before she became a

00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:44,500
full-time writer and was a very

00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,070
well-known fanfiction writer in the

00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,960
community

00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:48,460
um I interviewed her as part of my work

00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,780
and she gave me permission to use her

00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:51,780
real name because this is not a secret

00:07:52,380 --> 00:08:00,300
you know most ideas like this don't go

00:07:56,949 --> 00:08:03,400
much farther than ideas this is quite

00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:07,690
quite an undertaking we are going to

00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:11,969
build a brand new platform that will do

00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:16,180
what live journal is not doing for us um

00:08:11,969 --> 00:08:20,770
but what this resulted in is archive of

00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:23,500
our own this is what the Internet's is

00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:26,409
what the interface looks like it's a fan

00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:29,159
created fan run nonprofit non-commercial

00:08:26,409 --> 00:08:32,620
archive for transformative fan works

00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:34,270
mostly fan fiction um you can post other

00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:38,229
works there though it doesn't currently

00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:41,469
host things like video to give you a

00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:46,000
sense of of what this looks like in

00:08:41,469 --> 00:08:48,520
general it launched in 2008

00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,950
the basic gist is that you can find

00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:54,400
stories here from literally any source

00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:57,220
material you can possibly think of from

00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:59,830
several hundred thousand stories set in

00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:01,300
the Marvel Universe to at least one

00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:04,600
story about anthropomorphize

00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:06,580
universities I looked last night there

00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,270
are a few stories about the mozilla

00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:14,800
firefox'

00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:17,440
on there yes maybe don't look them up um

00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:20,220
but basically anything you can possibly

00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,930
think of there is there is work here

00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:25,660
so this is actually a slide from when I

00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:27,430
from when I did this presentation quite

00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:29,080
like this almost exactly a year ago

00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:31,570
because I wanted to give you a sense of

00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:34,750
how fast the site is growing as well as

00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:40,750
how how big it is

00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:43,150
so last year around this time about 1.5

00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:46,720
million users and almost 4 million works

00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:48,370
as of last night exactly 2 million users

00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:52,000
I don't know when this happened it was

00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:56,550
exciting and nearly 5 million works now

00:09:52,000 --> 00:10:00,010
so this is huge I mean this is a

00:09:56,550 --> 00:10:04,200
user-generated content platform and most

00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:07,510
remarkably it is designed developed

00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:11,740
maintained entirely by people in this

00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:13,990
community as I mentioned previously the

00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:16,960
fanfiction community is predominantly

00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:20,980
women and the data that I'm about to

00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:24,930
show you is from a census that a fan

00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:27,670
took of archived our own community in

00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:31,780
2013 though I've done some survey work

00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:35,680
since then on fandom generally and my

00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:40,240
findings are quite similar to this so

00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:43,890
for example more people on a o3 identify

00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:48,100
as genderqueer than identify as sis male

00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:51,070
and as you can see here mostly female

00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:56,269
identified there are also a very large

00:10:51,070 --> 00:11:01,970
number of queer people and in

00:10:56,269 --> 00:11:06,139
so if you look at sexuality and here we

00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:08,959
saw about 30 percent of respondents

00:11:06,139 --> 00:11:10,790
identified as heterosexual and my more

00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:17,810
recent survey work it was more like

00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:20,930
twenty twenty two percent um so I was

00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:22,930
very interested in this community and in

00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:26,240
particular in our kind of our own

00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:29,300
because of this idea that a community

00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:31,300
could build its own thing decide what it

00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:35,329
wanted to me make all of the decisions

00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:36,680
and that it was being created by groups

00:11:35,329 --> 00:11:41,779
of people that are traditionally

00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:47,420
underrepresented in computing so I'm

00:11:41,779 --> 00:11:49,100
going to tell you a story in general but

00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:52,190
most of the things that I'm talking

00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:56,300
about here came from an interview study

00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:58,399
that I conducted in 15 in 2015 with a

00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:00,139
number of people who worked on the

00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:03,709
development of the site as well as users

00:12:00,139 --> 00:12:07,610
etc I've also done a few large-scale

00:12:03,709 --> 00:12:09,500
surveys since then about platforms on

00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:14,510
fandom in general some of this data

00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:17,630
comes from there as well one of the most

00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:21,319
striking things about decisions early on

00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:25,850
in the development of the archive was

00:12:21,319 --> 00:12:29,510
that there was an idea that this is our

00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:33,529
front page of the Internet this is a fan

00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:37,639
of community it is for us by us we

00:12:33,529 --> 00:12:40,220
support everyone and in particular the

00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:42,139
way that Naomi put it to me was how are

00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:44,660
we gonna get enough people to not just

00:12:42,139 --> 00:12:47,600
build this thing but maintain it we're

00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:49,779
going to have to grow our own this was

00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:53,089
really critical because there was a

00:12:49,779 --> 00:12:57,949
initial value based decision to not

00:12:53,089 --> 00:12:59,870
bring in outside developers that it was

00:12:57,949 --> 00:13:01,970
extremely important that it was built

00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:04,250
and designed by people who were already

00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:05,660
part of this community and that if there

00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,179
weren't enough of them they were gonna

00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:12,549
create

00:13:07,179 --> 00:13:16,729
it is open source this is the current

00:13:12,549 --> 00:13:19,399
github page for the archive um anyone

00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:23,539
can put in put in a pull request but

00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:27,439
again the core group of developers are

00:13:23,539 --> 00:13:32,529
mostly volunteers who are in this

00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:36,259
community um they also built a

00:13:32,529 --> 00:13:38,449
non-profit around the archive to support

00:13:36,259 --> 00:13:40,219
it as well as some other project is

00:13:38,449 --> 00:13:42,829
called the organization for

00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:44,719
transformative works I am on the legal

00:13:42,829 --> 00:13:46,789
committee for this organization have

00:13:44,719 --> 00:13:49,549
been for quite a while though I've not

00:13:46,789 --> 00:13:52,879
had any I've not had any interaction

00:13:49,549 --> 00:13:56,599
with the development of the archive so

00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:58,069
I'm gonna go through a few design things

00:13:56,599 --> 00:14:00,439
about the archive that I think are

00:13:58,069 --> 00:14:03,469
really interesting from a designing for

00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:07,389
your own community standpoint though one

00:14:03,469 --> 00:14:13,819
of those actually starts with philosophy

00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:16,729
first so there is as I'm sure a lot of

00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:19,299
you know sometimes in the geek culture

00:14:16,729 --> 00:14:24,349
community there's a lot of gatekeeping

00:14:19,299 --> 00:14:26,329
who constitutes a real geek etc it's

00:14:24,349 --> 00:14:28,579
very important to the kind of ethos of

00:14:26,329 --> 00:14:31,009
archive of our own that if you say

00:14:28,579 --> 00:14:32,839
you're a fan you're a fan you belong

00:14:31,009 --> 00:14:35,739
here whoever is reading this page but

00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:39,979
you have come across the site you are

00:14:35,739 --> 00:14:42,019
welcome here and one of the ways that

00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:44,899
this philosophy made its way into the

00:14:42,019 --> 00:14:49,519
design has to do with inclusivity and

00:14:44,899 --> 00:14:52,449
accessibility so for example archive of

00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:55,249
our own is a remarkably accessible

00:14:52,449 --> 00:14:59,089
website particularly when it comes to

00:14:55,249 --> 00:15:02,469
working with screen readers so though

00:14:59,089 --> 00:15:05,629
this was a very small development team

00:15:02,469 --> 00:15:08,059
it was extremely important that they

00:15:05,629 --> 00:15:10,489
caught this right at the first um from

00:15:08,059 --> 00:15:12,859
the beginning and a number of people

00:15:10,489 --> 00:15:14,100
that I talked to both the developers

00:15:12,859 --> 00:15:16,769
mentioned

00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:19,740
as it says here everything had to be

00:15:16,769 --> 00:15:21,300
accessible otherwise it's not added they

00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:23,819
had people with assistive technology

00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:25,889
provide feedback and users that I talked

00:15:23,819 --> 00:15:27,810
to also mentioned this is being

00:15:25,889 --> 00:15:32,040
important someone mentioned their mother

00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:34,259
who has vision problems and that there

00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:37,579
was thought she saw built-in Te'o 3 in a

00:15:34,259 --> 00:15:40,880
way that wasn't in other websites

00:15:37,579 --> 00:15:45,930
another way that they try to be

00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:48,360
accessible is that there is support for

00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:49,769
works on the site being in many

00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:52,470
different languages

00:15:49,769 --> 00:15:55,829
there aren't automated translation tools

00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:59,040
but a small army of volunteers have

00:15:55,829 --> 00:16:01,230
translated all of the documentation on

00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:04,019
the site into many different languages

00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:06,569
and again there's support for posting

00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:09,930
fanfiction and whatever language you

00:16:06,569 --> 00:16:12,209
like and also allowing users to

00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:14,130
translate other people's fanfiction and

00:16:12,209 --> 00:16:18,630
tying those together in the backend in a

00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:21,149
way that they are easily found um but

00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:24,180
the number one thing that people talk to

00:16:21,149 --> 00:16:26,670
me about in terms of the design is the

00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:31,649
search and tagging system on this

00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:34,439
archive which was built to address a few

00:16:31,649 --> 00:16:39,300
things that were very important in the

00:16:34,439 --> 00:16:42,779
community so this is a tag cloud that

00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:47,100
you see if you go to search by tags on

00:16:42,779 --> 00:16:50,579
the site one thing that was very

00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:53,250
important to the designers was that they

00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:56,459
were making no value judgments about

00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:58,589
what you call things if you think about

00:16:56,459 --> 00:17:02,069
search systems generally there's a

00:16:58,589 --> 00:17:05,039
typical trade-off right so either you

00:17:02,069 --> 00:17:08,100
limit how people can tag things so that

00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:09,900
search works very well or you don't

00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:11,220
limit how people can tag things but then

00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:13,199
search doesn't work that great because

00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:14,490
if you use weird words to describe

00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:17,579
things are you misspelled things they

00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:21,850
don't tie it together etc and so the

00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:25,720
solution to this is that they created

00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:27,459
system called tag wrangling it has

00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:30,400
turned the search system and archive of

00:17:27,459 --> 00:17:32,860
our own into a curated folksonomy which

00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:35,500
basically means you can call something

00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:38,980
whatever you want and behind the scenes

00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:42,309
there's a real person who is deciding

00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:47,020
where that fits into the taxonomy of

00:17:42,309 --> 00:17:52,900
tags so for example this shows is sort

00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:57,400
of wrangling back end for mermaid so if

00:17:52,900 --> 00:18:02,650
on your story you tag it with merpeople

00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:06,429
or mermaid Sherlock or what do I got a

00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:10,090
tag to tell you what's a mermaid there

00:18:06,429 --> 00:18:13,059
is a tag Wrangler whose job it is to tie

00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:18,159
all of those things to the term

00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:20,559
merpeople and these are volunteers they

00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:24,700
tend to be tied to a particular fandoms

00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:26,740
so like you know you love Harry Potter

00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:29,380
so much that like in your free time

00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:31,390
you're gonna be tag wrangling for for

00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:33,400
Harry Potter and a lot of people also do

00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:35,289
it for these more obscure fandoms just

00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,940
because they want to help the archive

00:18:35,289 --> 00:18:40,870
they want to make it better it does

00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:42,610
require a lot of labour but it's been 10

00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:44,830
years now and there has not been a

00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:47,710
problem with not having enough

00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:49,990
even as the archive grows because the

00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:53,679
people who are working on this do it

00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:56,740
because they love it so much they want

00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:59,230
to make it better and the other thing

00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:02,740
that that it's great about the search

00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:04,150
system is again it doesn't it doesn't

00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:07,000
make any judgments about what you can

00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:09,820
call something so for example one of the

00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,460
developers talked about this early

00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:14,500
decision and said we knew that people

00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:16,659
call things by different names if you

00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:19,360
wanted to write a Buffy spike Fick and

00:19:16,659 --> 00:19:21,940
you really wanted to call its Buffy we

00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,559
didn't want to stop you from doing that

00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:25,150
so thinking about how you manage

00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:27,280
creating tags for a particular

00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:29,830
potentially infinite universe source

00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:32,830
text and what people will want to say

00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:34,110
that's where the tagging system came

00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:37,740
from

00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:40,230
I spoke to a number of users who would

00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:45,540
compare and contrast this to other sites

00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:47,070
so for example on fanfiction.net you

00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:50,490
can't have a romantic relationship

00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:51,870
between more than two characters based

00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:54,270
on the way that you can do the tacking

00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:58,920
system so they would mentioned that kind

00:19:54,270 --> 00:20:02,160
of thing or you know I I was able to use

00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:04,380
the words to describe people in a way

00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:06,620
that I want in terms of gender or

00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:08,880
sexuality or whatever it happens to be

00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:12,210
if you want to read more about this

00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:15,500
there's actually a great recent story

00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:18,270
and wired by the internet language

00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:20,250
linguistic Russian McCullough about how

00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:25,440
fans are better than tech at organizing

00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:30,810
information online so this system has

00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:33,870
also resulted in some very purposeful

00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:36,210
design decisions around how you can

00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:39,200
search for things and how you filter

00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:42,300
things so another way of thinking about

00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:47,370
inclusivity is that you want everyone to

00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:50,460
feel welcome there and also safe

00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:54,930
fandom tends to have a fair number of

00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:59,160
people with disabilities or who are

00:20:54,930 --> 00:21:01,710
dealing with mental illness and there's

00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:04,620
a lot of discussion around content

00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:05,940
warnings trigger warnings etc in this

00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:11,550
community and it's something that's very

00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:14,100
important in designing the archive they

00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:16,500
took into account existing conventions

00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:18,720
and fandoms so if you go back ten years

00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:21,510
and look at stories that are being

00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,870
posted on LiveJournal one of the things

00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:27,090
that you would see is the same type of

00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:29,550
content warnings over and over again

00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:30,930
there started to become social norms in

00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:33,030
the community around things that you

00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:39,330
have to warn for basically trigger

00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:42,179
warnings and so when you when you look

00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:45,900
at stories in the archive you'll see a

00:21:42,179 --> 00:21:47,440
series of tags some of which are things

00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:50,830
you would expect like

00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:52,750
character relationships genre etc and

00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:55,390
you also see this one in bold here that

00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:59,200
says graphic depictions of violence

00:21:55,390 --> 00:22:02,470
that's one of their required warnings so

00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:04,570
there's a set of warnings that are more

00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:06,280
than are listed here that are things

00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:08,440
that the community has decided you

00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:12,070
should always be warned if that's in the

00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:13,750
story and so when you post something it

00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:17,200
will say are any of these things here

00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:18,910
and then you can choose to say choose

00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,070
not to use our type warnings

00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:22,660
maybe you're unsure if it applies maybe

00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:25,030
you don't wanna spoil the story maybe

00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:26,860
you just do whatever it is you don't

00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:29,380
have to but then it basically becomes a

00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:31,930
read at your own risk

00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:35,560
kind of situation which the community

00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:38,890
quite appreciates and then actually a

00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:41,650
feature that they added I think only

00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:44,020
three or four years ago because of great

00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:47,290
demand with the ability to basically

00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:50,020
blacklist certain tags so when you're

00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:52,330
searching you can exclude whatever you

00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:55,330
want to exclude so that it doesn't show

00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:59,310
up in your search warnings these icons

00:22:55,330 --> 00:23:01,210
here represent different things that

00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:02,230
conventions that in the community were

00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:06,010
important when you're searching for

00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:08,250
stories so the little exclamation point

00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:10,420
means there's a required warning here

00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:12,580
the exclamation point question mark

00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:15,970
means know if there is read at your own

00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:21,400
risk rating type of romantic

00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:23,500
relationship etc um so another thing

00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:26,470
that's quite interesting about the way

00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:28,660
that archive of our own came to be and

00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:31,480
that the community has progressed over

00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:33,600
time at that as I mentioned earlier

00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:35,710
there has been kind of a migration

00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,780
across platforms so a lot of these

00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:42,690
conventions have been picked up over

00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:45,690
time a couple of years ago I did a

00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:50,860
large-scale survey where I asked people

00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:52,450
what platforms they used oh I was only

00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:54,580
looking for people who had been part of

00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:56,410
this community for 10 years or more and

00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:59,200
so it was quite a large swath of time

00:23:56,410 --> 00:24:01,190
and I know you probably can't see this

00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,990
very well but so there's a

00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:04,850
a red bump that goes off and then drops

00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:09,440
off fairly precipitously that is

00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:11,660
LiveJournal and there's two lines that

00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:14,030
kind of go like this

00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:20,120
best friends forever are kind of our own

00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:23,570
and tumblr but you can see that a lot of

00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:25,850
the platforms here have dropped off and

00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:28,310
stops being used over time and even

00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:31,700
worse sometimes things just disappear

00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:35,150
from the internet like Geocities there

00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:37,340
were a ton of fanfiction archives on geo

00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:42,440
cities and then one day BAM they're just

00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:44,480
gone right so another thing that's been

00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:47,870
very important to the fan fiction

00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:50,030
community is preservation preservation

00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:53,450
of content so that it doesn't disappear

00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:56,570
forever like if Geocities goes away and

00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:58,640
also preservation of their history so

00:24:56,570 --> 00:25:02,180
for example also around the same time

00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:04,250
around 2006-2007 YouTube becomes a thing

00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:06,950
suddenly there are all of these news

00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:09,800
articles about this amazing new art form

00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:13,910
of remix videos that have apparently

00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:15,680
been invented by men and a lot of people

00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:18,170
in the fan community were like wait wait

00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:22,250
wait women have been doing this since

00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:24,380
the 80s using VCRs and so there was also

00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:26,840
this idea that we didn't want the

00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:30,860
history of fandom particularly as a type

00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:33,500
of women's work to be erased um so one

00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:35,000
thing with the archive did to address

00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:38,480
this particular problem is something

00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:42,170
called open doors and it will allow

00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:44,030
anyone who has a who has a fanfiction

00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:45,680
archived or who knows of one to

00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:49,310
basically allow the content to be

00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:51,350
imported quite easily and to be sucked

00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:55,100
in wholesale to the archive given its

00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:56,990
own space they have a way of contacting

00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:59,390
authors to make sure they don't have a

00:25:56,990 --> 00:26:01,280
don't have a problem with that and

00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:05,480
they've managed to basically rescue a

00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:10,070
bunch of archives in this way however

00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:12,320
this value towards preservation also can

00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:14,929
butt up against another really

00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:20,240
valuing fandom which is control over

00:26:14,929 --> 00:26:21,769
your own content so for example as one

00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,360
of the developers told me a lot of

00:26:21,769 --> 00:26:25,370
people wanted the feeling

00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:27,679
early on that they could wipe out their

00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:29,389
Finnish identity in an instant if they

00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:31,399
had to they wanted to be able to

00:26:29,389 --> 00:26:33,889
disappear which becomes considerably

00:26:31,399 --> 00:26:36,529
more difficult on the internet very

00:26:33,889 --> 00:26:38,929
frequently you wipe out entire swathes

00:26:36,529 --> 00:26:41,000
of the community's history with you so

00:26:38,929 --> 00:26:44,720
basically the idea is if you decide that

00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:48,049
you want your fandom identity which is

00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:50,350
always sued anonymous people infinite

00:26:48,049 --> 00:26:53,539
and rarely go by their real names and

00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:56,690
you should definitely be able to do that

00:26:53,539 --> 00:26:59,990
and so people were deleting all of their

00:26:56,690 --> 00:27:02,149
work you know from the internet in order

00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:05,960
to disconnect it from their from their

00:27:02,149 --> 00:27:07,669
vanished identity but as a result it you

00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:09,860
know destroyed some of the community

00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:12,049
history so a design feature that they

00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:15,500
built in in the very beginning on is

00:27:12,049 --> 00:27:19,370
something called orphanage um which

00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:21,710
leaves stories on the archive but posted

00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:25,490
with no connection to a real person or

00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:27,139
even a pseudonym if you decided that you

00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:28,850
wanted to delete your identity on

00:27:27,139 --> 00:27:31,519
Facebook or Twitter all of your content

00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:35,179
would go with it right so this allows

00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:38,269
you to disconnect your identity from the

00:27:35,179 --> 00:27:42,649
work entirely but to not destroy the

00:27:38,269 --> 00:27:45,919
work itself there are some other really

00:27:42,649 --> 00:27:48,799
interesting features to mitigate these

00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:51,769
kinds of tensions there's the ability to

00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:53,509
tie multiple pseudonyms together and

00:27:51,769 --> 00:27:55,159
understanding that people and fandom

00:27:53,509 --> 00:27:56,450
have used multiple platforms over time

00:27:55,159 --> 00:27:59,830
and sometimes people have different

00:27:56,450 --> 00:28:02,809
identities across them a lot of really

00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:04,700
interesting design decisions some of

00:28:02,809 --> 00:28:07,279
which are specifically built to either

00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:11,509
reflect the values of the community or

00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:15,860
to mitigate these value tensions um and

00:28:11,509 --> 00:28:19,090
all of this design again was done by

00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:22,580
people who are part of this community

00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:25,180
because of these values because of

00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:27,370
issues of empowerment

00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:30,460
Civet II preserving values and cultures

00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:34,450
they really prioritized training up fans

00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:36,070
to do the work um this was not actually

00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:38,740
all that surprising to me because I'd

00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:40,180
been hearing stories about people

00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:44,980
learning technical skills and fandom for

00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:47,800
a really long time so for example one of

00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:50,230
my interview participants said that she

00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:52,660
taught herself Python because she wanted

00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:54,550
to program a stupid little program that

00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:57,100
would list different characters and give

00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:59,680
her like a romantic pairing at random to

00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:02,400
write stories about so she taught

00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:05,950
herself Python just so she could do that

00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:10,390
and she said because fandom was there it

00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:14,500
gave me an incentive so you take this

00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:16,780
and you bump it up a step further and I

00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:18,910
also talked to you a number of

00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:20,590
developers of the of the archive in fact

00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:23,290
at the time ended these interviews the

00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:25,330
lead developer had not known how to code

00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:28,840
before she started working on the

00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:30,580
archive um when it first came out she

00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:33,370
said I thought it was a great idea I

00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:36,100
wanted it to become a reality and I

00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:37,660
thought I'd be able to help I wanted to

00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:40,480
learn Ruby on Rails would probably

00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:42,310
wouldn't have been able to on my own so

00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,350
ao3 gave me the possibility to learn

00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:48,220
technical skills and in turn I would

00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:51,160
help build the archive um I heard from

00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:55,420
many people who for example started out

00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:57,340
as bug testers or tag Wranglers who

00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:59,380
would see what was happening get

00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:02,980
interested start asking questions and

00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:09,010
then slowly get more involved with the

00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:11,820
coding and I also heard from a number of

00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:14,410
the developers who would then directly

00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:17,620
contrast this with example to

00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:19,810
open-source communities one person noted

00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:22,120
that it was really empowering she'd come

00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:25,150
in with zero experience and there was

00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:29,100
this attitude that everyone can learn

00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:31,450
and could be helped and one person

00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:32,870
specifically contrasting this to her

00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:35,629
experience

00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:37,940
in open-source communities said people

00:30:35,629 --> 00:30:40,460
are allowing you to fail and make

00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:41,080
mistakes they know that it's a labor of

00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:44,059
love

00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:46,490
so they encourage you to get better

00:30:44,059 --> 00:30:51,320
without being like you're being terrible

00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:55,789
it's a little more loving of course you

00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:57,490
know a lot of research around some open

00:30:55,789 --> 00:30:59,929
source communities and even Wikipedia

00:30:57,490 --> 00:31:02,570
etc that we see it's sort of acrimonious

00:30:59,929 --> 00:31:04,519
environment where sometimes the best way

00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:06,279
to show how great you are is to tell

00:31:04,519 --> 00:31:10,850
every well it's how terrible they are

00:31:06,279 --> 00:31:13,730
this was basically the opposite and one

00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:15,889
of the reasons was that as one person

00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:17,450
put it everyone involved in the running

00:31:15,889 --> 00:31:20,139
and creating of a site was there because

00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:20,139
they loved it

00:31:20,809 --> 00:31:24,350
we're not gonna change something because

00:31:22,639 --> 00:31:26,869
we think it'll help advertisement we're

00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:28,490
gonna change it because it involves a

00:31:26,869 --> 00:31:30,980
different feature of the site that

00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:34,869
doesn't doesn't benefit fans the whole

00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:37,820
thing is a labor of love and I also

00:31:34,869 --> 00:31:41,090
heard echoes of this and the many users

00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:44,419
that I talked to you about how different

00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:48,679
this is and every other platform that

00:31:44,419 --> 00:31:50,929
they use they really trust that the site

00:31:48,679 --> 00:31:53,029
has their best interests at heart

00:31:50,929 --> 00:31:54,710
that they're not going to do things that

00:31:53,029 --> 00:31:56,149
will harm their community and part of

00:31:54,710 --> 00:32:00,350
the reason is because the people who are

00:31:56,149 --> 00:32:04,279
building it are then um something that

00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:07,279
I've been thinking about lately is where

00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:09,559
this community continues to go not just

00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:14,330
ao3 but fanfiction communities in

00:32:09,559 --> 00:32:20,210
general so this data is from is from

00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:22,789
2018 but I suspect that if we even push

00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:26,869
it a little bit farther we might start

00:32:22,789 --> 00:32:28,999
to see a bit of a climb for tumblr some

00:32:26,869 --> 00:32:32,570
of the interview data that I have is

00:32:28,999 --> 00:32:35,450
basically full of why tumblr is not as

00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:37,519
well loved as archive of our own so

00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:39,740
archive of our own does not have

00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:42,179
features for social interaction which

00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:46,110
was a very specific

00:32:42,179 --> 00:32:48,720
and and so tumblr has kind of become the

00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:52,289
place for social interaction in me in

00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:53,100
the absence of that on on a three but

00:32:52,289 --> 00:32:57,659
right now

00:32:53,100 --> 00:33:03,690
basically there's nowhere to go and this

00:32:57,659 --> 00:33:08,369
became really striking just about last

00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:14,119
December when we saw Tim blurs policy

00:33:08,369 --> 00:33:18,179
change an adult content ban which has a

00:33:14,119 --> 00:33:22,019
market impact on fandom in particular um

00:33:18,179 --> 00:33:23,639
and as as I heard about this story and I

00:33:22,019 --> 00:33:26,519
started seeing reactions to it it just

00:33:23,639 --> 00:33:32,460
felt like deja vu so what had happened

00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:36,029
to ly journal in 2007 and actually if

00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:39,659
you look back at this graph you'll see

00:33:36,029 --> 00:33:43,369
that well you probably can't actually

00:33:39,659 --> 00:33:46,499
see the numbers but the live journal

00:33:43,369 --> 00:33:47,820
policy changed happened in 2007 and it

00:33:46,499 --> 00:33:51,440
doesn't actually start to quite

00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:54,450
precipitously fall until about 2010

00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:56,600
which was around the time that archive

00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:59,879
of our own and tumblr start to rise

00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:03,720
there needed to be there needed to be a

00:33:59,879 --> 00:34:09,899
viable alternative option in order for

00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:12,240
people to leave and I've been having

00:34:09,899 --> 00:34:14,369
conversations myself and my PhD students

00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:16,700
lately with uh with people in Sandom

00:34:14,369 --> 00:34:19,200
about some of their concerns about

00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:21,950
social networks and tumblr in particular

00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:24,720
and there are some really common

00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:26,309
problems one of which is that tumblr

00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:28,409
does not have a granular privacy

00:34:26,309 --> 00:34:31,169
settings and it doesn't have sub

00:34:28,409 --> 00:34:33,030
communities um you know of all the

00:34:31,169 --> 00:34:35,790
things that keep like what people miss

00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:39,179
about about livejournal is that you

00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:41,790
could have your you know Harry Potter

00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:43,589
fanfiction community over here and your

00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:45,540
other you know anime fan fiction

00:34:43,589 --> 00:34:47,159
community over here you can have the one

00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:49,470
that's just for adult content that other

00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:51,179
people don't want to see over here and

00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:53,250
all of those communities can have their

00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:56,399
own social norms

00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:58,350
our own moderation practices and their

00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:01,440
own privacy settings so they can keep

00:34:58,350 --> 00:35:03,750
other people out one of the things that

00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:06,300
I that I study in addition to this is

00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:07,970
research ethics for public data and a

00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:11,720
lot of people in fandom are actually

00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:14,520
quite concerned about researchers

00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:16,530
looking at their content and also

00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:18,090
journalists because occasionally a

00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:20,010
journalist will be like oh wouldn't it

00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:22,080
be funny to like put something up on

00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:26,070
BuzzFeed about all this weird fanfiction

00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:29,810
stuff and if they're if they are

00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:32,880
interacting on tumblr there's no way to

00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:35,550
make it discoverable and visible to the

00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:38,970
community but not to people not in the

00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:41,760
community and around the time that a

00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:44,010
Tumblr's adult content ban happened

00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:47,570
myself and when I PhD students wrote the

00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:50,580
story about how even if tumblr falls

00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:53,070
bandim will not there will be something

00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:56,040
else though one of the problems is that

00:35:53,070 --> 00:36:00,030
we haven't quite found the something

00:35:56,040 --> 00:36:02,540
else yet one possibility that a lot of

00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:05,340
people were talking about is pillow fort

00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:09,720
which looks a bit like if live journal

00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:12,510
and tumblr had a baby and it but it's a

00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:15,000
it's a small group of developers without

00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:19,410
a ton of resources and particularly

00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:21,420
around the time that um tumblr did the

00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:23,670
adult content ban and a lot of people

00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:27,780
started saying oh gosh where are we

00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:32,000
gonna go next it kept crashing and I

00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:35,180
also I worry about this kind of

00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:38,250
initiative without the kind of

00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:41,430
grassroots huge movement behind it that

00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:43,830
a oh three had because one of the things

00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:44,640
that I saw when I talked to developers

00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:47,810
of ao3

00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:50,520
was that despite the massive success

00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:55,620
there have also been a lot of challenges

00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:57,990
along the way so the most obvious one is

00:36:55,620 --> 00:37:03,690
that this very resource-intensive

00:36:57,990 --> 00:37:04,570
to create something that's this big a o3

00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:07,070
is a

00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:09,050
nonprofit they work entirely on

00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:10,250
donations it was an extremely important

00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:14,450
value to them that they will never be

00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:16,340
advertising for example but even more so

00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:21,170
than like money to keep the server's up

00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:24,170
it's also the manpower there was a big

00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:26,210
problem with burnout among the

00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:28,850
development experts in particular at the

00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:32,330
beginning and part of the reason was

00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:34,340
because this decision to train up new

00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:36,070
people rather than to bring in expert

00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:39,740
developers meant that the experts were

00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:41,420
not only having to do expert things like

00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:44,210
you build new features in the archive

00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:46,700
they were also having to train new

00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:49,250
people and so I talked to a number of

00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:53,150
people who said you know this was great

00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:54,520
I loved it so much I just couldn't do it

00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:57,340
anymore

00:37:54,520 --> 00:38:00,310
since the time that I did this study and

00:37:57,340 --> 00:38:03,710
they have started on a very limited

00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:07,810
basis paying some outside developers

00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:11,150
though people that are quite well vetted

00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:15,650
by the community there's still this

00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:18,140
issue of training bottlenecks and in

00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:19,940
terms of other types of volunteer work

00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:23,870
so as I mentioned in order to make tog

00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:27,680
wrangling work there has to be really

00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:29,120
this army of volunteers and sometimes

00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:32,030
there can be issues with pockets of

00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:34,840
expertise like oh there's not someone to

00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:38,560
do this particular fandom or people are

00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:40,640
are spread out in ways that aren't that

00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:46,940
aren't conducive to making the whole

00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:50,290
thing work um but I think that these are

00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:53,840
the kinds of things that can be solved

00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:55,940
except really what's happened on ao3 it

00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:58,340
feels like a bit of a miracle I mean if

00:38:55,940 --> 00:39:00,290
you had asked me 10 years ago if this

00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:05,390
would work I would have been very

00:39:00,290 --> 00:39:08,120
skeptical it's taken a bit of magic and

00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:11,120
also a huge number of people who really

00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:13,970
really care and I think that this also

00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:16,330
has really significant implications for

00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:21,150
broadening participation

00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:24,400
in computing an open source in terms of

00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:26,410
giving a community the resources to

00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,660
build their own thing putting them in

00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:31,599
charge giving them the decisions but

00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:37,200
having some things to help like training

00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:40,450
for example and the outcome of this is a

00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:42,820
platform that is really valued by the

00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:46,590
community in ways that I do not see

00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:49,230
elsewhere so my favorite example of this

00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:51,790
um

00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:54,900
you often see people complaining about

00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:57,130
downtime for platforms right like

00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:58,599
Facebook's down for five minutes and

00:39:57,130 --> 00:40:01,750
everyone goes on Twitter to just act

00:39:58,599 --> 00:40:04,300
like their life is over right um when

00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:06,730
archive of our own goes down the common

00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:10,330
practice of the community is for it's

00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:12,240
for users to tweet cat pictures and tell

00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:14,650
the developers thank you for having me

00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:17,650
we know this must be hard for you to

00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:21,070
deal with right now here's some cats I

00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:22,540
think this is really indicative of some

00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:24,609
of the cultural things that are quite

00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:27,700
different about this platform than some

00:40:24,609 --> 00:40:29,710
other places we see um so I'm gonna end

00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:32,890
my talk there I wanted to make sure that

00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:35,740
I left a lot of time for questions I

00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:37,450
will note that I've had some excellent

00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:39,339
collaborators on this work and if you

00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:41,290
are the sort of person who likes to read

00:40:39,339 --> 00:40:43,240
academic papers I've also published a

00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:45,070
couple of things on this where you can

00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:47,140
read about some things in more detail

00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:51,400
Thanks

00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:54,260
[Applause]

00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:55,790
I'm gonna take advantage of physically

00:40:54,260 --> 00:41:01,100
being in the room to our first question

00:40:55,790 --> 00:41:03,830
and my question is about onboarding and

00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:05,090
particularly the that moment what I

00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:06,950
think is fascinating is there's this

00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:09,020
archive where there's sort of a very

00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:11,240
elaborate amount of participation and

00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:15,470
it's reasonably clear to me that the

00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:16,430
initial process is one of you start by

00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:18,800
reading right

00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:20,690
I assume very few people like you know

00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:23,270
they've like written this whole like I

00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:25,610
don't know Harry Potter Sherlock mashup

00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:27,770
well I mean not that I have but other

00:41:25,610 --> 00:41:29,300
people have and then they come in to put

00:41:27,770 --> 00:41:31,700
straight so they're really first what

00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:36,050
are the processes for that onboarding

00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:38,210
such that people start to contribute and

00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:39,740
then continue to contribute over a long

00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:43,100
time can you talk a little bit about

00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:44,900
that yeah I mean so so there's two kinds

00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:49,880
of contribution here so one is certainly

00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:56,510
just fanfiction like posting comments

00:41:49,880 --> 00:42:01,130
reading etc um I so I've talked to a lot

00:41:56,510 --> 00:42:03,170
of users over over many years and I've

00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:07,550
heard lots of stories about how you got

00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:10,370
started in in fanfiction it usually

00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:13,430
starts with reading and it also starts

00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:15,410
with being comfortable in the community

00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:18,440
such that you can kind of put yourself

00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:21,290
out there and part of that can have to

00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:23,210
do with seeing the positive feedback of

00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:28,130
the community to the work that's being

00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:29,990
done so Cecelia Aragon and her research

00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:31,730
group at University of Washington have

00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:35,510
been doing work related to

00:42:31,730 --> 00:42:40,100
fanfiction.net where they have done big

00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:42,320
data analyses of comments on fanfiction

00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:45,680
and the title of their first paper is

00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:50,030
thousands of positive reviews it is

00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:52,760
remarkable the contrast in the comments

00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:54,460
on fanfiction compared to the comments

00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:57,339
of basically everywhere else

00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:59,079
on the Internet and that's not to say

00:42:57,339 --> 00:43:04,540
it's all it's certainly not all rainbows

00:42:59,079 --> 00:43:07,359
and roses right but by and large the

00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:10,150
social norm of the community is to be

00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:13,690
positive to be constructive to build

00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:16,000
people up to help them etc and so seeing

00:43:13,690 --> 00:43:19,180
this makes people more comfortable with

00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:22,030
contributions of their own in terms of

00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:24,369
people who have moved into for example

00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:27,430
volunteer positions on the archive or to

00:43:24,369 --> 00:43:29,619
being more technical work I basically

00:43:27,430 --> 00:43:32,530
just hear stories about and I wanted to

00:43:29,619 --> 00:43:34,599
do more and I wanted to do more like I

00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:36,160
was posting fanfiction it was so great I

00:43:34,599 --> 00:43:38,349
was getting all this great feedback I

00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:41,020
really wanted to help so I started doing

00:43:38,349 --> 00:43:42,819
tag wrangling and then that got me more

00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:44,559
involved and then I started hanging out

00:43:42,819 --> 00:43:46,960
in the slack channel where coders were

00:43:44,559 --> 00:43:48,819
talking and then I wanted to get more

00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:50,530
involved and along the way they're

00:43:48,819 --> 00:43:54,609
getting there they keep getting positive

00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:56,500
feedback and they keep like feeling that

00:43:54,609 --> 00:43:58,569
they are part of the community and that

00:43:56,500 --> 00:44:00,400
it's I mean I've thought a lot about

00:43:58,569 --> 00:44:04,119
what can we learn for other online

00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:06,270
communities from the positive culture of

00:44:04,119 --> 00:44:10,780
fandom like how can we export this

00:44:06,270 --> 00:44:14,799
culture into other contexts and I don't

00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:17,680
I don't know I mean I I wish I had a

00:44:14,799 --> 00:44:21,640
good answer for you I mean I I have to

00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:26,140
say I wonder if part if if part of the

00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:28,150
answer is like it's mostly women which

00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:31,180
is not a particularly satisfying answer

00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:34,410
right but that certainly certainly could

00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:37,390
be part of it I also think just building

00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:39,730
social norms over a very long period of

00:44:37,390 --> 00:44:41,410
time there's lots of people in the

00:44:39,730 --> 00:44:42,880
fandom community who are sort of here to

00:44:41,410 --> 00:44:44,790
tell you how things should be and you

00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:48,579
don't do that

00:44:44,790 --> 00:44:50,170
but yeah I have a sneaking suspicion

00:44:48,579 --> 00:44:53,170
you're actually right about the most

00:44:50,170 --> 00:44:55,059
people yeah there's some research that I

00:44:53,170 --> 00:44:59,319
never got anybody yeah who to actually

00:44:55,059 --> 00:45:02,140
publish which I was told by a bird or

00:44:59,319 --> 00:45:03,609
something which was saying that they

00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:06,480
looked at the most successful

00:45:03,609 --> 00:45:06,480
yahoogroups

00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:09,690
over a course of something like 12 years

00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:12,300
when this was a thing right

00:45:09,690 --> 00:45:14,070
and the the one correlate they could

00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:15,690
find that with with success was having

00:45:14,070 --> 00:45:17,190
women moderators like that was the one

00:45:15,690 --> 00:45:18,950
thing they could find that they were

00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:24,510
like well okay now what do we do right

00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:26,100
yeah I have follow-up questions but I'm

00:45:24,510 --> 00:45:30,860
going to hold off because we have a

00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:33,180
question from Alan Jeffrey and he says

00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:34,950
what Pat seems to be trying to

00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:36,990
commercialize this space such as

00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:39,030
emphasizing links to Hollywood are you

00:45:36,990 --> 00:45:40,860
seeing a lot of uptake of what Pat and

00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:43,920
is it attracting a different community

00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:46,260
dinero yeah so that's that's a good

00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:49,110
question because to be clear there are

00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:49,710
other spaces for fan fiction than van

00:45:49,110 --> 00:45:53,700
ao3

00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:56,820
so fanfiction.net is the oldest and

00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:59,010
therefore has more works than than ao3

00:45:56,820 --> 00:46:04,260
the way of a3 is has grown much faster

00:45:59,010 --> 00:46:06,030
and Wattpad is another one there are

00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:08,880
some differences between the communities

00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:10,980
here so fanfiction.net skews much

00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:14,850
younger than ao3

00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:18,720
for example and what Pat tends to have

00:46:14,850 --> 00:46:20,760
some specific types of fandoms on it so

00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:23,970
the other thing is that the fanfiction

00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:25,890
community it's kind of like football

00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:28,410
fans where like there are some cultural

00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:29,460
similarities but like Broncos fans are

00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:32,610
gonna be slightly different than

00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:35,910
Patriots fans right um Wattpad

00:46:32,610 --> 00:46:39,500
traditionally has a lot of real person

00:46:35,910 --> 00:46:43,800
fan fiction particularly about boy bands

00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:46,380
and the community is slightly different

00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:49,770
and also because of some things that

00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:53,490
happened early on with Wattpad with the

00:46:49,770 --> 00:46:55,290
for example the novel after that was

00:46:53,490 --> 00:46:57,270
like published where they changed the

00:46:55,290 --> 00:47:02,400
names from being about one direction and

00:46:57,270 --> 00:47:05,010
two other random names and the culture

00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:08,280
there towards commercialism is slightly

00:47:05,010 --> 00:47:12,260
different than has been in sort of

00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:16,880
traditional fan fiction gift economy and

00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:21,920
so I you know I think they sort of

00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:24,529
serve slightly different audiences and I

00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:28,099
think that and what Pat also has both

00:47:24,529 --> 00:47:29,000
fan fiction and original fiction and so

00:47:28,099 --> 00:47:31,220
the way that they're able to

00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:33,500
commercialize is actually like they're

00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:36,859
actually commercializing the original

00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:39,319
work but sometimes that then leads to

00:47:36,859 --> 00:47:41,150
fan fiction like filing off the serial

00:47:39,319 --> 00:47:43,220
numbers for those of you who didn't know

00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:46,519
Fifty Shades of Grey was Twilight fan

00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:50,029
fiction which actually though not

00:47:46,519 --> 00:47:51,529
copyright infringement was a heavy norm

00:47:50,029 --> 00:47:53,150
violation of the community because

00:47:51,529 --> 00:47:54,859
people were quite upset that you would

00:47:53,150 --> 00:47:58,369
take something out of the gift economy

00:47:54,859 --> 00:48:00,230
of fandom and and and profit from it yes

00:47:58,369 --> 00:48:03,049
I would say that sites like watt pageant

00:48:00,230 --> 00:48:06,859
deserve slightly different purposes than

00:48:03,049 --> 00:48:09,380
three for example all right we have

00:48:06,859 --> 00:48:11,240
other questions in the rooms

00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:19,700
I have only one in Portland Vancouver

00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:22,009
Toronto San Francisco Mountain View so I

00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:24,410
think you mentioned briefly that there

00:48:22,009 --> 00:48:27,859
were some outside developers now being

00:48:24,410 --> 00:48:31,250
brought in to a three I guess I have two

00:48:27,859 --> 00:48:32,930
questions one is what's this how are

00:48:31,250 --> 00:48:34,640
those developers being funded I'm

00:48:32,930 --> 00:48:35,900
assuming there are I mean I don't know

00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:38,990
are there advertisements that are

00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:41,150
running on ao3 does that support

00:48:38,990 --> 00:48:44,779
developers if so if not what is the

00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:48,859
source of funding and I guess more

00:48:44,779 --> 00:48:51,529
generally what is the the way that ao3

00:48:48,859 --> 00:48:55,700
is able to pay for server costs right so

00:48:51,529 --> 00:48:58,519
um it is entirely donation based so

00:48:55,700 --> 00:49:00,049
there is an umbrella non-profit the

00:48:58,519 --> 00:49:02,420
organization for transformative works

00:49:00,049 --> 00:49:06,079
and has a fundraising drive a couple of

00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:08,809
times a year and from my understanding

00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:12,190
there's enough to you know keep the

00:49:08,809 --> 00:49:14,299
lights on it does things like pay for

00:49:12,190 --> 00:49:20,299
like the legal committee has done some

00:49:14,299 --> 00:49:22,130
work around trying to people sometimes

00:49:20,299 --> 00:49:23,720
people file trademarks some things that

00:49:22,130 --> 00:49:25,640
should not be trademarks and we have to

00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:28,730
pay money to fight any way that that

00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:30,170
sort of thing um and they had a they had

00:49:28,730 --> 00:49:32,420
enough of a surplus of it

00:49:30,170 --> 00:49:34,730
what were they were able to hire and I

00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:37,700
think one developer and not a lot it's

00:49:34,730 --> 00:49:39,650
not like a full-time but that was just

00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:41,539
so that there could be someone whose job

00:49:39,650 --> 00:49:43,849
it was to kind of keep things running

00:49:41,539 --> 00:49:46,460
but yeah the entire thing is is donation

00:49:43,849 --> 00:49:50,150
based and that's actually a very strong

00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:51,559
value it will never have ads and you

00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:53,930
know I you know I don't and I don't know

00:49:51,559 --> 00:49:58,279
what might happen if the donations drop

00:49:53,930 --> 00:49:59,450
off someday but also having some profit

00:49:58,279 --> 00:50:02,180
around it there are a number of other

00:49:59,450 --> 00:50:03,710
initiatives the ao3 is definitely the

00:50:02,180 --> 00:50:05,930
largest but there's a wiki called fan

00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:08,680
lore that is for like preserving fan

00:50:05,930 --> 00:50:12,109
history there's an academic journal

00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:15,769
transformative works and cultures and

00:50:12,109 --> 00:50:21,230
then the legal committee which is quite

00:50:15,769 --> 00:50:23,599
important because this is a type of

00:50:21,230 --> 00:50:25,789
creative work that has certainly had its

00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:27,380
copyright issues over the years and

00:50:25,789 --> 00:50:30,619
actually there's a very strong statement

00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:31,940
on the front page of ao3 that says we

00:50:30,619 --> 00:50:34,849
are for transformative works and

00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:36,079
transformative works are legal and so

00:50:34,849 --> 00:50:42,200
there's been a lot of movement in that

00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:44,269
space so I am no you go okay yeah so I

00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:46,400
had a question about your your take on

00:50:44,269 --> 00:50:47,660
the right to be forgotten and kind of

00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:49,730
cooperate with that so it's the right

00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:51,650
now it seems you only unlink the account

00:50:49,730 --> 00:50:54,440
but is it possible to also remove

00:50:51,650 --> 00:50:55,970
whatever you have written yes so you can

00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:58,940
certainly just delete anything that you

00:50:55,970 --> 00:51:02,240
want to delete and I will say that um

00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:05,269
you know is also quite an undertaking to

00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:07,279
make the archive gdpr compliant but you

00:51:05,269 --> 00:51:08,660
get in all of it and um and I'm actually

00:51:07,279 --> 00:51:10,309
I'm actually the only person on the

00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:14,210
legal committee that isn't a practicing

00:51:10,309 --> 00:51:16,069
lawyer or a law professor and like you

00:51:14,210 --> 00:51:18,410
know if you if you add it up like the

00:51:16,069 --> 00:51:19,759
consulting fees or what would be the

00:51:18,410 --> 00:51:21,819
consulting fees of people who are

00:51:19,759 --> 00:51:24,289
putting their volunteer time into this

00:51:21,819 --> 00:51:28,819
but yeah you can um the other thing that

00:51:24,289 --> 00:51:31,069
you can do so there is a single source

00:51:28,819 --> 00:51:35,599
of privacy which is that you can make a

00:51:31,069 --> 00:51:37,309
work only visible to logged in users as

00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:39,049
the other the other ways to deal with

00:51:37,309 --> 00:51:41,310
that yeah you can also just delete all

00:51:39,049 --> 00:51:44,260
your stuff

00:51:41,310 --> 00:51:46,870
so I want to ask a a difficult question

00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:49,510
not in the gotcha sense just a tricky

00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:54,670
thing which is one of the things that's

00:51:49,510 --> 00:51:56,830
notable about ao3 is the diversity and

00:51:54,670 --> 00:51:58,450
inclusivity and you were also talking

00:51:56,830 --> 00:52:01,120
about how very welcoming that that

00:51:58,450 --> 00:52:03,190
culture is and how positive it is how

00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:05,290
does that get reconciled with the sort

00:52:03,190 --> 00:52:08,310
of the callout culture that we're seeing

00:52:05,290 --> 00:52:11,530
about addressing issues of privilege and

00:52:08,310 --> 00:52:13,770
and questions of diversity there because

00:52:11,530 --> 00:52:15,580
I've definitely seen in other

00:52:13,770 --> 00:52:17,920
communities that's something people are

00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:19,390
wrestling with and admitting yeah how

00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:22,660
does that how does that work is that an

00:52:19,390 --> 00:52:24,940
issue it definitely is I said is that

00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:26,590
you know I tend to just speak quite

00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:30,400
positively but again it's not it's not

00:52:26,590 --> 00:52:33,820
all rainbows and and sunshine um so my

00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:35,410
my current PhD student Brianna did some

00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:38,110
has done some interviews over the past

00:52:35,410 --> 00:52:40,900
couple of years particularly with people

00:52:38,110 --> 00:52:43,420
in fandom who identify as queer about

00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:46,990
privacy and fandom as a support space

00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:48,430
and and these kinds of things and one of

00:52:46,990 --> 00:52:52,180
the things that is definitely becoming

00:52:48,430 --> 00:52:54,340
an issue is call-out culture butting up

00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:58,920
against for example privacy norms in

00:52:54,340 --> 00:53:02,050
fandom and this is indicative of a

00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:03,460
larger issue right now which is that

00:53:02,050 --> 00:53:06,760
people value different things

00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:09,460
differently and for example what's more

00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:11,650
important the intense privacy norms of

00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:13,330
fandom or calling someone out for Lakers

00:53:11,650 --> 00:53:15,640
their fanfiction that you think is

00:53:13,330 --> 00:53:18,700
racist because there have been issues of

00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:21,730
people being doxed in fandom because of

00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:23,140
being called out for something for the

00:53:21,730 --> 00:53:25,570
most part the people that we've spoken

00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:28,320
to like actually see this as a big

00:53:25,570 --> 00:53:32,980
problem but this is one of the things

00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:35,470
that basically Tumblr as a platform is

00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:38,070
making worse because there are no sub

00:53:35,470 --> 00:53:40,750
communities so on ao3

00:53:38,070 --> 00:53:42,220
there as I as I explained there's this

00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:45,190
read at your own risk

00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:47,260
kind of system I will say there are

00:53:45,190 --> 00:53:49,240
there are a number of people who

00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:51,820
disagree very strongly with the content

00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:53,770
policy of am-3 which is if it is legal

00:53:51,820 --> 00:53:57,700
you can post

00:53:53,770 --> 00:53:59,230
that decision was made for in my opinion

00:53:57,700 --> 00:54:01,420
quite good reasons which is that it

00:53:59,230 --> 00:54:03,670
means you don't draw a line anywhere

00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:06,160
based on a value judgment as a result

00:54:03,670 --> 00:54:08,800
there is a lot of content on eo3 that is

00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:12,070
frankly quite important but it is

00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:13,510
illegal and as someone on the legal

00:54:12,070 --> 00:54:15,640
committee I have seen the worst of it

00:54:13,510 --> 00:54:17,230
because when someone writes to us and

00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:18,760
says I'm going to call the FBI on you

00:54:17,230 --> 00:54:20,410
because of this fanfiction and gets sent

00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:24,070
to us and we're like okay who has to go

00:54:20,410 --> 00:54:26,410
look at it and so some people disagree

00:54:24,070 --> 00:54:29,590
quite strongly with that in an end and

00:54:26,410 --> 00:54:32,800
as a result and you know think the

00:54:29,590 --> 00:54:37,390
archive is not a good place that said

00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:39,580
where do you draw the line right but the

00:54:37,390 --> 00:54:42,190
but the issue on tumblr is that there's

00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:46,060
no really everything is bunched together

00:54:42,190 --> 00:54:50,170
you can't like go on tumblr and only

00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:53,170
interact with the people who you know

00:54:50,170 --> 00:54:54,820
will not find this content objectionable

00:54:53,170 --> 00:54:57,730
so I mean it's kind of mean these

00:54:54,820 --> 00:54:59,110
problems on a lot of platforms like to

00:54:57,730 --> 00:55:00,760
me the big problem with Twitter is that

00:54:59,110 --> 00:55:02,350
Twitter is not a community and so you

00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:04,210
have tons of communities with different

00:55:02,350 --> 00:55:10,990
norms all of whom are operating under

00:55:04,210 --> 00:55:12,580
the same policy and yeah I I think that

00:55:10,990 --> 00:55:16,000
in order to solve this problem

00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:17,950
so here wave my magic wand fanned on me

00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:20,050
it's a new social network that has

00:55:17,950 --> 00:55:22,960
granular privacy settings and sub

00:55:20,050 --> 00:55:25,390
communities and that would I think solve

00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:27,550
a lot of okay I think that would solve a

00:55:25,390 --> 00:55:34,150
lot of a lot of the problems okay I got

00:55:27,550 --> 00:55:38,530
two questions remotely we have Josh do

00:55:34,150 --> 00:55:41,890
you want to go first in Toronto sure um

00:55:38,530 --> 00:55:44,560
I I tried I was interested in

00:55:41,890 --> 00:55:46,450
contributing code to ao3 maybe a year

00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:47,470
ago or so and I was surprised to find at

00:55:46,450 --> 00:55:50,020
the time there seemed to be a message

00:55:47,470 --> 00:55:52,330
that said we have enough developers we

00:55:50,020 --> 00:55:54,430
will ask for more when we need them and

00:55:52,330 --> 00:55:57,940
I was I'm curious how that relates to

00:55:54,430 --> 00:56:00,490
the stories of people being so driven to

00:55:57,940 --> 00:56:01,690
like make oh three better that like they

00:56:00,490 --> 00:56:03,280
learned the code and

00:56:01,690 --> 00:56:06,400
me through that way do you know if

00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:09,610
that's like a hole that happened yeah so

00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:12,670
I've heard about you know particularly

00:56:09,610 --> 00:56:16,540
now in the early days there were not as

00:56:12,670 --> 00:56:19,240
many people clamoring to help and I

00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:20,890
think I haven't been told about these

00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:23,860
things specifically but I have a feeling

00:56:20,890 --> 00:56:27,910
there have been a couple who have come

00:56:23,860 --> 00:56:30,190
in to help and have ended up not being

00:56:27,910 --> 00:56:31,840
good community members at least this is

00:56:30,190 --> 00:56:34,950
sort of I have heard through this

00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:40,150
implied to me and so I think there are a

00:56:34,950 --> 00:56:42,940
bit gun-shy about bringing in especially

00:56:40,150 --> 00:56:44,230
people where it's not like you can't

00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:45,940
point to like oh I've been writing

00:56:44,230 --> 00:56:49,420
fanfiction for the past ten years and

00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:51,280
here's my sort of community cred at

00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:54,970
least that would be my guess I mean as I

00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:56,620
said I feel like they're like they've

00:56:54,970 --> 00:57:00,070
had these problems with not having

00:56:56,620 --> 00:57:02,590
enough people to train and and and etc

00:57:00,070 --> 00:57:07,480
and in some ways that could be solved by

00:57:02,590 --> 00:57:10,050
like opening up more I don't know but I

00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:11,290
agree I think it's probably an issue

00:57:10,050 --> 00:57:13,240
okay

00:57:11,290 --> 00:57:17,590
Christopher Arnold you're in San

00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:19,770
Francisco and you should ask for

00:57:17,590 --> 00:57:19,770
questions

00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:36,960
oh yes cool thanks Twitter's the

00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:39,150
third-largest trend what people doing

00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:41,069
using Twitter as the hosting platform or

00:57:39,150 --> 00:57:45,089
as a table of contents or something else

00:57:41,069 --> 00:57:46,170
um social interaction and so the other

00:57:45,089 --> 00:57:48,359
interesting thing about sort of

00:57:46,170 --> 00:57:50,790
transformative fandom as a community is

00:57:48,359 --> 00:57:52,680
that there are two major functions so

00:57:50,790 --> 00:57:55,980
there's an archiving function and a

00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:57,630
social function and the different sites

00:57:55,980 --> 00:58:01,950
that were that were shown on that graph

00:57:57,630 --> 00:58:03,990
for example have served one or both

00:58:01,950 --> 00:58:07,920
so like live journal with both archive

00:58:03,990 --> 00:58:12,450
and social tumblr is only social am-3 is

00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:14,520
only archive and yeah Twitter and I will

00:58:12,450 --> 00:58:16,670
say that you know for example you will

00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:21,089
notice that Facebook was not on that

00:58:16,670 --> 00:58:23,630
graph and Facebook does have granular

00:58:21,089 --> 00:58:26,910
privacy settings and some communities

00:58:23,630 --> 00:58:32,339
however it requires you to use your real

00:58:26,910 --> 00:58:32,550
name and like that will never happen all

00:58:32,339 --> 00:58:44,339
right

00:58:32,550 --> 00:58:46,290
did we have another questions room and

00:58:44,339 --> 00:58:47,960
forgive me my allergies are getting the

00:58:46,290 --> 00:58:50,369
best of me today

00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:51,710
first thing just an observation what you

00:58:50,369 --> 00:58:55,410
were talking about earlier about

00:58:51,710 --> 00:58:57,829
education and culture and response to

00:58:55,410 --> 00:59:00,180
Joe fish's question it feels like

00:58:57,829 --> 00:59:02,430
Vietnam has already gone a long way

00:59:00,180 --> 00:59:04,020
towards some of the things that we've

00:59:02,430 --> 00:59:05,760
talked about in transformative justice

00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:07,530
and even from the if you look at the

00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:09,810
late eighties early 90s the critical

00:59:07,530 --> 00:59:13,170
Legal Studies movement which I find is

00:59:09,810 --> 00:59:15,240
fascinating the question I had is that

00:59:13,170 --> 00:59:19,500
you talked a lot about you talked some

00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:22,020
about archiving and I think most visible

00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:23,670
to you technologists is the work that

00:59:22,020 --> 00:59:25,500
the Internet Archive does so it's

00:59:23,670 --> 00:59:27,420
curious how you work with the Internet

00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:30,930
Archive or they even aware of what

00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:34,230
you're doing doing are they taking

00:59:30,930 --> 00:59:36,599
credit for what y'all are doing so I do

00:59:34,230 --> 00:59:40,490
know that we have our relationship with

00:59:36,599 --> 00:59:43,540
that they are certainly aware of us um I

00:59:40,490 --> 00:59:48,190
don't know a lot about like

00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:54,370
specific relationship there but as far

00:59:48,190 --> 00:59:56,260
as I know we're all friends I mean I

00:59:54,370 --> 00:59:57,700
think I would say that you know one

00:59:56,260 --> 01:00:00,040
thing about the Internet Archive is that

00:59:57,700 --> 01:00:01,900
it it doesn't do something that you

01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:04,360
asked about earlier which is which is

01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:06,340
being able to this strong value of being
