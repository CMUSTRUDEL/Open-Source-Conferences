	Designing Targeted, Automated De-escalation Strategies for Social Media
Libby Hemphill, Associate Professor, School of Information, University of Michigan

Harassment, insults, trolling, threats, and many other anti-social behaviors are toxic to conversations online. Reporting and addressing these behaviors requires a lot of time, labor, and emotional strain, and they're often ineffective. To move toward more effective methods to curb problematic behaviors such as harassment and hostility, I propose that we think about the problem differently in two ways. First, we must be more specific and explicit about the behaviors and content that are unacceptable in particular contexts so that we can design targeted mechanisms for addressing them and recognize the potential unintended impacts of our interventions. Second, we must treat problematic behavior as a social problem, not just an individual one, which demands that we address the contexts in which behavior occurs. To ground this discussion, I'll provide an example of a targeted mechanism for addressing personal insults and an experiment designed to reduce their prevalence in existing online communities.
