	Digital Patronage:  A New Media Ecosystem Supporting Creative Content

Abstract: Digital patronage is the act of delivering recurring direct support to content creators online. In this talk I define digital
patronage as a form of social support and examine why patrons engage in this behavior in the context of the live streaming platform Twitch. This mixed method research illustrates patronsâ€™ motivations, how patronage motivations differ from that of donations, and the motivational factors that are associated with higher levels of patronage. I will also highlight different approaches of how content creators manage patronage and discuss what this means for the design of patronage platforms and emergence of a new creative content economy.
