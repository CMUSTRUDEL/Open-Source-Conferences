Title: Emerging Technology Speaker Series - A New Media Ecosystem Supporting Creative Content
Publication date: 2019-09-10

Description: 
	Digital Patronage:  A New Media Ecosystem Supporting Creative Content

Abstract: Digital patronage is the act of delivering recurring direct support to content creators online. In this talk I define digital
patronage as a form of social support and examine why patrons engage in this behavior in the context of the live streaming platform Twitch. This mixed method research illustrates patronsâ€™ motivations, how patronage motivations differ from that of donations, and the motivational factors that are associated with higher levels of patronage. I will also highlight different approaches of how content creators manage patronage and discuss what this means for the design of patronage platforms and emergence of a new creative content economy.

Bio: Yvette Wohn is an assistant professor of Informatics at New Jersey Institute of Technology and director of the Social Interaction Lab (socialinteractionlab.com). Her research is in the area of Human Computer Interaction (HCI) where she studies the role of algorithms and social interactions in livestreaming, esports, gaming, and social media.

	00:00:02,659 --> 00:00:07,340
good morning good evening my name is Joe

00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:09,960
fish okay I am principal scientist and

00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:11,969
it is my pleasure today to introduce

00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:15,150
your vet one from the New Jersey

00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:17,640
Institute of Technology I'm delighted to

00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:19,230
see you vet come here we've been we've

00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,510
sponsored her research before as part of

00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:24,840
the mozilla research grants which as you

00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:25,619
all know is one of my deep loves but I

00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,510
think it's particularly interesting

00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:28,920
she's gonna be talking about not the

00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,179
work that we sponsored her to do she's

00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,600
going to away on two different projects

00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:36,059
but I think it gets a really core

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,219
question that we have within the company

00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:40,110
if you look at the problems of the

00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:42,600
internet right now so many of them are

00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:44,610
predicated on issues around privacy

00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:49,379
right issues around people knowing other

00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:51,510
people's data you look at the whole

00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:54,120
issues with Facebook you look at the

00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,860
data leaks these are all privacy issues

00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,780
well okay why why do we have these

00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:59,699
privacy issues well it's not just

00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,500
because people are nosy it's not because

00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:03,239
someone like wants to know what you had

00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,369
for breakfast because they like to know

00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:06,360
what people had for breakfast they want

00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:09,180
to know what you had for breakfast so

00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:11,520
they can sell you more stuff right the

00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:14,460
underlying problem is this advertising

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,020
driven approach to how the web is funded

00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:18,689
right now and that's why I think this

00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:20,130
work is quite so exciting right if we

00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:22,439
can fund if we can look at one

00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:24,509
particular ecosystem within the web that

00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:26,310
is supported through digital patronage

00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:27,689
that gives a very different model for

00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:30,210
what the future of the web might look

00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:31,950
like so that's why I'm really excited to

00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:33,659
see this happen that's why I'm really

00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:35,100
excited to hear about this work and

00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:39,930
that's why I'm so delighted to introduce

00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:41,820
you or to you that one thank you hi

00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:44,670
thank you for having me a thank you for

00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:48,659
those who are joining outside of the

00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:50,189
Mozilla HQ like Joe Fish said my name is

00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:52,079
Yvette and I'm a professor at New Jersey

00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:54,420
Institute of Technology and also

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:57,869
director of the social interaction lab

00:01:54,420 --> 00:02:00,180
and our research has been funded in part

00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:02,009
by Mozilla as well as the National

00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:05,790
Science Foundation and today I will be

00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:07,829
talking about digital patronage this is

00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:08,840
New Jersey Institute of Technology we're

00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:11,239
located

00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:13,550
in Newark New Jersey which is very

00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:16,400
famous for its Airport and also very

00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:18,319
close to New York these are some of the

00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,540
students in my lab I really love working

00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:21,920
with these students several students

00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:25,610
have also worked on the research I'm

00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:27,620
going to present today so my research in

00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:30,560
a nutshell is in the field of

00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:32,090
human-computer interaction and I try to

00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,880
understand how people use different

00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:37,220
social systems and those social systems

00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:40,910
can range from social media Facebook

00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:42,709
Twitter to online games live streaming

00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:46,250
which is what I'm going to be mainly

00:02:42,709 --> 00:02:47,810
talking about today and so I also look

00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:50,959
at the effect of using these social

00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:53,120
systems and so it's kind of a

00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:57,319
communication plus psychology plus

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:59,410
computing field one of my favorite

00:02:57,319 --> 00:03:02,480
lenses in which I look at research is

00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:05,349
social provision and this is a term that

00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:08,090
describes the exchange between people

00:03:05,349 --> 00:03:10,610
that happens with a system in between

00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:12,590
and social provision can be anything you

00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:14,930
can exchange emotions you can exchange

00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:16,850
information but you could also exchange

00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:20,690
money and all of those are linked

00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:22,540
together so what is what is patronage

00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:25,280
well according to the dictionary

00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:27,560
patronage is the action of a patron

00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,290
supporting encouraging a person

00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:32,420
institution worker art and if you look

00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:35,329
historically traditionally wealthy

00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:37,790
people or institutions have been patrons

00:03:35,329 --> 00:03:40,069
so for example in the Renaissance period

00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:42,950
you see the influence of the Medici

00:03:40,069 --> 00:03:46,489
family who have sponsored the

00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:47,560
development of music the invention of

00:03:46,489 --> 00:03:50,540
the piano

00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:53,930
they supported Galileo so science

00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:56,810
philosophy art and architecture so a lot

00:03:53,930 --> 00:04:00,100
of the beautiful artwork that we know

00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:04,579
from that period these are all funded by

00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:07,639
individual patrons so here we have the

00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:09,290
Mona Lisa on the Left we have Beethoven

00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:11,959
and on the right we have Christopher

00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:17,090
Columbus whose expeditions were

00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:19,370
primarily funded by Spain but it's not

00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:21,900
necessarily an old thing even today when

00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:26,580
we look at art for

00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:29,940
example we see major individuals who are

00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:34,020
patrons for example this is a broad one

00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:36,840
of the many broad broad museums funded

00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:39,030
by Eli Broad and then we also have the

00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:41,699
Getty Museum which houses a huge

00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:45,090
collection art collection by Getty

00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:47,490
so in some sense patronage is old its

00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:52,979
new it's been around for a very long

00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:55,500
time so what is digital patronage well

00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:57,389
digital patronage as I define it is

00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:00,270
people directly supporting content

00:04:57,389 --> 00:05:02,820
creators who are their own media

00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:06,449
entities and this is happening through

00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:09,600
these new online financial systems so we

00:05:06,449 --> 00:05:12,240
have systems such as twitch or patreon

00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:15,599
that allow people to post content and

00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,370
allow patrons to give money to them

00:05:15,599 --> 00:05:19,680
through the system and then there are

00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:21,960
also some direct financial system such

00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:25,880
as venmo or PayPal where people can

00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:28,710
directly transfer money to somebody else

00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:30,630
so what are the main characteristics of

00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:32,610
digital patronage well I think the most

00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:34,080
important thing is that it's recurring

00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:36,510
support it's not that you're giving

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:39,150
money one time to someone it's that

00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:42,720
you're doing so on a monthly or a weekly

00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:45,150
or a yearly basis and the second thing

00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:48,210
is that this enables the formation of

00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:51,479
communities around the Creator and so

00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:53,970
instead of being project based which is

00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:56,370
the essence of a lot of kind of

00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:58,979
crowdfunding that we saw seen such as

00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:01,169
Kickstarter IndieGoGo where people come

00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:03,780
together to pitch money to a project

00:06:01,169 --> 00:06:08,820
this is more about pitching money in to

00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:10,800
support a person this is a content

00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:14,270
creator his name is ninja he's a

00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:18,750
professional video game player and he

00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:21,720
broadcasts his video gameplay online he

00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:25,169
used to be one of the largest streamers

00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:27,900
live streamers on Twitch although he

00:06:25,169 --> 00:06:28,590
recently moved to another live streaming

00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:32,880
service called

00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:36,750
sir ninja just based on subscriptions of

00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:39,210
people who were paying money for content

00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:41,210
that he was providing for free just

00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:44,070
based on that he was making at least a

00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:46,110
million dollars a month these are

00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:49,200
somewhat old statistics that's from last

00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:51,990
year and the interesting thing here is

00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:55,410
that his content is completely for free

00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:58,620
so nobody has to pay but people choose

00:06:55,410 --> 00:07:01,440
to pay and the interesting thing is that

00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:04,470
it's not necessarily platform dependent

00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:07,860
so ninja recently moved to mixer like I

00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:11,010
mentioned before and his patrons

00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:14,310
followed him there so that was a very

00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:17,880
interesting phenomena and he is a very

00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:21,000
good example of a hugely successful case

00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:23,970
now of course not all people who create

00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:28,740
content and broadcast online are as

00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:31,020
successful as a ninja but there are also

00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:34,110
examples of small content creators who

00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:35,760
are also making some money through

00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:40,640
digital patronage this is Howard

00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:44,670
Rheingold he's a writer an artist and

00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:47,160
he's retired but he has this page on

00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:51,390
patreon where people subscribe to him

00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:54,240
for as little as $1 a month and he says

00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:57,360
it's not enough to completely live off

00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,730
of those earnings but he it's able to

00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:03,300
buy some of his art supplies and sustain

00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:04,440
some of his hobbies the really

00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,600
interesting thing about live streaming

00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:09,330
which is going to be the medium that I'm

00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:12,180
focusing on today is that it affords a

00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:14,760
lot of interaction between the content

00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:19,350
creator and the viewers so here's a

00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:21,330
screenshot from twitch and this woman is

00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:24,030
broadcasting and on the right side you

00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:26,190
see that people are posting live

00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:28,290
comments as the broadcast is happening

00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:32,220
and because of this interaction it

00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:34,530
creates a lot of intimate interactions

00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:39,600
between the content creator and the

00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:40,560
supporters we see a lot of really unique

00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,479
content

00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:45,600
happening on live streaming these are

00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:48,120
just a couple of examples from twitch

00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:52,019
where you see people in cosplay cooking

00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:55,139
or making music or drawing and these

00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:57,990
people probably not all of them are able

00:08:55,139 --> 00:09:00,029
to make living off of the patronage but

00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:03,059
it is providing a supplemental sort of

00:09:00,029 --> 00:09:05,550
income and this is very different from

00:09:03,059 --> 00:09:07,980
more traditional models where you have

00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:10,170
to be a very successful person with a

00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,850
lot of viewers to make money so of

00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:16,620
course there are examples of this this

00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:19,529
is a streamer who plays online games and

00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:22,829
she has received some sponsorship from

00:09:19,529 --> 00:09:25,379
Logitech and Acer tech companies and

00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:27,870
that is displayed on our screen so she's

00:09:25,379 --> 00:09:31,680
being paid to put those ads up on her

00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:34,199
stream but these kind of sponsorships or

00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:37,199
advertisements can only really work when

00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:39,930
you have a huge viewership which is for

00:09:37,199 --> 00:09:44,490
the majority of content creators not the

00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:46,470
case so there are various ways to

00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:48,509
support a content creator the first one

00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:50,790
is through direct donations by just

00:09:48,509 --> 00:09:53,899
giving them money and this could also be

00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:56,819
considered as a type of tipping behavior

00:09:53,899 --> 00:09:58,559
the second is monthly subscriptions and

00:09:56,819 --> 00:10:01,529
I think this is what is the key to

00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:04,709
making digital patronage this is where

00:10:01,529 --> 00:10:07,500
you provide money on a monthly basis to

00:10:04,709 --> 00:10:10,290
a content creator and the third is

00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:12,329
physical gifts we see a lot of people

00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:14,269
who like content creators actually

00:10:12,329 --> 00:10:17,459
sending them things through the mail and

00:10:14,269 --> 00:10:19,740
then finally we have an indirect support

00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:21,750
through charity streams so a lot of live

00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:23,670
streamers sometimes hosts streams where

00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:25,740
any money that they make during that

00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:31,589
time frame they donate to a specific

00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:32,970
cause and so when the patrons donate to

00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:36,269
the streamer that money isn't going

00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:40,160
directly to the streamer but it is still

00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:44,040
providing them with a lot of support

00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:45,749
this type of so called tipping behavior

00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,429
is very interesting in this context

00:10:45,749 --> 00:10:50,740
especially in live streams because it

00:10:47,429 --> 00:10:53,320
involves a lot of virtual gifts

00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:56,830
and in the US this has gotten a lot of

00:10:53,320 --> 00:11:00,550
traction but when it comes to virtual

00:10:56,830 --> 00:11:04,570
gifts really the market in China is

00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:07,810
really huge you see on the right side

00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:10,690
this is a female streamer and people are

00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:14,620
buying these little emojis or emoticons

00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:15,970
with real money to give to her so when

00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:18,490
she receives it she's not actually

00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:21,520
receiving any kind of tangible product

00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:23,950
but this kind of picture on a screen but

00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:25,480
people are paying lots of money like you

00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:28,060
know up to tens of thousands of dollars

00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:33,160
sometimes to give these virtual gifts to

00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:36,070
streamers twitch introduced this system

00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:39,670
called cheering with their own kind of

00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:42,220
monetary system back in June 2016 where

00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:45,550
you can purchase bits with real money

00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:49,149
and then give these little emoticons to

00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:50,770
the streamers so that it creates like

00:11:49,149 --> 00:11:53,830
very interesting interactions between

00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:55,300
people here's a screenshot from a

00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:57,459
streamer one of my favorite streamers

00:11:55,300 --> 00:12:00,070
angry pug you could see at the bottom

00:11:57,459 --> 00:12:03,820
that he has like this tip jar and every

00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:06,190
time somebody gives him bits that fills

00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:09,310
up with like the virtual virtual

00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:13,029
currency and on the top you'll see that

00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:14,920
somebody has donated $5 and so those are

00:12:13,029 --> 00:12:16,570
direct donations so for streamers

00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:22,200
there's a lot of different ways in which

00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:22,200
they can make money from their viewers

00:12:22,829 --> 00:12:28,480
in terms of subscriptions there are

00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:30,880
different tiers and different systems

00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:34,390
have different ways of doing this so for

00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:37,690
example on Twitch which is owned by

00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:39,850
Amazon you only have 4 options if you're

00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:42,190
an Amazon Prime member you can subscribe

00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:44,529
to someone for free or you can pay

00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:47,110
roughly five ten or twenty five dollars

00:12:44,529 --> 00:12:49,060
a month and these can come with

00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:51,459
different perks and the content creator

00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:55,149
is a person who who adjusts what those

00:12:51,459 --> 00:12:57,700
perks will be on sites like patreon they

00:12:55,149 --> 00:13:01,329
have adjustable tiers so the content

00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:02,740
creator decides what kind of perks will

00:13:01,329 --> 00:13:04,959
come with the different tiers and though

00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:07,870
perks can be anything from access to

00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:10,390
different content access to the person's

00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:12,790
social media so for example a lot of

00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:15,040
people have private snapchat accounts

00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:19,089
which you cannot access until unless you

00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:23,440
are a certain subscriber special emojis

00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:25,480
or subscription badges so I know this

00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,390
seems very abstract so let me give you a

00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:30,580
few examples

00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:33,100
this group of content creators they're

00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:35,470
called the try guys they became kind of

00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:38,950
famous through BuzzFeed now they have a

00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:43,000
page on patreon where you can choose

00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:44,130
from multiple options of way to to

00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,779
support them

00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:49,029
there are many tiers I just put three on

00:13:46,779 --> 00:13:51,670
here as an example for example for only

00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:54,820
three dollars a month you get 24 hour

00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:57,520
early access to their videos but if you

00:13:54,820 --> 00:14:01,630
wanted to increase that to $5 you get

00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:04,060
access to their chat server and for 500

00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:07,839
or more per month they give you a

00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:11,680
personal shout-out in their podcast so

00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:14,800
this is a unique way of of content

00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:19,920
creators deciding what is the more added

00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:24,550
value on Twitch

00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:27,760
some of these perks are appear on on the

00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:29,709
screen for other viewers to see so for

00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,690
example um this is again the streamer

00:14:29,709 --> 00:14:34,120
angry pug and on the right side are

00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:36,730
people who are writing things in chat

00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:39,160
and you see that some people have this

00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:40,899
icon next to their name that looks like

00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:44,200
a pug but they're all different colors

00:14:40,899 --> 00:14:47,140
and the colors are based on how long

00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:50,560
that person has been a subscriber so if

00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:53,529
you look at the chat you know how long

00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:55,779
somebody has been there and that kind of

00:14:53,529 --> 00:14:58,690
mechanism of visually identifying

00:14:55,779 --> 00:15:01,390
someone's patronage also contributes to

00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:02,980
the dynamics of the community how people

00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:05,709
interact with each other as well as how

00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:09,820
the streamer choose to interact with the

00:15:05,709 --> 00:15:12,400
viewers on this slide these are some of

00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:14,550
the unique emoticons that you can get by

00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:18,720
actually subscribing to area

00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:21,750
so if you pay $5.00 a month you can get

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:24,870
these special emoticons and one might

00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:28,080
think why would you pay money to buy

00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:29,940
emoticons but if you're a viewer in this

00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:32,030
community and if you want to participate

00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:34,890
in the chat like I showed you earlier

00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:37,380
using these emoticons has a special

00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:38,970
language for that community that other

00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:42,420
people outside of the community may not

00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:43,620
really understand so some of these are

00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:46,350
pretty straightforward you know they're

00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:48,780
like a cute dog or a screenshot of his

00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:51,900
face but some of the things for example

00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:53,670
in the middle like jfm someone outside

00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:56,250
this committee would have no idea what

00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:59,070
that means but by posting this emoticon

00:15:56,250 --> 00:16:00,690
there's like this insider language that

00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:04,980
is happening that helps bond the

00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:09,450
community together so now I'm going to

00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:13,920
talk about a specific study that will be

00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:17,340
appear in the ACM chi play proceedings

00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:19,950
next month and this is a study about why

00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:22,260
people subscribe to live streamers on

00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:24,480
Twitch and this was based off of more

00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:27,720
than 300 hours of structured observation

00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:29,730
as well as a paper survey that we did at

00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:32,460
twitchcon which is a convention for

00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:34,260
twitch enthusiasts my students and I

00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:36,450
went there and we actually distributed

00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:39,360
paper surveys to people who were waiting

00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:42,510
in line for things and then we also had

00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:44,550
interviews with twitch subscribers so we

00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:46,740
have some statistical results as well as

00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:51,090
some qualitative results I won't show

00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:55,470
the exact numbers but I'll conceptually

00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:57,840
describe the findings so one of our

00:16:55,470 --> 00:17:00,390
first questions was why do you subscribe

00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:03,720
and how is a subscription different from

00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:06,420
a one-time donation and unsurprisingly

00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:08,850
we found that the reason people give

00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:11,190
money on a one-time basis and the reason

00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:12,780
why people subscribe on a regular basis

00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:14,730
are very there's a lot of similarities

00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:17,280
so for example they want to become

00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:19,290
closer with the streamer or they really

00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,630
enjoy the content and they feel like

00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:23,940
they want to pay for the entertainment

00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:27,630
that they're receiving or there's some

00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:29,059
educational value so for example a lot

00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:31,559
of

00:17:29,059 --> 00:17:33,539
viewers for example look at these

00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:35,929
streams to learn something and they feel

00:17:33,539 --> 00:17:38,970
like they want to pay for for learning

00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:40,559
but there were two distinct motivations

00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:43,470
that were unique to subscriptions that

00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:47,070
we didn't see in donations and the first

00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:49,950
one was they want attention from the

00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:52,620
streamer and the second one was they

00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:54,360
want some benefits and those benefits

00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:57,720
include for example getting special

00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:59,669
emojis or having a special subscription

00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:02,340
badge next to their name that I showed

00:17:59,669 --> 00:18:04,530
you earlier we thought this was really

00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:07,080
interesting and this was based on

00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:09,150
quantitative statistical results so we

00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:11,669
went into some more in-depth interviews

00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:13,620
to really understand why what does it

00:18:11,669 --> 00:18:15,690
mean to want attention and what does it

00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:20,070
mean to want benefits and we were very

00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:22,830
surprised that people use the term

00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:25,799
return on investment they were saying I

00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:29,370
want when I'm subscribing it's all about

00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:31,620
the ROI and what the ROI means for

00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:35,970
different people is somewhat variable

00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:36,960
but when we thought when I least

00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:39,059
personally when I thought about

00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,440
patronage I always thought about oh I'm

00:18:39,059 --> 00:18:43,080
just supporting this person because I

00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:45,299
really like them but some people really

00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:49,590
had this idea of they want something in

00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:52,830
return for giving my money the second

00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:56,669
thing was loyalty and a lot of patrons

00:18:52,830 --> 00:19:01,770
were very proud of how much time they

00:18:56,669 --> 00:19:04,890
had dedicated to to to the to the person

00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:06,990
that they - the content creator and so

00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:10,140
even if it's the same amount of money

00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:12,360
for example you know if you're donating

00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:14,760
10 dollars or subscribing for ten

00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:17,669
dollars a month over a year that's $120

00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:20,400
but they thought that the 12-month

00:19:17,669 --> 00:19:24,809
subscription was more valuable than a

00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:27,059
one-time $120 donation because it means

00:19:24,809 --> 00:19:30,150
that they were invested for that time

00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:32,340
and that this also tied into why people

00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:34,950
really wanted to have those badges next

00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:38,640
to their ID because that was also an

00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:40,260
indication of their loyalty and the

00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:43,530
third one was recognition

00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:46,110
from streamer and of course not all

00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:47,910
patrons wanted recognition from streamer

00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:51,870
but their what where it was a subset

00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:53,940
where they thought that if they were a

00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:58,410
patron for long enough then the streamer

00:19:53,940 --> 00:20:00,600
might notice them and this has some

00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:02,370
interesting implications especially for

00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:04,860
what it means for a streamer when they

00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:08,430
start scaling up and having more patrons

00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:12,300
the second thing we looked at was the

00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:15,110
initial reasons why people subscribe

00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:17,850
versus their continuation reasons and

00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:19,110
one of the things that was really

00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:22,170
interesting about the continuation

00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:24,920
reasons was this perceived relationship

00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:27,240
which was often parasocial in nature

00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:29,610
parasocial is an academic term that's

00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:31,710
used to describe with someone feels very

00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:34,020
a strong connection to someone that they

00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:35,910
don't really know so traditionally this

00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:38,100
has been used in a lot of research of

00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:41,160
like attachment to fictional characters

00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:44,040
or television dramas things like that

00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:47,790
but we see that again in this live

00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:50,640
streaming space and then we also see

00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:52,290
patrons wanting to continue because they

00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:55,200
think that they're having a financial

00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:57,540
impact on the streamer and they feel

00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:00,930
very proud that they're really helping

00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:02,430
out the streamer financially and so one

00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:05,100
of the interesting things here is that

00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:07,680
as a streamer gets larger one would

00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:08,970
think that oh once the streamers big

00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:11,700
enough they don't need the money anymore

00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:14,310
and that was true for some people but

00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:16,080
for others they even if the streamer was

00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:18,270
extremely popular making a lot of money

00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:20,610
they thought that their contribution was

00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:26,430
what kind of made that person who they

00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:29,730
were the next thing I want to show is

00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:32,100
kind of the relationship between why

00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:33,960
people subscribe and other supportive

00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:36,720
behaviors and this shows a lot about

00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:39,030
kind of how the different subscription

00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,610
reasons map onto different supportive

00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:43,530
behaviors so on the left side we have

00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:44,880
financial support personal connection

00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:47,250
and these are the reasons why people

00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,890
subscribe and on the right side we have

00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:52,500
buying merchandise giving gifts giving

00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:54,659
direct money buying bit

00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:58,530
and gifting subscriptions to other

00:21:54,659 --> 00:22:00,510
viewers so this was a statistical

00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:02,880
analysis and it's hard to show numbers

00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:06,419
through a PowerPoint so I made this kind

00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:10,200
of diagram when we look at financial

00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:12,450
support we find that people who support

00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:14,490
who are patrons because they want to

00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:16,409
provide financial support they are also

00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:18,059
engaged with a lot of other supportive

00:22:16,409 --> 00:22:21,690
behaviors such as giving money buying

00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:25,350
merchandise etc but we saw that people

00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:27,179
who are more likely to provide patronage

00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:29,490
because of financial support were less

00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:34,320
likely to give subscriptions to other

00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:36,600
other viewers next we have personal

00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:39,150
connection and these are people who are

00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:41,400
patrons because they want to feel this

00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:42,990
connection with the streamer and we

00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:46,110
found that the only thing that that was

00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:48,750
related to was buying merchandise and

00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:50,970
again we see this negative relationship

00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:55,309
between a personal connection and

00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:58,320
gifting subscriptions to other viewers

00:22:55,309 --> 00:22:59,940
third these are people who are being

00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,890
patrons because they really enjoy the

00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:04,260
content and we see that these people

00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:06,510
similar to the financial support they

00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:09,750
also buy a lot of merchandise they give

00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:11,760
money they give bits and again they are

00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:13,380
less likely to give subscriptions to

00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:16,049
other people so it seems it's really

00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:19,770
about their experience and not wanting

00:23:16,049 --> 00:23:22,340
to help out other others next we have

00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:25,020
educational value which is related to

00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:27,659
purchasing merchandise and giving gifts

00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:30,150
but none of the other things and then

00:23:27,659 --> 00:23:32,250
finally we this is I thought this is

00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:33,900
very interesting people who are paid us

00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:36,419
because they want attention they don't

00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:40,830
engage in any of the other supportive

00:23:36,419 --> 00:23:44,220
behaviors and then people who want

00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:46,890
benefits are more likely to give bits

00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:49,710
and give gifts and we think that this is

00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:52,470
because if you give bits in the system

00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:54,030
the twitch system also tracks how many

00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:56,190
bits you've given and you can also get a

00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:59,340
badge based on that so maybe it's the

00:23:56,190 --> 00:24:02,419
visibility of their patronage that also

00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:02,419
contributes this

00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:11,019
so finally what does digital patronage

00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:13,369
enable first niche content you could

00:24:11,019 --> 00:24:16,359
maybe be someone who's doing something

00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:20,320
very very specific like dressing up in

00:24:16,359 --> 00:24:23,450
50s wardrobe and cooking old recipes

00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:26,059
that may not appeal to a large enough

00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:28,700
people a large enough audience to make

00:24:26,059 --> 00:24:32,989
money off of advertisements but could be

00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:34,369
enough to have a very small audience we

00:24:32,989 --> 00:24:38,389
think this is really interesting and

00:24:34,369 --> 00:24:42,019
also could put be potentially scalable

00:24:38,389 --> 00:24:44,869
because we do see very positive examples

00:24:42,019 --> 00:24:48,559
and at the very top for example these

00:24:44,869 --> 00:24:51,049
are to the top content creators on

00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:53,299
patreon and you see that one is a

00:24:51,049 --> 00:24:56,029
podcast producer and the other one is

00:24:53,299 --> 00:24:59,840
Brandon Stanton who who creates the

00:24:56,029 --> 00:25:02,330
humans of New York series and they're

00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:04,639
making quite a lot of money per month to

00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:06,859
be able to sustain their jobs now of

00:25:04,639 --> 00:25:09,909
course this is kind of on the top end of

00:25:06,859 --> 00:25:13,340
things we also have on the bottom line

00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:17,090
the people who are content creators who

00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:19,639
may be the income from the patronage

00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:22,369
maybe it pays the bills or maybe it's

00:25:19,639 --> 00:25:24,769
the bottom line that could that gives

00:25:22,369 --> 00:25:27,529
them the freedom to not have to be like

00:25:24,769 --> 00:25:29,690
hustling all the time so for example um

00:25:27,529 --> 00:25:34,549
this is Laurie penny she's a journalist

00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:36,590
and recently she hit three thousand

00:25:34,549 --> 00:25:38,570
dollars per month in terms of the

00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:41,539
patronage support that she's receiving

00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:43,009
and she wrote this post about how this

00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:44,480
enables her to have a lot of more

00:25:43,009 --> 00:25:46,249
freedom and that she doesn't have to

00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,279
juggle two or three jobs because at

00:25:46,249 --> 00:25:51,529
least this is kind of like a baseline

00:25:48,279 --> 00:25:52,970
provides a baseline type of salary for

00:25:51,529 --> 00:25:55,159
her and I think this is really

00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:57,559
interesting has interesting implications

00:25:55,159 --> 00:26:01,369
for freelancers because freelancers

00:25:57,559 --> 00:26:03,379
don't have any baseline and this even if

00:26:01,369 --> 00:26:06,529
it's not a lot through digital patronage

00:26:03,379 --> 00:26:08,840
perhaps that baseline could be there and

00:26:06,529 --> 00:26:10,879
I think this is also interesting because

00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:13,009
it could lead to more content that goes

00:26:10,879 --> 00:26:14,550
against market forces when you think

00:26:13,009 --> 00:26:17,820
about what kind of content gets

00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:20,010
a lot of traffic online not all that

00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:21,660
content is necessarily quality content

00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:23,390
and that's why we see things like yellow

00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:27,450
journalism

00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:30,180
that's why news about celebrities gets

00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:33,600
more clicks than politics or social

00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:35,910
issues but this digital patronage could

00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:38,910
enable the support of content that may

00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:42,150
not be viable with advertising money and

00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:44,340
I think that's really exciting I think

00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:47,270
digital patronage allows us to revisit

00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:51,090
the long tail in 2008 Chris Anderson

00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:53,820
proposed that the internet enables a lot

00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:58,650
of proliferation of smaller and niche

00:26:53,820 --> 00:27:00,950
brands and that and that the focus could

00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:04,260
move away from kind of mainstream

00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:07,080
blockbusters or mega trends so that the

00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:11,100
long tail will become equivalent to the

00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:14,040
head now this was very idealistic and

00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:17,340
has been refuted for example in the

00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:19,440
Harvard Business Review there was some

00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:21,090
research suggesting that indeed the tail

00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,680
is long and flat but that doesn't

00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:24,870
necessarily mean it really catches up to

00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:27,090
the head and so there has been research

00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:32,040
shown that the tail is pretty long but

00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:34,260
it's not necessarily very thick but with

00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:38,190
digital patronage would that change the

00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:41,190
long tail will patronage catch up to

00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:42,720
blockbusters I don't think so

00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:45,180
even if you look at for example

00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,760
platforms such as Spotify a few

00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:49,890
blockbuster musicians such as Drake they

00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:54,090
still account for more than 90% of the

00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:58,020
plays so so I don't think patronage will

00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:59,730
totally change you know the the industry

00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:02,550
in terms of how we promote like big

00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:07,530
names however maybe the tail will be

00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:08,970
more sustainable and this means what

00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:12,000
this means is that there's like this

00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:14,250
shift from selling content to selling me

00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,490
so the content creator is becoming the

00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:21,510
brand this streamer her name is amaranth

00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:24,860
which is a very talented cosplayer she

00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:27,250
does this thing called ASMR which is

00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:31,930
gently whispering into a

00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:33,940
microphone and actually there are many

00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:35,680
many many people who do this so when you

00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:37,930
think of the content itself it's not

00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:40,180
that the content that she produces is

00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:42,700
necessarily superior to others but she

00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:45,430
has a very unique brand and way of

00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:47,800
interacting with people that make people

00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:50,110
want to follow and also want to make

00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:53,350
people give money to her even when they

00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:55,950
can access her content for free the

00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:59,410
second thing is creating relationships

00:28:55,950 --> 00:29:02,320
before unless you were like a very you

00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:05,350
know a famous person you don't really

00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:07,570
know who your who who your supporters

00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:10,030
are but through these digital patronage

00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:12,400
systems now you know who those people

00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:15,610
are and that way you can get to know

00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:17,830
them in a more systemic way and also

00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:23,250
those supporters can form communities

00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:26,710
around the creator this is a woman who

00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:29,140
makes quilts that have videogame themes

00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:32,230
it's a very very specific

00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:33,970
art and here you see her kind of

00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:36,070
streaming in her workshop where she's

00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:38,890
just has a camera on while she's

00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:41,170
building these quilts she has her cats

00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:44,290
watching and if you give her some money

00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:46,510
she will give treats to her cats I think

00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:49,900
this is really interesting because she

00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:51,640
does not make up money her her main

00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:54,850
profits are not from the digital

00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:57,100
patronage but this is a way for her to

00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:59,500
connect with people who will potentially

00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:01,990
buy her quilts and so she has built this

00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:04,650
community that may not be generating the

00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:09,970
money but leads to other derivative

00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:12,070
products so finally some of the final

00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:15,370
thought nuggets that I have on patronage

00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:18,070
at least as it as I see it on Twitch is

00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:21,040
that it's a mix of the emotional and the

00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:24,490
tangible there's money but it's not just

00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:27,880
you know thoughtless money people are

00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:29,470
very attached and there's a sense of the

00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:32,200
money that I'm giving is attached to

00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:35,080
loyalty it's attached to relationships

00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:35,870
and so this kind of tangle of the

00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,430
financial

00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:40,220
and emotional I think from a research

00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:42,320
perspective is very interesting and the

00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:44,690
second point is that the reasons why

00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:46,460
people are patrons are so different some

00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:48,080
people they don't care about what they

00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:49,520
receive in return they just want to

00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,470
support that person because they just

00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:53,390
love what that person is doing but other

00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:55,880
people are very keen on what they're

00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:57,650
getting in return and I think that from

00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:59,870
the perspective of the content creators

00:30:57,650 --> 00:31:02,030
it's also really important to know that

00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:05,150
there are these different motivations of

00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:07,370
the patrons and then third virtual

00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:09,770
representations mean something I was

00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:11,870
very surprised at how much value people

00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:15,050
were adding to these little emoticons or

00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:17,690
the these pictures that are that are

00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:21,080
showing the badges next to their names

00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:23,120
and I think this is especially

00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:25,040
interesting because like as we move into

00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,720
digital currencies and things like that

00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:28,910
we always think that there has to be

00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,980
some kind of tangible product attached

00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:34,400
to money for it to value but we see that

00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:38,450
these pictures basically can have a lot

00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:40,940
of value and then finally this also

00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:42,830
leads to a lot of relational management

00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:45,679
that the creators have to engage in and

00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:47,750
the scholar Nancy beam also talks about

00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:50,960
relational management in a recent book

00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:52,820
that is about musicians but we see that

00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,679
not just with musicians but content

00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:57,050
creators in general when you have this

00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:59,090
direct connection with your patrons you

00:31:57,050 --> 00:32:00,230
feel obligated to have to interact with

00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:03,590
them and that creates a lot of

00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:08,260
interesting and often emotionally

00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:10,670
draining dynamics so finally what's next

00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:13,840
investigating other patronage platforms

00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:16,910
such as patreon also understanding

00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:18,890
patronage and brand management practices

00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:20,840
from the creators perspective so today I

00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:22,640
was mainly talking about the supporters

00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:25,910
but what does it look like from the

00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:28,010
other side and then finally developing

00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:31,000
and exploring new systems that support

00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:34,190
different patronage activities so as a

00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:36,650
as a patron currently there aren't a lot

00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:39,860
of systems that give you metrics on your

00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:41,960
own patronage history or the different

00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:44,420
people that you are supporting and it's

00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:46,380
also the same on the creator end because

00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:49,650
we've talked to creators too

00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:53,430
and it just seems that everything is

00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:55,860
digitally everything exists digitally

00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:59,910
but the metrics are not quite there yet

00:32:55,860 --> 00:33:03,690
and then of course like understanding

00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:05,940
how growth of patronage occurs if you're

00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:07,830
a very very small creator and you start

00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:09,890
gaining more and more patrons what does

00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:13,110
that patron management look like and

00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:15,270
what is the bigger impact that it has on

00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:17,040
the creative industry I think this is a

00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:18,720
really exciting new area and I'm looking

00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:21,000
forward to seeing where digital

00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:33,210
patronage goes from here thank you very

00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:35,130
much so there's like this really

00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:37,320
enthusiastic slack channel discussion of

00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:39,560
you that you don't know how or not you

00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:43,230
of the work right

00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:45,570
my first question on here so first off

00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:48,390
thank you very much and the general

00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:52,020
consensus is like raucous enthusiasm

00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:54,900
just poorly communicated through through

00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:58,500
the internet first question is from

00:33:54,900 --> 00:34:00,170
Janet see who's up in Seattle and you

00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:03,810
alluded to this I think in your

00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:05,220
penultimate slide in vets research I

00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:07,020
didn't want to talk about the burnout or

00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:10,889
the mental slash physical demand

00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:12,659
creating content 24/7 yes and this is

00:34:10,889 --> 00:34:14,429
something that is discussed among

00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:16,590
creators all the time if you go to

00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:19,409
conventions for creators they have

00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:23,129
panels on which they try to educate each

00:34:19,409 --> 00:34:26,070
other on how to manage burnout I think

00:34:23,129 --> 00:34:27,960
that there's there's a lot of advice

00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:30,000
especially given to new creators about

00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:33,270
don't think that this is you have to be

00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,770
on 24/7 and there's a lot of concern

00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:38,250
about mental health and a lot of

00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:40,290
dialogue around that and so I think

00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:42,419
there is a huge awareness in the creator

00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:43,950
community that you have to if you're

00:34:42,419 --> 00:34:46,830
spending a lot of time on air you have

00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:49,350
to spend a lot of time off air and so I

00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:52,409
think there's a there's a lot of

00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:56,280
acknowledgement and discussion around

00:34:52,409 --> 00:34:57,990
that which i think is very healthy same

00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:00,050
question I have here is from Diane Tate

00:34:57,990 --> 00:35:03,990
who maybe in the San Francisco office

00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:07,350
I'm not sure no no I've got a picture of

00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:09,360
me that's fine uh-huh and then asked

00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:11,430
what lessons from supporting individual

00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:13,800
influence of personality types can we

00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:15,660
carry over to the digital patronage of

00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,860
products and services does that make

00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:18,330
sense I think it's asking a question

00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:19,500
from a very particular Mozilla point of

00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:24,360
view so if it doesn't make sense I can

00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:25,440
elaborate a little sure as mentioned in

00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:27,570
the introduction we're trying to figure

00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:29,900
out alternate ways to fund the internet

00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:32,700
and obviously you can think about maybe

00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:34,620
what if Mozilla was to do some sort of

00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:36,270
service that people would subscribe to

00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:37,530
in a similar kind of way so there's some

00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:39,430
of the stuff that's out there right now

00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:41,840
like our work around

00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:43,700
making telling you whether your passport

00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:49,720
was stolen password with stolen in a

00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:52,280
password breach right or we are

00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:56,920
experimenting with other sort of privacy

00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:59,840
and safety and security kind of services

00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:02,060
the other particular personality types

00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:04,220
that I think Dane is just over trying to

00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:06,320
ask if we start to think about the

00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:08,540
personality of Mozilla are there

00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:12,260
directions we should lean into right

00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:15,080
right I think the important thing that

00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:17,180
at least and this is just my opinion is

00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:19,640
that digital patronage will not work for

00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:22,750
everything and what I think that it does

00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:25,400
work with is when you have a strong

00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:28,100
individual who has a personality that is

00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:29,270
their own media entity so that people

00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:31,520
feel like they have a direct connection

00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:33,290
but I think that when you're starting to

00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:35,480
look at this at an institutional level

00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:37,600
it loses some of its merit and I think

00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:42,050
this is one of the reasons why

00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:43,460
newspapers have really failed to to

00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:45,050
continue the subscription model that

00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:46,760
they used to have because if you think

00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:48,920
about news paper is a long time ago you

00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:51,650
have to pay X number of dollars to get

00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:54,560
your news now most people don't do that

00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:56,060
and they've and so they've switched to

00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:59,210
an advertising model which has its own

00:36:56,060 --> 00:37:02,210
own problems but you see people are

00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:07,580
supporting individual journalists and

00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:10,490
writers and so I think that patronage is

00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:13,100
something that requires a very central

00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:15,530
character and that if you try to do this

00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:18,800
at like an organizational level and lose

00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:20,840
that sense of intimacy so I think that

00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,670
may be one thing that could possibly do

00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:24,200
it is even if you're doing trying to do

00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:26,810
something from Mozilla's perspective

00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:29,450
it's not say okay this is mozilla but

00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:31,610
maybe create a persona that could be the

00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:33,440
proxy of mozilla so maybe you have this

00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:34,340
you know you have a mascot that's a

00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:39,050
really cute box

00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:41,390
maybe that fox is the is the persona it

00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:43,430
that person it's like it becomes the

00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:45,290
content creator or the entity that

00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:47,930
people can relate to and there's

00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:49,580
actually someone managing that is a

00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:51,080
brand yeah no I think that would be

00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:51,800
interesting I mean that being said I

00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:55,310
know that the

00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:57,500
talk to patreon patreon oh geez that's a

00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:59,540
horrible word and probably the right one

00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:01,880
still makes me uncomfortable no one

00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:06,020
should use that word again the top to

00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:07,790
patronage is chapo Trap House and humans

00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:09,670
of New York both of which I mean the

00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:12,020
humans of New York in particular is is

00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:13,730
there I mean there is some person who

00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:16,070
does it but their personality is not

00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:17,840
sort of the core part of what goes on

00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:19,670
there and chapo Trap House again has

00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:22,070
this you know it is beyond the

00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:26,690
individual right right I mean I think

00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:29,750
those are I think it's first of all

00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:31,700
there's people that are successful and

00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:33,440
on the top end of content creators and

00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:36,200
then there are people who are kind of

00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:38,210
starting out and I think that at the top

00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:41,870
level you will always see people who

00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:43,820
were who are hugely successful not

00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:45,410
because they are on patreon but because

00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:47,300
they were successful before and they

00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:48,920
basically brought their supporters to

00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:51,140
patreon so I think that's a different

00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:53,630
example but when we look at people who

00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:58,010
start out on patreon I think it's it's

00:38:53,630 --> 00:39:01,880
different and so when we see kind of

00:38:58,010 --> 00:39:03,380
this when we see the distribution and

00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:04,880
like the majority of people are not

00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:09,260
there because they were already famous

00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:10,520
yep that's a good point I have a few

00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:15,610
more questions on the slack Channel do

00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:15,610
we have any questions in person David

00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:23,500
thanks did you in your survey or in any

00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:27,050
of the observation notice people

00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:28,550
stopping their subscription or deciding

00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:30,170
that they didn't want to donate anymore

00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:32,960
or didn't want to follow because I know

00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:34,340
that part of the mental health problems

00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,980
for creators is the fear that they'll

00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:38,390
leave and go to something new is that is

00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:40,700
that at all part of your announcement

00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:43,010
yes so there definitely are people who

00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:47,450
stopped I think the top three reasons

00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:49,760
were one the person switched completely

00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:52,160
switched their content and the reason

00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:54,920
they were patron was because of the

00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:56,630
content and so when the content changed

00:39:54,920 --> 00:40:03,470
they were no longer interested in that

00:39:56,630 --> 00:40:05,040
the second reason was looking at and I

00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:07,920
kind of gave this example earlier too

00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:10,170
but there were some people who they were

00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:11,940
not very affluent themselves but they

00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:14,040
really wanted to support someone because

00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:16,580
they were so poor but then when that

00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:20,430
person became financially successful

00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:22,380
since the patron was still not in an

00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:25,650
affluent position they felt like they

00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:28,050
didn't have to support them anymore so

00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:29,400
that has a kind of dual implications

00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:31,530
because there were also people who

00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:34,110
wanted to continue to support even

00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:38,030
though the person they thought was at a

00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:43,110
good financial state and I think the

00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:44,730
final one was related to people who were

00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:47,300
patrons because they wanted this

00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:50,280
personal connection with a streamer and

00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:52,710
after a time they felt like they weren't

00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:54,600
achieving that and I think that's really

00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:57,420
hard from the creator's perspective

00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:59,130
because everyone is expecting to or

00:40:57,420 --> 00:41:01,140
wanting to be your friend and that's

00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:06,960
really hard to do from a creative

00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:10,710
perspective quickly would you say that

00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:13,410
then these need to seem like grassroots

00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:15,780
efforts to get support and then at a

00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:18,540
point in which they seem like successful

00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:21,090
going concerns people might find the

00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:22,620
next grassroot thing so that the

00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:25,710
personality that's important is sort of

00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:26,970
like a scrappy upstart that's what

00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:29,100
people really want to invest in on a

00:41:26,970 --> 00:41:30,540
platform like Twitter patreon I mean

00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:33,300
there are definitely people like that

00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:36,210
who purposely seek out smaller streamers

00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:38,190
so that you know if you go into a stream

00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:39,660
where there are only a handful of people

00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:41,430
and you start talking there you're going

00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:46,320
to get noticed so people who want that

00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:48,810
attention are probably less likely to

00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:51,210
continue if the person gets bigger but

00:41:48,810 --> 00:41:52,890
that's like a that's not all patrons are

00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:56,610
like that they're a subset of patrons

00:41:52,890 --> 00:42:00,030
who are like that I have a question here

00:41:56,610 --> 00:42:03,210
from Ashley Boyd who is part of Mozilla

00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:05,880
Foundation and she's I believe in the

00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:07,230
San Francisco area I think usually she

00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:09,210
may not be I don't know

00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:11,190
and she says I'm curious about the

00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:13,440
degree to which patrons understand and

00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:15,520
value that this direct support of

00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:18,450
content creators challenges the

00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:20,680
a business model of surveillance and ads

00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:23,510
like this the thing people know or is

00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:27,010
this just our reading of it

00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:27,010
[Music]

00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:35,150
could you read the last part of the

00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:36,530
question please Hammond I'm curious

00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:38,780
about the degree to which patrons

00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:41,180
understand and value that their direct

00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:43,040
support of content creators challenges

00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:45,619
the pervasive business model of

00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:47,770
surveillance and ads right right I don't

00:42:45,619 --> 00:42:51,170
think they're necessarily thinking about

00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:55,099
surveillance but in terms of ads I there

00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:58,550
is definitely this sense of pride that

00:42:55,099 --> 00:43:01,849
they're partaking in an alternative

00:42:58,550 --> 00:43:05,030
means of supporting creators and what I

00:43:01,849 --> 00:43:06,859
mentioned earlier about loyalty the way

00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:09,500
that people think that their time is

00:43:06,859 --> 00:43:13,880
more valuable than money I think is a

00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:16,220
very good indicator of that so I would

00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:20,150
say the majority of patrons probably

00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:23,240
know that you know without them the the

00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:25,760
content creator may otherwise not have a

00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:28,869
good means of making money and so I

00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:28,869
think they're very aware of that

00:43:31,329 --> 00:43:39,859
good do we have any questions in person

00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:42,589
Portland how's it going dudes Portland's

00:43:39,859 --> 00:43:44,799
waving Portland's thumbs up good

00:43:42,589 --> 00:43:47,270
San Francisco Vancouver Toronto

00:43:44,799 --> 00:43:50,240
Vancouver I can vaguely see you there

00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:52,430
clustered at one end of the table waving

00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:53,750
they're nice and waving okay I mean I

00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:55,160
guess one thing I would like to add to

00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:58,309
kind of follow-up to the previous point

00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:59,960
is that there are people who who do

00:43:58,309 --> 00:44:01,430
think about kind of the impact that

00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:02,829
they're making but then there are also a

00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:05,809
lot of people especially younger people

00:44:02,829 --> 00:44:08,210
that they're just paying $5 to get the

00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:10,280
emoticons and there's not much about

00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:13,849
like oh like the creator like they just

00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:15,740
want that emoticon and that's what I

00:44:13,849 --> 00:44:18,470
find like very fascinating about like

00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:20,930
how much power just having that emoticon

00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:24,589
has and I think it's really interesting

00:44:20,930 --> 00:44:27,740
to look more into that pool

00:44:24,589 --> 00:44:31,460
next question from Jared Hirsch and I

00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:33,799
forget what jared is but he asks other

00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:35,150
examples of brands sponsoring creators

00:44:33,799 --> 00:44:37,760
on a singletrack daily or weekly

00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:38,820
schedule like a conference or a TV or a

00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:47,050
radio

00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:50,140
on the livestream yeah there are there

00:44:47,050 --> 00:44:52,270
are so there are some efforts that are

00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:54,280
made by content creators individually

00:44:52,270 --> 00:44:57,340
like those who are at least savvy enough

00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:59,440
to to get different sponsorships twitch

00:44:57,340 --> 00:45:04,020
also facilitates some of that so for

00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:07,180
example if you're a game player and you

00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:09,400
are not big enough to have a sponsor but

00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:11,590
twitch for example if there's a new game

00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:15,220
coming out they will say if you play

00:45:11,590 --> 00:45:18,730
this game for X number of hours to your

00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:20,440
audience then you will get some kind of

00:45:18,730 --> 00:45:22,810
amount of money so in that case that's

00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:25,420
kind of like kind of like product

00:45:22,810 --> 00:45:27,490
placement to a certain extent and twitch

00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:29,560
helps facilitate that to some extent for

00:45:27,490 --> 00:45:31,810
the content creators who are not big

00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:35,260
enough to secure those product placement

00:45:31,810 --> 00:45:38,500
placements on their own I also know that

00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:40,690
there's a lot of product placement in in

00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:44,380
regards to equipment streaming equipment

00:45:40,690 --> 00:45:46,540
so like gaming chairs you see a lot of

00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:48,190
energy drinks are sponsoring larger

00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:49,960
streamers so that they have like the

00:45:48,190 --> 00:45:53,020
energy drink a refrigerator in the

00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:55,410
background those small things like

00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:58,810
product placement but I think those are

00:45:55,410 --> 00:46:01,750
for smaller creators like very difficult

00:45:58,810 --> 00:46:03,760
to procure yeah I noticed that in your

00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:09,220
screenshot of ninja announcing his

00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:10,720
switching and he's wearing this huge was

00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:14,800
just like all right high five I've just

00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:16,780
made my bonus for the year right he has

00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:19,060
like when you get to the live level of

00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:21,130
ninja it's no longer a content creator

00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:23,920
it's basic he's basically a celebrity he

00:46:21,130 --> 00:46:29,080
has a whole huge team managing different

00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:31,510
parts of it so I've got three more

00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:34,180
questions that have come in um first one

00:46:31,510 --> 00:46:36,040
answer hook I wonder if content creators

00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:37,660
get together to form syndicates or

00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:39,520
groups where patronage gives you access

00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:40,990
to all of the creators in that group oh

00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:43,360
that's really interesting I think the

00:46:40,990 --> 00:46:47,280
system currently doesn't support that

00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:50,550
but there are definitely

00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:53,010
in ad-hoc ways content creators get

00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:55,560
together to form groups and they direct

00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:58,590
their supporters to other people in that

00:46:55,560 --> 00:47:01,470
group so for example and we see this a

00:46:58,590 --> 00:47:04,140
lot in not in so much in gaming circles

00:47:01,470 --> 00:47:06,960
but in people who do kind of more artsy

00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:09,060
things because especially for people who

00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:11,190
do art they feel like the other person

00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:14,460
is not a threat because artwork is just

00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:18,330
not really competed well I guess like

00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:20,580
competing they not everybody is

00:47:18,330 --> 00:47:23,100
streaming 24/7 so when they're done with

00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:25,530
their stream they will direct their

00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:28,320
viewers and say hey here's this other

00:47:25,530 --> 00:47:29,820
content creator who who may who is

00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:31,770
similar to me that you guys might want

00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:36,960
to check out and that way they also

00:47:31,770 --> 00:47:39,720
share their patrons as well Gloria Kim

00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:41,970
asks you mentioned that this model of

00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:43,410
exchange rewards the individual brand or

00:47:41,970 --> 00:47:45,180
personality where there are

00:47:43,410 --> 00:47:46,980
characteristics common among the top

00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:48,180
performers and how did that compare to

00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:49,830
the performance you found me show

00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:53,850
audiences and perhaps a more modest

00:47:49,830 --> 00:47:56,870
degree of success that's a good I think

00:47:53,850 --> 00:47:59,160
there's a very big distinction between

00:47:56,870 --> 00:48:01,560
there are content creators who are

00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:03,810
famous because of their content and the

00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:07,620
content is so excellent and then there

00:48:03,810 --> 00:48:08,850
are content creators who are just who

00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:12,060
people like them because of their

00:48:08,850 --> 00:48:14,010
personality and there is a bit of a

00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:16,590
distinction and I think ninja is a very

00:48:14,010 --> 00:48:19,920
unique case where he has the personality

00:48:16,590 --> 00:48:22,860
and he also is able to you know snipe

00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:24,270
people who are flying out of the air so

00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:27,240
I think that's one of the reasons he's

00:48:24,270 --> 00:48:28,830
successful but one of the content

00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:31,320
creators I was showing you earlier angry

00:48:28,830 --> 00:48:33,420
pug he plays this game he's decent at

00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:36,000
the game he's not the absolute top

00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:37,530
player but the way that he plays is so

00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,980
interesting he makes all these weird

00:48:37,530 --> 00:48:44,550
sounds with his mouth and it's just so

00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:46,980
entertaining to watch and so I think

00:48:44,550 --> 00:48:48,720
that and and and he knows that he knows

00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:51,120
that like it's his personality that's

00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:53,250
really drawing people in so I think that

00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:55,080
we see these kind of dual things between

00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:57,060
people who are like ok it's just about

00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:59,830
the content and people who are more like

00:48:57,060 --> 00:49:03,810
their personality

00:48:59,830 --> 00:49:08,410
I have a question here from Tony Murphy

00:49:03,810 --> 00:49:11,290
and Tony asks have you seen any content

00:49:08,410 --> 00:49:14,140
creators create their own coin or like

00:49:11,290 --> 00:49:16,750
FinTech payment processing system so the

00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:19,840
payments payments are outside a platform

00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:21,160
specific I think you then continuous

00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:22,750
maybe in the future I could get a credit

00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:25,330
card and get points from from my

00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:28,210
favorite point content creators that's a

00:49:25,330 --> 00:49:31,080
really interesting idea currently well

00:49:28,210 --> 00:49:34,360
at least based on this study on twitch

00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:36,460
content creators do there is a way for

00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:39,280
people to directly give money like for

00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:41,650
example through PayPal but the

00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:44,260
interesting thing is that the content

00:49:41,650 --> 00:49:47,290
creators don't necessarily encourage

00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:50,830
that over the subscription via twitch

00:49:47,290 --> 00:49:53,170
even if the CIFOR example if somebody

00:49:50,830 --> 00:49:55,030
subscribes $5 on Twitch they're not

00:49:53,170 --> 00:49:58,420
going to get the whole $5 because twitch

00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:59,830
Amazon takes a cut but if they received

00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:02,470
a direct payment through PayPal they

00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:04,990
could get the full $5 however they also

00:50:02,470 --> 00:50:08,500
they really value getting it through

00:50:04,990 --> 00:50:10,960
twitch because twitch tracks how many

00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:13,480
subscribers you have and then the

00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:16,290
subscribers also get that badge and so I

00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:19,180
think it's these added visual

00:50:16,290 --> 00:50:22,510
visualizations of people's patronage

00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:27,880
that make people prefer to get that

00:50:22,510 --> 00:50:30,550
through the site yeah I mean I think

00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:33,160
that may be an interesting thing to sort

00:50:30,550 --> 00:50:34,690
of moving right but I think the other

00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:36,840
thing is that right now there's not a

00:50:34,690 --> 00:50:40,210
lot of alternatives so if an alternative

00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:42,880
platform comes up where it doesn't

00:50:40,210 --> 00:50:45,780
incentivize people being on the platform

00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:48,550
then we might see a lot more diverse

00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:52,060
financial transactions happening yeah

00:50:48,550 --> 00:50:53,980
although yes you'd need a company who

00:50:52,060 --> 00:50:59,620
really wanted a sort of diverse web for

00:50:53,980 --> 00:51:01,840
that to happen anyway I will say that

00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:03,340
somebody commented I can't find the

00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:04,720
exact comment someone was sort of really

00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:06,340
delighted that somehow we'd had this

00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:08,320
whole discussion and the word blockchain

00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:10,190
hadn't been mentioned once which of

00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:13,910
course I've now broken by saying it but

00:51:10,190 --> 00:51:16,460
you know it was ice although that was

00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:18,290
sort of glorious I was thinking I was

00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:21,070
talking about that I didn't because the

00:51:18,290 --> 00:51:23,870
research on that is so preliminary but

00:51:21,070 --> 00:51:27,140
we see patronage like especially in the

00:51:23,870 --> 00:51:31,520
art taking form in in blockchain so for

00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:35,030
example if you are a small like small

00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:36,770
investor you can't buy like a Rothko

00:51:35,030 --> 00:51:38,840
painting because it's billions of

00:51:36,770 --> 00:51:41,810
dollars but we see in the art we're

00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:44,330
seeing the art world that through kind

00:51:41,810 --> 00:51:48,020
of blockchain there's people buying

00:51:44,330 --> 00:51:50,630
shares of art I think that's also kind

00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:52,550
of a new form of patronage where before

00:51:50,630 --> 00:51:54,620
it used to be had to be really rich to

00:51:52,550 --> 00:51:57,950
purchase this one piece of art but now

00:51:54,620 --> 00:52:00,200
we're seeing kind of through blockchain

00:51:57,950 --> 00:52:02,420
technology so the art world is really

00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:04,370
kind of toying with that and all of

00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:06,200
their latest conferences have have all

00:52:04,370 --> 00:52:09,260
been about like blockchain art so

00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:10,700
definitely I think there's a aspect of

00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:13,060
patronage there that needs to be

00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:13,060
explored

00:52:16,470 --> 00:52:22,740
I have a question from Katie Pierce on

00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:24,780
Twitter who asked how are these funds

00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:27,060
treated by tech systems how does this

00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:28,349
work in a globalized economy and how

00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:30,270
does this money actually show up in the

00:52:28,349 --> 00:52:31,680
creator's bank account right that's a

00:52:30,270 --> 00:52:35,550
really good question that's a really

00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:37,910
good question I think that in terms if

00:52:35,550 --> 00:52:41,280
you are on Twitch or patreon then

00:52:37,910 --> 00:52:44,460
depending on where you're located you

00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:47,369
have to file that you receive a tax

00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:49,290
document kind of similar to if you were

00:52:47,369 --> 00:52:52,800
on eBay or something like that as a

00:52:49,290 --> 00:52:55,050
vendor I'm not sure how that works

00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:58,020
locally for all the different countries

00:52:55,050 --> 00:52:59,339
I know that twitch has a global audience

00:52:58,020 --> 00:53:02,670
and there are people from all around the

00:52:59,339 --> 00:53:05,130
world streaming but as to how the tax

00:53:02,670 --> 00:53:07,260
structure works from the different in

00:53:05,130 --> 00:53:10,410
the different companies I'm not aware of

00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:12,569
but do you have a sense of how much of a

00:53:10,410 --> 00:53:14,609
count the platform takes like if only

00:53:12,569 --> 00:53:16,589
give you a $10 thing

00:53:14,609 --> 00:53:20,010
how much do you walk away it's very

00:53:16,589 --> 00:53:24,470
ambiguous and there's no clear rules

00:53:20,010 --> 00:53:27,480
about it what I understand is that

00:53:24,470 --> 00:53:29,579
depending on it's kind of a rich get

00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:33,780
richer model where if you're a newer

00:53:29,579 --> 00:53:36,359
streamer and they take a larger cut but

00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:40,800
as you accumulate more they actually

00:53:36,359 --> 00:53:42,690
take a lesser cut but the I don't think

00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:45,180
that there are hard and fast guidelines

00:53:42,690 --> 00:53:50,160
on like what that threshold is there are

00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:52,380
also some loose or guidelines at least

00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:55,170
from the streamers perspective about

00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:56,670
what it takes to become a streamer that

00:53:55,170 --> 00:53:58,290
can start earning money because not

00:53:56,670 --> 00:53:59,940
everyone who streams can earn money you

00:53:58,290 --> 00:54:03,990
have to have there are some conditions

00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:05,970
that need to be met and you have to meet

00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:07,560
those conditions and agree to certain

00:54:05,970 --> 00:54:10,770
things before you can start actually

00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:12,990
making money on touch and there is a

00:54:10,770 --> 00:54:16,430
element of subjectivity that goes into

00:54:12,990 --> 00:54:21,359
those decisions that people don't know

00:54:16,430 --> 00:54:25,380
quite how it works okay we have another

00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:27,869
question from Gloria Kim oh this is a

00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:30,130
good one could you speak more about the

00:54:27,869 --> 00:54:32,619
lack of tangible backing up

00:54:30,130 --> 00:54:34,239
the digital representation for instance

00:54:32,619 --> 00:54:36,640
does the digital representation lose

00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:38,859
value when the creator or patreon moves

00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:41,019
to another platform how I need is the

00:54:38,859 --> 00:54:43,359
value a digital representation to that

00:54:41,019 --> 00:54:46,509
specific platform that's a really good

00:54:43,359 --> 00:54:50,009
question and I think especially in the

00:54:46,509 --> 00:54:52,420
streaming context we there's not enough

00:54:50,009 --> 00:54:54,910
competition for us to see what it's like

00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:56,859
for when one person moves from one

00:54:54,910 --> 00:54:58,029
platform to another and so I think ninja

00:54:56,859 --> 00:55:00,519
is a really interesting case because

00:54:58,029 --> 00:55:02,529
he's one of the first case studies where

00:55:00,519 --> 00:55:05,109
a huge streamer on Twitch actually moved

00:55:02,529 --> 00:55:08,049
to mixer and took a lot of the

00:55:05,109 --> 00:55:10,109
subscribers with him and but I think

00:55:08,049 --> 00:55:13,420
that like as I mentioned before not all

00:55:10,109 --> 00:55:15,279
patrons are obsessed with the virtual

00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:17,470
gifts or the digital representation I

00:55:15,279 --> 00:55:19,569
think that those who are will probably

00:55:17,470 --> 00:55:21,309
be upset if that person leaves the

00:55:19,569 --> 00:55:24,190
platform because then they will it will

00:55:21,309 --> 00:55:27,069
be like losing all your points right but

00:55:24,190 --> 00:55:31,479
definitely not all patrons are there for

00:55:27,069 --> 00:55:33,130
for that recognition so I think it'll be

00:55:31,479 --> 00:55:35,619
interesting to see especially as a mixer

00:55:33,130 --> 00:55:38,289
becomes bigger what we see with all this

00:55:35,619 --> 00:55:40,989
kind of cross-platform activity and it

00:55:38,289 --> 00:55:43,450
could be that streamers realize that

00:55:40,989 --> 00:55:45,130
when you have when you're managing all

00:55:43,450 --> 00:55:47,739
this multiple media and right now

00:55:45,130 --> 00:55:49,539
there's not for example you don't really

00:55:47,739 --> 00:55:51,160
make money through Twitter by being a

00:55:49,539 --> 00:55:54,579
powered Twitter user or you don't make

00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:57,579
money through through Instagram unless

00:55:54,579 --> 00:55:59,890
you aside from the ads but once those

00:55:57,579 --> 00:56:02,049
systems if they start implementing this

00:55:59,890 --> 00:56:04,839
patronage system I think it'll be really

00:56:02,049 --> 00:56:07,239
fascinating to see how creators manage

00:56:04,839 --> 00:56:09,519
that and if there will then be services

00:56:07,239 --> 00:56:18,249
that try to link all of those things

00:56:09,519 --> 00:56:22,869
together ok I think that's just about

00:56:18,249 --> 00:56:26,530
all we have time for and we do one more

00:56:22,869 --> 00:56:28,300
round of in the room things

00:56:26,530 --> 00:56:29,890
and I'm not seeing sort of frantic

00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:32,380
waving from coming from anyway

00:56:29,890 --> 00:56:34,900
frantic waving David frantic waving

00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:38,560
alright you got two and a half minutes

00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:41,260
so it seemed like a lot of the

00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:42,730
motivations I had to do with the

00:56:41,260 --> 00:56:47,560
relationship or perceived relationship

00:56:42,730 --> 00:56:48,880
between the patron and the creator one

00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:50,800
thing I've noticed over the past like

00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:52,840
year or so is that communities that

00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:54,850
follow creators are going on other

00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:56,980
platforms to talk about the creators

00:56:54,850 --> 00:56:58,750
like discord where you're hanging out

00:56:56,980 --> 00:57:00,670
with other people in another chat and

00:56:58,750 --> 00:57:04,290
voice chatting and hanging out with that

00:57:00,670 --> 00:57:08,620
community so how important do you think

00:57:04,290 --> 00:57:10,990
those communities are to this economy

00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:13,570
around a creator separate from the

00:57:10,990 --> 00:57:15,880
creator's personality once you're in it

00:57:13,570 --> 00:57:17,950
you're really in it you get those

00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:20,260
emoticons for the other people they're

00:57:17,950 --> 00:57:22,510
not so much to show your relationship to

00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:24,370
that creator right right so if you could

00:57:22,510 --> 00:57:27,520
talk a little bit about that yeah the

00:57:24,370 --> 00:57:29,230
community aspect is what I think is what

00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:30,880
makes kind of digital patron is

00:57:29,230 --> 00:57:32,980
different from the one-off donations

00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:36,130
because it's not just me and the Creator

00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:37,800
it's me other patrons and the Creator

00:57:36,130 --> 00:57:39,970
and then kind of in the middle of

00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:42,970
someone that I haven't talked about is

00:57:39,970 --> 00:57:45,430
moderators so as these communities get

00:57:42,970 --> 00:57:48,880
bigger paid creators have a hard time

00:57:45,430 --> 00:57:51,370
managing the volume of kind of

00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:53,650
conversations on their own and so they

00:57:51,370 --> 00:57:56,980
need people to help out with that

00:57:53,650 --> 00:57:59,770
and so moderators are there not only to

00:57:56,980 --> 00:58:02,290
like delete bad content but they're also

00:57:59,770 --> 00:58:04,450
there to facilitate discussions and this

00:58:02,290 --> 00:58:07,390
happens a lot especially on livestream

00:58:04,450 --> 00:58:08,980
because the Creator is live producing

00:58:07,390 --> 00:58:11,550
some kind of content so they can't be

00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:14,140
looking at the chat the whole time and

00:58:11,550 --> 00:58:15,940
sometimes when people post something and

00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:17,260
the streamer is unable to respond

00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:19,210
sometimes people get very upset it's

00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:20,770
like I just said something why won't you

00:58:19,210 --> 00:58:22,900
respond to that and a lot of times

00:58:20,770 --> 00:58:24,970
that's when moderators can also jump in

00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:29,920
and start facilitating the conversations

00:58:24,970 --> 00:58:32,500
so there's this kind of thing where as a

00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:35,240
streamer builds a larger and larger

00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:38,930
following they also need to

00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:41,780
froot human moderators to help sustain

00:58:38,930 --> 00:58:43,610
that community and so I mean that's like

00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:46,220
a whole other talk but you know that

00:58:43,610 --> 00:58:47,900
dynamics with moderators and is really

00:58:46,220 --> 00:58:51,410
fascinating as well and how they recruit

00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:53,690
them and how they manage them and so

00:58:51,410 --> 00:58:56,119
there's a lot of this kind of people

00:58:53,690 --> 00:58:59,210
management that happens not just from

00:58:56,119 --> 00:59:02,740
the creator patron perspective but also

00:58:59,210 --> 00:59:05,360
like all the in-between people as well

00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:07,340
cool all right and with that I would

00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:07,760
like to thank you very much for coming

00:59:07,340 --> 00:59:09,080
