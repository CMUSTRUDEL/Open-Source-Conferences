Title: Baruch Lev - Challenges in creating value from Intangibles (intellectual capital)
Publication date: 2019-08-26
Playlist: Emerging Technologies Speaker Series
Description: 
	Baruch Lev - Presenter (Bio: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/faculty/bio/baruch-lev)

Not all investments yield measurable revenues. For example we at Mozilla invest in our community relationships, in educational efforts, and in policy work. When we do this, we're building intangible assets.

Baruch Lev will speak about intangible assets: their special attributes, the problems they create for measurement systems (at all levels), and the considerable economic value they create. Baruch will help us begin to understand how to think about these kinds of resource allocation decisions.

He has been seminal in the work done in this area, writing "Intangibles," which carefully defined how knowledge, relationships, brand, and similar assets are fundamentally different than things like buildings and product inventory.

good morning my name is Jessica Margolin

00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:08,760
and it's my pleasure to welcome you here

00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:11,550
to Mozilla to listen to a fascinating

00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:14,219
speaker Baruch Lev who will be talking

00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:16,080
about intangible assets I'm gonna let

00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:27,990
him go into more detail about his talk

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:31,859
and here's professor Lev spread all over

00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:41,850
I usually ask students to come together

00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:45,899
what I want to ask you so good morning

00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:47,629
to all of you pleasure to be here I'm

00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:50,280
going to talk about intangibles

00:00:47,629 --> 00:00:52,620
intangible economy intangible companies

00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:56,460
particularly consequences challenges

00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:58,710
mainly to managers I mentioned investors

00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:02,940
in passing although that's not your main

00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:04,559
concern it's my main concern really but

00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:07,049
I would like to say that the first time

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:09,540
I encountered the intangibles was when I

00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:14,850
taught at University of California

00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:17,250
Berkeley here and was about 25 years ago

00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:21,000
at the same time I was also a partner in

00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:25,140
a thriving consulting firm that was set

00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,009
up by two of my colleagues and we did

00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:30,590
mainly litigation support work

00:01:28,009 --> 00:01:33,329
valuations for mergers and acquisitions

00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:35,400
economic consulting finance consulting I

00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:40,049
was in charge of the finance accounting

00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:42,000
part and I did lots of valuations of

00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:47,040
companies mainly for mergers and

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:50,189
acquisitions and litigation and mainly

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:53,720
new types of companies new types at the

00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:55,140
time I'm talking late 80s early 90s

00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:58,380
mid-90s

00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:01,890
so the first valuations of cellular

00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:05,329
phone companies biotech companies later

00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:12,469
Internet service providers lots of those

00:02:05,329 --> 00:02:15,930
and what struck me immediately was that

00:02:12,469 --> 00:02:19,349
valuation models methodologies that we

00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:23,519
usually used for these purposes based on

00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:26,459
assets and the benefits the cash flows

00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:29,099
coming from assets were completely

00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:32,370
useless for these types of companies

00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:34,890
they didn't have any traditional assets

00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:38,220
and the assets that you see on balance

00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:41,219
sheets of companies and they had

00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:45,409
intangible assets their loss of patterns

00:02:41,219 --> 00:02:49,889
and rights and brands and other things

00:02:45,409 --> 00:02:54,000
and it was a huge challenge to value

00:02:49,889 --> 00:02:59,010
companies intensive rich in these types

00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:03,000
of assets for reasons that will become

00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:06,720
clear in a moment so we had to develop

00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,780
new methodologies new approaches which

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:12,989
then fed into my academic research and I

00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:16,889
wrote lots of papers and books about the

00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:20,459
intangibles it was really fun until

00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:26,699
until today so I'm going to talk about

00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:31,590
about intangibles starting with where is

00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:34,169
the clicker here this is this is another

00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:38,459
presentation that I have here I'm going

00:03:34,169 --> 00:03:41,940
to give Friday at UC Irvine but I'm just

00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:45,870
stealing the first six slides from this

00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:50,190
presentation so that's the situation in

00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:52,440
the United States this is this comes

00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:54,750
from two well-known economist Carroll

00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,699
Colorado and Charles Holton publishing

00:03:54,750 --> 00:04:00,689
in American Economic Review which is the

00:03:56,699 --> 00:04:04,139
top journal for economists and this is

00:04:00,689 --> 00:04:07,769
the total investment in United States

00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:12,659
relative to Value Added something like

00:04:07,769 --> 00:04:16,169
GDP in tangible assets that the brown

00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:18,620
downward sloping line and intangible

00:04:16,169 --> 00:04:23,290
assets the upward

00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:26,810
blue greenish line that you see there

00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:31,180
and what you see is an amazing

00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:38,290
transformation of the entire US economy

00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:43,580
here from reliance on physical assets

00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:46,970
plant machinery structures inventory

00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:52,150
which goes down from like 60% of GDP to

00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:55,310
10 it's an amazing decrease and

00:04:52,150 --> 00:05:01,610
constantly increasing reliance on those

00:04:55,310 --> 00:05:03,310
intangible assets on the right side 2017

00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:06,320
to give you an idea of the absolute

00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:09,200
value the total investment in United

00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:11,450
States that I'm speaking here only or

00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:14,260
they are speaking only about private

00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:17,090
sector investment this doesn't include

00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:20,060
government and universities but that's

00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:23,030
most of the investment the total

00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:26,540
investment in intangibles in United

00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:31,610
States in 2:17 was two point four

00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:35,060
trillion with the T dollar enough to pay

00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:37,930
for the wall and everything else to open

00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:40,490
the government two point four investment

00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:42,620
intangible assets these are the asset

00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:45,620
that most people still think of real

00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:50,030
assets you can touch them when they fall

00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:54,289
they make noise is half of this and as

00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:56,780
you see the gap is growing the increase

00:05:54,289 --> 00:05:59,060
in intangible asset started really in

00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:02,660
the 80s huge increases were new

00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:06,080
industries totally intangible like

00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:10,310
software and then biotech came into

00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:13,039
being in a big sense I can still

00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:19,070
remember and one of my research studies

00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:20,720
I read letters that were written to the

00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:23,419
Financial Accounting Standards Board

00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:26,710
that's the regulator for accounting for

00:06:23,419 --> 00:06:30,210
financial report and this was about

00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:33,150
expensing intangibles which I will

00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:37,889
mention later on there was a letter

00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:41,270
written from Microsoft in 1984 and they

00:06:37,889 --> 00:06:45,780
had to include a whole paragraph

00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:48,810
introducing who Microsoft is at the time

00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:51,830
cause no one knew this this company said

00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:55,800
we are up-and-coming

00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:57,509
company developing software and they saw

00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:00,419
that their opinion will be taken

00:06:57,509 --> 00:07:04,139
seriously so that's really the

00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:05,280
ascendance of intangibles the huge the

00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:08,099
huge

00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:11,009
absolute amounts when you think about

00:07:08,099 --> 00:07:14,280
intangibles they basically speak about

00:07:11,009 --> 00:07:17,370
three types of assets one related to

00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:19,680
innovative activities which is our indie

00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:23,900
and patterns and new products and

00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:29,220
services the other related to IT

00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:34,020
databases a big data and the third one

00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:36,840
which is less known it's usually called

00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:41,310
by economists organization capital

00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:44,699
that's the way enterprises are run the

00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:47,099
unique way that creates value this is

00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:50,400
usually the most important intangible of

00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:54,720
all this includes specific business

00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:58,830
processes like recommendation algorithm

00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:01,979
of Netflix Amazon and others this

00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:06,199
includes brands includes human resources

00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:11,009
and others of the way the enterprise is

00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:14,930
organized and creates value so these are

00:08:11,009 --> 00:08:18,020
the three types of the three nexuses of

00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:20,880
intangibles if you look around the world

00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:25,590
the United States is a class by itself

00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:28,020
you see the deaths for 2013 that's a

00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:30,960
total investment intangibles 1.2

00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:34,380
trillion there one point nine trillion

00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:39,169
there but today as I said it's close to

00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:40,769
point five trillion China a very distant

00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:43,709
second

00:08:40,769 --> 00:08:46,139
the rest are very small particularly

00:08:43,709 --> 00:08:50,100
European countries southern European

00:08:46,139 --> 00:08:53,300
countries almost no investment at all in

00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:56,309
intangibles which of course is clearly

00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:58,619
reflected in the power of economic

00:08:56,309 --> 00:09:01,679
performance of these companies these

00:08:58,619 --> 00:09:04,829
countries in the rate of growth of these

00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:08,279
countries in their viability the

00:09:04,829 --> 00:09:12,749
vibrance of these countries you can see

00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:17,579
the ranking here even UK with 1.57

00:09:12,749 --> 00:09:23,970
billion miniscule amounts relative to

00:09:17,579 --> 00:09:27,799
the United States one last thing I would

00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:31,399
like to say isn't that's preamble to

00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:36,239
several things I'll mention later on

00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:38,610
assets that are recognized in financial

00:09:36,239 --> 00:09:41,579
reports of companies and by financial

00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:45,179
reports I mean those quarterly and

00:09:41,579 --> 00:09:47,939
annual reports that public companies

00:09:45,179 --> 00:09:50,639
those whose stocks are traded in so

00:09:47,939 --> 00:09:53,579
exchanges have to release to their

00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:58,110
shareholders assets that appear on the

00:09:53,579 --> 00:10:01,170
balance sheet are those assets on the

00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:03,329
declining line the fixed assets the

00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:06,420
property plant machinery does the

00:10:03,329 --> 00:10:11,249
dimension before most of the intangible

00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:13,829
assets not reported by companies on

00:10:11,249 --> 00:10:17,369
their balance sheet which creates a huge

00:10:13,829 --> 00:10:19,980
problem for again mergers and

00:10:17,369 --> 00:10:22,369
acquisitions valuation of companies they

00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:25,410
are basically buried in the account

00:10:22,369 --> 00:10:28,549
because in the accounting terminology

00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:32,189
the investment in these assets are

00:10:28,549 --> 00:10:35,809
expensed there is a big difference

00:10:32,189 --> 00:10:38,790
between accounting between expense and

00:10:35,809 --> 00:10:41,339
capital and expenses something that

00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:43,829
doesn't provide future benefits paying

00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:45,959
salary is an expense you pay for past

00:10:43,829 --> 00:10:48,540
services paying interest pain where

00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:51,869
these are expenses investment in the

00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:54,480
machine is an asset capital because it

00:10:51,869 --> 00:10:57,120
creates expected of course to

00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:00,720
create future benefits so accountants

00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:04,050
regard all intangibles as not having

00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:07,050
future benefits or benefits are so

00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:11,040
uncertain that cannot even taken into

00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:14,250
account in terminology of of an asset it

00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:17,880
has it has a terrible effect on the

00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:19,920
financial report on information not only

00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:22,279
information to shareholders but

00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:26,029
information also used by managers

00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:30,570
internally and affect adversely business

00:11:26,029 --> 00:11:33,089
decisions that are made by by firms even

00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:38,880
by a smart managers but that's just the

00:11:33,089 --> 00:11:41,010
preamble why is this development so so

00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:44,579
important because it explains lots of

00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:48,320
puzzles lots of interesting phenomenon

00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:48,320
first one is

00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:06,369
failure of measurements at all level

00:12:02,999 --> 00:12:12,069
because of the inappropriate treatment

00:12:06,369 --> 00:12:14,589
of of intangible assets and I'll just

00:12:12,069 --> 00:12:17,290
give you one example that's not going to

00:12:14,589 --> 00:12:26,079
be an accounting or finance presentation

00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:29,649
but just one example in the measurement

00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:31,920
of income measurement of earnings and

00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:34,269
this applies to profit and to

00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:37,119
not-for-profit public companies not

00:12:34,269 --> 00:12:42,009
public companies the end result of

00:12:37,119 --> 00:12:45,759
operations income this kind of a surplus

00:12:42,009 --> 00:12:48,670
over expenses is always an indicator of

00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:51,850
performance a very important indicator

00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:57,329
of performance in capital markets that's

00:12:51,850 --> 00:13:00,910
the number that guides investments

00:12:57,329 --> 00:13:04,410
ideally investments people's investments

00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:08,619
corporate investments should flow to

00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:11,649
companies with high potential high

00:13:08,619 --> 00:13:15,249
profitability should with be withdrawn

00:13:11,649 --> 00:13:18,040
from low profitability so in the

00:13:15,249 --> 00:13:20,649
measurement of income there the critical

00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:23,559
thing is what's called matching to

00:13:20,649 --> 00:13:26,919
against all the sales against all the

00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:29,529
revenue to match all the expenses that

00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:31,629
were incurred in the process of

00:13:29,529 --> 00:13:34,230
generating these revenues if you get a

00:13:31,629 --> 00:13:37,919
good matching the income number is good

00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:41,319
in the sense that it really reflects the

00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:44,290
performance of the enterprise the change

00:13:41,319 --> 00:13:48,040
in the value of the enterprise if there

00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:52,749
is a mismatch then the number becomes a

00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:55,809
meaningless number and according to the

00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:58,089
accounting systems in United States to

00:13:55,809 --> 00:14:02,110
some extent even outside the United

00:13:58,089 --> 00:14:05,379
States all those intangible investments

00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:07,660
that I mentioned before all R&D all

00:14:05,379 --> 00:14:10,720
investment in brand enhancements all

00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:11,390
investments in IT in human resources are

00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,570
regards

00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:19,610
expenses their benefits will come in the

00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:24,430
future so you get a huge mismatch every

00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:28,100
quarter every year between the sales and

00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:31,100
expenses whose benefits will accrue in

00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:33,860
the future and the number becomes a

00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:36,260
meaningless number now I just want to

00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:39,260
prove this to you and this comes from a

00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:44,000
recent finance paper that I wrote which

00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:46,580
I must say with great pride it's for the

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,490
last year is the most downloaded paper

00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:53,050
in Finance of all of all other papers

00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:55,940
and here I wanted really to shock

00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:59,530
particularly hedge fund managers and

00:14:55,940 --> 00:15:02,450
professional investors and I said

00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:05,060
because most most valuations of

00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:07,700
investors revolve around the earnings of

00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:11,030
companies I said suppose we can

00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:14,000
perfectly predict performance of

00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:15,500
companies next quarter how much money

00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,630
you can make from this perfect

00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:21,230
prediction so this is some kind of a

00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:23,810
ceiling if you have the best predictions

00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:26,990
the best models the best spreadsheet

00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:29,360
they are using how much money and what

00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:33,650
you can see here that hint for the last

00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:36,290
period - 11 - 17 for three months and

00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:39,740
talking about quarterly you can make two

00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:43,460
point two point six percent this is

00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:47,210
above market with risk adjusted so

00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:51,010
that's about 12 percent annual this is

00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:53,450
three months annual this is a very high

00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:56,050
gain that you can make and that's not

00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:58,420
surprising if you can predict perfectly

00:15:56,050 --> 00:16:02,180
what I have on the holes on the

00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:05,290
horizontal axis is all the companies

00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:08,829
these are all US public companies

00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:13,180
underlying this graph

00:16:08,829 --> 00:16:18,579
so I I classified them into five groups

00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:22,130
from the left to the right in increasing

00:16:18,579 --> 00:16:24,940
intensity of intangibles increasing

00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:27,820
intensity so on the left there are

00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:31,120
companies with relatively low

00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:35,089
intangibles financial companies

00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:38,930
insurance others moving to the right

00:16:35,089 --> 00:16:41,930
you'll get into very high intensive

00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:45,399
intangible companies but what's striking

00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:48,500
here is that they gain from this

00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:51,610
indicator of value indicator of

00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:55,790
performance really collapses as

00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:57,800
intangible intensity increases meaning

00:16:55,790 --> 00:17:02,920
that with the increase in intangible

00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:07,850
intensity you get failure of measurement

00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:11,839
system and earnings are used not just by

00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:15,949
investors are used internally by by a

00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:18,709
company GE now it's all really

00:17:15,949 --> 00:17:23,179
unfortunately on the slippery slope down

00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:25,189
but in its high days particularly under

00:17:23,179 --> 00:17:29,630
Jack Welch a legendary

00:17:25,189 --> 00:17:32,600
see over left in the 2001 his rule was

00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:34,280
GE was a conglomerate still is meaning

00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:39,790
they have lots of businesses lots of

00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:43,070
companies combined his rule was that any

00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:45,679
subsidiary any line of business that

00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:51,200
doesn't have the highest or second

00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:56,000
highest profitability among its peers is

00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:59,570
out either sold or closed so lots of

00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:03,530
internal decisions are based on measures

00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:06,110
that are here it's easy to show because

00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:08,929
I have access to stock prices are much

00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:11,290
less access to internal decisions but

00:18:08,929 --> 00:18:13,190
it's the same the same type of

00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:15,140
measurement

00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:18,890
there's also failure of measurement on

00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:21,200
the macro level national account because

00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:22,220
in many cases those intangibles

00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:26,210
where

00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:30,679
considered just an expense not and not

00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:32,720
an investment once once some of those

00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:35,090
like research and development and

00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,519
software in recent years were considered

00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:41,299
assets in the national account those

00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:45,440
accounts that produced GDP and and

00:18:41,299 --> 00:18:50,929
consumption and others the whole growth

00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:52,970
of the US economy changed with that so

00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:56,149
on the reason to consider intangibles is

00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:59,600
that if you just let traditional

00:18:56,149 --> 00:19:03,559
accounting measurements go they will

00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:06,409
completely bias your measurement

00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:09,879
procedures the second the second point

00:19:06,409 --> 00:19:14,029
while intangibles are important is that

00:19:09,879 --> 00:19:16,899
in intangible intensive economy works

00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:16,899
differently

00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:35,860
you might not be aware of it but there

00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:38,590
is a huge development maybe some of you

00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:43,200
are a huge development in US capital

00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:48,360
markets the total number of companies

00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:54,880
listed on US exchanges decreased from

00:19:48,360 --> 00:20:00,130
1997 by 50% we have now 50 percent fewer

00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:03,280
public companies than we had in 1997

00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:05,350
this is unprecedented in the history of

00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:08,530
the United States in the history of any

00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:12,430
other country the disappearance of half

00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:15,250
the companies in the stock market all

00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:17,230
stock markets of United States lots of

00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:19,540
research goes to it

00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:21,850
the two major reasons are mergers and

00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:24,720
acquisitions lots of companies combined

00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:27,940
or one of them disappears and

00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:29,740
liquidations lots and lots of companies

00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:33,250
particularly smaller particularly high

00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:38,830
tech particularly high tech basically

00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:42,610
fail and go bankrupt and the main reason

00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:45,190
for this huge restructuring of capital

00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:47,890
markets in the United States are the

00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:51,040
intangible asset lots and lots of

00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:55,530
companies cannot cope in this new

00:20:51,040 --> 00:21:03,600
economy in which competition is

00:20:55,530 --> 00:21:03,600
substantially higher than before and and

00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:15,100
and large huge firms dominant firms

00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:18,190
appear in many industries and stay there

00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:23,080
for long used to be that large firms

00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:26,290
would come new ones now they just stayed

00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:28,930
the same Microsoft and Facebook and

00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:31,390
Google are going at Amazon of course

00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:33,220
going to Peter for a long time that's

00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:35,050
not just in high-tech it's the same

00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:37,900
thing in pharmaceutics

00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:40,909
Pfizer is the largest pharmaceutical

00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:44,779
company in the world for at least 30 or

00:21:40,909 --> 00:21:49,159
all the years and the small ones have

00:21:44,779 --> 00:21:52,309
great difficulties are competing this

00:21:49,159 --> 00:21:56,409
case so significant changes in the

00:21:52,309 --> 00:21:56,409
economy particularly capital markets

00:22:03,879 --> 00:22:10,330
banks investment banking insurance

00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:12,889
companies are changing significantly

00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:17,330
because they have great difficulties

00:22:12,889 --> 00:22:20,419
coping with intangibles traditionally

00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:23,809
loans were given with collateral and

00:22:20,419 --> 00:22:27,139
collateral on fixed assets on buildings

00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:32,029
on machines on inventory is something

00:22:27,139 --> 00:22:37,759
which is easy day I think I have to

00:22:32,029 --> 00:22:42,039
leave no it's very easy to do banks have

00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:45,889
done it for hundreds of years but

00:22:42,039 --> 00:22:49,940
intangibles as collateral it's very

00:22:45,889 --> 00:22:54,489
complicated for intangibles for example

00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:57,440
the property rights are not well-defined

00:22:54,489 --> 00:23:00,070
there are patents of course but many

00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:04,389
intangibles are not patented like like

00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:07,879
brands and others so for a bank to

00:23:04,389 --> 00:23:10,039
repossess something and be able to sell

00:23:07,879 --> 00:23:12,619
it particularly when they all know

00:23:10,039 --> 00:23:15,440
markets I'll talk later about it on how

00:23:12,619 --> 00:23:19,970
markets in intangibles creates huge

00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:22,519
difficulties so most of those intangible

00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:25,489
intensive companies basically don't

00:23:22,519 --> 00:23:29,179
borrow money in the traditional way from

00:23:25,489 --> 00:23:35,139
banks few of them do but most don't the

00:23:29,179 --> 00:23:38,929
issue stocks and venture capitalists are

00:23:35,139 --> 00:23:42,440
exploiting this thing and getting into

00:23:38,929 --> 00:23:44,989
banks used to be before financing

00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:47,769
companies cause venture capitalists are

00:23:44,989 --> 00:23:51,889
much more flexible they take equity

00:23:47,769 --> 00:23:52,530
instead of giving loan they mostly

00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:56,280
unders

00:23:52,530 --> 00:24:00,120
the business so they are thriving banks

00:23:56,280 --> 00:24:03,450
in terms of lending really shrinking

00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:09,650
because of the intangible economy and

00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:09,650
the fourth and last issue is managerial

00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:22,940
I'm talking about why it's important to

00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:25,950
understand to consider intangibles

00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:28,499
intangibles caused significant

00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:30,330
difficulties for managers much more

00:24:28,499 --> 00:24:33,090
difficult to manage much more

00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:36,330
challenging much more risky than

00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:41,039
traditional physical assets and I'll

00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:41,659
talk about it much later in a few

00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:53,869
minutes

00:24:41,659 --> 00:24:53,869
much more in in a few minutes yeah I

00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:07,799
take I'll take questions questions that

00:25:04,409 --> 00:25:11,490
are clarification right now if something

00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:17,639
is unclear if the methodology is unclear

00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:23,909
the data things like this okay so I

00:25:17,639 --> 00:25:27,119
let's let's wait a little okay why why

00:25:23,909 --> 00:25:29,070
is why is the impact of intangible so

00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:33,409
profound what's what's so different

00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:33,409
about intangibles

00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:42,690
there are several characteristics of

00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:47,149
intangibles that tangible assets don't

00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:47,149
have the first one is scalability

00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:58,930
a recent book that was published on

00:25:54,820 --> 00:26:04,540
intangibles it's a good book capitalism

00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:09,940
without capital gives the example of a

00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:12,880
yoga studio versus Twitter so the

00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:15,910
scalability of a yoga studio scalability

00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:18,400
means how much revenues how much

00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:20,980
business you can create from a resource

00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:24,400
from an asset is of course very limited

00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:26,950
you can have 1520 people at most 18

00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:32,370
hours a day but that's it

00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:36,850
Twitter can scale almost to infinity in

00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:41,400
this case aeroplanes physical assets

00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:46,120
compared to software compared to music

00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:49,090
streamed for managers the major the

00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:52,450
major challenge is how to scale what you

00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:55,300
have so example is of course Amazon that

00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:57,160
opened its platform to basically to

00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:59,440
everyone which was quite controversial

00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:02,020
at the time I remember lots of financial

00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:07,630
analysts following Amazon questioning

00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:10,240
the the how can they do it how can they

00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:12,460
provide even competitors with their own

00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:15,930
platform all these of course it works

00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:19,960
beautifully but that's a great great

00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:22,030
examples or example of scalability when

00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:25,290
you combine this with what's called

00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:25,290
network effect

00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:40,690
by that work fact people mean but for

00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:43,169
example if I have if I have a GE

00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:45,640
refrigerator if someone else buys a

00:27:43,169 --> 00:27:49,690
refrigerator oh I don't really benefit

00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:52,120
from this but if I'm part of of a

00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:54,429
network let's say I'm using an iPhone

00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:56,650
and someone else buys an iPhone there is

00:27:54,429 --> 00:28:00,309
an increase in the total number of users

00:27:56,650 --> 00:28:02,890
more incentives for producers of

00:28:00,309 --> 00:28:06,370
applications for example and things like

00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:09,130
this everyone benefits so when something

00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:12,480
has this kind of a network effect it

00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:16,360
increases exponentially the demand and

00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:18,580
that's how monopolies are created that's

00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:22,140
how you get these huge companies that

00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:25,840
you have now with scalability and

00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:29,260
network effect which creates as you all

00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:32,080
know huge public issues are these really

00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:36,909
monopolies should they be considered

00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:39,010
should they be challenged as monopolist

00:28:36,909 --> 00:28:43,270
traditionally United States monopolies

00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:49,059
were broken up going back early 20th

00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:53,110
century Standard Oil later AT&T they try

00:28:49,059 --> 00:28:56,200
to do it to IBM and unsuccessfully so

00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:57,850
far are no challenges to these huge

00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:00,370
monopolies that we have but there are

00:28:57,850 --> 00:29:04,440
various very serious challenges in

00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:09,190
Europe in the EU very serious challenges

00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:12,039
so that's the that's the first thing

00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:17,340
that distinguishes intangibles from

00:29:12,039 --> 00:29:17,340
others the second is some cost

00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:29,940
with physical assets you very rarely

00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:33,360
have some cost some cost means that the

00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:36,050
entire investment is gone that's it so

00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:39,180
even if you develop a commercial

00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:41,460
commercial project and it's not very

00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:44,700
successful you have only sixty percent

00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:47,820
occupancy it's still there

00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:51,810
it may revive in the future there is a

00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:55,020
huge project used to be project now it's

00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:59,670
a cannery Wharf in London some of you

00:29:55,020 --> 00:30:02,370
may know it it started as a huge failure

00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:04,530
the right one brother brothers who were

00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:06,840
the developers went bankrupt because of

00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:11,270
this project now it's thriving

00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:15,150
he doesn't go away but a drug that fails

00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:18,390
phase 2 clinical test phase 3 clinical

00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:22,800
tests the entire investment is gone

00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:26,760
completely gone some cost main

00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:29,940
consequence of resources with some cost

00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:32,280
is that it increases significantly the

00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:36,860
cost because of the increased

00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:41,100
uncertainty when you can lose everything

00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:46,410
in four enterprises when uncertainty is

00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:49,080
up investment is down significantly so

00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:52,560
this is this is a significant downward

00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:54,660
pressure on investment in intangibles

00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:57,330
they're high risk they're high

00:30:54,660 --> 00:31:01,590
uncertainty particularly the one that

00:30:57,330 --> 00:31:08,340
comes from some cost creates all kinds

00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:11,690
of mail of managerial issues there is

00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:15,720
the issue of fixation with cost of

00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:18,330
managers and I'm sure all of you have

00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:21,140
experienced it at some point in time you

00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:23,760
incur losses but since you already

00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:26,430
invested a lot in the project whether

00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:28,770
it's your own investment in stock or

00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:30,720
corporate investment there is the

00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:33,560
tendency to say let's invest a little

00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:36,320
more and we'll recover the whole

00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:39,860
thing will make it a success the whole

00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:43,280
thing which is a huge mistake when the

00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:45,500
time is come you have to cut incur the

00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:47,750
sound costs but there is always the

00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:50,720
tendency particularly particularly for

00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:53,690
managers for executives of public

00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:55,910
companies when it's sang costs it's a

00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:57,950
loss when it's a loss it decreases

00:31:55,910 --> 00:32:00,140
earnings when it decreases earnings it

00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:03,550
decreases stock price investors and

00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:05,960
board members are starting asking

00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:08,120
embarrassing questions why did you get

00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:10,730
into this project or is always the

00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:14,680
natural tendency psychological tendency

00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:17,300
to continue investing in projects losing

00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:21,770
projects despite the fact that it's time

00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:24,130
to so that's one one managerial issue

00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:28,460
other managerial issues is how to

00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:30,880
contain those sound cost and lots of

00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:34,430
lots of companies are experimenting with

00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:37,700
for example joint venture partnerships

00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:40,520
even with competitors in order to reduce

00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:44,870
the cost of developing something

00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:47,570
diversification working on several many

00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:50,840
like pharmaceutical companies projects

00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:54,280
if one fails to fails well we still go

00:32:50,840 --> 00:33:00,890
on I know there's an acute issue for you

00:32:54,280 --> 00:33:04,100
securitization off of R&D for example

00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:09,440
selling shares on our Indies so that you

00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:14,360
spread the risk among many investors the

00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:17,050
third specific unique characteristic of

00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:17,050
intangibles

00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:31,340
in plain language this is theft meaning

00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:34,100
that with physical assets owners of

00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:38,660
physical assets think about on line with

00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:41,210
airplanes can completely restrict non

00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:43,730
owners from using the assets as long as

00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:45,260
you have an effective police force and

00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:49,700
judicial system

00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:52,220
I don't think executives of Delta

00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:55,070
Airlines are losing sleep that someone

00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:58,330
will steal their airplanes or will still

00:33:55,070 --> 00:34:00,799
sits on their on the airplane with

00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:05,120
intangibles it's entirely different

00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:09,290
relatively easy to invent around there

00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:11,690
are more than 5,000 new patent

00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:16,210
infringement lawsuits in United States

00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:20,659
every year there is a huge amount of

00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:25,760
spill overs from the owners benefits

00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:28,070
spilling to others across countries of

00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:34,460
course a major issue in United States

00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:35,690
others using u.s. technologies and the

00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:37,700
example given in the book that I

00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:41,090
mentioned I like this example of spill

00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:44,419
overs all smartphones look like the

00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:47,090
iPhone they say all of them you don't

00:34:44,419 --> 00:34:51,169
have you don't have smartphones like a

00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:52,669
ball like round like elliptical like all

00:34:51,169 --> 00:34:54,770
they're basically all look the same

00:34:52,669 --> 00:35:00,859
because they all took the design from

00:34:54,770 --> 00:35:05,300
the from the iPhone huge huge managerial

00:35:00,859 --> 00:35:07,670
challenges that managers of intangible

00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:10,940
intensive companies have and tangible

00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:17,359
companies managers don't really have how

00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:22,100
to minimize the spill overs so patenting

00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:23,990
of course it's it's obvious but there

00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:28,540
are many areas in which patents are not

00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:33,550
written off huge huge delay

00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:35,800
today from filing to grant if you are

00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:38,740
granted it's between three and four

00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:43,810
years huge delay that you are basically

00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:46,630
exposed to to this kind of spillover

00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:49,480
so some result to secrecy are the result

00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:55,359
to non-compete which under standard here

00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:58,300
in California it's illegal but the

00:35:55,359 --> 00:36:01,869
spillover is is very serious it also has

00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:04,480
a positive side the paper that this

00:36:01,869 --> 00:36:09,490
comes from that I'm going to present at

00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:12,099
UC Irvine on Friday deals with a law in

00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:17,410
the United States that came into effect

00:36:12,099 --> 00:36:21,660
in 2000 which mandates that the US

00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:26,400
Patent Office will publish patent

00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:29,560
documents eighteen months after filing

00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:32,440
it used to be that the publication was

00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:35,170
only at Grant only where you were

00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:37,839
granted a patent the whole patent

00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:42,040
application which is a huge document

00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:45,250
sometimes 30 40 pages with all the bless

00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:46,810
you all the technical details were

00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:49,599
published now it's published much

00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:53,470
earlier on average 20 months before

00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:55,869
grant and the idea is to promote

00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:57,250
innovation promote sharing of

00:36:55,869 --> 00:37:00,119
information

00:36:57,250 --> 00:37:04,660
it was incredibly controversial the law

00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:05,770
25 Nobel laureates in science in

00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:09,400
economics

00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:12,280
wrote a letter to the Senate objecting

00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:14,790
to this Lord and said that this will be

00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:19,510
a huge disincentive particularly to

00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:23,560
individual inventors to invent but it

00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:28,599
passed and now every every Thursday the

00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:33,010
US Patent Office makes those those 18

00:37:28,599 --> 00:37:35,650
months patents public they are they are

00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:38,590
incredibly revealing in this in this

00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:43,090
paper we have an example of Amazon

00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:46,730
amazon is is very secretive about its

00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:49,550
future course of business what are the

00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:50,930
areas they are going to venturing into

00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:53,480
its own zone

00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:58,580
they never in the in the conference

00:37:53,480 --> 00:38:01,580
calls which are calls with investors the

00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:04,460
main information venue for companies

00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:07,370
today in the conference called Jeff

00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:10,240
Bezos and other executives always said

00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:13,630
you know we don't speak about our

00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:16,760
strategy our future or this our debt

00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:19,250
from the 18 months disclosure you can

00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:23,420
get a very good idea of where they are

00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:26,750
going for example when the first drone

00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:30,280
delivery patterns Amazon patterns came

00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:31,940
out it was clear where they are going in

00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:34,700
this area

00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:36,830
so I'm talking about spillovers what we

00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:39,980
show in this one of the things we show

00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:45,070
in this paper is that there are positive

00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:49,070
spillovers meaning we show that when the

00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:52,570
patent of company X let's say is

00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:57,800
disclosed other companies in the same

00:38:52,570 --> 00:39:00,350
technological area benefit from this

00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:03,140
information investors in other companies

00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:06,050
all of a sudden it becomes clear we're

00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:09,290
not clear but clearer well the whole

00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:11,450
area is going and you can see it from

00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:13,520
the reaction of investors to stock

00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:17,390
prices you can even measure the effect

00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:22,360
of the spillover so it's not all bad but

00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:25,700
for the specific companies it is and the

00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:30,940
fourth characteristic of intangibles

00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:30,940
compared to tangible is no models

00:39:34,569 --> 00:39:41,420
this is of greatest concern to investors

00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:43,640
this is of greatest concern to managers

00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:46,219
there are just no market in intangibles

00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:48,650
there's no market in our indeed there is

00:39:46,219 --> 00:39:51,829
no marketing brand Stephane is nothing

00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:54,729
in human resources there are certain

00:39:51,829 --> 00:39:59,930
transactions Google a year ago bought

00:39:54,729 --> 00:40:02,599
30,000 patents from a company but there

00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:05,509
is no transparency we never know which

00:40:02,599 --> 00:40:08,979
type of patents were bought what was the

00:40:05,509 --> 00:40:13,459
price paid for it so there are no

00:40:08,979 --> 00:40:16,539
transparent markets for for intangibles

00:40:13,459 --> 00:40:20,180
this creates lots of problems because

00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:23,059
valuation by and large is based on

00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:26,329
what's called comparables thinks that

00:40:23,059 --> 00:40:31,130
are similar I remember when he left

00:40:26,329 --> 00:40:34,849
Berkeley to New York we had a nice house

00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:38,170
or several several agents try to compete

00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:42,469
on getting the business one of them came

00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:44,989
with extremely sophisticated market

00:40:42,469 --> 00:40:48,999
analysis in our area we lived on the

00:40:44,989 --> 00:40:53,359
hills in Berkeley our our area

00:40:48,999 --> 00:40:55,999
comparables houses of yours close to

00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:59,779
your size in your neighborhood or

00:40:55,999 --> 00:41:02,799
vicinity and we got a pretty good idea

00:40:59,779 --> 00:41:05,719
of the price of our house from these

00:41:02,799 --> 00:41:08,420
comparables same thing that's how

00:41:05,719 --> 00:41:11,119
investors value new companies like a new

00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:13,839
biotech companies a new IPO they

00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:19,130
compared it to existing companies

00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:24,819
relatively similar product type size and

00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:27,890
others without markets valuation is

00:41:24,819 --> 00:41:31,099
incredibly difficult up to up to

00:41:27,890 --> 00:41:32,869
impossible reason why there are no

00:41:31,099 --> 00:41:36,410
markets in intangibles is that

00:41:32,869 --> 00:41:39,709
intangibles are unique even in for a

00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:44,059
specific industry like mercs patterns

00:41:39,709 --> 00:41:46,630
are very different then Pfizer spelling

00:41:44,059 --> 00:41:50,589
so Eli Lilly patterns

00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:54,880
so unique things it's very difficult to

00:41:50,589 --> 00:41:56,650
trade with them so that this has lots of

00:41:54,880 --> 00:42:00,160
implications particularly for mergers

00:41:56,650 --> 00:42:03,839
and acquisitions acquiring companies in

00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:06,670
high-tech industries is much riskier

00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:08,229
then acquiring in other industries

00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:11,799
because you really don't know the value

00:42:08,229 --> 00:42:13,839
in this case I am now writing a book on

00:42:11,799 --> 00:42:16,739
mergers and acquisitions and one of the

00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:20,140
first results that we have we use a huge

00:42:16,739 --> 00:42:24,130
I'm an empiricist in my my nature all

00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:28,720
all that I do in my work all that I do

00:42:24,130 --> 00:42:32,859
is work with data so we have a database

00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:36,099
of no less than 30 thousands mergers and

00:42:32,859 --> 00:42:39,630
acquisitions all over the world and we

00:42:36,099 --> 00:42:42,549
apply a big model to get to get

00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:45,309
inferences from and one of the first

00:42:42,549 --> 00:42:48,549
interest that we got is that the

00:42:45,309 --> 00:42:50,519
benefits from mergers in high-tech are

00:42:48,549 --> 00:42:52,930
substantial on average of course

00:42:50,519 --> 00:42:57,099
substantially lower than the benefits in

00:42:52,930 --> 00:43:04,029
other areas which are related to the no

00:42:57,099 --> 00:43:05,859
market difficulties in valuing ok I'll

00:43:04,029 --> 00:43:10,829
move to the last topic that I'll cover

00:43:05,859 --> 00:43:16,599
today and that's specifically focus on

00:43:10,829 --> 00:43:22,509
managerial challenges with with managing

00:43:16,599 --> 00:43:26,019
intangibles so I'll start with setting

00:43:22,509 --> 00:43:31,210
setting the benchmark here with the

00:43:26,019 --> 00:43:34,359
objective of an enterprise and I mainly

00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:36,609
mean a business enterprise in this case

00:43:34,359 --> 00:43:41,559
and it's generally agreed that the

00:43:36,609 --> 00:43:47,069
objective is to obtain and sustain

00:43:41,559 --> 00:43:51,569
long-term competitive advantage simple

00:43:47,069 --> 00:43:54,759
you want to succeed within your industry

00:43:51,569 --> 00:43:56,850
it's simple in principle but it's much

00:43:54,759 --> 00:44:03,470
more difficult to of course to

00:43:56,850 --> 00:44:03,470
to maintain in reality competition is

00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:15,230
severe in many areas it's difficult but

00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:17,850
keeping with this idea of long term

00:44:15,230 --> 00:44:23,360
sustainable competitive advantage how is

00:44:17,850 --> 00:44:28,790
this done and it's done by having and

00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:28,790
successfully deploying strategic assets

00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:38,610
these are very different than the asset

00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:41,810
that most people think about like

00:44:38,610 --> 00:44:45,420
machines and and buildings and land

00:44:41,810 --> 00:44:52,500
strategic assets have three qualities

00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:54,690
three attributes one is benefit that's

00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:57,000
the most obvious they they promise

00:44:54,690 --> 00:45:02,720
benefits in the future if not it's not

00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:02,720
an asset second one is limited supply

00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:15,130
like wireless spectrum and it doesn't

00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:18,850
have to be intangible like landing

00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:22,030
rights of Airlines for example these are

00:45:18,850 --> 00:45:24,490
all assets with limited supply because

00:45:22,030 --> 00:45:27,160
if the supply is unlimited all your

00:45:24,490 --> 00:45:28,990
competitors will have access to it you

00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:31,900
won't be able to distinguish yourself

00:45:28,990 --> 00:45:46,150
from the competitors so limited supply

00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:49,720
and the third one different for

00:45:46,150 --> 00:45:53,710
competitors to basically imitate we

00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:56,170
create in this case like Google's search

00:45:53,710 --> 00:46:00,190
engine may take you 20 years to get

00:45:56,170 --> 00:46:05,110
where they are and these are the assets

00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:07,540
that today create value physical assets

00:46:05,110 --> 00:46:10,570
don't create any value because all your

00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:13,390
competitors have the same assets all

00:46:10,570 --> 00:46:16,300
pharmaceutical companies have the best

00:46:13,390 --> 00:46:18,340
laboratory equipment from laboratory

00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:23,380
equipment you cannot create you cannot

00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:27,720
distinguish yourself in within your

00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:31,750
competition set those are the ones that

00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:35,110
create value and the question is how do

00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:39,100
you manage these assets very difficult

00:46:35,110 --> 00:46:42,640
to manage so I just in brief I have

00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:46,870
about 10 15 minutes I'll mention the

00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:50,350
main parameters of managing in an

00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:54,690
intangible economy managing intangible

00:46:50,350 --> 00:46:54,690
intensive asset first one

00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:07,750
you'll be surprised to know that many

00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:10,960
companies don't know the strategic asset

00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:14,530
do you have for example do you have a

00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:15,720
brand most people even don't know what

00:47:14,530 --> 00:47:20,650
the brand is

00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:23,890
they confuse brand with a name so

00:47:20,650 --> 00:47:26,830
Polaroid is a very well-known name some

00:47:23,890 --> 00:47:29,170
of you may even remember the camera in

00:47:26,830 --> 00:47:33,180
this case definite a brand because there

00:47:29,170 --> 00:47:36,970
the film went bankrupt many years ago

00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:39,430
Xerox is definitely a very known name I

00:47:36,970 --> 00:47:43,540
wouldn't say it's a brand they hardly

00:47:39,430 --> 00:47:51,760
compete within the industry that they

00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:55,119
are Bayer Aspirin is a brand a brand is

00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:59,290
something that allows its owner to

00:47:55,119 --> 00:48:04,390
charge premium price that's that that's

00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:07,330
the economic test of a brand and Bayer

00:48:04,390 --> 00:48:11,410
Aspirin is more expensive than all the

00:48:07,330 --> 00:48:13,930
generic despite the fact that aspirin is

00:48:11,410 --> 00:48:17,530
a very simple formula there is no doubt

00:48:13,930 --> 00:48:21,550
that generic are as good as beer lots of

00:48:17,530 --> 00:48:25,990
people insist on buying Bayer Aspirin

00:48:21,550 --> 00:48:29,530
that's a brand you pay for something

00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:31,980
special unless you can charge more than

00:48:29,530 --> 00:48:35,339
your competitors you don't have a brand

00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:38,890
you may think you do but you don't I

00:48:35,339 --> 00:48:42,640
recently saw a beautiful dissertation

00:48:38,890 --> 00:48:47,349
from MIT PhD dissertation and the person

00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:51,160
actually estimated the value of Amazon's

00:48:47,349 --> 00:48:54,490
brand it's beautiful he got access to

00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:58,480
one of those baths that compare book

00:48:54,490 --> 00:49:02,859
prices and he had like like half a

00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:08,710
million purchases of books in which the

00:49:02,859 --> 00:49:11,470
customer compared Amazon's of with three

00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:14,109
or four others so these are price

00:49:11,470 --> 00:49:15,010
conscious people unlike me I go straight

00:49:14,109 --> 00:49:17,260
to Amazon

00:49:15,010 --> 00:49:22,420
when I don't compare it with anybody

00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:26,619
else but they all compared Amazon book

00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:30,850
the same book all of them knew how to

00:49:26,619 --> 00:49:35,440
cover Amazon in 72 percent of the cases

00:49:30,850 --> 00:49:38,770
Amazon charge more than competitors so

00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:41,109
so you could buy definitely a cheaper

00:49:38,770 --> 00:49:44,080
book in most of these cases nevertheless

00:49:41,109 --> 00:49:49,920
like like 80% of the people bought from

00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:53,710
Amazon that's a brand willingness to pay

00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:56,830
conscientiously pay more because of

00:49:53,710 --> 00:49:59,730
something better delivery better

00:49:56,830 --> 00:50:02,380
protection of your credit card whatever

00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:06,250
that's that's a brand he was also able

00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:09,490
to actually value the brand by the price

00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:12,100
differential of Amazon from the closest

00:50:09,490 --> 00:50:14,109
competitors times the number of the

00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:16,869
average the average differential times

00:50:14,109 --> 00:50:19,810
the numbers of book that they sell and

00:50:16,869 --> 00:50:25,140
he got the value of the brand that's how

00:50:19,810 --> 00:50:29,380
you you value brands in this case so

00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:31,750
knowing knowing you're the the strategic

00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:35,619
assets that you have those assets that

00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:39,630
create value is extremely important and

00:50:35,619 --> 00:50:41,890
what value they create like

00:50:39,630 --> 00:50:45,220
recommendation algorithm recently I

00:50:41,890 --> 00:50:50,640
heard the CEO of Netflix saying that

00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:53,500
more than 80% of all streaming Netflix

00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:56,650
basically are basically generated by the

00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:59,140
recommendation algorithm it's a huge

00:50:56,650 --> 00:51:02,650
value creator in this case this is

00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:05,770
definitely a valuable asset so the first

00:51:02,650 --> 00:51:08,520
thing that you should do as a manager

00:51:05,770 --> 00:51:12,820
whether it's profit or not-for-profit

00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:15,660
what are the assets that create value in

00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:18,790
your organization second thing

00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:18,790
[Music]

00:51:32,069 --> 00:51:36,579
investments or resource allocations you

00:51:34,569 --> 00:51:39,369
always have limited resources within the

00:51:36,579 --> 00:51:41,319
company the enterprise how do you

00:51:39,369 --> 00:51:44,109
allocate to spend more now Randy or less

00:51:41,319 --> 00:51:46,119
on R&D it's a basic question really no

00:51:44,109 --> 00:51:48,069
one knows how to solve this question

00:51:46,119 --> 00:51:53,589
absolutely Noah

00:51:48,069 --> 00:51:58,029
I was hired several years ago by DuPont

00:51:53,589 --> 00:52:00,819
to exactly answer this question and they

00:51:58,029 --> 00:52:01,990
wanted me they have the head at the time

00:52:00,819 --> 00:52:03,910
now they are going through a

00:52:01,990 --> 00:52:07,930
reorganization I'm not sure but at the

00:52:03,910 --> 00:52:10,059
time they had three types of R&D with

00:52:07,930 --> 00:52:12,999
more than a billion dollars investment a

00:52:10,059 --> 00:52:15,700
year three types of R&D are in the aim

00:52:12,999 --> 00:52:18,339
that prod new products and to our Andy

00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:22,150
aimed at containing cost this is called

00:52:18,339 --> 00:52:26,289
process R&D for fixed costs for variable

00:52:22,150 --> 00:52:30,039
cost and also wanted me to evaluate the

00:52:26,289 --> 00:52:32,829
brand most of the big names that you

00:52:30,039 --> 00:52:36,130
Pont have like nylon and like whether

00:52:32,829 --> 00:52:39,489
they developed off patent decades so

00:52:36,130 --> 00:52:42,759
they compete and spend lots of money on

00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:45,130
brand enhancement so they basically

00:52:42,759 --> 00:52:49,390
wanted me to answer the question what is

00:52:45,130 --> 00:52:53,710
the return on a dollar invested in one

00:52:49,390 --> 00:52:55,630
two three types of R&D and it I was

00:52:53,710 --> 00:52:58,539
convinced that a company of this size

00:52:55,630 --> 00:53:01,960
and they exist more than 150 years they

00:52:58,539 --> 00:53:04,749
have lots of studies of this type I

00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:07,239
didn't want to invent the wheel so when

00:53:04,749 --> 00:53:09,759
I met with them I said show me the

00:53:07,239 --> 00:53:13,059
previous studies that you have I want to

00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:14,799
build on something said we we never did

00:53:13,059 --> 00:53:17,289
such a thing they said we have lots of

00:53:14,799 --> 00:53:19,869
case studies he said we have a whole

00:53:17,289 --> 00:53:22,989
room of case studies how lycra was

00:53:19,869 --> 00:53:26,319
developed our nylon was developed but we

00:53:22,989 --> 00:53:29,230
never we never did it and I I did it

00:53:26,319 --> 00:53:30,999
with with a PhD student it was one of

00:53:29,230 --> 00:53:32,350
the most interesting consulting jobs

00:53:30,999 --> 00:53:35,350
that I had

00:53:32,350 --> 00:53:38,020
in my life and we actually estimated

00:53:35,350 --> 00:53:41,170
what what we had what we had they had

00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:43,750
very good records they didn't know how

00:53:41,170 --> 00:53:45,760
much they get from R&D but they had very

00:53:43,750 --> 00:53:47,740
good records for every year they had

00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:50,380
records of new products that were

00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:54,400
developed and products that were

00:53:50,380 --> 00:53:57,580
modified in a big way we defined what is

00:53:54,400 --> 00:54:00,640
small modification large modification we

00:53:57,580 --> 00:54:03,970
had they had the our indeed they had the

00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:06,600
cash flows from each product usually

00:54:03,970 --> 00:54:10,990
increasing for several years and then a

00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:13,420
decay so we actually computed classic

00:54:10,990 --> 00:54:16,720
return on investment how much do you get

00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:19,270
on down and the results were eye-opening

00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:20,170
on some types of our indeed the return

00:54:19,270 --> 00:54:22,450
was huge

00:54:20,170 --> 00:54:25,690
other types so already the returns were

00:54:22,450 --> 00:54:28,090
very low now I remember when I presented

00:54:25,690 --> 00:54:32,530
this project to the board of DuPont it

00:54:28,090 --> 00:54:36,820
was slated between 1:00 and 2:30 seven

00:54:32,530 --> 00:54:39,280
o'clock they still debated this thing

00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:41,230
because they went really to details what

00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:43,480
will happen if we'll take 200 million

00:54:41,230 --> 00:54:45,100
dollars from this type of R&D to this

00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:48,460
type of only that's the question of

00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:51,490
resource allocation what will be the

00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:55,450
ramification on the R&D that goes down

00:54:51,490 --> 00:54:57,400
and goes up this was in a very plush

00:54:55,450 --> 00:54:59,890
Country Club so at seven o clock I

00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:02,140
remember the door opens someone came and

00:54:59,890 --> 00:55:04,690
said we cannot continue reheating dinner

00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:08,260
it will be completely destroyed you have

00:55:04,690 --> 00:55:11,350
to finish and dinner I said with several

00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:13,500
several board members said you know why

00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:16,690
why this was so interesting to us and

00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:20,020
I'm sorry I'm using this language you

00:55:16,690 --> 00:55:22,060
said you didn't he said usually

00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:25,020
get people coming to our saying you know

00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:27,850
the pound has to be more environmental

00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:29,650
DuPont has to be more tasty part of the

00:55:27,850 --> 00:55:31,840
motive we don't know how to deal with

00:55:29,650 --> 00:55:34,930
these issues you came with numbers and

00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:37,060
with numbers we can deal and that's the

00:55:34,930 --> 00:55:41,530
great important whether you're for

00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:43,720
profit not-for-profit having numbers on

00:55:41,530 --> 00:55:45,880
which to base

00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:48,359
sessions so this is these are the

00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:50,980
critical issues of resource allocation

00:55:48,359 --> 00:55:55,540
but not have much time I just mentioned

00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:57,480
another project Swiss Re is this either

00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:59,230
the largest or second largest

00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:02,160
reinsurance company in the world

00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:05,740
reinsurance our companies that insure

00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:07,540
insurance companies you think that you

00:56:05,740 --> 00:56:10,599
have an insurance company they use

00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:15,550
dalish basically sell your insurance to

00:56:10,599 --> 00:56:19,119
another company to spread the risk so IT

00:56:15,550 --> 00:56:21,510
people from reading to from Swiss we

00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:24,460
that's the name of the company Swiss we

00:56:21,510 --> 00:56:25,170
came to me and said we are in big

00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:28,810
trouble

00:56:25,170 --> 00:56:30,730
that's how they define it and I said

00:56:28,810 --> 00:56:34,990
okay you know I'm also in trouble but

00:56:30,730 --> 00:56:37,990
what's your trouble they said every year

00:56:34,990 --> 00:56:40,540
we get an increase in our budget this

00:56:37,990 --> 00:56:42,730
year and it's a huge budget for an

00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:45,940
insurance company the IT budget this

00:56:42,730 --> 00:56:48,369
year the board said no increase until

00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:51,280
you bring us a study that you provide

00:56:48,369 --> 00:56:54,130
any benefit to the company and it's

00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:59,859
difficult it's it's easy to measure the

00:56:54,130 --> 00:57:04,300
benefits that salespeople provide but IT

00:56:59,859 --> 00:57:08,200
is a internal service it's not easy to

00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:12,849
measure the benefits of IT but we

00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:14,740
developed a model and we used 160

00:57:12,849 --> 00:57:19,240
insurance companies in the world in

00:57:14,740 --> 00:57:25,000
order to isolate the contribution of IT

00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:28,089
to the sales growth of the company so

00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:32,830
these things can be done they require

00:57:28,089 --> 00:57:36,130
some imagination thinking sometimes

00:57:32,830 --> 00:57:38,470
somewhat more advanced statistics but

00:57:36,130 --> 00:57:43,030
measurements can be applied even to

00:57:38,470 --> 00:57:48,030
these fuzzy types of assets third thing

00:57:43,030 --> 00:57:48,030
is preserving

00:57:52,520 --> 00:58:03,630
I mentioned it already the spill overs

00:57:59,270 --> 00:58:12,510
intangibles can can vanish can really

00:58:03,630 --> 00:58:15,180
vanish and huge efforts being invested

00:58:12,510 --> 00:58:19,080
in the preservations of these incidents

00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:22,650
in intelligence about what competitors

00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:25,400
are doing what kind of disruptions can

00:58:22,650 --> 00:58:30,020
come that's why people go to conferences

00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:34,200
to hear about new things to talk with

00:58:30,020 --> 00:58:38,100
with others but he'll - you have to be

00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:40,200
imaginative several years ago several

00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:44,100
executives of Dow Chemical came to me

00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:47,310
and they really post one of the most

00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:52,790
interesting questions that I got they

00:58:47,310 --> 00:58:56,490
said we have thousands of joint ventures

00:58:52,790 --> 00:59:00,410
alliances with other companies and we

00:58:56,490 --> 00:59:05,430
suspect that lots of knowledge Dow

00:59:00,410 --> 00:59:08,970
knowledge is basically being being taken

00:59:05,430 --> 00:59:10,850
by by our partners and it's natural you

00:59:08,970 --> 00:59:13,890
know in each of these alliances

00:59:10,850 --> 00:59:16,710
executives of Dow an executive of the of

00:59:13,890 --> 00:59:19,950
the partner meet and sometimes have

00:59:16,710 --> 00:59:21,930
drinks in the evening and they usually

00:59:19,950 --> 00:59:26,100
ask you know what are you currently

00:59:21,930 --> 00:59:27,990
working on what this and that it's very

00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:29,730
very awkward to say you know I cannot

00:59:27,990 --> 00:59:33,000
speak about it I'm not going to say

00:59:29,730 --> 00:59:35,790
about it so they say the question they

00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:39,180
posed me is how can we defend ourselves

00:59:35,790 --> 00:59:44,630
how can we eliminate those joint

00:59:39,180 --> 00:59:48,620
ventures that we basically lose lose

00:59:44,630 --> 00:59:51,720
knowledge to and what what we did is

00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:57,900
based on patents this is now very very

00:59:51,720 --> 01:00:01,220
developed data on parent you can you can

00:59:57,900 --> 01:00:02,730
characterize the technical technological

01:00:01,220 --> 01:00:07,220
areas

01:00:02,730 --> 01:00:11,339
in which thou is in the US Patent Office

01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:14,730
classifies all patterns into 400 I think

01:00:11,339 --> 01:00:17,339
eighty technological area so this is a

01:00:14,730 --> 01:00:21,530
very well defined classification system

01:00:17,339 --> 01:00:27,869
so you have those area we mapped the

01:00:21,530 --> 01:00:32,060
partners areas before they became thou

01:00:27,869 --> 01:00:36,050
partners and after and then we looked at

01:00:32,060 --> 01:00:39,210
changes in the technological area

01:00:36,050 --> 01:00:42,599
converging of the partners converging on

01:00:39,210 --> 01:00:45,000
Dow and in many cases there were very

01:00:42,599 --> 01:00:48,900
significant changes you could see that a

01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:52,050
year after the joint venture was set up

01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:55,290
this partner started to do things that

01:00:52,050 --> 01:00:59,570
are very similar to what Dow is doing

01:00:55,290 --> 01:01:01,859
and they use this to basically eliminate

01:00:59,570 --> 01:01:05,130
quite a few of the you know basically

01:01:01,859 --> 01:01:08,270
close those joint ventures so lots of

01:01:05,130 --> 01:01:19,349
things can be done in this area of

01:01:08,270 --> 01:01:21,690
preserving operate unfortunately where

01:01:19,349 --> 01:01:23,849
we're at time I'm not really sure how

01:01:21,690 --> 01:01:29,310
long we can go ahead and keep streaming

01:01:23,849 --> 01:01:32,400
I've two minute okay my but that's okay

01:01:29,310 --> 01:01:37,790
I can stop here do we do we have two

01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:41,069
minutes on video yeah okay thank you no

01:01:37,790 --> 01:01:43,859
deploy deploying asset how you deploy

01:01:41,069 --> 01:01:46,730
your synthetic asset is an incredibly

01:01:43,859 --> 01:01:50,250
important thing some of you may know

01:01:46,730 --> 01:01:54,960
you're too young to be there at the time

01:01:50,250 --> 01:01:59,060
that IBM in the early 90s was really

01:01:54,960 --> 01:02:01,380
almost gone and then they got a new CEO

01:01:59,060 --> 01:02:04,410
surprisingly not even from technology

01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:06,210
Lou Gerstner but he was an incredible

01:02:04,410 --> 01:02:09,240
CEO you don't have to understand

01:02:06,210 --> 01:02:12,930
technology to be a good CEO and he

01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:15,840
completely revived IBM

01:02:12,930 --> 01:02:18,180
he later when he when he retired in 2001

01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:22,800
- I wrote a best-seller book even

01:02:18,180 --> 01:02:24,390
elephants can dance no changing IBM but

01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:27,360
the main thing he did one of the main

01:02:24,390 --> 01:02:32,280
thing he did was they showed him all the

01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:35,370
all the beautiful development centers of

01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:39,180
IBM IBM gets more patents they get like

01:02:35,370 --> 01:02:42,750
2025 patents a day a day more patents

01:02:39,180 --> 01:02:45,120
than most countries in the world so they

01:02:42,750 --> 01:02:48,510
showed him all these these centers and

01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:50,010
patents and he was just a businessman so

01:02:48,510 --> 01:02:52,050
he asked you know what are we going

01:02:50,010 --> 01:02:55,380
after we do pick withhold his patents

01:02:52,050 --> 01:02:57,900
say well you know some we develop how

01:02:55,380 --> 01:03:01,020
many do we develop we said about four to

01:02:57,900 --> 01:03:04,800
five percent and the rest as I said

01:03:01,020 --> 01:03:08,850
nothing so he said from now on or any

01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:12,360
pattern that is not developed or slated

01:03:08,850 --> 01:03:16,050
soon to be developed is out either sold

01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:17,820
or licensed so there was mayhem at first

01:03:16,050 --> 01:03:21,240
you know we are going to benefit our

01:03:17,820 --> 01:03:25,020
competitors all these nonsense he

01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:27,840
shrugged all this thing more than 20% of

01:03:25,020 --> 01:03:32,910
IBM's earnings come from comes from

01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:36,720
selling licensing knowledge it's amazing

01:03:32,910 --> 01:03:39,210
what you can get by deploying smartly

01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:41,730
the assets that you have in this case

01:03:39,210 --> 01:03:44,700
and the last one which I won't get into

01:03:41,730 --> 01:03:47,660
because of time is measuring

01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:47,660
contribution

01:03:57,570 --> 01:04:02,700
by this I mean measuring the

01:04:00,050 --> 01:04:06,090
contribution of the assets

01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:09,120
well deployed accounting measurements as

01:04:06,090 --> 01:04:11,940
we saw completely inappropriate in this

01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:13,620
case we devised in a recent book that I

01:04:11,940 --> 01:04:16,290
wrote with the co-author we devised a

01:04:13,620 --> 01:04:19,500
new measure and I can give you a

01:04:16,290 --> 01:04:22,230
reference to it if you want which works

01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:26,810
much better than that but that's there

01:04:22,230 --> 01:04:31,020
this that's the essence of managing

01:04:26,810 --> 01:04:34,540
intangible assets and that's what I

01:04:31,020 --> 01:04:40,800
wanted to talk about today thank you

01:04:34,540 --> 01:04:40,800
[Applause]

01:04:47,340 --> 01:04:56,550
oh sorry about that thank you so much

01:04:53,430 --> 01:04:58,530
for coming dr. Lev we really appreciate

01:04:56,550 --> 01:05:00,840
here there's quite a few questions that

01:04:58,530 --> 01:05:02,820
have backed up in the channel but I know

01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:05,790
everybody how it well not everybody but

01:05:02,820 --> 01:05:07,980
some people may have things to run off

01:05:05,790 --> 01:05:09,120
with do we have a little yeah we have

01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:15,240
maybe five minutes to take some

01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:16,590
questions I guess a question that's kind

01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:26,040
of underlying some of the things in the

01:05:16,590 --> 01:05:28,500
channel is around maybe unpacking right

01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:29,730
it's in the other it's in the upstarts

01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:31,620
in the slack channel and not in the

01:05:29,730 --> 01:05:32,670
there's a few channels that I that they

01:05:31,620 --> 01:05:36,090
were mounted in here and unfortunately

01:05:32,670 --> 01:05:39,600
I'm not Diane who is our normal monitor

01:05:36,090 --> 01:05:40,710
person well let me just ask anybody in

01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:48,990
the room does anybody in the room have a

01:05:40,710 --> 01:05:52,050
question quick question so you said sunk

01:05:48,990 --> 01:05:53,820
costs was a huge part of how you view

01:05:52,050 --> 01:05:57,120
intangible assets I'm curious as to how

01:05:53,820 --> 01:05:58,950
you view the relationship between sunk

01:05:57,120 --> 01:06:01,170
costs and opportunity costs like are

01:05:58,950 --> 01:06:02,850
there certain situations where you would

01:06:01,170 --> 01:06:04,590
go against that as being one of your

01:06:02,850 --> 01:06:10,290
main principles if the opportunity cost

01:06:04,590 --> 01:06:12,930
was great enough some cost I defined

01:06:10,290 --> 01:06:17,910
opportunity cost is usually defined as

01:06:12,930 --> 01:06:21,720
the opportunity that you gave up in

01:06:17,910 --> 01:06:25,230
doing something so if I invest in Amazon

01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:28,530
I could have invested in another company

01:06:25,230 --> 01:06:32,700
about the same risk level if the average

01:06:28,530 --> 01:06:35,850
return on this company is 10% that was

01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:38,460
my opportunity cost I expect from Amazon

01:06:35,850 --> 01:06:43,110
to get more than the 10% that's why I

01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:45,060
invested in Amazon so I don't see how

01:06:43,110 --> 01:06:47,430
they are linked the Suncoast an

01:06:45,060 --> 01:06:52,080
opportunity cost of real cost is what I

01:06:47,430 --> 01:06:55,830
could have gained if I hadn't made this

01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:58,280
specific decision which is the cost to

01:06:55,830 --> 01:07:02,000
be compared with the benefits of

01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:04,610
decision that I made if I don't get more

01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:07,130
benefits that that I lost and I

01:07:04,610 --> 01:07:09,650
definitely made a bad decision in this

01:07:07,130 --> 01:07:12,380
case opportunity some costs are costs

01:07:09,650 --> 01:07:14,930
that you already incurred you already

01:07:12,380 --> 01:07:17,630
pay you paid already two and a half

01:07:14,930 --> 01:07:19,760
billion dollars to develop a drug it was

01:07:17,630 --> 01:07:23,150
quite successful in tests then it comes

01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:27,680
to phase three clinical tests the most

01:07:23,150 --> 01:07:31,220
advanced the largest human sample and it

01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:35,270
fails in this case basically the whole

01:07:31,220 --> 01:07:38,660
project is done in this case and your

01:07:35,270 --> 01:07:41,090
investment is gone some people split

01:07:38,660 --> 01:07:44,590
hair and say that you you also learn

01:07:41,090 --> 01:07:47,960
from mistakes it's not completely gone

01:07:44,590 --> 01:07:51,140
you know now what not to do in the

01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:53,240
future so maybe it's not a total loss

01:07:51,140 --> 01:07:59,690
it's only ninety percent loss but this

01:07:53,240 --> 01:08:02,390
this is some cost okay so I guess the

01:07:59,690 --> 01:08:07,310
other what I was trying to get at is at

01:08:02,390 --> 01:08:09,590
Mozilla we're very we lean into the idea

01:08:07,310 --> 01:08:13,130
of spillover we we like building

01:08:09,590 --> 01:08:16,760
community we share we have open source

01:08:13,130 --> 01:08:18,620
projects so a question is do you have

01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:21,230
thoughts about that just as a general

01:08:18,620 --> 01:08:23,810
topic or do you have thoughts about how

01:08:21,230 --> 01:08:28,250
return on investment might be calculated

01:08:23,810 --> 01:08:29,120
differently if you consider that I don't

01:08:28,250 --> 01:08:30,589
know does that impact the way that

01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:35,240
you're doing calculation for a return on

01:08:30,589 --> 01:08:37,580
investment maybe it it doesn't impact

01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:41,990
the return on investment in principle it

01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:44,990
impacts the end result of the

01:08:41,990 --> 01:08:46,960
computation because the more the more

01:08:44,990 --> 01:08:50,830
the spillover

01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:53,660
the fuel the benefits that that you get

01:08:50,830 --> 01:08:56,780
so if you have a fixed investment in a

01:08:53,660 --> 01:08:59,299
project and you have awfully low

01:08:56,780 --> 01:09:02,240
benefits you will have a very low return

01:08:59,299 --> 01:09:04,520
in this case the more the more you can

01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:07,310
capture maybe from a social point of

01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:09,239
view it's it's not very conducive but

01:09:07,310 --> 01:09:14,319
the more you can capture

01:09:09,239 --> 01:09:16,210
then the higher will be the return is

01:09:14,319 --> 01:09:18,100
there a sense I guess of how how to

01:09:16,210 --> 01:09:19,900
account for the timing of that that if

01:09:18,100 --> 01:09:21,639
you there's a sense that by embracing

01:09:19,900 --> 01:09:23,679
the fact that there's gonna be spillover

01:09:21,639 --> 01:09:25,630
any way that you can capture the return

01:09:23,679 --> 01:09:27,130
on investment further down the the road

01:09:25,630 --> 01:09:28,750
but we're maybe not we don't have the

01:09:27,130 --> 01:09:30,880
mechanisms by which we can do that

01:09:28,750 --> 01:09:32,560
currently usually usually if they'll

01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:34,569
spill over to the beginning they'll be

01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:36,759
even more spill overs at the end there's

01:09:34,569 --> 01:09:39,310
no I'm not familiar with the process

01:09:36,759 --> 01:09:41,710
that gets with lots of spill overs

01:09:39,310 --> 01:09:44,080
meaning you have you have lots of other

01:09:41,710 --> 01:09:46,449
people's benefiting from your investment

01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:47,529
and then at some point in time three

01:09:46,449 --> 01:09:49,989
years in the future

01:09:47,529 --> 01:09:52,569
all of them are abandoning their

01:09:49,989 --> 01:09:54,969
technology and giving back to you all

01:09:52,569 --> 01:09:59,440
the knowledge I'm not familiar with such

01:09:54,969 --> 01:10:00,940
cases most most companies try and that

01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:04,510
that's the whole idea of course of

01:10:00,940 --> 01:10:08,469
patents most companies try to restrict

01:10:04,510 --> 01:10:13,630
to contain as much as possible to spill

01:10:08,469 --> 01:10:15,310
over okay thank you I'm half listening

01:10:13,630 --> 01:10:17,500
and half trying to scan for the

01:10:15,310 --> 01:10:20,199
questions you're um I'm thinking maybe

01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:22,119
we're out of time for live questions but

01:10:20,199 --> 01:10:25,869
we can put some answers up on the wiki

01:10:22,119 --> 01:10:27,429
are there other questions in the room if

01:10:25,869 --> 01:10:30,210
not I think we're gonna call it thank

01:10:27,429 --> 01:10:30,210
you so much again

01:10:31,790 --> 01:10:36,149
