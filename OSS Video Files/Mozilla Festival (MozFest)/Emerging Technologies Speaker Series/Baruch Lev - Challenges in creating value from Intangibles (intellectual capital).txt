Not all investments yield measurable revenues. For example we at Mozilla invest in our community relationships, in educational efforts, and in policy work. When we do this, we're building intangible assets.

Baruch Lev will speak about intangible assets: their special attributes, the problems they create for measurement systems (at all levels), and the considerable economic value they create. Baruch will help us begin to understand how to think about these kinds of resource allocation decisions.

He has been seminal in the work done in this area, writing "Intangibles," which carefully defined how knowledge, relationships, brand, and similar assets are fundamentally different than things like buildings and product inventory.
