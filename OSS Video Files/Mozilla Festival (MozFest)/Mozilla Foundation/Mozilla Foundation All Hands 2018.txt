so welcome back everybody this is our

00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:10,889
interactive and different plenary so

00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:12,420
that quick question is how many people

00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:15,000
have been to a plenary at one of our all

00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:16,529
hands before keep your hand up if you

00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,180
think they're really interactive and

00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:25,920
engaging the last one was not bad Thank

00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:28,560
You Josh so he got a half from Josh this

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,929
is an upgraded format but we're

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,180
iterating so last time we did a mofo

00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:35,670
only all hands which now we're iterating

00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,840
by doing a mode for plenary last time

00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:38,610
now it's an all-hands

00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,219
but we are gonna do the same thing we're

00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:43,739
gonna really look at our issues and the

00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:46,289
work we're doing through staff and

00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:47,610
fellows you already got the update in

00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:51,180
the Town Hall the other day this is

00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:52,829
really just kind of reflection and also

00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:55,770
there is going to be a participatory

00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:57,899
part which today and Jan will run and

00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:00,210
where we all get to be part of the

00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:03,480
plenary so we'll get to that in about 45

00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:06,210
minutes but just you know to kick off on

00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:14,159
the theme of reflection I kind of and

00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:16,710
now we're gonna talk about product you

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,560
know I have this real sense of worry and

00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:22,020
the sense of hope right now for our work

00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,689
and you know rather than just start

00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:26,970
listing off kind of things about

00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:30,119
Cambridge analytical and GDP are is that

00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:32,189
like how do I talk about that feeling of

00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:34,650
worry and hope right now so actually did

00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:37,439
go and look into pocket and I just gonna

00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:39,630
take you through the last seven articles

00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,700
that I bookmarked because they actually

00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:43,619
really had both of that they had to

00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,720
worry and they had to hope in it but

00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:47,729
also deeply some focus and like oh yeah

00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,439
this is the conversation we're in right

00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:51,060
now and I warned you one of them is that

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:55,890
actually in the last seven I added it

00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:57,479
for effect so first one Renee's gonna

00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:00,180
talk about this article so I'm not gonna

00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:03,810
go into depth on it but we all feel this

00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:07,350
sense that something big has grown this

00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:09,450
ad based surveillance economy it is at

00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:10,950
the heart of so much of what we are

00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:13,730
concerned about in terms of Internet

00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:15,620
health and you hear a lot about that

00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:17,720
people talk about and it's actually in

00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:20,540
many ways I get the many times I get the

00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:22,790
feeling that it's beyond what we could

00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:24,349
have imagined beyond what even DARPA

00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:26,900
could have imagined so we'll hear a

00:02:24,349 --> 00:02:29,450
little bit about that burn and the other

00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:32,120
thing I look marked and that was Renee's

00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:34,670
article wired from about two weeks ago I

00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:37,310
read this piece of ice the other day

00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:39,950
which is this journalist who decided to

00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:42,019
just like think it's weird that I see

00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:43,430
making ads like when I just I'm talking

00:02:42,019 --> 00:02:45,170
to friends about things that I have

00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:48,170
never typed anywhere on the internet and

00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:51,190
is that real and we went out and did a

00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:54,519
test and turns out it is incredibly real

00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:58,609
that the same kind of hello Google or

00:02:54,519 --> 00:03:00,620
you know serious or Alexa this trigger

00:02:58,609 --> 00:03:02,690
words lots of people are building that

00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:05,060
into other apps because you've given the

00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:07,519
microphone permissions and that actually

00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:08,930
is driving at us it was weird that the

00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,870
journalist conclusion was don't really

00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:14,989
worry about it so I do encourage you to

00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:20,900
go read that there might be a campaign

00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:22,669
there and this is the one that I snuck

00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:25,099
in is in my pocket but it wasn't in the

00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:28,430
last seven is the article black that

00:03:25,099 --> 00:03:30,590
Lynette who's one of our fellows did in

00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:33,440
quartz a little while ago in early April

00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:35,900
and unfortunately Lynette wasn't able to

00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,459
get here for visa issues which is a you

00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:39,889
know sad about because she was actually

00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:41,209
going to talk after Renee one of the

00:03:39,889 --> 00:03:44,450
things she was going to talk about is

00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:46,549
how the issues like Cambridge analytic

00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:48,530
are the growth of the platforms the

00:03:46,549 --> 00:03:52,700
impact of the ad based surveillance

00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:54,560
economy on democracy exist in other

00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:56,870
parts of the world outside of the u.s.

00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,660
outside of Europe you know all across

00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:01,340
Africa it seems in particular the Kenyan

00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:03,379
and the Nigerian elections that she

00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:05,870
talks about in this article having some

00:04:03,379 --> 00:04:09,200
of the same challenges around

00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:11,299
misinformation is also different and in

00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,400
particular this came up as we were doing

00:04:11,299 --> 00:04:15,609
some of our campaigns delete facebook

00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:18,560
which is one campaign that emerged

00:04:15,609 --> 00:04:20,479
around Cambridge and Lucca is there an

00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,300
option for people whose whole internet

00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:24,680
news Facebook especially if you know

00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:27,590
they're using free basics and that's the

00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:30,390
only way they get it on so really

00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:32,640
kind of look at how to think about the

00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:35,190
things same and different just important

00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:37,140
to us in building a global movement and

00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:38,670
then there are actually two articles

00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:42,270
that were in my last seven on China

00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:44,130
which is a growing number one the China

00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:46,410
is increasingly becoming an export

00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:49,470
economy for its version of Silicon

00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:51,180
Valley it's not just an opt-out Silicon

00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:54,990
Valley but in this case it's that

00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:59,100
they've sold Zimbabwe the Chinese sold

00:04:54,990 --> 00:05:02,400
about way it's recognition system as a

00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:04,380
way to then get gather more African data

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,700
in terms of you know how its facial

00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:07,950
recognition system works but it's being

00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:10,320
rolled out commercially across Zimbabwe

00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:11,820
and I actually saw the other day I was

00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,400
just showing Steven the break I was in a

00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:17,370
ball in Toronto and you know where you

00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:20,310
barely see Apple pay in Canada but there

00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:23,070
was an alley pay in a WeChat pay their

00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:25,640
ball which was pretty interesting to see

00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:29,430
that you know as something sneaking out

00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:30,930
into the Canadian market and then

00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:33,720
finally I think most people probably

00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:35,370
heard about or been talking about or

00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:37,500
some people who are writing about China

00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:41,010
Social Credit System which really is

00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:43,680
about literally your credit your access

00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:47,310
to travel many other things being driven

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:49,170
by your reputation online and that's you

00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:50,670
know it's a real thing and that's sort

00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:52,980
of where we you know we sit at the

00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:55,020
choice of do we want the Facebook is

00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:57,480
better than DARPA surveillance society

00:05:55,020 --> 00:06:00,060
or the social credits society at the two

00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:03,440
competing paradigms and the need

00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:05,940
hopefully for a third paradigm

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,130
sophistica a couple more is you know

00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:11,160
where's the hope and all that because

00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:12,810
it's sort of despairing and that three

00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,150
other things I found in that set of

00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:18,930
pocket articles were Jonathan Zittrain

00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:21,720
from from Harvard did this piece in The

00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:23,580
Times I think last week yeah and it

00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,710
talks about proposals for different

00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:27,480
internet of things and frankly his

00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:29,790
proposals are interesting I would say

00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:32,640
that Julia and John and Peter have

00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:34,130
better proposals but it's really helpful

00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:36,660
that that's a conversation that is

00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:38,820
really starting to grow it's not just

00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:40,590
something that you know I remember back

00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:43,470
to John proposed

00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:48,540
in doing the physical app store at Mozza

00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:51,750
fest in 2012 I was like that's a really

00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:54,570
stupid idea but let him do it anyways it

00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:57,720
really has worked into this set of work

00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:59,910
and that's really these issues with

00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:02,370
concrete proposals like the trust mark

00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:04,590
and other things and so that's exciting

00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:08,640
and to me there's a lot of Hope in the

00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:10,290
hat there was a piece of wire it's a

00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:12,720
little bit older but I just added it to

00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:14,580
pocket this week I guess because I just

00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,470
came across it around how the

00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:18,360
decentralized internet the idea that we

00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:20,430
read decentralized the internet which

00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:23,130
the Internet Archive and others have

00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:25,680
really championed is actually usable and

00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:28,350
we've got you know people including one

00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:31,530
of our fellows here who are working on

00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:33,090
that a decentralized browser and you

00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:35,490
know it's here but it has some glitches

00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:36,690
so it's not how many people are using a

00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:46,320
kind of decentralized browser

00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:48,540
alternative oh really it's good I think

00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:50,040
you know that's a lot like how many

00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:53,610
people would have put up their hand of

00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:58,470
who was using mosaic in early 1994 and

00:07:53,610 --> 00:08:00,720
so people we know

00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:03,120
in fact people were funding are building

00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,590
these alternatives and they can become

00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:08,630
you know they can't become big and they

00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:11,880
can become disruptive and then the last

00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:14,910
pocket is this which is kind of double

00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:16,800
edged sword but last week I guess was

00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:20,280
the fifth anniversary of the Snowden

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:23,670
revelations as if this was a piece was

00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:26,760
interviewed a guardian the people are

00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:29,010
still powerless is a sad statement but

00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:30,570
the fact they're aware and the fact that

00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:33,420
there are so many people who we are

00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:36,420
connected to who are trying to shift

00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:38,970
that powerlessness the combination of

00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:40,200
that awareness and the fact that so many

00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:42,300
people are out there doing the work

00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:45,090
including all of us including our allies

00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:46,950
everybody becomes amaz fast that gives

00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:48,810
me a lot of hope because there's a

00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:53,070
chance I think to write a different set

00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:53,970
of headlines for the next five years and

00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:56,940
that's

00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:58,800
we're all here to do so that's just a

00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,630
little that's what's in my pocket I

00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,210
would love to see other people's last

00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:06,420
five pocket articles and share them

00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:07,650
around but I didn't expect that he's

00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:12,090
trying to figure out what to talk about

00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:13,620
and look at that last night so to pass

00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:16,830
it on to some other people who are going

00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:19,860
to talk about where we are right now and

00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:21,900
the work I think that the framing of it

00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:23,820
is a lot has changed certainly in the

00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:26,780
two and a half years or so where we've

00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:30,030
been talking about internet health and

00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:32,610
Jesse said for me the experience is it's

00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:34,170
easier to explain our issues as we've

00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:36,060
talked about their health and bringing

00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:37,890
these concepts into the mainstream

00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:39,420
so it's an environment where people are

00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:41,850
ready for it

00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:44,280
and they're aware and so what we're

00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:45,960
gonna do now it's kind of go into a

00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:49,020
little bit of that your data and you

00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:51,330
theme which is an attempt that many of

00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:53,130
us are working on in terms of how to

00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:57,150
reach people help them feel less

00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:58,650
powerless tap into that awareness and so

00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:00,660
first Renee is going to talk just about

00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:03,120
the bigger picture issues and then

00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:04,670
Melissa and john and kasia talk about

00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:09,060
some of the work both that we've done

00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:11,130
around data and that we really dig into

00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:14,220
those core tools the internal health

00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:16,140
report fellowships and awards and our

00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:18,480
campaigns which of course are

00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:20,160
underpinned by Moz fast and our open

00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,440
leadership community building work talk

00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:25,080
about how that stuff comes to life in

00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:39,089
terms of moving our issues forward so

00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:43,710
I'm going to start with Renee hi

00:10:39,089 --> 00:10:48,750
everybody good morning it's California

00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:50,400
time so it is it's way early so yeah my

00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:51,690
fellow in media misinformation and Trust

00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,790
and I'm gonna walk through some of the

00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:56,190
stuff that you know why I've been

00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:57,780
writing about DARPA and maybe give some

00:10:56,190 --> 00:11:00,570
context on like my background to help

00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:02,310
make this a little bit clearer but you

00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:04,320
know we're here because something is

00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:06,990
well I am here in part because something

00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,330
is wrong with the internet and over the

00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:10,560
last I think about three and a half

00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:12,690
years that I've been a disinformation

00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:17,460
researcher which is amazing that it's a

00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:19,170
job now so it I got into it actually

00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:23,040
studying the anti-vaccine movement back

00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:24,720
in 2014 and and it was like shamelessly

00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,310
with a policy goal which was I wanted to

00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,830
get a lot passed in California to

00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:31,920
eliminate vaccine opt outs and could not

00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:34,940
figure out where this remarkable well

00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:38,730
coordinated well-funded conspiratorial

00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:40,800
eco system had how it had managed to

00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:41,850
propagate to the extent that it had to

00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:46,890
the point where it really become a

00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:48,600
policy force and ironically Devin Yuna

00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:52,440
is one of our esteemed congressman from

00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:54,330
California released a couple statements

00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,260
back before Trump was elected so again

00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:58,320
back in 2014

00:11:55,260 --> 00:12:00,030
talking about how his own experience and

00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,880
Internet advocacy had really changed as

00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:04,830
a congressman he said he used to get 10%

00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,180
kind of crackpot conspiracy theories

00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:07,950
about how the chemtrails were poisoning

00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:10,260
his constituents but at some point it

00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:13,020
had switched and his and his office was

00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:15,870
now dealing with like 80% kind of

00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:17,790
nonsense inbound and he was perplexed

00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:21,360
actually back when he was still a

00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:22,380
reasonable person four years ago by what

00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,930
was happening on the Internet

00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:27,060
so a number of us had been kind of

00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:29,459
looking at how the system had evolved

00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:33,030
and I feel like you know if we go back

00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:37,560
in time to web 1.0 and the Geocities

00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:39,540
days you know grand promise was that we

00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,589
had eliminated the gatekeepers and at

00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:42,270
the time we thought that this was a

00:12:40,589 --> 00:12:44,010
really fantastic thing because anyone

00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:45,750
could write exactly what was on their

00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:47,640
mind and so is this explosion and

00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:48,510
freedom and ideas and access to

00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,160
information

00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:53,880
and of course back in the decentralised

00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:55,380
days or the early days there was of

00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,760
course misinformation online because

00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:58,050
anybody could write anything we could

00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,610
all have our own blogs and say whatever

00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:01,550
we wanted but it was a little bit

00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:03,630
different because the algorithmic

00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:06,060
curatorial systems hadn't really been

00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:07,440
built yet and consolidation hadn't

00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:09,839
happened in the way that that it has

00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:12,000
evolved over the subsequent kind of ten

00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,709
years so as we studied disinformation

00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,070
when one of the things we really look at

00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:19,079
is the structural frameworks of the

00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:22,949
social explosion and what the kind of

00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:25,980
steady proliferation of one you know as

00:13:22,949 --> 00:13:27,750
each social platform became bigger they

00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:30,420
amassed these phenomenal standing

00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:32,220
audiences and because they did provide

00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:35,010
in fact a service that many many people

00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:37,290
wanted and enjoyed but the kind of

00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:39,149
consolidation also meant as we've seen

00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:42,839
that there are these large standing

00:13:39,149 --> 00:13:45,060
audiences kind of ripe for the reaching

00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:47,579
which has had really interesting impacts

00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:49,170
when we look at conspiratorial content

00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:51,779
when we look at political extremism when

00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:53,430
we look at social extremism and the way

00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:54,540
that that consolidation and those

00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:57,959
standing audiences have really

00:13:54,540 --> 00:14:00,959
contributed to radicalization so as the

00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:02,160
platform's grew and then developed a

00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,589
business model that turned them into

00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,029
attention brokers that feedback loop

00:14:04,589 --> 00:14:07,680
where you know you have all of these

00:14:06,029 --> 00:14:09,420
people on site you have to keep them on

00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,040
site so you're incentivized to do things

00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:12,360
to keep them on site which means you

00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,100
don't have to explain this to anybody in

00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,810
here really but that the incentive

00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:18,660
structure was kind of fundamentally

00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:21,740
misaligned and what we began to see was

00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:23,519
things like you know for me I had these

00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:25,019
anti-vaccine sock puppets that

00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:27,060
infiltrated anti-vaccine groups

00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:30,240
reason being just to understand how the

00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:31,680
dynamics were were being carried out and

00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,750
more kind of extreme conspiratorial

00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:36,600
communities on Facebook and Twitter how

00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:38,250
the disinformation was moving from

00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:40,410
network to network to network so we were

00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:43,230
really looking at it as a as a system

00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:44,790
problem at the time and I started seeing

00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:46,350
really interesting things like my

00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:48,149
anti-vaccine sock puppets getting

00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:49,980
referred into Pizza Gate groups long

00:14:48,149 --> 00:14:52,230
before Pizza Gate was a popular story

00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:54,720
back when Pizza Gate was still a very

00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:56,519
underground conspiracy theory so we

00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,550
started seeing these interesting areas

00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:01,910
where curatorial systems like search and

00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:03,320
trending and recommendation engines were

00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:07,300
actually contributing to and

00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:10,790
facilitating the increasing either

00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:13,360
degree of extremism and in some some

00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:15,410
types of content or this conspiracy

00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,450
correlation matrix that was actually

00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:19,190
taking people and moving them from one

00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:21,310
conspiratorial community another

00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:23,120
entirely based on things like

00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:24,680
collaborative filtering and just

00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,690
recommendation engines that had been

00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:29,990
built without an eye towards looking at

00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:32,330
the downstream effects so there is this

00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:34,100
you know I think if we had to sum up the

00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:36,800
current state of social it's that the

00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:38,120
algorithms are remarkably effective at

00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,760
what they do they are so good at what

00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:42,800
they do the platforms are providing

00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:44,570
people with exactly you know are giving

00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,860
people exactly what they want just that

00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:47,270
there's not necessarily a sense of

00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:49,400
ethics kind of built into those

00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:52,760
recommender systems and what we've begun

00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:55,070
to see is the idea that the amassing of

00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:56,780
mass quantities of data which people are

00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:58,610
perhaps unaware that they're providing

00:15:56,780 --> 00:16:00,650
but they are in fact opting in and using

00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:02,630
the services means that we have these

00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:04,730
systems where it's incredibly easy to

00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:08,230
target people the audiences are always

00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:10,120
there and there's not a whole lot of

00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:12,440
[Music]

00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:16,010
sophistication built into the idea of

00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:18,800
should we can we which should me so how

00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:21,230
does this intersect with DARPA so there

00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,180
were I did some of the work on the

00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:24,800
counter Isis efforts for State

00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:27,020
Department and interfaced with DARPA as

00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:30,020
part of part of that project and have

00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:33,170
had the experience of working with some

00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:37,060
of their program managers in both at

00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:39,440
conferences and just kind of creating a

00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:41,840
pipeline of ideas creating creating

00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,700
conversations with them and I wanted to

00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:47,540
go back to something that they managed

00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:49,100
to there were two programs that I think

00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:51,350
are really relevant to talk about here

00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:53,510
the one in this article was about Total

00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:56,480
Information Awareness anybody remember

00:16:53,510 --> 00:17:00,080
Total Information Awareness okay so

00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:03,050
Total Information Awareness was started

00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:05,120
after September all was introduced after

00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:07,310
September 11th so the idea was that you

00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:09,890
could gather all of these different

00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:13,400
types of data credit-card purchases

00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:14,390
travel records your dentist was you know

00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,459
you name it everything

00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:18,050
you could possibly imagine and that if

00:17:16,459 --> 00:17:19,579
they could link these databases if

00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:21,860
Dartmouth could link these databases it

00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:24,530
could potentially mine them for

00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:26,089
indications that either a person was you

00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:28,190
know had kind of terrorist proclivities

00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:29,540
or was actively trying to carry out an

00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:32,330
opera you know an operation was being

00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:35,360
radicalized or that there were certain

00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:38,150
signatures that they could look at to to

00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:41,660
detect and prevent terrorism so it was a

00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:45,670
really interesting idea that horrified

00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:47,420
everyone and so it was it was

00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:49,430
universally I believe it was a unanimous

00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:51,080
decision by the Senate bipartisan

00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:53,000
decision to shut down funding and to

00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:54,710
kill the program they saw it as a mass

00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,890
dragnet why would we allow the

00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:59,030
government to have this the degree of

00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:01,840
information that they had amassed

00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:04,520
interestingly what we saw was that the

00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:06,200
public and the senators were horrified

00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:08,360
by the very idea that Total Information

00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:11,840
Awareness could be a thing and then very

00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:15,140
shortly after Facebook started and the

00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:17,000
same said the civil civil society if you

00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:20,870
go back and read the articles from from

00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,760
2000 to 2003 timeframe when the push to

00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:23,270
kill Total Information Awareness was

00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:25,610
happening

00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:27,860
you saw the EF F the ACLU and Cato

00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:30,500
writing these articles about what an

00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:32,480
absolute travesty the very idea that any

00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:37,250
government entity could amass this kind

00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:40,010
of data was those same civil society

00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:43,340
organizations have not said very much

00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:46,460
about the exact same degree of

00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:48,650
consolidation and massive data being

00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:49,940
being carried out in the private sector

00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:52,300
now of course the government can come

00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:54,530
arrest you and the and Facebook can't

00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:58,520
but at the same time there's been this

00:18:54,530 --> 00:19:00,580
really remarkable sense that we don't

00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:02,810
want the government having access to

00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:04,940
this degree of information but we're

00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:07,450
perfectly fine with private sector

00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:09,620
companies continuing to consolidate

00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:11,510
there was another DARPA program that was

00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:12,920
also really interesting that is in this

00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:14,780
article but trying to figure out how to

00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:16,130
tell that story that's the story of

00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:17,090
social media and strategic

00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:19,010
communications

00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:21,650
Smith was the program is anybody in here

00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:25,550
ever heard of it so this was a program

00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:27,140
and I ran from 2012 to 2015 and this is

00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:28,250
the mission statement through the

00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:29,840
program DARPA see

00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:32,539
seeks to develop tools to help identify

00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,789
misinformation or deception campaigns to

00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:35,960
counter them with truthful information

00:19:33,789 --> 00:19:39,799
reducing adversaries ability to

00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:42,830
manipulate events so back in 2012 as the

00:19:39,799 --> 00:19:44,809
amassing of users and manipulative

00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:47,299
content on social media began to become

00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:49,280
obvious darpa therapist mission

00:19:47,299 --> 00:19:51,350
statement is to prevent and create

00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,480
strategic surprise so the idea is that

00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:57,470
you are there's always somebody it's a

00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:59,450
great mission statement so both are

00:19:57,470 --> 00:20:00,830
trying to prevent your adversaries from

00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:02,240
strategically surprising you in a

00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:04,280
technological capacity while also

00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,230
simultaneously developing the very

00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:07,460
capabilities to do that they're very

00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:11,240
honest about what they do I really like

00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:14,179
that but the interesting thing about

00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:15,799
Smith was that this was the program the

00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:17,750
DARPA Twitter bot challenge there was a

00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:20,900
detection challenge to detect thoughts

00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:23,240
on Twitter back in 2013-2014 timeframe

00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:24,770
so there were there's this is a public

00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:26,600
you know all of this information is open

00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:28,400
source you can go read the papers that

00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,990
were that were produced and submitted a

00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,880
lot of academics participated in the

00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:34,909
semester program which again we killed

00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:36,890
in 2015 and we saw a wired and aclu in a

00:20:34,909 --> 00:20:38,450
horrible you know all of the popular

00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:40,010
writing at the time was this idea that

00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:41,679
we were you know horrified at the idea

00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:44,559
that the US government was investigating

00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:47,299
the manipulation capabilities and

00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:48,679
potential for social networks so here

00:20:47,299 --> 00:20:52,010
again we have a second instance of

00:20:48,679 --> 00:20:54,470
killing a program that actually was was

00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:56,330
would have been you know quite useful we

00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:59,480
are still drawing on that the research

00:20:56,330 --> 00:21:02,289
that was done in that program six years

00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:06,679
ago now trying to think about what

00:21:02,289 --> 00:21:09,590
what's next so the idea that I would say

00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:11,600
that the the main issue right now is we

00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:14,650
have this very broken state of the

00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:17,000
internet it has to be a combined effort

00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:18,350
to fix it right we have to work with

00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,090
government we have to work with civil

00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:21,710
society and we have to work with

00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:24,440
technologists so we have to galvanize a

00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:26,419
movement of technologists who work in

00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:28,880
the big tech companies as well to be

00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:31,130
thinking about solutions so we have in

00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,600
fact seen that you know there's this

00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:33,799
perception a lot of the time you go to

00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,270
conferences and you hear that like

00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:36,590
government just doesn't know what it's

00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:38,090
doing certain parts of the government

00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:41,000
absolutely do know what they're doing

00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:41,810
it's just that there's this weird

00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,910
division

00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:45,980
where the conference's are happening

00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:49,010
almost in parallel and there's very

00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:53,780
little kind of coming together so when

00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:55,340
we talk about solutions and that's what

00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:59,360
I think we're going to be talking about

00:21:55,340 --> 00:22:01,190
a bit of in our meetings as we go we're

00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:03,710
still not really addressing the problem

00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:07,760
head-on so we need to be thinking about

00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:10,790
ways that we as Ella can step in and

00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,660
bridge some of these gaps so the thing

00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:14,020
that I've been thrilled to have the

00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:16,970
opportunity to do is really work with

00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:19,310
lawmakers to try to help them understand

00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:21,260
you know moment right now they hear

00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:23,120
mostly from big tech lobbyists and

00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:25,610
they're not really hearing as much from

00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:27,560
mid-sized tank or even small tech there

00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:31,550
there's no like startup lobbyists down

00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:35,210
there speaking to them about what is

00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:37,040
possible and also what is happening so

00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:39,970
there's a real opportunity to bridge

00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:42,230
that gap in conversations with lawmakers

00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:43,310
I think a couple of other folks are

00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:46,550
going to talk about some of the

00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:48,710
regulatory efforts but there is a real

00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:52,310
opportunity here to translate Mozilla

00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:54,350
values into industry norms and I think

00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:58,280
that's another piece that we're trying

00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:59,900
to figure out can we create a community

00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:02,720
can we continue to have conversations

00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:05,120
with big tech platforms but also what

00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,280
are the areas where since we have this

00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:10,130
unique DNA of being both technologists

00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:13,250
ourselves that really understand what is

00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:15,620
possible and how it works but also have

00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:20,290
this strong commitment to freedom to

00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:23,390
internet health unto creating and

00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:25,910
creating the ideal form of the Internet

00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:28,340
and so how do we how do we take our

00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:31,670
unique DNA and really get that out there

00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:33,590
more so I think there's a combination of

00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:35,720
needing to reach legislators needing to

00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:38,780
reach the media and you need to reach

00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:40,910
people directly this is all gonna take a

00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:42,710
lot of collaboration I'm happy to talk a

00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:45,590
little bit more about the various

00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:47,150
specifics of the kind of groups that are

00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:48,800
beginning to come together and network

00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:51,050
around it or to talk a little bit more

00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:53,060
about the specifics of flying down to DC

00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:54,920
on Thursday morning to go meet with the

00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:56,440
Senate again so the conversations that

00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:59,169
we're having there

00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:00,640
and just to say that you know there's

00:23:59,169 --> 00:24:02,410
really a remarkable moment right now

00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:06,960
where everybody is listening people are

00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:10,960
beginning to be aware of the kind of

00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:12,429
contradictions and bad choices that

00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:24,460
we've made over the last ten years and

00:24:12,429 --> 00:24:26,200
to begin thinking about solutions Thank

00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:29,799
You Renee I think everyone is listening

00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:31,600
probably has two meanings as you say

00:24:29,799 --> 00:24:35,530
that I didn't actually say it explicitly

00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:37,570
but you played the worry rule in in this

00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:39,820
talk certainly I mean it really struck

00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:41,650
me in that article the the thing that

00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:43,059
everybody rejected in Total Information

00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:45,070
Awareness being a thing that we've

00:24:43,059 --> 00:24:47,440
actually built a bigger better version

00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:49,059
that we also know from certain the

00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,610
government can access in addition to

00:24:49,059 --> 00:24:54,880
having these other effects is a you know

00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:56,919
pretty stark thought to sit with and you

00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:01,030
know we've all opted into it not just

00:24:56,919 --> 00:25:02,980
opting in kind of thoughtlessly to serve

00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:05,470
the service but we all use these

00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:07,150
services and wish they were different in

00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:10,630
which they were better

00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:13,480
so we now switch to the hope portion of

00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:15,340
the of the conversation we're all in the

00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:17,799
business of trying to call this stuff I

00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:19,870
bring together a set of people who want

00:25:17,799 --> 00:25:22,179
to make it different so we want to just

00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:24,610
step into a little bit of reflection on

00:25:22,179 --> 00:25:25,960
that looking across three of the key

00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:28,320
pieces of work that we do in that

00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:31,179
direction in that direction through the

00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:33,190
your data a new lens both what we've

00:25:31,179 --> 00:25:35,860
been doing and where we're going that we

00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:38,320
will go to the interactive portion so

00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:39,940
melissa is gonna talk this is going to

00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,660
kick us off by talking about our

00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:46,359
fellowships

00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:46,359
[Applause]

00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:57,470
hi everyone so these are my parents May

00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:59,330
1975 there in Tokyo at the Imperial

00:25:57,470 --> 00:26:03,110
Gardens you can kind of see the flowers

00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:04,790
behind my dad they're a few weeks after

00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:06,830
this photo was taken they got married

00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:09,590
with the promise that they would leave

00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:11,900
Tokyo and live in London in New York for

00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:14,870
the rest of their lives and my mom would

00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:16,790
spend time in Paris and paint and learn

00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:19,600
French and that they would never have

00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:19,600
any children

00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:27,410
life had other plans my mom wanted or

00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:29,810
she became a teacher and realized that

00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:32,240
she wanted to have kids of her own my

00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:34,520
dad's company moved them to London York

00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:37,010
but life never really was what they

00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:38,960
wanted so they stopped thinking about

00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:41,180
what they wanted in the moment and

00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,800
started thinking and planning and

00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:45,050
building towards the future that they

00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:48,470
wanted to kids

00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:50,810
40 years later I'm still living in Tokyo

00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:53,360
my mom's still dreaming up one day

00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:54,770
speaking French they're living a life

00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:58,310
that they never could have predicted in

00:26:54,770 --> 00:27:02,780
1975 the one thing that has stayed the

00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:05,990
same they go to the Imperial Gardens

00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:09,380
every May and they take photos and they

00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:10,760
send these to my brother and me oh one

00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:12,410
thing that didn't show up there my mom's

00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:15,890
making that face cuz she's pouting cuz

00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:17,150
there were no flowers in 2016 and they

00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:22,010
really need to work on their selfie game

00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:24,230
and we but it's like this magic rate of

00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:27,530
photo and voice and messaging technology

00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:28,700
that has kept us connected kept me up to

00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:31,010
date on their shenanigans

00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:35,420
and kept them feeling like they're still

00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:37,700
a part of my life last year my mom

00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:39,410
arranged it so I could wish a happy

00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:44,420
hundredth birthday to my grandfather on

00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:45,890
FaceTime you can see in the corner he

00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:49,550
loves all things techy who was an

00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:51,530
engineer throughout history but even he

00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:53,330
never imagined that he could talk to his

00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:55,330
granddaughter through a phone and see

00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:57,549
her spirit phone I should say

00:27:55,330 --> 00:28:01,029
when I was living 10,000 kilometers away

00:27:57,549 --> 00:28:03,070
and I speak to him relatively awesome

00:28:01,029 --> 00:28:06,580
he's always baffled we never get much of

00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:08,860
a conversation because he's like himself

00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:12,220
seeing me he doesn't really quite

00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:14,369
understand how this is all working and

00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:16,840
it really is truly amazing technology

00:28:14,369 --> 00:28:18,700
people say they never imagined the

00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:20,499
future like the present we have today

00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:22,889
and they're probably right what they

00:28:20,499 --> 00:28:26,830
imagined isn't what we have today

00:28:22,889 --> 00:28:28,809
remember the Jetsons I'm in the 1960s

00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:31,440
they were dreaming of robots that were

00:28:28,809 --> 00:28:34,749
made robots they were part of her family

00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:36,519
Rosie took care of the kids she helped

00:28:34,749 --> 00:28:38,169
them with her homework she cooked

00:28:36,519 --> 00:28:39,190
through the family she made sure that

00:28:38,169 --> 00:28:41,320
George Jetson

00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:44,259
you know his cholesterol don't get too

00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:45,129
high she took care of the family but

00:28:44,259 --> 00:28:54,879
what did we get

00:28:45,129 --> 00:28:56,950
we got robots you know Rosie never

00:28:54,879 --> 00:29:00,369
shared the Jetsons personal data with

00:28:56,950 --> 00:29:02,259
that big company Acme core you know the

00:29:00,369 --> 00:29:03,730
worst parts of humanity are really

00:29:02,259 --> 00:29:08,139
holding back the best parts of

00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:10,450
Technology it often feels like greed and

00:29:08,139 --> 00:29:13,059
fear are what's driving the creation of

00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:15,220
this stuff we see it we've heard about

00:29:13,059 --> 00:29:19,269
it we don't like it and that's why we're

00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:21,369
here right to demand better to make sure

00:29:19,269 --> 00:29:24,549
that our lives are not commoditized and

00:29:21,369 --> 00:29:26,710
to build something better altogether so

00:29:24,549 --> 00:29:28,690
you'll hear from John about how our

00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:30,700
campaigns are giving people a voice to

00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:31,029
tell companies to do better and to be

00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:34,090
better

00:29:31,029 --> 00:29:35,919
you also hear from kosheh about how the

00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:38,440
internet health report is setting this

00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:40,299
agenda setting this vision for the world

00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:42,549
that we want in the world for creating

00:29:40,299 --> 00:29:44,499
together we're doing this with fellows

00:29:42,549 --> 00:29:47,169
too who are fighting for a better future

00:29:44,499 --> 00:29:50,320
the fellows and residents they come to

00:29:47,169 --> 00:29:52,480
us with expertise their own networks of

00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:55,169
amazing people and they help us figure

00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:59,259
out where to go next

00:29:55,169 --> 00:30:01,109
Steve song who is here this week brings

00:29:59,259 --> 00:30:03,669
his lifetime of experience in

00:30:01,109 --> 00:30:06,700
telecommunications policy and connecting

00:30:03,669 --> 00:30:08,570
the unconnected with us he's raising

00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:10,820
let's say the next year

00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:14,659
creation of policy pickers to be more

00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:16,279
like Rosie and less like Roomba he does

00:30:14,659 --> 00:30:18,769
is by talking to policy makers about

00:30:16,279 --> 00:30:21,830
important issues like neutrality and

00:30:18,769 --> 00:30:24,110
good data protection policies Steve

00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:26,090
helps us design and fund a program to

00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:28,580
train a whole group of today's engineers

00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:30,980
will one day be policy makers in their

00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:34,009
own countries through workshops he's

00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:36,950
helping them these regulators build a

00:30:34,009 --> 00:30:38,830
better connected future Steve is also

00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:41,600
bringing new thinking into the movement

00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:42,860
right now he believes actually no it's

00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:45,320
not right now you believe he believes

00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:48,049
that the lack of access to the Internet

00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:50,029
is the worst net neutral neutral any

00:30:48,049 --> 00:30:51,649
violation of all it's a really

00:30:50,029 --> 00:30:55,399
interesting argument and I think you

00:30:51,649 --> 00:31:02,169
should ask him about it this week you

00:30:55,399 --> 00:31:04,789
know you know Rene just spoke a lot and

00:31:02,169 --> 00:31:07,250
a lot of the conversation around this

00:31:04,789 --> 00:31:10,700
information right now is causing like

00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:12,789
knee-jerk reactions from governments for

00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:15,830
example there is a bill in California

00:31:12,789 --> 00:31:18,139
called the Bop bill that's asking all

00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:21,200
bots to declare that they are in fact

00:31:18,139 --> 00:31:22,730
BOTS and on the surface this is great we

00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:26,779
should know whether we're talking to a

00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:29,299
human or a bot but the bill reacts to

00:31:26,779 --> 00:31:33,049
the problem of Russian BOTS influencing

00:31:29,299 --> 00:31:35,019
the u.s. elections in 2016 and it could

00:31:33,049 --> 00:31:38,149
really hurt freedom of expression online

00:31:35,019 --> 00:31:40,190
so well the law could help us or if it

00:31:38,149 --> 00:31:41,990
became law it could help us deal with

00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:45,500
some problems that we have today

00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:49,309
it could also really create irreparable

00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:51,200
harm for the future grenades discussing

00:31:49,309 --> 00:31:53,389
this legislation with EFS to find

00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,759
balance and make sure that the potential

00:31:53,389 --> 00:31:58,700
of a better future isn't hurt by the

00:31:55,759 --> 00:31:59,980
decisions of today she also brings

00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:03,970
together

00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:06,620
thanks for slacking me bring together

00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:09,409
researchers from companies like Google

00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:10,639
and Facebook and reddit to talk about

00:32:09,409 --> 00:32:12,710
the big problems that we have right now

00:32:10,639 --> 00:32:14,899
and thanks renée's we're bringing on

00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:16,340
more fellows this fall to conduct

00:32:14,899 --> 00:32:18,260
research about the effects of

00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:20,389
misinformation around around the world

00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:22,700
as well as to talk to and educate

00:32:20,389 --> 00:32:24,020
politicians about the

00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:25,970
information about artificial

00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:29,060
intelligence so that they're not so

00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:31,070
reactive it's kind of like bringing his

00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:33,530
work helps platforms and governments

00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:35,840
figure out that cool technology like

00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:41,090
rosy doesn't have to track us like

00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:43,790
Roomba and we have John you know John's

00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:46,070
previous work which mark also alluded to

00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:48,950
helped us imagine a bigger and better

00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:51,980
world with IOT this technology is so

00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:54,740
cool but right now the amount of data

00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:57,860
it's collecting and sharing makes the

00:32:54,740 --> 00:33:00,380
world feel a bit dystopian John's work

00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:02,090
continues to involve all I mean with

00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:04,460
Mozilla he just won an incredible grant

00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:07,430
from therapy and Perlman this money will

00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:09,320
go into the network that he's been

00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:12,020
cultivating and supporting throughout

00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:14,870
his career and it'll help new leaders

00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:18,200
explore local problems and find local

00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:21,410
IOT solutions that will help life with

00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:25,850
technology be better and not just better

00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:27,740
connected John brought Julie on boards

00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:30,800
got awesome people connecting awesome

00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:33,140
people and Julia creates stories and

00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:35,720
prototypes to imagine the world that we

00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:36,710
do want this isn't about reacting to

00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:39,050
today's problems

00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:41,590
what about pushing beyond what we know

00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:43,430
what we think we know and what we have

00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:46,370
for example right now

00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:49,790
we buy a lot of gadgets but are they

00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:51,710
really ours are these things we need do

00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:53,470
we really need Alexa to help us add

00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:56,180
toilet paper into our shopping list

00:33:53,470 --> 00:34:00,110
julie is imagining a future or futures

00:33:56,180 --> 00:34:02,180
that where we control what our things

00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:04,200
now and where our data isn't up for

00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:07,750
grabs all the time

00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:09,580
John also brought on Peter and his work

00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:12,010
in this space about figuring out how to

00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:13,180
identify the good stuff and give credit

00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:15,640
where credit is due

00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:19,240
it's also about getting people to want

00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:21,370
to build respectful technology and shape

00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:24,640
this kind of gadget field data filled

00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:26,400
world with hope and not fear he's

00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:28,720
bringing his community of things

00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:30,760
enthusiasts to have some difficult

00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:33,310
questions and to come up with something

00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:35,920
like a trust mark for IOT so that we

00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:37,500
know our data is in good hands and a

00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:40,930
greenness back to the Jetsons

00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:43,600
John Giulia and Peter are figuring out

00:34:40,930 --> 00:34:45,850
how the next Rosie's of the future can

00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:49,680
be locally or contextually relevant and

00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:49,680
how they will respect us in our data

00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:54,490
this is actually a photo from San

00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:57,250
Francisco the office if any of you seen

00:34:54,490 --> 00:34:59,380
that with Fellowes were trailblazing the

00:34:57,250 --> 00:35:01,000
future we want to see right there are

00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:02,350
other fellows out there who aren't able

00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,380
to join us this week but they're doing

00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:07,840
really fantastic work and really excited

00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:10,390
to say that we're bringing on 30 more

00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:12,580
fellows I think this fall to shape the

00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:15,010
future that values people over profit

00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:17,350
and that puts the personal and personal

00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:19,090
data or that respects the personal they

00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:22,350
might pretend they do so I want to call

00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:23,650
out the amazing work that Amy and Murray

00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:27,610
aralia

00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:29,500
Brett Cory Rizvan and staff have done to

00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:32,920
make this all possible

00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:32,920
[Applause]

00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:44,020
pyaare we're announcing the next group

00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:48,670
of awesome fellows soon so please ask

00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:50,740
them about them so to be clear I'm not

00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:53,680
saying that rosy and the Jetsons is the

00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:56,500
future we want right there are a lot of

00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:59,310
problems with this 1960s future Society

00:35:56,500 --> 00:36:01,330
racial diversity being one of them so

00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:03,400
but those of you who watch the show

00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:06,070
might remember that they lived in this

00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:09,280
sky-high apartment because earth at

00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:11,680
ground level was way too polluted sci-fi

00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:13,900
in the mid 1900s already figured out

00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:15,370
that the people in the future would be

00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:17,860
dealing with the problems that they

00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:19,990
caused but instead of designing a world

00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:23,140
where they reversed pollution or made it

00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:26,170
better they just built on top of it but

00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:28,720
we're ahead of this we figured out that

00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:30,490
we don't want our future to be hamstrung

00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:32,560
by the mistakes by our short-term

00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:35,190
mistakes so we're designing and building

00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:38,050
a healthier Internet today together

00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:40,330
we're on solid ground and we have an

00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:42,970
exciting and busy road ahead of us so

00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:45,310
this week I'd love for each of you to

00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:48,640
talk to someone you don't know might be

00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:51,790
a new team member might be a fellow and

00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:54,010
share your visions of the future up next

00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:56,770
here's John going to talk about how our

00:36:54,010 --> 00:37:00,330
campaigns are giving us voice for better

00:36:56,770 --> 00:37:00,330
data security and better

00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:08,059
[Applause]

00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:13,509
thanks Melissa

00:37:11,069 --> 00:37:15,999
so I'm gonna start by talking about

00:37:13,509 --> 00:37:19,480
Facebook back in March

00:37:15,999 --> 00:37:22,799
a Canadian Christopher Bailey came out

00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:25,690
with a pretty astonishing revelation and

00:37:22,799 --> 00:37:28,839
I think for many of us it wasn't super

00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:31,119
surprising but has really brought data

00:37:28,839 --> 00:37:33,059
to the form that that's Facebook allowed

00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:36,099
a private company Kempe channel attica

00:37:33,059 --> 00:37:38,650
to use the data of 50 million people to

00:37:36,099 --> 00:37:43,990
influence an election campaign without

00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:46,720
their knowledge or consent for us within

00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:48,549
12 hours of this year's breaking the

00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:52,480
campaign statement consulted with people

00:37:48,549 --> 00:37:54,809
all over local and Lofa it was pretty

00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:59,259
far and wide we had that advocacy team

00:37:54,809 --> 00:38:01,499
policy tech legal compliance trying to

00:37:59,259 --> 00:38:05,230
figure out exactly what had happened and

00:38:01,499 --> 00:38:06,999
really how to make things right lots of

00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:10,630
different asks came out from different

00:38:06,999 --> 00:38:13,450
groups at the time and within 48 hours

00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:16,210
we've managed to mobilize nearly 60,000

00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:18,160
people to ask Facebook to clarify -

00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:21,190
excuses exactly how the data is going to

00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:23,259
be used within just a few hours of that

00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:26,559
we were actually talking to Facebook

00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:31,019
directly and 20,000 more people had

00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:33,460
signed on in just a few days after that

00:38:31,019 --> 00:38:36,700
Facebook biggest companies in the whole

00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:48,130
world changed its default settings and

00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:49,930
that was because of us as Congress in

00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:52,359
the u.s. geared up to questions occur

00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:54,039
Berg we are Facebook just stop

00:38:52,359 --> 00:38:55,660
advertising to us using cross-site

00:38:54,039 --> 00:38:57,430
tracking so cross eye tracking is

00:38:55,660 --> 00:39:00,039
following creeping you around the

00:38:57,430 --> 00:39:02,670
internet checking out what you were

00:39:00,039 --> 00:39:06,009
doing when you weren't on Facebook and

00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:08,259
really the hopes were for us with that

00:39:06,009 --> 00:39:12,460
someone in Congress would see an iceberg

00:39:08,259 --> 00:39:15,220
so they did Facebook was questioned

00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:17,980
about cross-site tracking multiple times

00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:19,060
by different Congress people and

00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:23,500
Senators

00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:25,210
and then when the pairings were Facebook

00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:27,430
we're gonna be behind closed doors we

00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:31,660
were also there we were there to demand

00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:33,220
transparency that parents served and the

00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:34,660
hearings weren't they were they were

00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:37,990
live streams and are watched by millions

00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:40,420
of people around the world these ones

00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:43,030
are really important ones like this

00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:45,430
against huge companies like Facebook as

00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:47,500
you mentioned Mozilla is allowed fierce

00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:51,910
advocate for protecting consumers and

00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:53,310
the most sensitive data structurally we

00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:56,290
were pretty ready for this moment

00:39:53,310 --> 00:40:04,660
luckily thanks to the amazing work from

00:39:56,290 --> 00:40:05,980
our tech team and our data people where

00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:08,080
I would have really spring into action

00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:10,440
and and test what had been resonating

00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:12,790
with people on the most illest

00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:14,590
we achieve that through doing some

00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:17,710
warm-up campaigns just a month before

00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:20,170
the Facebook news cannot but more

00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:23,920
importantly we're really ready to open

00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:26,110
our doors and work alongside like-minded

00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:28,960
consumer rights organizations not just

00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:38,620
in the US but really across the whole

00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:41,410
globe alone in the space we're leading

00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:43,090
by example by working open we let

00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:46,000
partners know that ins and outs of our

00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:47,470
campaigns and we share our resources and

00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,530
what we're finding is we're seeing the

00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:52,570
same in return we're finding that

00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:55,150
through working together everybody is

00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:58,040
winning it and sometimes we actually end

00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:59,250
up winning before you even want to win

00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:03,580
[Music]

00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:06,610
so cloud pets it's a toy known also

00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:09,480
known as bi where you can hug it's a

00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:11,950
cuddly toy it records audio and video

00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:17,020
it's been described as super hackable

00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:19,960
and really it's the insecure toy about

00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:21,760
nightmares and hopefully not an

00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:25,120
indication of things to come but a

00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:27,240
campaign spirit by Sarah and led by

00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:29,830
Mozilla saw a coalition of organizations

00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:32,320
signing on to an open letter undermining

00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:32,859
the Amazon Target Walmart through the

00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:36,160
world

00:41:32,859 --> 00:41:46,930
retailers drop flour pets from the

00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:49,200
shelves was so successful we didn't even

00:41:46,930 --> 00:41:51,970
have a chance to mobilize our supporters

00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:54,069
all three retailers dropped flour pets

00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:57,579
within a couple of days of the open

00:41:54,069 --> 00:42:03,749
letter being accidentally leaked by the

00:41:57,579 --> 00:42:05,920
day and just to see her I'm down at the

00:42:03,749 --> 00:42:08,190
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in

00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:12,519
front of Trump and pence they're

00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:15,309
delivering 30,000 signatures to force it

00:42:12,519 --> 00:42:18,910
to protect consumers on the Equifax data

00:42:15,309 --> 00:42:20,950
breach earlier this year we had

00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:22,599
thousands of Indian sign onto an open

00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:25,569
letter which was published in the

00:42:22,599 --> 00:42:28,210
Hindustan Times it's read by over 10

00:42:25,569 --> 00:42:29,799
million people every day and that was to

00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:31,989
make sure Indians right to privacy it

00:42:29,799 --> 00:42:34,210
would be upheld and the in the privacy

00:42:31,989 --> 00:42:37,059
law which we're hoping to see the draft

00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:39,279
of that this week and tomorrow we're

00:42:37,059 --> 00:42:41,049
going to be asking Europeans to call

00:42:39,279 --> 00:42:43,359
their member of European Parliament to

00:42:41,049 --> 00:42:45,759
stop new copyright laws from coming into

00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:47,440
force and these copyright laws really

00:42:45,759 --> 00:42:50,970
would decimate the freedom and openness

00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:53,440
of the Internet as we know it in Europe

00:42:50,970 --> 00:42:55,509
ultimately the the future for us is

00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:59,019
going to represent a continuation of

00:42:55,509 --> 00:43:03,640
this work and we can focus companies

00:42:59,019 --> 00:43:06,880
quite consciously because that can enact

00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:09,789
change and and quickly so when left

00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:11,829
unchecked corporations don't let

00:43:09,789 --> 00:43:16,420
anything stand in the way of of bigger

00:43:11,829 --> 00:43:18,160
profits but they do have a weakness the

00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:20,109
biggest corporations in the world rely

00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:22,839
on ordinary people like us to keep them

00:43:20,109 --> 00:43:25,359
in business where their customers where

00:43:22,839 --> 00:43:28,329
their employees will win on your

00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:31,299
employees but people are and we often

00:43:28,329 --> 00:43:35,819
their investors and when we act together

00:43:31,299 --> 00:43:35,819
we can be more powerful the mayor and

00:43:36,069 --> 00:43:41,380
enough we can actually help them become

00:43:38,289 --> 00:43:45,549
an advocate to change themselves so this

00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:48,670
was World Oceans Day on Friday this is

00:43:45,549 --> 00:43:54,609
in London it's a billboard it's a corona

00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:59,190
billboard and that big wave is plastic

00:43:54,609 --> 00:44:01,449
that's been sucked out see turn an

00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:06,729
installation in front of us and this was

00:44:01,449 --> 00:44:08,380
entirely paid for by Corona thought that

00:44:06,729 --> 00:44:12,339
a beer company would become an advocate

00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:14,199
for keeping our oceans healthy but it's

00:44:12,339 --> 00:44:16,449
pretty amazing that your owners now like

00:44:14,199 --> 00:44:20,529
leading the phone to read the ocean of

00:44:16,449 --> 00:44:25,979
plastic so this year we're going to

00:44:20,529 --> 00:44:28,690
continue a rapid response work campaign

00:44:25,979 --> 00:44:30,519
right now the world is really looking to

00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:32,589
Europe is a leader protecting consumer

00:44:30,519 --> 00:44:39,219
data and that's happened a lot for TTP

00:44:32,589 --> 00:44:40,719
are just mentioned before as well so

00:44:39,219 --> 00:44:44,259
we're going to be investing a lot more

00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:46,209
resources and you're because we can see

00:44:44,259 --> 00:44:49,749
that what happens in Europe is have

00:44:46,209 --> 00:44:54,400
event and we're really going to continue

00:44:49,749 --> 00:44:57,099
to be a leader on IOT campaigning I run

00:44:54,400 --> 00:45:00,130
a clean space but dad is having a stay

00:44:57,099 --> 00:45:02,319
in the Sun and corporations more aware

00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:05,109
and more alert than ever about the

00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:09,369
effects that it's going to have on on

00:45:05,109 --> 00:45:12,299
the world around us so together we're

00:45:09,369 --> 00:45:16,059
going to continue this great work and

00:45:12,299 --> 00:45:19,119
talking now about setting the agenda on

00:45:16,059 --> 00:45:20,680
Howard a disused and and the rock health

00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:22,210
report plays and that is good because

00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:28,840
yeah

00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:32,090
[Applause]

00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:33,790
hi um my name is Kasia and it's 5:00

00:45:32,090 --> 00:45:36,500
p.m. for me

00:45:33,790 --> 00:45:38,120
bear with me I have this strange mix of

00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:41,360
getting more and more sleepy and

00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:43,390
adrenaline kicking right now so I'm

00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:48,170
going to start with an interactive

00:45:43,390 --> 00:45:51,020
question do you like yoga raise your

00:45:48,170 --> 00:45:53,570
hands don't you like yeah Wow that's a

00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:55,370
fair amount you just like me

00:45:53,570 --> 00:45:56,990
if you ever come to Berlin office you

00:45:55,370 --> 00:45:58,550
will know that I encourage everyone to

00:45:56,990 --> 00:46:01,670
attend our first day morning yoga

00:45:58,550 --> 00:46:02,810
classes so probably now you're asking

00:46:01,670 --> 00:46:04,760
yourself all right gotcha

00:46:02,810 --> 00:46:07,400
yeah that's nice you making us look at

00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:08,960
this picture of this funny yoga pants

00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:11,690
what that's the stuff to do with

00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:14,210
Internet health and the report well I'll

00:46:11,690 --> 00:46:17,960
tell you my passion for yoga turned out

00:46:14,210 --> 00:46:21,970
to be a bit dangerous for me in 2017 I

00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:25,190
thought I deserve a professional grade

00:46:21,970 --> 00:46:28,880
american-made yoga mat so I went online

00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:32,540
and I ordered one it was shipped and it

00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:34,430
was great but to my surprise a couple of

00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:37,490
months later in just couple of weeks

00:46:34,430 --> 00:46:40,810
before we published a report I received

00:46:37,490 --> 00:46:43,070
by mail to my Berrien address a letter a

00:46:40,810 --> 00:46:45,560
letter that informed me about the

00:46:43,070 --> 00:46:48,110
security breach at the online company

00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:50,630
where I bought my yoga mat and that my

00:46:48,110 --> 00:46:52,640
credit card data including the security

00:46:50,630 --> 00:46:55,340
code a detail that shouldn't have been

00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:57,920
stored in the first place was leaked

00:46:55,340 --> 00:47:01,190
then I should probably call my bank that

00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:03,560
was the only advice I got so I was

00:47:01,190 --> 00:47:07,460
pretty upset of course I called my bank

00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:09,950
and my money was saved but this made me

00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:11,480
think this made me think how many other

00:47:09,950 --> 00:47:14,570
people receive this kind of letters

00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:18,710
recently or even worse how many breaches

00:47:14,570 --> 00:47:20,150
were there and no letters were sent do

00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:22,640
we want to live in the world when we

00:47:20,150 --> 00:47:25,340
give up we are what we like just because

00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:28,310
we worried that somebody there was maybe

00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:30,470
sloppy about data security it also made

00:47:28,310 --> 00:47:33,290
me think about how over the course of

00:47:30,470 --> 00:47:35,330
the last year's I stopped sharing more

00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:37,730
and more my personal details from my

00:47:35,330 --> 00:47:40,730
friends over social networks

00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:44,000
and how torn I was when I wanted to buy

00:47:40,730 --> 00:47:47,440
a fitness tracker I don't feel I can be

00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:51,410
myself anymore online these days and

00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:55,070
well this is a problem because Internet

00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:56,720
is our and environment now the whether

00:47:55,070 --> 00:47:59,750
it's healthy or not affects our

00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:02,869
happiness our pocketbooks democracies

00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:04,850
and economies and this is exactly this

00:48:02,869 --> 00:48:07,840
kind of human issues that we pay

00:48:04,850 --> 00:48:12,020
attention in the Internet Health Report

00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:14,510
we want to connect the everyday issues

00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:16,430
that affect us that made is live off of

00:48:14,510 --> 00:48:19,670
the abstract issues of that

00:48:16,430 --> 00:48:21,440
centralization of privacy we write the

00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:23,030
report for the people in the movement

00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:25,250
who want to understand the issues a

00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:27,890
little bit better and want to know what

00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:33,020
do to make motivate people to make

00:48:27,890 --> 00:48:34,910
internet healthier the report covers the

00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:38,750
big five internet health issues I'm sure

00:48:34,910 --> 00:48:41,090
we all familiar with they all overlap in

00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:43,670
different ways but personal data is what

00:48:41,090 --> 00:48:46,220
cuts really across all of them we always

00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:51,500
talk about being private about knowing

00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:54,320
what's happening to our data in the core

00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:57,650
business model just as Rene told us

00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:59,990
before of the internet relies on

00:48:57,650 --> 00:49:02,600
personal data and knowing everything

00:48:59,990 --> 00:49:05,600
about everyone repackaging the data and

00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:09,560
selling it again in the report we look

00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:11,390
at the very brain very broad possible

00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:14,060
range of factors that affect the

00:49:11,390 --> 00:49:16,940
internet health but we highlight three

00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:19,700
main topics that we found most important

00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:21,020
in the last months and they all also of

00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:23,900
course have something to do with

00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:26,090
personal data we talk about securing the

00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:27,920
Internet of Things and the billions of

00:49:26,090 --> 00:49:30,290
devices that will come online in the

00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:34,490
next 20 years we talk about

00:49:30,290 --> 00:49:37,700
misinformation and the broken ad economy

00:49:34,490 --> 00:49:39,980
behind it we talked about two big tech

00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:42,830
so we wonder are the big technology

00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:46,130
giants to pick should we do something

00:49:42,830 --> 00:49:47,330
about it relying on the business model I

00:49:46,130 --> 00:49:50,119
just mentioned they're getting more

00:49:47,330 --> 00:49:51,620
wealthy and powerful and the data that

00:49:50,119 --> 00:49:53,570
they collect is easily

00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:57,080
is easy to be preached by unethical

00:49:53,570 --> 00:49:59,660
hackers and then it can be miss misuse

00:49:57,080 --> 00:50:03,440
too deep and even the divides that exist

00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:05,960
and discrimination beyond the spotlight

00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:09,050
articles we also look at everyday

00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:10,910
examples of people who are affected by

00:50:09,050 --> 00:50:13,940
these photos we talked to a ransomware

00:50:10,910 --> 00:50:18,920
victim or to a cryptographer an activist

00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:21,080
in Egypt but the core strength of the

00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:23,450
report is that although we have a very

00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:32,570
powerful and great team with Solanas our

00:50:23,450 --> 00:50:34,820
editor Sam and our gyrus and myself we

00:50:32,570 --> 00:50:36,590
actually wrote the report together with

00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:39,140
all of you with the army of people and

00:50:36,590 --> 00:50:41,270
staffers from across moko and mofos with

00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:44,740
the fellows so many of you and with many

00:50:41,270 --> 00:50:48,590
organizations like Wikimedia digit are

00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:50,540
ranking digital rights or the web

00:50:48,590 --> 00:50:52,640
foundation and many many more really we

00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:53,870
almost had 200 contributors from all

00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:58,130
around the world and I'm talking about

00:50:53,870 --> 00:51:00,800
really substantial contributions so we

00:50:58,130 --> 00:51:05,360
worked and worked many months hard and

00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:07,910
then the day of the launch came and well

00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:10,670
I forgot to mention one more being very

00:51:07,910 --> 00:51:12,440
important this slide is about saying a

00:51:10,670 --> 00:51:13,730
big thank you to all of you because we

00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:21,560
created it together

00:51:13,730 --> 00:51:23,360
thank you the most important slide of

00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:26,740
the whole presentation thank you for

00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:29,960
being pastor thank you for being

00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:31,850
diligent thoughtful creative and above

00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:34,460
all patient with all of us I think we

00:51:31,850 --> 00:51:37,730
can all be proud of ourselves and this

00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:40,360
is just beginning so we worked very hard

00:51:37,730 --> 00:51:44,660
and the day of the lunch arrived and

00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:46,220
this happened well when we started to

00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:48,320
work at the report we could never have

00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:50,720
planned for this coincident that choose

00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:52,370
that the exactly very day when we

00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:54,920
launched the report when we hit the

00:51:52,370 --> 00:51:58,280
publish button all the eyeballs and all

00:51:54,920 --> 00:52:00,500
the cameras were targeted at the

00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:02,660
American Congress or my Superbird was

00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:05,020
testifying well I started watching it

00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:09,040
myself as well

00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:10,810
and we were a little bit scared we held

00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:12,099
our breath because we thought we didn't

00:52:10,810 --> 00:52:14,050
know where this overshadow our

00:52:12,099 --> 00:52:16,510
publication we'll go under in all this

00:52:14,050 --> 00:52:19,810
media mess but it quickly became

00:52:16,510 --> 00:52:23,440
apparent that it actually we hit the

00:52:19,810 --> 00:52:26,440
momentum while the headlines about

00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:29,380
Cambridge analytical about data and

00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:31,750
privacy hid the made in mainstream media

00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:36,250
it quickly became apparent also that

00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:38,020
people are looking for answers that they

00:52:36,250 --> 00:52:39,910
know something's wrong but nobody could

00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:41,770
really understand and explain to them

00:52:39,910 --> 00:52:43,630
what's wrong so we were the right report

00:52:41,770 --> 00:52:47,140
in the right place

00:52:43,630 --> 00:52:50,890
we got exclusively positive coverage in

00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:54,460
major tech publications in the US UK

00:52:50,890 --> 00:52:56,830
France in Germany and especially great

00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:58,750
thing about it was that contrary to last

00:52:56,830 --> 00:53:00,550
year when the media mostly reported

00:52:58,750 --> 00:53:03,040
about the sheer existence of the report

00:53:00,550 --> 00:53:05,320
this year they really dove into the

00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:07,060
issues the journalists maybe started the

00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:09,520
interviews with McCambridge analytical

00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:11,020
but then they went further and picked up

00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:13,420
on the issues we raised like digital

00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:18,880
colonialism internal shutdowns and many

00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:21,460
more above all we wanted however the

00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:24,670
Internet's to be perceived as a resource

00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:27,070
it is published under a free license so

00:53:24,670 --> 00:53:28,630
it can be taken it can be copied remixed

00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:30,700
translated and this is exactly what

00:53:28,630 --> 00:53:33,099
happened and it happened all over the

00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:35,470
world and this is mainly thanks to the

00:53:33,099 --> 00:53:37,510
fantastic world by Amira and iris who

00:53:35,470 --> 00:53:39,550
came up with a great engagement plan and

00:53:37,510 --> 00:53:44,589
worked with many of you also to produce

00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:46,630
materials in many languages so this is

00:53:44,589 --> 00:53:48,880
only of two months after publication and

00:53:46,630 --> 00:53:50,410
we had around 40 actions by the

00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:52,210
community taking towards the report

00:53:50,410 --> 00:53:54,250
related to the report as you can see all

00:53:52,210 --> 00:53:57,250
over the world really in 16 different

00:53:54,250 --> 00:53:58,349
countries so there were medium articles

00:53:57,250 --> 00:54:00,790
being written

00:53:58,349 --> 00:54:03,130
we had partnership we received

00:54:00,790 --> 00:54:05,800
partnership requests we went on so many

00:54:03,130 --> 00:54:08,560
events the right scone república

00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:10,330
creative commons PDF in central eastern

00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:13,200
europe and so on there were dozens of

00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:15,420
community events being organized

00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:18,270
parts of the report were even translated

00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:20,400
voluntarily into Portuguese not to

00:54:18,270 --> 00:54:22,980
mention all that all the materials and

00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:26,030
of course we started counting because we

00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:28,980
all know keep the eyes are important

00:54:26,030 --> 00:54:31,290
right now we are we are the more than 7

00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:34,049
press mentions more than 80,000 unique

00:54:31,290 --> 00:54:36,299
visitors more than 10,000 PDF downloads

00:54:34,049 --> 00:54:43,559
and many many rows show events and many

00:54:36,299 --> 00:54:46,680
are so to come so what's next we are at

00:54:43,559 --> 00:54:48,930
the very start of what report can become

00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:52,920
both for the movement and for Mozilla

00:54:48,930 --> 00:54:55,799
and your everyday work as part of this

00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:57,900
vision we all work on the internet

00:54:55,799 --> 00:55:00,690
health and are actually defining what

00:54:57,900 --> 00:55:04,799
this means the nurture fellows you are

00:55:00,690 --> 00:55:07,290
fellows you train open leaders to create

00:55:04,799 --> 00:55:09,630
conditions for Mozilla to thrive launch

00:55:07,290 --> 00:55:11,010
amazing advocacy campaigns I was really

00:55:09,630 --> 00:55:14,640
really impressed by the length is within

00:55:11,010 --> 00:55:17,430
the Amazon and this is exactly what the

00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:19,079
internet is for and what is it about so

00:55:17,430 --> 00:55:20,460
we don't want you only to contribute to

00:55:19,079 --> 00:55:23,280
it of course we want you to contribute

00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:25,260
to it but we also want you to use it to

00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:27,480
take it and to integrate it into your

00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:29,190
work and this is also something we're

00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:32,670
going to be talking about in the next

00:55:29,190 --> 00:55:35,010
days so let's think together about how

00:55:32,670 --> 00:55:36,630
can we make this connection click really

00:55:35,010 --> 00:55:39,059
between the everyday experience the

00:55:36,630 --> 00:55:41,460
human experience and the big issues now

00:55:39,059 --> 00:55:42,809
sometimes it's just a little thing let's

00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:45,420
make it click sometimes you need to

00:55:42,809 --> 00:55:47,760
receive a data breach letter from a yoga

00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:49,680
company but hopefully is not going to be

00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:54,390
less traumatizing for everyone hopefully

00:55:49,680 --> 00:56:00,839
we can help a little bit so we are still

00:55:54,390 --> 00:56:03,480
a long way before we have a long way

00:56:00,839 --> 00:56:06,210
before now what we going to put into the

00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:08,369
next internet health report but surely

00:56:06,210 --> 00:56:10,109
it will have something to do with the

00:56:08,369 --> 00:56:11,579
personal experience of the internet what

00:56:10,109 --> 00:56:15,119
are we going to be talking about smart

00:56:11,579 --> 00:56:18,049
cities and and how they affect our

00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:20,309
freedom to move privately or assemble

00:56:18,049 --> 00:56:22,410
publicly or maybe we're going to be

00:56:20,309 --> 00:56:26,190
talking about cyber warfare and however

00:56:22,410 --> 00:56:26,820
everyday devices can be turned into into

00:56:26,190 --> 00:56:31,020
weapons

00:56:26,820 --> 00:56:32,880
for those attacks or similar we cannot

00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:35,820
divorce the personnel from the global

00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:37,920
when it comes to the internet so when my

00:56:35,820 --> 00:56:40,710
data was stolen when I purchased the

00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:44,160
yoga mat it wasn't an attack personal

00:56:40,710 --> 00:56:46,410
attack on my freedom nobody was trying

00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:48,720
to stop me from working on my personal

00:56:46,410 --> 00:56:51,240
health but each time I roll out this

00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:54,900
blog mat I think that they ease with

00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:56,970
which I purchased the yoga mat online it

00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:59,730
comes at a price that our society is

00:56:56,970 --> 00:57:03,510
still about to realize the full extent

00:56:59,730 --> 00:57:07,020
of and consequences of the problems of

00:57:03,510 --> 00:57:09,900
the Internet are personal and the human

00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:12,900
risk are above concentrated around a

00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:15,150
personal data and the data is my data

00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:18,120
your data and everybody in my yoga class

00:57:15,150 --> 00:57:20,430
so maybe we still not able to really

00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:23,010
articulate in a short-handed way what

00:57:20,430 --> 00:57:26,730
the Internet's health really is about

00:57:23,010 --> 00:57:30,210
but for me aspirationally at least I

00:57:26,730 --> 00:57:33,000
think Internet is helping when it all it

00:57:30,210 --> 00:57:35,590
makes us all go

00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:45,300
[Music]

00:57:35,590 --> 00:57:45,300
[Applause]

00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:59,550
maybe just one more round of applause

00:57:48,120 --> 00:58:01,350
for kasia john melissa and of course you

00:57:59,550 --> 00:58:02,730
know everyone in this room could get up

00:58:01,350 --> 00:58:05,730
and tell a story as we're all

00:58:02,730 --> 00:58:08,070
contributing for that and an even bigger

00:58:05,730 --> 00:58:09,690
set of things and really this week is

00:58:08,070 --> 00:58:14,130
really about us all sharing those

00:58:09,690 --> 00:58:16,710
stories just a quick poll before we move

00:58:14,130 --> 00:58:18,870
into the interactive participatory part

00:58:16,710 --> 00:58:21,900
of the plenary how many people learned

00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:25,380
something in that last four sets of

00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:27,360
things and so good that was the point I

00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:28,410
certainly learned about there's many

00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:31,770
things in there that I didn't know

00:58:28,410 --> 00:58:34,530
before I saw those talks last week and

00:58:31,770 --> 00:58:36,240
then kind of even more details today one

00:58:34,530 --> 00:58:38,010
of the questions I asked the same time

00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:40,680
at the end of the plenary in Austin was

00:58:38,010 --> 00:58:43,020
I'm not asking this now how many people

00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:44,970
want to have more conversations about

00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:47,190
stuff like this there's a part of

00:58:44,970 --> 00:58:49,470
everyday work the the question I do want

00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:51,150
asked is how many people feel we are

00:58:49,470 --> 00:58:52,770
having more conversations about the

00:58:51,150 --> 00:58:55,410
stuff we just heard about as a part of

00:58:52,770 --> 00:58:57,420
our everyday work so that's an

00:58:55,410 --> 00:58:59,280
interesting thing I would throw out a

00:58:57,420 --> 00:59:03,780
seat in the conversation about half of

00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:06,660
us I think it energizes us it makes the

00:59:03,780 --> 00:59:09,560
work deeper whether we're building a

00:59:06,660 --> 00:59:13,740
website for designing a campaign or

00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:16,170
writing the Terms of Service or raising

00:59:13,740 --> 00:59:19,530
money everybody here is a part of doing

00:59:16,170 --> 00:59:21,720
that and really one of the key things is

00:59:19,530 --> 00:59:24,030
for us to be talking about that and

00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:26,730
connect it to the personal as kasia said

00:59:24,030 --> 00:59:30,240
at the end so that's what we're gonna do

00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:31,910
now certainly we're at a spot where the

00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:34,640
public is listening on these issues

00:59:31,910 --> 00:59:37,890
awareness but we're we're doing a lot on

00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:40,740
the data personal data set of themes as

00:59:37,890 --> 00:59:43,320
you've seen as much more expansive even

00:59:40,740 --> 00:59:45,720
than what you have seen but what we want

00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:47,790
to do now is look at something we need

00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:51,090
to do both externally but has to start

00:59:47,790 --> 00:59:51,510
here which is get under our heads a

00:59:51,090 --> 00:59:54,960
little bit

00:59:51,510 --> 00:59:56,670
these are big really really big issues

00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:59,400
but it's a big intellectual issues

00:59:56,670 --> 01:00:01,200
problems to solve puzzles to solve we

00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:03,359
actually have to connect that head part

01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:05,670
somebody get everything at Bart to the

01:00:03,359 --> 01:00:08,180
hard part so what did it feel like to

01:00:05,670 --> 01:00:10,710
get that letter or what is our

01:00:08,180 --> 01:00:13,790
experience at a heart level of these

01:00:10,710 --> 01:00:16,440
issues why do we actually spend our time

01:00:13,790 --> 01:00:20,490
talking about the staff working on this

01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:21,780
staff so that's the invitation it or not

01:00:20,490 --> 01:00:23,580
just for the next half hour but

01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:25,170
especially for the next half hour to

01:00:23,580 --> 01:00:27,930
really kind of make that head heart

01:00:25,170 --> 01:00:30,810
connection and get into the heart part

01:00:27,930 --> 01:00:32,310
of it and so that and Jan are gonna come

01:00:30,810 --> 01:00:34,020
and lead us through that they did this

01:00:32,310 --> 01:00:35,520
exercise the smaller group before I

01:00:34,020 --> 01:00:39,730
thought it was amazing so everything

01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:42,829
glad you've offered to come and do it so

01:00:39,730 --> 01:00:42,829
