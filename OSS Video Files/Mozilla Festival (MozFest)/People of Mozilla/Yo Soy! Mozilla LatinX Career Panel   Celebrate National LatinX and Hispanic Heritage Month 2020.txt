thank you

00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,600
all we're just gonna kick off you know

00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,440
the reason that we're here as leslie

00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,199
mentioned is that it's national latinx

00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,320
and hispanic heritage month

00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:06,000
and so what we really want to hear about

00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,520
today is just sort of

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,680
the the name of the panel is called yo

00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,280
soy what made you

00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,720
sort of who you are today and what

00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,479
brought you here and

00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,560
we know that your stories are rich and

00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:17,600
varied and so what we're going to do how

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,759
we're going to tackle this

00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,680
is we're going to have each panelist

00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,759
share just one anecdote

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,360
from your background that is

00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,280
illustrative of

00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,600
sort of how your background is so

00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:32,080
formative and how it brought you here

00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,080
and this is really a discussion so

00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,919
rather than each person sort of going

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,120
if you want to comment on somebody

00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,759
else's story

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,440
or add to it um by all means that's

00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,919
really the format here

00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,120
so yeah can i enter for one moment and

00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,199
see if um

00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,039
some people can't attend this call right

00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,840
now and they would love to hear this

00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:53,840
would we be open to recording it

00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,120
um this is already being recorded i

00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,639
believe on air mozilla

00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:00,240

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,080
okay so yeah this will be on air mozilla

00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,039
later for folks as well

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,080
so um so we're gonna start with those

00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:15,199
stories

00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,639
so this meeting is being recorded and

00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,639
we're also being recorded

00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,479
so would anyone like to start with a

00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,080
personal story about

00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:24,720
what made you who you are and brought

00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:27,840
you here yeah i can go first

00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,759
um uh you know i've been thinking about

00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,160
this question a lot since you asked it

00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,600
and

00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,360
thinking about things about my

00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,240
background and things that really

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,680
influenced

00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:40,080
like who i am today what i do and

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,840
i remembered that when i was in junior

00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,880
high in high school i was actually

00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:47,680
a translator for our court systems uh

00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,080
for immigration cases i grew up in a

00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,080
small

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,280
town in new hampshire there weren't a

00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,639
lot of people that were

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,800
truly bilingual and that could help and

00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,400
so it was a job that i did all

00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,440
throughout junior high in high school

00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:05,440
and a couple things that that taught me

00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:08,240
one is the importance of empathy

00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,720
the second is that you know who you are

00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,960
on

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:14,479
paper isn't who you are in real life and

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,240
that doesn't always come across

00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,039
especially in the most important times

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,199
in your life

00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:21,120
and so it's important that we understand

00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,680
people for who they are

00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,360
and the third and and this is i think

00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,160
the most important of what

00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,960
shaped me in a lot of ways is so much of

00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,599
my role

00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,880
at that point in my life was trying to

00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:35,360
get to know the people

00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,800
to be able to help them with their story

00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,479
in front of the courts

00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,840
because i knew that what was on paper

00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:43,039
wasn't enough

00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,720
and so that that idea of like curiosity

00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,879
and that idea of getting to know someone

00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,960
to help convey their story

00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,319
to allow them to stay in this country

00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,440
was so important

00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,400
and it's something that i've carried

00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,400
with me to today

00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:00,160
wonderful thank you who else would like

00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:04,479
to share

00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:06,560
and the third and and and this sorry

00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:08,400
um i can i can kind of piggyback off of

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,039
that that for me

00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,240
um i think like i i grew up in miami

00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,160
florida

00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,520
i grew up speaking spanish everyone

00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,440
around me i think the official language

00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,440
of miami is spanglish

00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,280
um and so just kind of having that

00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,639
realization once i left and moved to a

00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,240
bigger city that

00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,000
not everyone kisses on the cheek to say

00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,000
hello not everyone speaks spanish

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,919
not everyone knows what a pupusa is

00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,240
right like knowing that

00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:34,080
my point of view is actually really

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,279
unique and not actually represented and

00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,080
not just in the media but

00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,719
in a lot of industries and being able to

00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,719
kind of tap

00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:42,560
into you know your latinidad and your

00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,080
dual identity and being able to

00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,399
kind of speak to that and represent that

00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,560
point of view because it really isn't

00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:51,360
and i think that's really fueled me and

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,360
my work that i do

00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,839
wonderful thank you

00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:02,320
i think liz joined us too so liz if um

00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,959
what we did is initially folks just said

00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,320
their name

00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,480
and what you do at mozilla and how long

we're going around and sharing a story

00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,399
from our background but we'll let you

00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,760
start just with your name and what you

00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,600
do here

00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,480
i'm so sorry i was clearly very

00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,240
engrossed in the company meeting

00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,399
i feel like i had some sort of a lag but

00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,519
i'm the zenibaum i am the senior social

00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,320
strategist

00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,600
on the firefox team i work on the

00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,320
marketing team with both

00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,279
uh eddie and ashford super excited to be

00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,720
here

00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:36,480
um and talk about uh our culture

00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:40,080
and everything that uh we have going on

00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,519
great thank you um

00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,200
so we're not going to put you on a spot

00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,040
for a story yet but eddie

00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,240
and astrid have already shared a

00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,760
personal story from their background

00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,440
that has really influenced them so

00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,560
that's where we're at now so

00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,760
tony or ilda would you like to go next

00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,320
and share

00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,320
a story

00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,120
yeah i'll jump in i think for me it's um

00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,279
it's it

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,800
starts with uh opportunity and i think

00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,760
that that's kind of where like the

00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,519
origin of

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,680
this is for me as well with with my

00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,760
ancestors and i think for me the

00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:14,399
what what i think back to is uh the

00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,920
story of my grandfather who's uh

00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,519
actually my middle name so my full name

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,399
is antonio andres i'm named after both

00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:22,320
my grandparents

00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:23,839
so um so andres came in 1962 as part of

00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,440
the rossettos program and

00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:31,200
he came looking for opportunity um

00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,399
and he pretty much served his his

00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,279
community

00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,480
um helped others around him and i think

00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:39,120
for me that that's

00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,160
a big a big inspiration and a big

00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,560
driving force for

00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,160
for who i am what inspires me on a daily

00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,959
basis and

00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,160
he was uh he was one that inspired a lot

00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:51,600
of people around him

00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,399
he inspired my dad um and their family

00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,399
and

00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,560
our family started off in the fields and

00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,320
got into construction and through that

00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,800
ended up learning a lot a lot of trades

00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,000
and basically that's i mean it's

00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,600
part of the metaphor but it's like

00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,880
basically building a grassroots house

00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,600
from the ground up right so that's what

00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,600
the cement

00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,120
builds all the way to the top and and

00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,079
through that they learned all the skill

00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,360
sets so

00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:13,680
for me that's that's my biggest

00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,720
inspiration and it's goes back to

00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,320
opportunity

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,279
so that's that's why i came to mozilla

00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,279
is looking for opportunity

00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,480
and building on tony's story i guess i

00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:31,120
would have to say the same

00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:34,240
so um i think a lot of my background

00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:36,800
is built more like what i bring to it is

00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:39,200
more about the resilience and creativity

00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,160
and being able to navigate through

00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,279
things

00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:45,839
even when things are really hard um

00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:47,600
and i think i learned that just from by

00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:50,800
the people that i interacted with with

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:54,240
my family my neighborhood

00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:56,079
so just being very resilient and

00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,240
this year seems to have brought that out

00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:00,320
right for everybody we all need to

00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,600
be able to be resilient and be creative

00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,600
and how we work and what we do

00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,720
yeah i mean i can add on to that too i

00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,680
think resilience is something that i can

00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,160
really relate to

00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:14,399
from my background growing up and kind

00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:17,680
of my family's experience with

00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:20,160
uh coming to the states from puerto rico

00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,279
my mother would tell she told me the

00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,240
story of how

00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:25,839
they came to new york and she was put

00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,160
into elementary school and she didn't

00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:27,920
know

00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,160
a word of english and there's no such

00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,560
thing as esl like back in the day

00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,440
so you were just kind of forced to

00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,839
figure it out

00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,040
and kind of persevere and move through

00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,320
that

00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,240
and i think you know she really drilled

00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:43,519
into me uh

00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:45,920
just that that kind of same mentality of

00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,639
uh resilience and perseverance and kind

00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,959
of growing up

00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,320
uh where i grew up in the city like very

00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:53,040
underprivileged background

00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,639
um you know she really taught me that

00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,600
like education was where

00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,079
how i was gonna get out of uh where i

00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,079
was

00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,519
and move forward and i kind of took that

00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,440
to heart and made sure that like you

00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,120
know education was my priority and focus

00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,560
on that really hard um

00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,240
and i think that's kind of what got me

00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,320
to where i am today just kind of that

00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,399
perseverance and that resilience and

00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,360
to hilda's point like 2020 has been

00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,720
terrible but

00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,720
you know you just kind of rolled the

00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,399
punches and i think if you come

00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,560
from a background where you have that

00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:22,079
experience um

00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,880
you know you can get through anything

00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:26,800
even 2020.

00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:29,120
thank you for articulating that so well

00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,120
liz

00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:35,920
neat so um so you all kind of

00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,440
i mean maybe it was teed up this way

00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,199
because i said share a story from your

00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,160
background but you all drew on your

00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,399
family

00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,279
um that seemed to be kind of a common

00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,839
theme

00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:46,639
and i guess i'm gonna ask a question

00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,000
which is

00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,920
you know what does your family think

00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,040
about how your life is you know your

00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,440
career

00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:55,519
um you know come on give us some some

00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,120
pride or whatever but you know like

00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:59,279
what's their reaction do they expect you

00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,040
to be where you're at today and and

00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:03,040
how did they they play into that as you

00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,680
went along as you evolved and eddie you

00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,720
look like you

00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:09,680
you some say yeah i think

00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,720
um you know it's funny because uh my

00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,639
father

00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,800
and particularly my family still in

00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:17,760
latin america has no idea what i do

00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,720
and despite how much i try to explain it

00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,800
um

00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,959
they just kind of laugh and they're like

00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:26,720
oh well that sounds great you know

00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:29,120
um i think beyond that though you know i

00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,000
the the fact that you know coming where

00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,199
my family came

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,279
from you know no education no money

00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:37,120
coming to this country with literally a

00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,959
hundred dollars in their pocket

00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,199
you know the fact that i was able to go

00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:43,760
to high school they'll go to a college

00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:45,279
graduate you know have a family i mean

00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:48,560
these are things that make them

00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:50,639
so happy um and you know

00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,399
you're right it for for us it's very

00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,920
much about you know family and

00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:55,360
connectivity and

00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,880
um and it's one of the things i'm

00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,720
actually very grateful for about

00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:01,600
companies of mozilla

00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,560
and the ability to connect with people

00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,440
via the internet

00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:07,120
you know i was thinking about one thing

00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,760
from my past which was

00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,360
i did a short stint of going to school

00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,760
down in argentina

00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,959
and back then you know you had to buy

00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,279
like a webcam

00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:18,880
and the connection was awful and it

00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,680
would cut out all the time and i think

00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,000
about

00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,040
like what life is like now and how i'm

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,959
able to

00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,320
share and connect with my family real

00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,920
time you know

00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,639
talk to them every single day even

00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:33,279
though we're you know continents apart

00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,279
it's amazing

00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,440
yeah i can add on to that too i think my

00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,440
mom has no idea

00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,199
of what i do it's like i work on the

00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,560
internet like i'm on the computer all

00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,839
day that's all she knows she like calls

00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,320
me for tech support like

00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,120
my wi-fi is broken like i don't do that

00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,800
um

00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:54,959
but you know she had high expectations

00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,440
for me like i was raised by a single

00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:58,160
mother

00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,839
and uh you know there was no other

00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:03,040
alternative like i either

00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:05,440
like graduated and did school and like

00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,240
graduated at top of my class or i was in

00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,160
so much trouble

00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:11,440
like and you don't want to be in trouble

00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:14,399
from a latin mother let me tell you

00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,120
so you know it was always like a lot of

00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,040
pressure

00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,160
growing up to deliver on that

00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,399
expectation

00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,600
um and being the first in my family to

00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,320
graduate from

00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,600
a university uh you know was a huge

00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,279
achievement and i think you know she's

00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,440
just really proud that

00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,880
you know i delivered on the expectations

00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,519
she had and

00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,160
um you know i've flourished since then

00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,480
which is

00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,160
fantastic but i think you know i could

00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,160
have done anything and chosen anything

00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,199
as a career and she would have been fine

00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,440
with it um

00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:44,320
she's just really proud that like you

00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,680
know i

00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:49,519
i got out and uh you know and instilling

00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,160
the same kind of values in my daughter

00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:53,600
that

00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,600
were instilled in me growing up

00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,320
i think i can continue with that the

00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,320
same idea

00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,519
i'm originally from the dominican

00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:05,039
republic and

00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:05,919
i immigrated to canada almost two years

00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:08,079
ago

00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:09,919
and i remember that i was working for

00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:12,640
the tax office there

00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,600
uh dominican republic is a small island

00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:17,520
in the caribbean

00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:20,319
and it's a it's not a rich country

00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,360
and i remember that i was working for

00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:25,679
the task office

00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:29,200
and i was working on

00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:30,559
tech and i

00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,559
from the beginning i started reading

00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:35,840
about moxila about

00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:38,480
a fighting against microsoft

00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,160
and it was a thing that inspired me to

00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:43,520
to

00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,960
go to the tech career but it was

00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:48,240
something that i

00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:50,799
like i didn't i never aspired

00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,480
to do that that thing that worked for a

00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:54,640
big company because

00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,400
when you come from a country that is

00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:59,600
poor and you don't have like

00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:02,080
those alternatives it's like you have a

00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,799
stereotype for yourself and you think

00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,000
like

00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:08,720
it is not possible and you close

00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,400
all day doors for yourself and i

00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:14,000
remember that i spent like

00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:17,360
six years with that doubt thinking

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:20,160
uh i want to aspire to

00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,799
uh working a big company but it's not

00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,400
for me

00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,720
because i come from a a poor country in

00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,320
east

00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:31,440
for me i spent the whole six years

00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:34,480
with that doubt in my mind and someday i

00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,760
applied for a company in canada it was

00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,080
shopify

00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,280
and i never thought that they were like

00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:42,240
send me an invitation

00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,880
and they did for my surprise they did

00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,760
and i

00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,240
came to canada for the first time i

00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,120
never

00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,080
spoke english in outside of like

00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:53,360
watching tv

00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:55,520
and going to classes and for me

00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,720
like they thought that a company was

00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:00,160
sponsoring me

00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:01,760
for coming to a country and paying for

00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,840
everything and

00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,760
just for having an interview with me it

00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:09,440
was like a

00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:13,039
a big push to give me

00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:15,120
self-esteem to continue and i

00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:16,559
came here to canada and spend like a

00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:20,559
week taking

00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:22,320
a like knowing the city and

00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:24,720
having an interview in the company

00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:28,000
unfortunately i didn't got the job

00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:32,160
but when i go back to dominican republic

00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:35,520
the same day that i came back i i um

00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,840
quit my job because that gave me like

00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:40,160
the power

00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:43,360
to believe in myself and don't

00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:45,360
create false stereotypes that are not

00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:49,280
real that are in your mind

00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:50,640
and after that yeah this is amazing i

00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,440
just want to make sure we know who you

00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,440

in um for the panelists

00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,720
reminder

00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:08,080
if folks have questions by the way i'm

00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,440
not i don't have to be the only one

00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,000
asking questions so um

00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,880
if you want to tag me in moco the moco

00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,159
slack channel

00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,039
just tag me and i'll see it um but we

00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,600
did have a question

00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:21,039
that someone sent to me which was um is

00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,520
there anything special about your

00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:24,880
experiences as a latinx mozillian

00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,640
that are either more positive or

00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:31,840
negative than what you've experienced at

00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,840
other companies

00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:38,559
i can answer that so i i come from um

00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:41,039
very large multinational for-profit

00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:43,520
companies the majority of my career

00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:45,600
and i found that mozilla has been very

00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,159
warm welcoming very friendly it is more

00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,640
like a

00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:50,799
family which is you know very important

00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:54,480
for us as everyone has mentioned

00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:57,520
and i think um my experience here has

00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:59,919
been more of i'm part of a great team

00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,280
i'm working together with everyone and

00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,320
there's a lot of empathy and

00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:05,760
understanding

00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:08,159
and um just a will

00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,679
an effort to get to know you as a person

00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:13,120
and that's not always

00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:14,799
you know been in other places and i

00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,559
think that

00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:18,320
i'm not sure if it's necessarily just

00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:20,080
our latin culture but i think maybe just

00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,799
the mozilla culture and maybe those of

00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:24,159
us who

00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:26,480
have that type of uh focus

00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:27,760
bring more are more able to share that

00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,240
here be more

00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,919
open about it and i want to do a shout

00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,480
out to arturo because i've worked with

00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,880
him

00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,720
uh with the firefights engineering team

00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,320
and met him uh pretty much i guess when

00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,159
he started give or take and

00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:42,240
he's been phenomenal on the team and

00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:44,000
he's just been amazing to work with and

00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,799

having met you and your wife so i'm glad

00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:56,559
that you're here

00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,600
anyone else want to share i was just

00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:59,440
going to say like

00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,880
you know this isn't a better or worse by

00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,039
any stretch

00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,080
but what i have found interesting is no

00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:06,799
matter what

00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,520
company i've worked at um whether small

00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:10,559
or big

00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:12,080
um the latin community we tend to find

00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:14,480
each other pretty quickly

00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:16,159
uh and we tend to rely on each other

00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,440
kind of from the early days even if

00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:20,640
we're not

00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:23,600
uh connected in what we do um

00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:25,679
you know by profession uh and and i saw

00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:27,039
this in in so many companies and in so

00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:28,799
many places and

00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:30,799
it's one of the things that i'm super

00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:32,880
grateful for and the same is true here

00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:34,799
you know like the the latin pride

00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:37,280
channel and in slack like

00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:38,799
um you know since day one has always

00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,720
been like very welcoming

00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:42,799
you know always wanting to help always

00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:51,200
wanting to be about connecting and

00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:54,559
chatting and i love that

00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:56,000
anyone else tony astrid and you don't

00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:58,960
have to share on this one

00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,960
i have another one

00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:05,039
you ready for another one okay um

00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:07,120
what do you think are our great

00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:09,440
opportunities to celebrate

00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,799
and benefit from you and your and the

00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,760
other rich cultures that we have at

00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:13,360
mozilla

00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:16,320
whether it's in our products our

00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:19,679
marketing campaigns or even internally

00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:21,760
um what are your thoughts on that

00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:23,360
well i think kind of going off of what

00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:26,720
eddie said here is like community

00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:29,360
i think like you know tapping into

00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:31,200
well the specific the latin community

00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:33,679
it's like he said

00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,720
we just seem to connect so there's these

00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:36,720
these

00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,000
you know ways of communicating ways of

00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,080
ways of connecting and

00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,840
it's like latinos there's another one

00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:44,880
and it just tends to build so it's a

00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:47,039
it's just a big it's a big network um

00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,919
people that you know we're here to drive

00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:50,320
we're here to help and

00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:51,039
we're here to serve so i think that in

00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,440
essence that's

00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:54,240
that's uh that's a good that's a good

00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,360
way to start is

00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,480
is uh having us help out in one way or

00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,679
another but it's like

00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,840
it's a strong community that we have

00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:01,840
here

00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,480
yeah i would say something that's really

00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,400
interesting um

00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,840
just from my time here um and being

00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,440
someone who hasn't been like a super

00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,520
hardcore techie is

00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,640
kind of learning how the community that

00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,640
i grew up in

00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,720
and family and friends have probably

00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:21,840
been surveilled and taken advantage of

00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,799
and have fallen victim to a lot of the

00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:25,200
things that

00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:26,799
we're working on right now there's

00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,400
millions of us in this country i think

00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:29,200
this election there's going to be 32

00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,320
million

00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:34,320
eligible latinx voters um so it's a huge

00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,799
community and it's a great opportunity

00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,159
and it's

00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:38,400
a community that we definitely should be

00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:39,200
talking to because communities of color

00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,200
are the most

00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,039
vulnerable to surveillance and to the

00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,480
issues that we talk about every single

00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:46,080
day so i definitely think it's a huge

00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,200
opportunity and something to think about

00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:50,240
for our products and

00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,240
especially for our marketing

00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,120
and building on that this is something

00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:58,080
that we talk a lot about

00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:00,000
in marketing is is how do we um how do

00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,440
we represent the brand

00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,080
you know that is helping these

00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:06,159
communities you know how do we showcase

00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:08,240
what we can do on the ground to help

00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:08,799
them you know ashford and i talk a lot

00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,000
about

00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:14,480
you know accessibility uh and knowing

00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,400
that you know so much of our young you

00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:19,200
know brothers and sisters don't

00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,640
have access to internet um there's a

00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,679
story that circulated

00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:25,679
not that long ago about some kids

00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:27,120
that were trying to do their schoolwork

00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:29,440
outside of a taco bell

00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,200
in the parking lot on the ground because

00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,159
they've never internet access at home

00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,760
and so that's

00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:36,080
how they were trying to get their

00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:38,000
homework done um

00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,840
and you know i think there's such a huge

00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:44,159
opportunity for for mozilla

00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:46,159
to to be a hero in that conversation

00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:48,559
i agree i think you know if mozilla

00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:51,120
shows up they have to be

00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:52,000
always there too like you can't just

00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,000
show up and and

00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,279
seem like you're taking advantage of the

00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
underprivileged communities

00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:58,640
or communities of color um you have to

00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,840
be there

00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:04,480
and be there all the way um

00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,600
the the children aspect is something

00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,640
i've talked about with

00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:11,279
with everybody as well like um

00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,840
just knowing like my experience growing

00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:14,559
up from

00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:16,720
where i was and where i am now i think

00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:18,799
it's hard to imagine what it's like

00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:21,120
being in that sort of scenario and if

00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:23,520
you've never been in it you don't know

00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:25,679
um i think that you know i'd love to

00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:27,760
find more ways to support

00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:29,279
children of all colors and backgrounds

00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:32,240
and you know deliver

00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:32,799
opportunities to them that i had to call

00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,120
my way

00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:37,440
to get because they weren't given to me

00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:39,679
um so i think that there's so much that

00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,919
we could do as an organization

00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:43,120
as a non-profit to really support

00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:44,960
children out there

00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:48,080
and bring technology to them and give

00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:49,600
them the leg up that they honestly need

00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:52,880
to be able to have the privilege that

00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,880
all of us enjoy every day

00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:59,120
hank's other thoughts on that really

00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:03,840
good stuff does anybody have any other

00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:03,840
reactions thoughts

00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:10,720
any other questions for just a reminder

00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:13,840
to ask me in moco

00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:15,360
um you know mozilla as part of our

00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:17,200
racial justice commitments we have

00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:20,720
committed to hiring

00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,919
more folks um who are of the tanks

00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:25,120
background as well as

00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:27,919
uh black and hispanic so we are have

00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,799
explicitly stated that um what's your

00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:31,679
thinking on

00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:33,279
how we can go about doing that well you

00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:35,120
know making it a welcoming environment

00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:38,080
and open environments

00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,080
any thoughts on that

00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:44,640
i think the latin pride employee

00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:47,919
resource group is a great start

00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:49,120
and i i would love to see the different

00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:51,919
organizations

00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,799
um whether it's based on you know on

00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:54,880
whatever

00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:56,480
aspect it is that they be featured

00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,679
within like the onboarding when the

00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:01,039
employee joins

00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:02,720
you know i recently um got involved with

00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:04,159
mentoring new employees and have been

00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:07,600
doing that a little bit

00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:09,200
and it seems to help hopefully

00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:11,360
but i think that that's that's a great

00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,520
way of doing it and just embracing and

00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,640
having that safe place to be able to ask

00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:17,440
questions and

00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,000
when we do join i also think that we all

00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:22,000
because

00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,960
we are um a bit unique in our different

00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,200
environments

00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,480
that we all have an opportunity to share

00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,159
more externally

00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,679
and leverage our networks whether

00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:33,760
they're professional or

00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:36,799
more personal networks to do more um

00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:39,360
education and recruiting so that would

00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:41,360
be an opportunity to kind of grow there

00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:44,320
and maybe that's an opportunity for

00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:46,960
mozilla if we can create some sort of

00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:48,640
um packages if you will like what that

00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,360
was introduced earlier for our marketing

00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,039
campaign

00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:53,440
that could be shared with employees that

00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:55,919
then we can take in and

00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,279
leverage to share them share our our

00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:00,399
message or share our

00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:00,399
our information

00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:06,480
yeah i would say that um hiring is great

00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,880
but

00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,240
i think sometimes you hire and then you

00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,679
don't create an environment where that

00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,320
person can flourish

00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:15,200
um because points of view are different

00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,039
or unique

00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,559
and so i've been in a lot of situations

00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:19,679
where you know maybe i'll suggest

00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:21,679
something and it's like well i don't

00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:22,000
think that's on brand because the person

00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:23,679
just

00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,600
really doesn't doesn't know that

00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:27,039
community or doesn't see that

00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,240
point of view and then later on it's

00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:29,600
something that kind of blows up and

00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,919
you're just sitting there like

00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:33,360
you know what i mean like so i think

00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:36,159
it's it's sometimes like

00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:37,039
the when you're the only one um you can

00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:38,799
kind of feel

00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:40,159
a little bit out of place or that your

00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:41,919
opinion is

00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:43,279
not valued so i would definitely say

00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:45,120
just like creating an environment where

00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:47,200
we all support each other and

00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:51,840
other points of view are valued and you

00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:51,840
allow that person to really flourish

00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:57,600
it's great i think the theme here is

00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,960
community right i think it's like

00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,559
looking for a place to belong looking

00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,159
for a place to feel safe

00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:05,039
looking for a place to relate i think

00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:08,000
that that gives us that

00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:08,000
theme here is community

00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:14,640
so um a number of you have been sharing

00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:17,120
your stories on social media so

00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,880
for folks who haven't seen we have a

00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:21,360
mozilla careers twitter

00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,559
as well as a linkedin page for mozilla

00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,640
and we're sharing

00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:26,000
stories of many of the folks on this

00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,720
call whether on the panel or not on the

00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,799
panel

00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,960
um we're about halfway through it's part

00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:32,640
of the month that we're recognizing

00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,000
um have you gotten any feedback i'm

00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,120
curious for the folks who have already

00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,799
shared their stories out

00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,799
have you gotten any feedback

00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:44,399
yeah i've certainly been um pained quite

00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:47,840
a bit on linkedin

00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:50,799
particularly from kind of younger

00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:51,200
latin folks that were just excited to

00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:53,679
hear

00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,559
our story um you know for those of you

00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:57,279
that know me

00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:58,399
uh i hate attention i hate being in

00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:00,480
front of a camera

00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:02,080
i'm behind a camera person i've been

00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,559
that way my whole life

00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:06,320
um but you know martha convinced me to

00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:07,919
do this because she said

00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,600
you know there's so many young people

00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:12,320
that would love to hear your story

00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,720
and you know aspire to maybe be you one

00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,399
day

00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:17,039
and and it's worth you telling that

00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:18,480
story and and that's a hard thing for me

00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:19,519
to hear it's a hard thing for me to

00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,240
accept

00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:23,440
but i saw it firsthand um and i've

00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:26,080
already been pinged

00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,640
a bunch and have some coffee chats set

00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,919
up with

00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:33,760
young kids to see if i can help mentor

00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:33,760
so i think that's been fantastic

00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:40,559
wow that's pretty cool anyone else have

00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:42,000
more stories like that

00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:43,600
i don't think i've gotten as many pinks

00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,360
as eddie but i must agree

00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:50,799
i think uh kelsey and mata were very um

00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:51,200
encouraging to to share the story and

00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:53,679
and

00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:56,240
um hopefully in being able to inspire

00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:57,919
others and make a difference and um

00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:00,880
similar to what arturo said you know

00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:03,919
show that it can be done right

00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:06,000
so um i've gotten a few pings on

00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:07,679
linkedin from people i don't know so i'm

00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,600
thinking that's probably coming from

00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:12,320
there i haven't really looked um

00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,360
but uh i'm i'm sure that it'll make a

00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,799
difference and i'm

00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,399
i'm glad that we're doing this because i

00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:19,039
think it also can be leveraged by

00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:20,080
other organizations i know um in san

00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:22,559
diego we have

00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:24,000
an organization called mana which is

00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:26,559
kind of like a a

00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
sisterly mentoring organization and that

00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:30,159
person reached out about

00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,080
maybe joining a panel there or something

00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:33,440
so i think that it did get some

00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,919
visibility from

00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,600
how we can you know further expand and

00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:40,159
share our stories

00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,159
our message

00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:45,760
great i think for me that the biggest

00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:48,320
kpi here is

00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:49,519
is my parents love and sharing the story

00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,360
with them is uh

00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:52,880
was definitely a tremendous moment and i

00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,000
think a little bit of like what you know

00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,360
what we're all saying here what eddie

00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,480
said about they don't really understand

00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,799
what we do here

00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,519
like you know it's for us it's you know

00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:01,360
you

00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:03,279
you do something with compute or you do

00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,919
something with la television it's like

00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:05,440
okay like

00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:07,679
they don't understand understand but

00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,320
when when you show them that like here's

00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:09,520
my

00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,800
accomplishment like that's something

00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,320
that you know they don't need they don't

00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,960
need to understand it like they they see

00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,480
that

00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,639
it's like it's something that was

00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,240
accomplished and and they appreciate

00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:20,079
you know that we're giving back to them

00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:22,800
so for me the biggest kpi here is

00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:22,800
my parents love

00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:30,879
that's great um

00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:32,079
let's see so just a reminder folks can

00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:33,919
ping me if they have questions in the

00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:36,720
main moco slack

00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:39,599
and this is really tied to um just

00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:39,599
making it a welcome

00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,760
we were just talking earlier about you

00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:46,720
know how can we create a welcoming

00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:48,480
environment for folks that may join

00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:50,079
anything specific on someone who might

00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,679
be new and

00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:53,280
you know so for example like we have the

00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:55,200
onboarding program that you mentioned

00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,320
we're thinking about how to improve it

00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:59,599
but are there other

00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:02,000
way ways that all of us

00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:04,160
can help you know not just the micro

00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,280
communities but all of us can create a

00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:08,079
better environment for folks just

00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,079
joining mozilla

00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:18,240
don't be shy yeah i mean i think like

00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,960
you know the latin pride channel is

00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:22,320
really great

00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:24,240
um uh shout out to my manager liz hull

00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,359
who found it for me i know i did existed

00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,720
and i was just so happy

00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:28,640
to find it and kind of find this

00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:31,440
community um

00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:32,320
yeah i think honestly just like everyone

00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,839
getting to know

00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,359
people a little bit better and getting

00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:36,480
to know their background and kind of

00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:37,920
understand like oh like that's where

00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,960
you're coming from or

00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,480
i had no idea that that was a thing um

00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,560
i think the more we just all learn about

00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:46,320
each other i think would be

00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:48,240
you know that's that's the best way that

00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,960
we can allow other people to flourish

00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,200
because we're not

00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,880
kind of just like shooting down or i

00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,160
think i know something more than you do

00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,880
it's more like we're all learning

00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:58,880
together you know what i mean yeah one

00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:01,200
of the things that we used to do

00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:03,200
at one of my previous companies is you

00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:05,440
know we once or twice a year we would

00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:08,000
get all the ergs together

00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:09,599
um because even though it's great for us

00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,400
you know to have a group like latin

00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:12,160
pride

00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,920
you know obviously so much of the pain

00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,839
points that we experience are shared

00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:18,000
with other cultures too

00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:19,920
um and so getting together with those

00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,760
groups to see how we can work together

00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:23,920
how we can lift each other up

00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:26,400
how we can support each other during our

00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:28,079
months and kind of throughout the year

00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,440
was something that i thought you know

00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:31,359
worked really well and

00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:33,599
the company was really great about kind

00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:34,480
of creating that space for us to be able

00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:36,160
to do that

00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,320
you know and giving us a week you know

00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:40,160
once or twice a year to be able to

00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,680
you know put agendas together and put

00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:44,400
together plans and get to know each

00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,400
other and all that

00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:49,280
yeah i love that like this are great too

00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:51,599
just having the opportunity to talk

00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:53,440
about experiences on a personal and

00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:56,000
human level versus like

00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:57,760
the product and work level um you know i

00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,480
think even with the all hands they're

00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:01,119
great but

00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,680
you know that's it's so focused on work

00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:03,520
and

00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:05,920
you don't often get to learn about

00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:07,920
anybody's background or

00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,760
just more about who they are as a human

00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:11,280
i think that more opportunities like

00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,680
this are great to just

00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:15,280
bring that awareness and learn about

00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:17,280
everybody it doesn't have to be focused

00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,079
on people of color necessarily but just

00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:23,839
hearing from

00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:23,839
some people in the organization is great

00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,880
one other thing i'd throw in there um

00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,400
just as a call out

00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:34,800
uh because this is the first time that

00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:38,079
it's ever happened in my career

00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,480
is mitchell met with us about a month

00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:41,280
ago

00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:43,280
or so and that was the first time a ceo

00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,640
at an organization said i want to i want

00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:48,240
to meet with

00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:51,440
folks from this group and she listened

00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:53,200
and she was empathetic and she gave us

00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,760
her personal thoughts on a whole bunch

00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:57,040
of

00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:58,720
really um difficult topics and i just

00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:01,680
thought that was fantastic and and i

00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,680
want to celebrate that

00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:06,160
yeah that was a first experience for me

00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:07,599
as well and i've been in tech for like

00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:10,640
25 years so

00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:13,680
it was definitely um

00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:15,760
a great experience and and very valuable

00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:17,359
i think for us to have that opportunity

00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:20,400
to have that one-on-one chat

00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:22,320
with mitchell and and um for some of us

00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,280
we're continuing to meet regularly with

00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,119
leslie as well

00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,560
and i think that that that speaks

00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:29,920
volumes to

00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:32,079
the organization and what's there um

00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:34,000
but just like everyone else said i think

00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:34,480
most importantly is just the reminder

00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,200
that

00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:38,880
we need to be open to all ideas and all

00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:42,000
views on things because

00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:43,680
we we have uh

00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,359
our own perspective on things based on

00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:47,760
our experiences and

00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:49,520
it might even be biased by our current

00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:51,440
experience versus what

00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:53,440
where we were before so we really need

00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:55,760
to be considering

00:38:53,440 --> 00:39:01,839
a lot of different views on everything

00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:01,839
that we do

00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,920
we actually had a question come in in

00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:09,040
moko thank you moko

00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:12,320
thank you erica um and the question is

00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:14,640
is um on the role of language in spanish

00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:16,560
um how does spanish figure into your

00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:18,320
lives as adults and parents

00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:20,240
do you speak spanish at home is it a

00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:22,320
priority for you to have your kids learn

00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:26,240
it and read it

00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:28,480
and do you consume content in spanish

00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:29,520
i would say that when i'm mad spanish is

00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,680
my first go-to

00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:35,520
[Laughter]

00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:37,520
and i can attest to that too by the way

00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,560
um yeah i mean i mainly speak spanish

00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:41,680
with my parents

00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:43,680
um with my friends it's it's a lot of uh

00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,560
spanglish if you guys like on buzzfeed

00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:47,839
like better like

00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:50,160
is a thing um that we say a lot uh

00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:52,640
and i definitely consume uh content in

00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,640
spanish

00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:57,359
i i agree with astrid when i'm mad i

00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,560
seem to

00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:02,800
go to spanish um so i've got uh two

00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:04,400
teenagers now actually and

00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,079
my daughter went through spanish

00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,119
immersion programs for her whole

00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:09,040
elementary school

00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:11,920
so she's fluent in spanish and has seen

00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:14,240
the benefit my son

00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:15,680
is learning spanish so we do speak

00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:18,319
spanish at home

00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:20,079
not as much as we probably should but we

00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:22,880
continue to try to do that

00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:24,079
and it's it's very important i've seen a

00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:26,720
couple benefits one

00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:28,640
is i actually got a job once because i

00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:30,960
spoke spanish even though it wasn't

00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,760
um like the official version because i

00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,440
had just

00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,880
i'd never taken a spanish class it was

00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:38,240
just whatever i learned from

00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:39,599
from home but i was uh working on all of

00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:42,079
the america's region

00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:43,200
and the fact that i spoke spanish gave

00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:45,920
me that leg up

00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,880
as far as my my um interview and i was

00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:49,280
hired over

00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:51,040
my the other candidate just because of

00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,400
being able to speak in spanish to all

00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,599
the people that i interacted with in

00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:56,160
latin america and

00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:57,520
south america and my daughter saw the

00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,640
benefit and i think that's what's

00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:00,960
driving my son

00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:02,400
is we we spent a month in europe and

00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:05,440
because it's latin-based

00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:07,520
languages she was able to communicate

00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:09,520
very easily with everybody

00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:11,280
whereas he was always asking her to

00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,839
interpret things for him or read things

00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:16,160
for him

00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:18,400
so i think it plays a big role

00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:19,680
i didn't grow up speaking spanish i

00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,359
would beg my mom

00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,960
to teach me but i think she was

00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:26,079
traumatized in

00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:30,800
her experience with coming to the us

00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:32,480
and i she always emphasized to me that

00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:35,040
speaking english and speaking it

00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:36,800
perfectly and like really understanding

00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:38,560
the language and the nuance of it was

00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:40,880
incredibly important

00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:43,040
um to the to the point where she

00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:45,280
wouldn't teach me spanish like i took it

00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:47,200
in school for probably 10 years and i

00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:50,480
always got a's but

00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:50,800
it was on my own um and i i kind of like

00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,560
would

00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,240
come at her like later in time and be

00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:56,319
like why didn't you teach me like i

00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:59,119
don't know it anymore like i know like

00:41:56,319 --> 00:42:00,000
probably elementary like spanish at this

00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:02,240
point and

00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,079
i wish i like knew it fluently because i

00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,640
would love to speak it with my daughter

00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:06,640
and

00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:08,640
my husband's like super interested in

00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:11,040
spanish and speaks it more than i do

00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:13,920
and he's very white so that's

00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,920
embarrassing for me

00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,480
but yeah i'd love to do more um i'm

00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,880
hoping that when my daughter starts like

00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,200
really

00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:23,280
immersing in being immersed in it in

00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:24,880
school that we can work on it together

00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:26,480
and then i can refresh myself and start

00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:28,839
to speak it more fluently and maybe get

00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:30,800
like duolingo going or something like

00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:32,960
that

00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:34,160
language it's funny uh it's a source of

00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:37,119
tension in our house

00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:38,480
because um my family and where i'm from

00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:40,560
is from uruguay

00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,839
my family my wife's family is from

00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:44,880
mexico

00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:46,720
so the way that we kind of enunciate

00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:48,000
certain things the way we conjugate

00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:50,480
certain verbs

00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,000
you know is very different um and so

00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:54,079
when we're teaching our daughter

00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,240
like my my wife will say well that's

00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:58,800
polio for chicken and i'll say no

00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:00,240
it's bosho and then our daughter doesn't

00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:02,079
know which one to say

00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:03,359
and obviously i'm like no mine is

00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:05,440
correct um

00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:07,119
and so it always uh creates a pretty

00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,400
funny dynamic but

00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:10,400
it does speak to something that's

00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,000
interesting that i think we're going to

00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:14,280
see more and more of in

00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,839
in the next decade or so which is

00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:18,079
polyculturism

00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:19,040
um and that's the mixing of multiple

00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:21,040
cultures

00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:22,720
and you know not only within our own

00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:26,240
kind of latin cultures

00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:28,960
you know but um hispanic and black and

00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:29,680
black and asian and you know and how

00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:31,280
other

00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:33,280
communities and cultures are coming

00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:36,640
together and how that shapes

00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:38,640
younger generations um so you know i

00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:40,160
think the next decade

00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,839
is going to be really interesting in

00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:43,359
that sense because

00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:47,359
we're not going to be able to look at

00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:47,359
people as one homogeneous group anymore

00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:55,760
did everyone answer that wanted to

00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:59,119
answer that one

00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:00,880
okay oh tony oh yeah i think

00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:02,720
for me my first language is actually

00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,839
spanish and both my parents came from

00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:06,960
mexico

00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:10,079
my dad got here at around 88

00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:11,359
and the primary language in

00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:12,480
my home was spanish so i ended up

00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:13,359
learning english through watching

00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:15,200
cartoons and

00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:16,640
picking it up through culture so i think

00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,920
for me that's that's always been

00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:20,160
it's always been very important because

00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:21,599
my my dad understands spanish and speaks

00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:23,599
very well graduated from high school

00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:26,480
went on to college my mom does

00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:27,760
and did his grandparents so it's always

00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:30,400
been important to

00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:31,040
communicate to them and and their

00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,440
language and

00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:34,880
understand it and i mean it even plays a

00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:37,359
role into

00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:38,880
how i think about my kids i have three

00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:40,079
children and thinking about the names

00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,839
and how they pronounce

00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:43,440
their names right like i think coming

00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:45,839
from from

00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:47,280
i want i want i we chose names that they

00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:49,280
can actually

00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,640
pronunciate right so like my oldest

00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:52,160
son's name is jared but

00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,599
also in spanish you can say it is hared

00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,880
right so it's picking something that

00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:56,319
they can pronounce because then

00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:58,720
if they can't pronounce the name then

00:44:56,319 --> 00:45:00,319
it's a little bit of exclusion for them

00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:02,480
so that's it's uh it's always played an

00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:04,480
important role in role in thinking about

00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:06,319
you know language and also thinking

00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:08,480
about my kids and speaking to them and

00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:09,839
in spanish so they can you know they can

00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,400
understand people a little bit better

00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:11,680
and i think

00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,800
that's that's the more important part

00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:14,319
there is the understanding is

00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:17,040
communicating with people

00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:17,920
i think um as some of our group here was

00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,599
highlighting like

00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:21,440
the words mean like different things and

00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:23,200
i think when you understand it

00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:24,480
it paints like a more beautiful picture

00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:27,920
of of things and

00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:31,200
although like you know what is it a

00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:33,200
tostada for me means like fried tortilla

00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:34,880
in puerto rico it means like fried or it

00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:36,160
means toasted bread it's like to me it's

00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:37,599
like it's just this imagery of like

00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:39,599
beautiful words so

00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:43,280
it's definitely very important in my

00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:43,280
life and i know other people as well

00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:52,079
we got um another question in moco

00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:54,079
um and it's really a follow up um

00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:55,280
from what you were sharing liz around

00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:57,359
speaking spanish

00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:58,640
um and learning it and connecting to

00:45:57,359 --> 00:46:00,400
your culture and the question is

00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:02,400
do you have any recommendations on for

00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:05,040
those who have been disconnected from

00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,040
their heritage

00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:10,160
i don't feel disconnected from my

00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,800
heritage necessarily aside from the

00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:14,000
language

00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:15,760
i think my my family is

00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,520
as i think most latin families are like

00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:20,880
extremely extremely close

00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:23,760
um and we always uh

00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:24,560
celebrated like everything together um

00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:26,160
and i always

00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:28,960
was immersed in the language around me

00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:31,920
because they would speak spanish

00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:34,480
at any kind of family gathering so i

00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:36,079
feel really connected to my culture

00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:39,200
you know have been to puerto rico many

00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:39,200
times at this point

00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:44,400
i think the language is the missing key

00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:47,839
for me mostly because

00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:49,760
um it's difficult like i i want to speak

00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:51,359
the language i didn't necessarily want

00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:53,280
that when i was younger it was kind of

00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:54,960
like the petulant teenager of like no i

00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,440
don't want to speak spanish like you

00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:58,880
know

00:46:55,440 --> 00:47:01,280
um but now i kind of wish that i had

00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:02,160
um maybe force myself a little bit more

00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,839
and really

00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:05,440
tried to immerse myself in the language

00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:07,839
a bit more um

00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:08,880
i i can pick it up again like if i have

00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:11,119
a textbook i can

00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:12,640
get myself back into it um so that's

00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:14,000
kind of i'm waiting for my daughter to

00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:15,200
get back for school

00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,520
so i can start working on the

00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:19,040
conjugations again and then

00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:20,880
i mentioned duolingo i was like

00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:22,079
practicing with that as well

00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:24,000
it's just something you have to do every

00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:25,680
day in your home um and i think that

00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,319
that's been the barrier for me as well

00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:28,000
as like

00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:30,240
you know you have to make sure that like

00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:33,520
everybody is speaking the language

00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:33,520
to make sure that you don't lose it

00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:42,240
yeah okay um

00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:44,800
there was another question on um

00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:46,400
some uh someone in moco amy says i

00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:49,119
caught a mention of buzzfeed's

00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:50,800
pero like what other media brands do the

00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:52,720
panelists think cover or speak to the

00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:54,960
latinx experience

00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,960
well

00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:03,040
um i follow me too on

00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:06,319
social media so it's like it's a play on

00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:07,680
like me too but it's mitu um i think

00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:11,839
they do a pretty good job

00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:13,440
um yeah better like is great um

00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:15,599
i actually have had a kind of a hard

00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:17,119
time i i follow certain people on like

00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:18,839
social media but it's not really like a

00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:22,319
media company

00:48:18,839 --> 00:48:22,960
um i would say that otherwise you're

00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:26,000
kind of like

00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:28,880
stuck with univision and telemundo

00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,960
and that that's also just a very like

00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:34,079
there's talking to a very specific

00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:35,760
audience as well so i don't know anyone

00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:39,839
else

00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:40,880
yeah i was going to say um certainly a

00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:43,440
whole slew of people

00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:45,040
on social media that are kind of yeah

00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:46,240
you know this younger generation that's

00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:48,960
kind of playing

00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:49,680
um in and out of their their various

00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,760
cultures

00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:53,040
um i'm sure we can put together a list

00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:56,079
for those people

00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:58,079
um i surprisingly i think netflix is

00:48:56,079 --> 00:49:00,559
doing a better and better job here

00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:02,240
um i'm seeing more and more content um

00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:04,720
coming from other countries

00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:06,559
um i've been finding that if i watch

00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:08,480
like a film from argentina like

00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:10,000
a whole bunch more will pop up but

00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:12,319
they're very hard to find

00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,160
unless you know you're actually um

00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:16,960
watching those types of films

00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:18,079
um so that's that's uh kind of a big

00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:21,119
deal

00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:23,520
um and uh what was the other one that i

00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:25,760
was gonna say

00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:27,680
uh drawing a blank on it now but i did

00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:28,160
wanna touch on the on the previous

00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,920
question

00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:31,520
too in terms of like being able to

00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:33,119
reconnect to your roots

00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:35,920
one of the things that i found that was

00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:38,240
really helpful here in the us

00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:39,920
is that there are a lot of groups in the

00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:41,839
us like from

00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:43,119
certain countries that meet pretty

00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:45,119
regularly

00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:48,160
i was surprised when i first moved to

00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:50,640
california at like 17

00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:52,079
i happened to stumble upon like a group

00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:55,359
in a park

00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:57,520
and i saw a huge uruguayan flag so i

00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:58,800
walked over to them and introduced

00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:00,480
myself and

00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:02,640
it was a community that would get

00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:05,040
together like once a month from

00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:06,240
various expats that that came to live in

00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:08,079
the united states

00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:09,520
and the more i dug into it the more i

00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:12,720
found out there was like

00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:14,960
regional chapters local chapters um

00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:17,280
and all all types of countries would do

00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:17,760
it um early in my career we did a lot of

00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:20,400
work

00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:22,079
from various groups you know from

00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:23,920
different states of mexico

00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:25,680
and so even if you're from a specific

00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:27,440
state in mexico you can find a group

00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:30,400
that probably gets together

00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:31,440
pretty regularly in your hometown so i'd

00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:34,000
highly encourage

00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:34,559
you to look for those because they exist

00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,520
and

00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:37,520
they're very welcoming

00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:42,960
it's great anybody else have anything to

00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:45,520
add

00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:45,520
to that one

00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:51,280
just one more thing would say two like

00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:52,880
something that i've discovered like i

00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:56,000
recently moved to portland

00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:56,800
and um any time i see like a latin food

00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,720
vendor

00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:00,000
you know i just like want to talk to

00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:00,720
them want another story want to get

00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,640
together

00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:04,319
and they will hook you up with food

00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:05,760
really good food so i would say that's

00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:06,880
another way to just like get to know

00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:08,720
other cultures

00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:10,240
and you know get to explore like your

00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:11,680
own city and sometimes like you might

00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:13,440
not know what something is

00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:14,880
but even just like saying hello and just

00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:16,240
like being interested in the food like i

00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:20,000
found like that's such a great way to

00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:20,000
learn about another country's culture

00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:26,640
portland has that like one foods like uh

00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:27,760
pod for puerto rican food and i was out

00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:30,960
there and i was like

00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:31,760
what oh my gosh you have to send it to

00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:34,240
me

00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:34,240
oh my god

00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:39,040
i would say music's a pretty good source

00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:40,160
to find culture and kind of dig into the

00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:41,359
more of the roots a little bit so i

00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:42,800
think that

00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:43,839
wherever you find it whether it's

00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:45,440
through a record shop whether it's

00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:47,280
through a local show

00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:49,280
that's a good way to to get started on

00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:52,559
something right

00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:55,599
yeah just a plus one to that the um

00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:57,520
uh like dance studios are another great

00:51:55,599 --> 00:52:00,800
one that my wife and i have found

00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:01,599
um they'll be able to point you to

00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:03,599
people that

00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:05,280
you know will do salsa nights or tango

00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:07,920
nights or whatever

00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:09,839
and the the community finds themselves

00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:12,800
together at these types of events

00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:15,200
pretty often you know when we're not in

00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:15,200
coven

00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:20,160
okay we actually have to we're getting

00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:23,920
to

00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:26,319
time um so thank you for everybody's

00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:27,839
engagement and this is great um we have

00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:29,280
two questions that are related and

00:52:27,839 --> 00:52:31,599
i guess it's kind of a wrap question so

00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:33,760
i'm gonna put them together

00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:35,200
and um have you all take a stab and then

00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:38,480
uh take a turn at it

00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:40,960
and then we'll i think we'll wrap um but

00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:42,319
one is um for folks listening in that

00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:44,800
meet that aren't at mozilla

00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:45,680

you have for them

action item that we can do

00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:02,319
to we touched on it generally but if you

00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:03,839
could give people like one takeaway of

00:53:02,319 --> 00:53:04,160
something that we can all do to make

00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:07,280
this

00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:08,480
a better environment for folks um what

00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:10,800
would that be so

00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:11,920
to folks outside mozilla what advice

00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,680
would you give them coming in

00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:15,440
and then for us here what advice do you

00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:18,640
have for us here

00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:20,240
so okay eddie

00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:22,240
you look like you're gonna say something

00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:25,440
so

00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:28,160
no sure happy too um so

00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:30,559
you know for people curious about being

00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:32,880
in marketing or brand strategy

00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:34,640
um this is what i tell everybody

00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:36,880
curiosity

00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:38,000
be curious about everything ask a lot of

00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:40,000
questions

00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:42,240
research a lot meet with as many people

00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:45,040
as you can um

00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:46,400
the sign of a great marketer is is you

00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:48,559
know how much they

00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:49,520
um take in and how much they try to

00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:51,359
understand

00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:53,119
kind of the insights and motivations

00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:56,160
behind people um

00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:57,680
so that would be my advice for that in

00:53:56,160 --> 00:54:00,880
terms of what we could be

00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:02,319
doing here uh internally you know i was

00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:03,520
just talking to somebody about this the

00:54:02,319 --> 00:54:06,160
other day i think

00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:07,359
it's really important to really

00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:09,040
understand

00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:10,720
you know why somebody is the way that

00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:13,440
they are so for instance in

00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:15,359
in my case like i'm a pleaser if if i

00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:17,440
feel like i'm not pleasing you

00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:19,200
you know then i'm not doing my job and

00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:19,680
that so much of that stems from my life

00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,760
because i

00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:23,280
needed to please my parents and make

00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:25,040
sure that they were happy and

00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:26,319
you know making sure i was helping and

00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:29,119
pleasing my community

00:54:26,319 --> 00:54:30,640
um and doing right by people you know

00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:31,359
but that might be interpreted as

00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:33,280
weakness

00:54:31,359 --> 00:54:35,359
to other people right they might see

00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:37,200
that as me always just going with

00:54:35,359 --> 00:54:39,440
whatever is being asked of me

00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:40,559
um and and that's not the case it's just

00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:42,079
in my dna

00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:43,760
and i think the more that we try to

00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:46,160
understand that you know the better we

00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:46,160
all are

00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:51,040
i think i'll go with the understanding

00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:52,480
part there as well and go go backwards

00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:56,480
and i think

00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:59,119
similar with with my site it's it's uh

00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:00,640
and for me it's it's uh it's more about

00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:02,000
it's the understanding it's it's trying

00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:04,480
to trying to help others and

00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,440
and for me a lot of that comes with with

00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:07,440
listening and

00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:09,200
and being an observant but i think some

00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:11,760
of that might be

00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:13,119
i guess you know perceived as like quiet

00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:16,000
not assertive enough

00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:17,839
you know but for me it's my my way of

00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,640
being is listening is serving is making

00:55:17,839 --> 00:55:20,240
sure that

00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:22,000
i'm hearing what you're telling me and i

00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:23,920
think that that

00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,440
ties into both what you know we should

00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:26,640
be doing more of at mozilla is getting

00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:27,359
getting a chance to understand more

00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,880
people like

00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:30,400
have a conversation with people ask them

00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:31,520
what's below the surface what

00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,799
you know what is this what does this

00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:34,400
look like what does this sound like like

00:55:32,799 --> 00:55:36,480
what does this feel like you know

00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:37,599
get beneath the surface and i think

00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:40,319
going back to

00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:41,680
um for my role and giving advice to

00:55:40,319 --> 00:55:44,319
people outside

00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:45,920
my role is audio video collaborations

00:55:44,319 --> 00:55:49,040
and communication so it's

00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:49,839
it's for me it's being able to to

00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:51,760
understand

00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:53,280
people and what it is that that they

00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:55,200
need right like i

00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:57,280
i have the i have the technical skill

00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:58,960
sets to do

00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:00,400
my job but it's more of understanding

00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:02,400
the person and i think that's the part

00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:03,440
that's most important is understand

00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,640
listen

00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:06,480
you know listen to what people are

00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:07,680
telling you like try to understand

00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:09,680
what it is that they feel what it is

00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:17,839
that they see and then

00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:17,839
and then proceed with helping

00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:25,920
hi i think i i agree um

00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:27,119
with both eddie and tony on the kind of

00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:30,400
the listening and

00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:34,000
being curious and getting to know people

00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:37,920
on a human level um i think is

00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:39,680
just best practice in life i feel like

00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:42,000
um i think for people looking to get

00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:44,000
into so when i started out

00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,440
my career like social media didn't exist

00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:48,319
as like a thing

00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:49,200
um and i just kind of like fell into it

00:56:48,319 --> 00:56:50,799
um

00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:53,119
i think you know if you're just starting

00:56:50,799 --> 00:56:55,599
out in your career interning a lot

00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:56,559
um is really helpful i did a lot a lot

00:56:55,599 --> 00:56:58,960
of internship

00:56:56,559 --> 00:57:00,319
internships throughout my early kind of

00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:02,799
college years

00:57:00,319 --> 00:57:04,640
uh and then you know being curious to

00:57:02,799 --> 00:57:05,839
eddie's point of like asking questions

00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:07,520
when you're starting out

00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:09,599
even in an internship or in your first

00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:10,400
role learning about what other people

00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:11,760
are doing

00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:13,520
like you know taking people out to

00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:15,040
coffee just kind of getting to know more

00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:17,119
about like what they do

00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:18,160
on a day-to-day basis and who they are

00:57:17,119 --> 00:57:21,680
as a human i think

00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:24,160
um is paramount um i'm a big listener

00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:27,440
too like i'm always listening and

00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:29,119
i think that uh you know it's it

00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:30,799
it's really helped me kind of develop

00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:34,319
myself as a marketer as well

00:57:30,799 --> 00:57:37,040
um having a lot of empathy for

00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:41,280
everybody the human experience is really

00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:42,079
important too yeah big plus one to that

00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:43,599
about like

00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:45,119
we're all humans at the end of the day

00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:46,640
and i think um just thinking of like

00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:47,359
content creation and content marketing

00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:49,040
it's like

00:57:47,359 --> 00:57:50,799
what's the human story like what's the

00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:52,559
story and how are you providing value to

00:57:50,799 --> 00:57:54,480
your audience i would say it's like

00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:56,400
the biggest things that are top of mind

00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:58,160
for me and i i would say to someone else

00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:00,160
looking to get into this career

00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:01,599
um and i think just really understanding

00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:02,400
each other at a human level and doing

00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:04,000
your research and

00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:05,520
trying to understand that audience is

00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,359
really important so

00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:08,559
um yeah i would say that's just kind of

00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:10,000
best practice all around whether you

00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:10,960
want to understand more about a culture

00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,680
or you want to talk to

00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:15,040
a certain group um just all of us trying

00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:15,520
to get together and understanding each

00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:18,319
other

00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:18,319
is really important

00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:25,040
and i can't really add that much more to

00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:25,680
what everyone said because i think that

00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:27,440
uh

00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:28,799
being very open and understanding is

00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:30,880
critical um

00:58:28,799 --> 00:58:32,559
i guess what i say to everybody is just

00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:34,799
learn something every day

00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:37,520
because whatever you learn you're it's

00:58:34,799 --> 00:58:40,240
not a waste regardless of how you use it

00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:42,000
for uh program management one of the

00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:44,240
most critical skills i think is to

00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,680
your soft skills because you don't

00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:47,920
really manage people

00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:49,040
so you're really having to depend on

00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:50,000
building the rapport and the

00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:53,359
relationships

00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:55,839
and being able to get things done by

00:58:53,359 --> 00:58:57,599
working with individuals so whether

00:58:55,839 --> 00:58:59,280
you're inside the company or wanting to

00:58:57,599 --> 00:59:02,000
come in i think soft skills are

00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:04,000
critical for anything and if you're

00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:06,880
outside the other thing i would say

00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:08,799
is that you don't necessarily need to

00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:11,440
take off all the boxes on the job

00:59:08,799 --> 00:59:12,559
um job posting or the job rack that

00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:14,319
sometimes other

00:59:12,559 --> 00:59:15,760
experiences and skills that you have

00:59:14,319 --> 00:59:17,839
would meet that the

00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:19,280
intended knowledge or skills that you

00:59:17,839 --> 00:59:22,720
would bring so

00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:23,200
um be open and if you feel that that

00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:26,160
something

00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:27,920
is of interest then apply and you know

00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:33,839
worst case that can happen is that you

00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:33,839
say no so you have to learn to ask

00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:40,480
these are really great pieces of advice

00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:41,359
i sort of like to frame them so hooray

00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:43,119
for recording

00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:45,760
this will be on your mozilla if you want

00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:46,160
to share it out with anyone afterwards

00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:48,400
and

00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:50,240
um keep following mozilla careers on

00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:50,559
twitter we have some more stories coming

00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:53,359
up
