00:00:01,399 --> 00:00:09,210
my name is Selena Declan

00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:12,570
I am director of Firefox runtime I work

00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:15,809
for Mozilla and I manage a group of

00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:17,880
about 80 engineers who work on things

00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:21,050
that are back into the browser stuff

00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:24,570
like networking security JavaScript

00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:27,300
thing called the Dom four year ago you

00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:31,560
wouldn't recognize how the browser works

00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:33,630
today a year ago it was slow and what we

00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,790
call janky like you'd like load up a web

00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:39,660
page and have to wait for a while and

00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:41,399
now it's smooth and fast and a lot of

00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:45,420
the work to get there

00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:48,510
was driven by this piece I'm from

00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:52,770
Montana originally I kind of grew up out

00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:54,329
in the woods my first year in college I

00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:58,289
met someone who had a computer in the

00:00:54,329 --> 00:01:00,300
dorm and he showed me the web for the

00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:04,579
first time and it just totally blew my

00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:04,579
mind I never seen anything like it

00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:12,570
Mozilla is a really interesting

00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:14,580
wonderful strange place and the people

00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:16,590
that I work with they're amazing and

00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:19,740
smart and I learned so much from them

00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:22,290
every day looking forward into the

00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:23,040
future there's just there's so much to

00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:27,509
do right now

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:30,060
we're living in a time of kind of great

00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:33,509
uncertainty we're also living in a time

00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:36,540
of great consolidation of huge

00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:39,990
corporations that have interests that

00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:42,850
don't always align with users desire for

00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:46,570
security and privacy and freedom

00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:48,370
so I feel like Mozilla really has an

00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:51,750
important place in the world in being

00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:55,650
being that voice being that advocate and

00:01:51,750 --> 00:02:00,670
you know I'm just overjoyed honestly to

00:01:55,650 --> 00:02:02,820
be able to devote my work to supporting

00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:02,820
that mission

00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:05,170
