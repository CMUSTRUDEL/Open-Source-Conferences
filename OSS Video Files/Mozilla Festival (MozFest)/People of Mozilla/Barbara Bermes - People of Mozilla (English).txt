I'm definitely a nerd I love to play

00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:08,849
around with new technologies I also

00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:10,769
always want to get the latest devices

00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:13,410
and gadgets to play around with and

00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:15,389
obviously working for Mozilla and a tech

00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:16,920
company that's exactly but that's the

00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:23,519
heaven of a nerd I would say

00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:23,519
[Music]

00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:31,779
I'm Barbara Armas I'm the product

00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:35,050
manager for Firefox focus and originally

00:00:31,779 --> 00:00:38,260
I grew up in Germany for me it's so

00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:40,300
beneficial and so nice to kind of bring

00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:42,129
this into the company as well and say ya

00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:44,370
know I can understand how Germans feel

00:00:42,129 --> 00:00:48,749
because that's how I grew up as well

00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:48,749
[Music]

00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:59,250
but I really like about Mozilla is that

00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:01,950
we are the alternative player that we

00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:04,140
can do things differently and more

00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:05,760
creative than maybe other players in

00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,410
this industry and that's basically the

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,880
reason also why I'm here and nothing

00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:10,230
else

00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:12,840
to me working from Mozilla it's very

00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:15,390
special because there's always hope and

00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,670
positivity about our products and the

00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:19,860
things that we're doing

00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:22,680
why is Mozilla's mission so important

00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:25,110
well if it's not Mozilla who cares who

00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,970
does that so I want people to pick up

00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:28,560
the pride and say yeah I trust this I

00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:31,220
know it's from Mozilla so it's good I

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,220
