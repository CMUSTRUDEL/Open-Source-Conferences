00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:11,030
I'm Kathleen Vega I currently work with

00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:17,750
Mazon where I'm leading their engagement

00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:19,400
with the global Internet for us it means

00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:21,140
we you need to be present in the for our

00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:23,060
global agendas around tech policies are

00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:24,770
being shaped if we want to make sure

00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:27,010
that decision-makers worldwide adopt

00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:29,330
informed and sensible decisions and

00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:31,580
regulations that do not infringe on

00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:33,379
users rights then we need to engage in

00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:35,030
these discussions and we need to provide

00:00:33,379 --> 00:00:37,399
expertise and we need to be a strong

00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:39,140
user focused voice and in the current

00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:43,940
geopolitical climate you could say her

00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:46,190
place of reason Berlin is a very

00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:48,800
inspiring place and it has been an

00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:51,139
inspiration to me pretty much from as

00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,030
long as I can think and it remains an

00:00:51,139 --> 00:00:55,399
important source of motivation because

00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:57,199
when you grow up in a divided city where

00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:59,299
you may be in the same place and yet

00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,829
you're on different sites you don't

00:00:59,299 --> 00:01:02,870
actually have to look very far to be

00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:04,650
reminded that freedom and privacy cannot

00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:06,900
be taken for right

00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:08,490
but I love that Mozilla doesn't only

00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,260
raise these concerns it doesn't only

00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:12,060
voice the rights of users

00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,860
it also takes action and it puts these

00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,660
into practice and Firefox is just one

00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:17,670
example of that but there's so many more

00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:20,720
projects that we are working on to try

00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:20,720
