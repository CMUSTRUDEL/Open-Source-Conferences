Title: Flow Media: Real-Time Reporting, MozFest 2011
Publication date: 2011-11-06
Playlist: Mozilla Festival 2011
Description: 
	Alastair Dant from The Guardian discusses the output of the Real-Time Reporting session at MozFest 2011.

The Mozilla Festival is a yearly celebration that brings together hundreds of passionate people to explore the frontiers of the open web. We mash developers, designers, and big thinkers together to make things that can change the world.

This year's theme is Media, Freedom and the Web—how can the web can make us more creative, collaborative and connected in an age of broadcasters big and small?

From the revolutionary frontlines to amateur music videos, people around the world are using web media to express themselves and show the world as they see it. How can the open web make journalism, film-making, music, and games work better? What does a read-write media look like?

Join us for three days of passionate people using the web to bend, hack and reinvent all forms of media—and how we communicate with the world.

00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:17,310
people about our interactive technology

00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:19,439

00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,910
newsroom and also to run a design

00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,460
challenge which is kind of happening

00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:24,570
behind me right now we're a diverse and

00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,180
interesting array of people are

00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:30,300
basically looking at the problems that

00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:33,600
the media now faces surrounding the flow

00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:35,430
of events and real-time reporting of

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,410
those events so on one hand we've got

00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:39,719
live blogging and all the issues that go

00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:40,710

the other hand we've got the kind of

00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:43,980
stuff that I deal with Interactive's

00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:46,020
where we're trying increasingly to find

00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:50,100
ways of presenting the content of those

00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:51,539
live blogs so that people can make kind

00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,430
of a more immediate sense of the

00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:56,539
different strands of activity that are

00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:56,539
