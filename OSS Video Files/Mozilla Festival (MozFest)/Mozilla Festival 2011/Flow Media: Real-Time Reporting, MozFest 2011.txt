Description: 
	Alastair Dant from The Guardian discusses the output of the Real-Time Reporting session at MozFest 2011.

The Mozilla Festival is a yearly celebration that brings together hundreds of passionate people to explore the frontiers of the open web. We mash developers, designers, and big thinkers together to make things that can change the world.

This year's theme is Media, Freedom and the Web—how can the web can make us more creative, collaborative and connected in an age of broadcasters big and small?

From the revolutionary frontlines to amateur music videos, people around the world are using web media to express themselves and show the world as they see it. How can the open web make journalism, film-making, music, and games work better? What does a read-write media look like?

Join us for three days of passionate people using the web to bend, hack and reinvent all forms of media—and how we communicate with the world.
