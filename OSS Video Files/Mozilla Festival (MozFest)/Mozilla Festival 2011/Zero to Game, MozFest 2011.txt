Publication date: 2011-11-06
Playlist: Mozilla Festival 2011
Description: 
	Jono Xia from Mozilla discusses the output of Zero to Game session at MozFest 2011.

The Mozilla Festival is a yearly celebration that brings together hundreds of passionate people to explore the frontiers of the open web. We mash developers, designers, and big thinkers together to make things that can change the world.

This year's theme is Media, Freedom and the Web—how can the web can make us more creative, collaborative and connected in an age of broadcasters big and small?

From the revolutionary frontlines to amateur music videos, people around the world are using web media to express themselves and show the world as they see it. How can the open web make journalism, film-making, music, and games work better? What does a read-write media look like?

Join us for three days of passionate people using the web to bend, hack and reinvent all forms of media—and how we communicate with the world.

00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:16,780
the first time so I did a session this

00:00:14,499 --> 00:00:19,750
morning on teaching people to get from a

00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:21,250
blank file to a very simple kind of game

00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:23,230
engine where they can drive a character

00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:25,480
around the screen with the arrow keys to

00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:29,440
get people to feel for what developing

00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:31,600
games in html5 is like I'm really into

00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:33,339
html5 as a game technology because it

00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:35,589
means I don't have to worry about what

00:00:33,339 --> 00:00:37,120
operating system my players have or

00:00:35,589 --> 00:00:38,829
getting approval from anybody's App

00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,649
Store I just put the game on a URL and

00:00:38,829 --> 00:00:44,260
say go here play this which i think is

00:00:41,649 --> 00:00:47,530
really positive for the future of making

00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:49,449
games and then tomorrow i'm doing a more

00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:51,190
in-depth advanced teshon where i'm

00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:52,719
showing people a game engine that's like

00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:54,429
eighty percent complete and i'm going to

00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,050
ask them to hack new features into it

00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:58,679
and together we'll make something really

00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:58,679
