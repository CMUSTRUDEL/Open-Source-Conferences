Title: Mozilla Festival London 2011: Media, Freedom & the Web
Publication date: 2011-11-06
Playlist: Mozilla Festival 2011
Description: 
	The Mozilla Festival is a yearly celebration that brings together hundreds of passionate people to explore the frontiers of the open web. We mash developers, designers, and big thinkers together to make things that can change the world.

This year's theme was Media, Freedom and the Web—how can the web can make us more creative, collaborative and connected in an age of broadcasters big and small?

From the revolutionary frontlines to amateur music videos, people around the world are using web media to express themselves and show the world as they see it. How can the open web make journalism, film-making, music, and games work better? What does a read-write media look like?  Three days of passionate people using the web to bend, hack and reinvent all forms of media—and how we communicate with the world.

and the web

00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:57,270
too many times in this world we get told

00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:59,190
to look and not touch the web of 2011 is

00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:01,020
far too much that way and too many

00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:03,000
people see it as a read-only resource

00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,650
where they believe what they're told the

00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,600
Mozilla festival is a chance for people

00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:08,460
to learn how to make the web in the

00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,320
image of what they want it to be how to

00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,300
speak in their own voice not through the

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,800
channels that are handed to them and how

00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:15,360
in general to take control of their

00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:18,680
online destiny instead of having that

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,680
