Title: Open Badges, MozFest 2011
Publication date: 2011-11-06
Playlist: Mozilla Festival 2011
Description: 
	Carla Casilli from Mozilla discusses the output of the Open Badges session at MozFest 2011.

The Mozilla Festival is a yearly celebration that brings together hundreds of passionate people to explore the frontiers of the open web. We mash developers, designers, and big thinkers together to make things that can change the world.

This year's theme is Media, Freedom and the Web—how can the web can make us more creative, collaborative and connected in an age of broadcasters big and small?

From the revolutionary frontlines to amateur music videos, people around the world are using web media to express themselves and show the world as they see it. How can the open web make journalism, film-making, music, and games work better? What does a read-write media look like?

Join us for three days of passionate people using the web to bend, hack and reinvent all forms of media—and how we communicate with the world.

okay so this morning we had an open

00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:07,649
badges session and we had a pretty good

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,849
turnout I was actually very happy we had

00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:10,380
a number of people who were interested

00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:12,389
in finding out about open badges so a

00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:14,340
lot of people came and had no idea about

00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:16,800
that which so I explained to them that

00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:18,600
it was an outgrowth of the last Mozilla

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,420
festival in Barcelona and how we

00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,830
developed the idea of extending the open

00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,480
badge infrastructure and how that could

00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:27,060
play out into digital badges and I also

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,529
cover the DML competition which is a

00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,090
competition that we're hoping will see

00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:32,520
the ecosystem for the open badge

00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:35,870
infrastructure in conjunction with

00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,870
