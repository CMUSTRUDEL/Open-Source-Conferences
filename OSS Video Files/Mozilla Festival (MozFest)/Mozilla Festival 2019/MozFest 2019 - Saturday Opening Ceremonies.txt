y'all's time but we do want to start

00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:04,259
this day with a couple of quick words

00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:06,390
from several wonderful folks and invite

00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:08,640
them to share why they're here what they

00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:10,709
are thinking about during the Mozilla

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,720
festival and how they might invite you

00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:13,760
to think about what we are doing here

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,959
together

00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:19,939
and in this larger world I need folks to

00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:22,129
visualize making lots of loving noise

00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:24,409
multiple times this morning but can we

00:02:22,129 --> 00:02:26,720
practice that and start off by welcoming

00:02:24,409 --> 00:02:30,760
Angela the executive director of OSHA

it's amazing to be able to celebrate an

00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:46,760
amazing festival that's been working to

00:02:44,329 --> 00:02:49,310
create rather build a healthier internet

00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,510
for the past decade let's just give them

00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:57,079
loved ones for that to start with

00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:58,670
thank you now I know most of this

00:02:57,079 --> 00:03:00,950
particular more stress is special for

00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:03,319
all of us because it's a last moment

00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:06,590
we'll be here in London right but it's

00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:08,989
also pretty special for me because well

00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:12,709
first off I love giving cuddly hugs this

00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:14,959
is me in 2013 with foxy I've been to

00:03:12,709 --> 00:03:17,299
three most fests but this is a special

00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:20,209
and because it's my first one since I

00:03:17,299 --> 00:03:21,650
took on the executive director role and

00:03:20,209 --> 00:03:23,389
you know getting this opportunity to

00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:25,549
actually speak onstage and talk about

00:03:23,389 --> 00:03:27,739
you know the impact that Moses has had

00:03:25,549 --> 00:03:32,329
on us and you know where we're looking

00:03:27,739 --> 00:03:34,609
to go in the future who Shahid has been

00:03:32,329 --> 00:03:37,129
here for 11 years for those of you who

00:03:34,609 --> 00:03:39,590
don't know about us we are a technology

00:03:37,129 --> 00:03:41,150
company that was born out of the

00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:44,480
post-election violence that broke out in

00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:46,340
Kenya in 2008 it's a tool that was

00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,040
primarily created to help ordinary

00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:50,419
citizens share information around what

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,090
was happening in the ground then and

00:03:50,419 --> 00:03:54,769
just create a bottom-up approach to how

00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:56,690
information was getting shared so that

00:03:54,769 --> 00:03:59,900
people actually knew what was going on

00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:02,419
and in those 11 years we've seen the

00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:05,090
platform being used more than 180

00:04:02,419 --> 00:04:07,400
thousand times in more than 160

00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:09,169
countries a 2 that was born out of

00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,739
problems you always tend to associate

00:04:09,169 --> 00:04:14,540
with Africa low bandwidth bad governance

00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:16,699
that's ended up creating such massive

00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:18,739
impact in the world over the last 11

00:04:16,699 --> 00:04:20,810
years and that's something that couldn't

00:04:18,739 --> 00:04:23,870
have happened without it being open

00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:25,580
source because it helped people

00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:28,520
across the entire world just you know

00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:30,320
take it created or rather adapted to the

00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:33,889
own individual context and make it their

00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:36,979
own from you know humanitarian

00:04:33,889 --> 00:04:39,320
responders being able to connect with

00:04:36,979 --> 00:04:42,470
people in need and send over critical

00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:44,810
resources or helping ordinary citizens

00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:47,210
create or rather contribute to

00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:49,430
democratic outcomes in the elections you

00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:52,370
know helping them protect the votes in

00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:53,900
Kenya not once twice about five times

00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:55,880
between seventeen we had two elections

00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:59,150
but that's a story for another day

00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:01,520
in Zambia and Zimbabwe are also helping

00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:03,919
to create awareness around human rights

00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,660
violations tracking in cases of sexual

00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:08,030
harassment against women in Egypt or

00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:11,300
what's been happening in Syria over the

00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:13,750
last couple of years so in a nutshell

00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:15,889
the platform has been used to help

00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:17,870
marginalize people to raise their voices

00:05:15,889 --> 00:05:21,229
and we are committed to making sure that

00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:24,350
that keeps happening now every year

00:05:21,229 --> 00:05:26,180
we've been at mas fest we've had push a

00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:27,950
Headey representation in one shape or

00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:29,720
the other you know right now we have

00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:31,490
four other members of the team here

00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,990
who'll be running sessions on Sunday and

00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:37,669
it's something that we've always done

00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:41,090
year to year and it's been important to

00:05:37,669 --> 00:05:44,060
us because it's one of the places were

00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:47,120
able to converge once a year with people

00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:48,470
who are like-minded who are steered

00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,120
towards the same goal building a

00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:52,039
healthier internet and who are also

00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,830
aligned with the goals that we have as a

00:05:52,039 --> 00:05:56,270
company or as an organization trying to

00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:57,830
make sure that we are shifting how

00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:59,660
information is getting shared and

00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:02,990
allowing people to actually share their

00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:04,789
opinions I remember back in 2012 this

00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:08,330
was right before the Kenyan elections in

00:06:04,789 --> 00:06:10,340
2013 we held a small hackathon and we

00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:12,500
had one particular problem trying to

00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:14,389
figure out the way trying figure out how

00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:16,220
to engage with people with just feature

00:06:14,389 --> 00:06:18,200
phones and make sure that they're

00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:20,990
actually included in the conversation

00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:22,550
and from that one day of being able to

00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:24,470
sit together with people from across the

00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:26,630
entire world who are able to develop

00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:28,070
strategies that have informed us

00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:30,560
developing an election monitoring

00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:32,479
toolkit that we've used in 2017 in our

00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,450
own elections and that people are

00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,600
continuously coming back to to take and

00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:39,000
adapt into their own

00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:41,430
Vigil contacts right you know we've had

00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,440
staff members be a part of the open

00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:45,270
leaders program and begin to start

00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,880
thinking about how to also engage with

00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:49,590
designers in the open source space so

00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:51,480
that we are designing the right kind of

00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:53,580
tools or designing tools in the right

00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:56,790
way so that it's actually able to help

00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:58,860
people in in an appropriate manner right

00:06:56,790 --> 00:07:00,870
or being able to connect with fellows

00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:03,450
who then helped us look towards moving

00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:05,160
from collecting data converting that

00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:07,590
into information and then knowledge

00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:10,170
because it needs to go B go beyond just

00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:11,910
having the data somewhere but actually

00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:13,880
making sense out of it and then making

00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:16,290
use of it in a way that will then inform

00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:19,380
better decisions getting made

00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:21,150
right so mas Fest has been absolutely

00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:23,250
key in helping us create those

00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:25,530
connections and seeing that work then

00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:27,240
continue to go on over the rest you know

00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:28,410
over the rest of the year it says you

00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:32,160
know a really good way of being able to

00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:34,320
celebrate all of that now I've been on

00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:37,020
the show here for eight years I started

00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:39,540
off as a software developer back in 2011

00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:41,460
so I was part of the team those actually

00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:44,130
you know they're building the features

00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:46,350
fixing the bugs and all of that and then

00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:48,720
over the last five years I primarily

00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:51,240
moved on into bridging the gap between

00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,040
or other creating a connection between

00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,840
people who are building the software and

00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,820
the ones who are making use of it and

00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:59,010
contributing to it helping to build

00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:00,600
social movements around the tools that

00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:01,830
are getting used in all those different

00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:04,530
contexts whether it's humanitarian

00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:07,410
response or crisis mapping and things

00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:09,870
like that and the reason why I am now

00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:14,000
kicking over and you know working with a

00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:18,750
fantastic team that is majority female

00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:21,450
majority female to steer the ship

00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:23,790
towards a new direction but not

00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:26,040
necessary to new because a lot of people

00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:28,110
are timing this as us going back to our

00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:31,080
roots and the reason why that's the case

00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:33,500
is because we are now entirely focused

00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:36,419
on making our products fully open source

00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:38,280
over the last ten to eleven years we've

00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:40,050
you know we've gone through making the

00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,849
platform open source exploring different

00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:44,820
business models in the open source space

00:08:41,849 --> 00:08:47,190
but it's been tough right we've

00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:49,150
identified or rather they've been buyers

00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:50,830
people being able to make use of it

00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:53,290
and so I want to do slash and burn those

00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:54,670
barriers making sure that anyone across

00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:57,010
the entire world regardless of the

00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:59,440
financial ability is able to access a

00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:00,910
tool to raise their voices whether it's

00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,740
somebody who wants to create awareness

00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:04,810
about human rights violations in the

00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:06,520
country or somebody wanting to find a

00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:08,980
way of being engaged and making sure

00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:11,980
that they can make you know keep the

00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:14,440
electrons free and fair and and peaceful

00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:17,020
so making our to completely open source

00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:18,610
and also committing to engaging you know

00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:20,560
be more intentional and engaging with

00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:23,080
our community so that we're also looking

00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:25,450
towards helping them leverage the

00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:27,010
technology to be more impactful it goes

00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:28,570
beyond you just developing a tool and

00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:30,670
leaving it out there but are you

00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:32,320
actually understanding in what context

00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:34,450
are they making use of it how do they

00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,640
adapt it to their own individual context

00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:38,800
how do they then apply it as well to

00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:41,350
their own different strategies so that

00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:44,080
they're able to make you know better use

00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:46,660
of the tool so essentially it's just

00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,430
going back to being open source engaging

00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:50,650
more with our community and building the

00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:52,680
capacity to make use of our tools so

00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:55,570
that's what the future looks like to us

00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:58,029
as a parting shot I think it's just a

00:09:55,570 --> 00:10:00,910
call for everyone to you know celebrate

00:09:58,029 --> 00:10:03,700
that we're able to come together at Moss

00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:06,010
fest it's been ten years it's so amazing

00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:08,050
so make use of the next couple of days

00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:09,520
to continue to engage with each other

00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:11,709
and make sure that we're making a

00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:16,300
difference in the world and building a

00:10:11,709 --> 00:10:21,390
healthier internet thank you Thank You

00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:21,390
Angela thank you thank you thank you

00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:26,470
there are so many people to give credit

00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:28,089
to for Mozilla festival and so many

00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:29,680
movements and activities that connect to

00:10:28,089 --> 00:10:32,260
it but there's a single individual who

00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:34,360
indulged in a lot of conversations

00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:36,760
eleven years ago to get a sense of how

00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:39,010
Mozilla could have a role in open and

00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:40,839
healthy Internet and so I would really

00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:43,779
encourage everyone to give a very warm

00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:47,140
welcome to mark shermin executive

00:10:43,779 --> 00:10:50,940
director Mozilla Foundation Thank You

00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:50,940
Gunnar hello my fast

00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:59,160
and Thank You Angie I don't know where

00:10:56,670 --> 00:11:01,470
you went there Thank You Angie I you are

00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:05,610
such an example as so many other people

00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:07,650
are here of folks of organizations who

00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:10,650
have over the course of these 10 years

00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:12,960
whether you came ten years ago nine

00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:16,080
years ago five years ago last year just

00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:17,520
to the first time have made this a place

00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:19,830
that is useful for each other

00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:21,210
as we go through those evolutions in

00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:22,470
what we're doing through the year and so

00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:25,530
I really thank you for sharing that

00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:28,980
story and I'm excited for the next ten

00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:30,990
years of doing that so reflecting back

00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:34,020
on ten years ago where we kicked off the

00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:35,910
first mods fest in in Barcelona I really

00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:39,330
was and those of you who know me will

00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:41,670
find this surprising at a loss for words

00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:44,010
as to what to say as we kind of kicked

00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:46,380
off this 10th anniversary and somebody

00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:48,930
said I think I might have been Sarah but

00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:51,570
we have a whole book and so I thought

00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:54,050
you know why not just take a page from

00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:54,050
the book

00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:02,580
[Laughter]

00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:04,650
that's the purpose of the book is to

00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:07,320
have pages torn from it and put back in

00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:10,140
and as is the spirit of Maz fast and but

00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:12,570
I didn't kind of know how to frame this

00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:14,340
reflection on the 10 years and and then

00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:15,690
I came across a lot of stuff in there

00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:17,730
you should spend some time with that

00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:20,040
book and add to it but something that

00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:21,330
Michelle Thorne who was one of the other

00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,770
people who helped us get it off the

00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:25,260
ground 10 years ago and gunner and I

00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:27,810
wrote this summer and it started I think

00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:29,910
section two or something and it kind of

00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:31,920
goes like if you've been reading the

00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:33,600
news over the last few years you might

00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,460
have a feeling like oh

00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,710
the Internet's broken doesn't say

00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:41,220
and here they edited that out but that's

00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:42,660
good about being here and many people

00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:45,750
feel that and it's a kind of reasonable

00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:48,000
thing to feel but if you have been a Maz

00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:50,300
fast for any part of the last ten years

00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,040
you may have a slightly different

00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:57,600
feeling you might say hey the Internet

00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:59,790
is broken and attending and there's

00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,010
something we can do to fix it and let's

00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:03,720
just roll up our sleeves come on let's

00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:06,750
go let's go

00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:09,449
fix it and that is the spirit we have

00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:11,879
held for those 10 years roll up your

00:13:09,449 --> 00:13:15,300
sleeves come on let's go

00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:17,160
and I really hope that those of you who

00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:19,170
have helped keep that spirit alive

00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:21,660
continue to and those of you who are new

00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:24,990
pick that up and move it forward

00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:26,970
as we move into the next couple days

00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:29,040
you'll may notice that suddenly it's

00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:31,199
kind of woven into all these different

00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:33,120
things openness no diversity Digital

00:13:31,199 --> 00:13:35,339
Inclusion queer and decentralization all

00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:38,970
the things you see there is a kind of

00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:40,649
thread around trustworthy AI that kind

00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:43,139
of goes through all of it and it's it's

00:13:40,649 --> 00:13:45,029
an intentional piece partly because

00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:47,910
we're in a moment right now where that

00:13:45,029 --> 00:13:49,500
is the case with AI and data-driven

00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:51,629
decision making is woven through

00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:53,579
everything we do is woven into our

00:13:51,629 --> 00:13:55,889
cities and facial recognition and

00:13:53,579 --> 00:13:57,480
cameras it's woven into our homes and

00:13:55,889 --> 00:14:00,480
speakers that talk to us and listen to

00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:03,060
us it's woven into how we get to see or

00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:06,800
who decides what we get to see in terms

00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:09,300
of news and we're in a world where that

00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:12,180
pervasive data-driven surveillance

00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:14,370
economy is something that not just us

00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:17,910
but like more and more people don't

00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:20,160
trust or worried about and so this year

00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:21,809
with Mozilla and the festival we're

00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:25,290
really trying to dive into how do we

00:14:21,809 --> 00:14:28,110
have that come on let's go attitude to

00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:30,629
fixing that to not just stare with fear

00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:33,029
or powerless powerlessness at the big

00:14:30,629 --> 00:14:35,519
tech companies where our governments are

00:14:33,029 --> 00:14:37,860
taking technologies like AI but turn it

00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,569
around and make it more trustworthy

00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:42,809
instead of something that we don't trust

00:14:39,569 --> 00:14:45,689
and take control of it and what is

00:14:42,809 --> 00:14:48,029
exciting is over like last night at the

00:14:45,689 --> 00:14:50,189
science fair at the Moz fest house for

00:14:48,029 --> 00:14:52,410
those of you who were there I already

00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:54,930
felt a lot of that come on let's go

00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:56,040
spirit around this AI team people who

00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:58,050
are not only talking about let's

00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:01,259
regulate the tech platforms and how this

00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:03,779
works but fresh ideas like regulations

00:15:01,259 --> 00:15:06,000
it will actually take our data away from

00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:07,379
the platforms give it back to us it's

00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,410
much in the way that's a long distance

00:15:07,379 --> 00:15:12,959
and local were torn apart in the phone

00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:15,240
world in the 80s people are talking

00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:16,590
about in fact you can do this here you

00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:19,230
know not trusting Amazon

00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:20,220
build your Alexa or Google or Apple but

00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:23,130
building your own and there is a

00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:24,810
build-your-own Alexa session here and

00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:26,580
people talking about a different kind of

00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:28,740
engineer and different kinds of teams

00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:30,540
and more diverse teams building our

00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:32,250
technological world and there are a lot

00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:33,780
of people talking about that here and a

00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:36,210
lot of people who represent and live

00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:38,640
that everyday here bringing more ethical

00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:41,640
more human centric ideas to how we build

00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:43,530
these technologies so that come on let's

00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:46,050
go spirit really is the thing I'm most

00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:47,910
inspired by in Moz fast and I think it

00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:49,080
gives me hope I would say the last

00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:51,600
couple years have been a little bit more

00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:54,120
dour in terms of looking about how much

00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,980
is broken I'm excited to be with this

00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,990
community which is there to make it

00:15:55,980 --> 00:16:00,600
better and fix it so I look forward

00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:02,310
let's kick it the shins of the tech

00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,290
giants a little bit while we're here but

00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:13,230
let's also go and build something better

00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:16,140
come on let's go thank you mark I need

00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:19,200
to request a huge Mozilla festival

00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:21,360
welcome for a first time at Mozza fester

00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:31,470
alley you are a Mozilla Creative Media

00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:33,360
Awards recipient welcome hello everyone

00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:34,680
I think it's pretty cool that we just

00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,780
heard from people who've been a part of

00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:38,160
Moss fest for a full decade and then

00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:41,220
there's B was here for the first time

00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:43,170
but it's a good representation so a

00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:46,530
little bit about me first my name is

00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:48,090
alia I grew up in Cairo Egypt and I

00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:49,650
think my upbringing in Cairo vidiians

00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:51,960
said then we had deep care for social

00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:54,240
responsibility and social impact but

00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:56,070
also I was a preteen when the attempted

00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,300
Egyptian revolution happened which meant

00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:59,010
that I had a very young age I was

00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:00,480
thinking and worrying about justice and

00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:01,980
equity and accountability and all those

00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,350
concepts we care a lot about here at

00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:05,970
most fest I also study computer science

00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:08,220
at New York University in Abu Dhabi

00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:10,200
which means that I love technology and

00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:12,780
working with it and always have and I

00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:14,100
think for a lot of years I've been or

00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:16,260
for the past few years I've been trying

00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:17,760
to find the intersections where these

00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:20,010
seemingly the students were separate

00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,750
parts of my identity day so I would

00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:23,520
think about how to use technology for

00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:25,410
social impact and try to find spaces

00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,730
that were at the overlap but I always

00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:27,930
felt like it was sort of a bit of a

00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:30,420
contradiction

00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:33,420
and then in 2018 I took a class called

00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:35,250
politics of code with Pierre actually

00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:38,070
and in Craig's department so thank you

00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:39,660
both so the class is about the

00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:41,520
socio-political and economic

00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:44,340
implications of software and how it

00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,990
affects our society and these were three

00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:47,580
of my classmates a Gabor genuine and

00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:49,860
mija who ended up being my teammates

00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:51,780
later on but in class we spoke a lot

00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:53,280
about how there is often a gap between

00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,900
people building the technology that

00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,250
affects all of us and that members of

00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,990
the public who are affected by this

00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:59,520
technology but do not feel comfortable

00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:01,500
questioning it because they may not

00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,150
understand the technical language or are

00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:05,520
mystified by the technology and think

00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:06,780
computers are always accurate and that's

00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,430
a big problem because if you don't have

00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:10,110
an aware couple exact in question half

00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:11,750
tech is being built then you can't hold

00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:15,000
anyone accountable for what's happening

00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:17,280
so we saw later on in the year Mozilla

00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,480
creative media where it's called for

00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,700
projects that have to do with a i's

00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,990
impact on society at at this point we're

00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:24,060
definitely not part of the Mozilla

00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:26,580
community we've never been to most of us

00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:28,680
but this was sort of our entry point so

00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:30,720
we proposed a project called survival of

00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:33,390
the best-fit and it's online so you can

00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,530
check it out and give us feedback but

00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:36,660
survival of the best-fit is an

00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:39,330
interactive game or simulation that's

00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:40,920
intended for people who may not want to

00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:42,510
wake up at 9 a.m. to attend the opening

00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:45,240
circle almost first because they don't

00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:46,470
really care about internet hoes and

00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,910
maybe people who don't even know what an

00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:49,620
algorithm is romantic what machine

00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:51,090
learning is and the goal of the game was

00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:53,040
to teach them how or tell them how

00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:54,930
algorithms could be biased and how

00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:57,300
software does depend on the people

00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:59,070
building it so you go through the game

00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:00,930
as without giving you too many spoilers

00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:03,350
we go through that you go through the

00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:05,280
game as a CEO of a small start-up

00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:07,440
recruiting new people so you go through

00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,480
a manual recruitment process and then

00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,770
you're being told you're not fast enough

00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:13,890
you need to introduce an automated

00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:15,240
hiring process so you walk through like

00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:17,040
a high level process of now how that

00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,720
happens you're being told that your

00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:20,910
earlier decisions are gonna be used to

00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,320
make that algorithm and then as you walk

00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:23,880
through the game you see how the

00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,990
algorithm ends up being biased even

00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:27,840
though you might may not have intended

00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:29,220
for it to be so working on this game I

00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,660
think something that was super important

00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:32,580
for all of us was to make sure that the

00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:34,710
target audience is people who may not

00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:36,720
have any familiarity with a concept

00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:38,160
beforehand so we read user testing like

00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,140
sitting outside of a library bribing

00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,630
people with Palestinian effing

00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:43,890
skin-like do you understand and if you

00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:45,060
play it and you don't understand these

00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:47,160
let us know so that we can make sure

00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:48,600
it's more accessible to everyone but

00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:51,450
something that I reflected a lot about

00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,980
while after building this game was that

00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:54,600
I was talking to people and I was often

00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:56,460
asked the question did you have a

00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:58,080
personal experience in your life or did

00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:00,120
you have something that you've been

00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:02,400
through that made you very passionate

00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:04,620
about AI ethics or tech bias or

00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,060
algorithmic accountability and I was

00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:08,220
like no like I didn't grow up thinking

00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:09,570
about algorithmic bias like I don't know

00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:11,760
what that is

00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:13,890
but I did grow up thinking about bias

00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,870
about accountability about justice and I

00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:17,250
think looking at how that reflects in

00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:19,200
the technology we can seem is just a

00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:21,120
natural extension of caring about these

00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,950
topics in general and I think that's

00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,900
really important as we think of the 10th

00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:26,910
anniversary and the internet health

00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:28,860
movement or tech ethics or tech policy

00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:29,970
and to not think of this movement as

00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:32,400
something that's specific to the

00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:33,960
internet or to technology or all the

00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,850
themes that we discuss here but as a

00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:37,530
natural extension that an integral part

00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:39,300
of a broader movement to make sure that

00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:40,980
our society is both on the internet and

00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:43,050
off the internet represent all the

00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:46,500
spaces that we have here the centralized

00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:49,770
open inclusive and so on so I think

00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:52,470
we're at a great place right now it's a

00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:54,300
great stuff for us all to be here but I

00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:56,820
also think these conversations can't

00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:58,890
just stop here so I think if we all go

00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:00,300
to these sessions talk about and have

00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:02,130
these very important conversations and

00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:03,450
that's great but I think what we need

00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:05,700
actually need to do is make sure we take

00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:06,570
them forward and when I was told I have

00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:09,000
to speak at the 10th anniversary

00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:10,680
festival I was like yes this is gonna be

00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,870
about hope and I'm gonna talk about how

00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:16,380
excited I am for the future but I don't

00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:19,080
wanna die I'm like many 21 year olds I'm

00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:21,240
pretty scared I've seen my country and

00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:22,950
my region plagued with human rights

00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:24,360
violations and other things I'm not

00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:28,110
going to mention when there may be

00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:30,150
recordings I have seen like the threat

00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:32,010
of the climate crisis authoritarian

00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:33,390
regimes all over the world book stock

00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:34,260
companies having more and more power

00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:36,090
over their internets

00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:37,860
so I may be a little scared of the

00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:39,480
future but I think what I am excited

00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:41,250
about is what we can do together there

00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,720
are the possibilities that exists when

00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:44,670
we come to places like this and have

00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,840
conversations like this but also when we

00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:47,160
go outside of the buildings of

00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,020
Ravensbourne and make sure we have these

00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:50,880
conversations with people who may not be

00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:52,110
familiar with the conversations

00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,300
to make sure that we're not just

00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:56,550
building a future that's survival of the

00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:58,860
best foot and not survival of the

00:21:56,550 --> 00:22:01,020
farthest away from rising sea levels or

00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:02,300
survival of the wealthiest or survival

00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:04,800
of the most technically sophisticated

00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:12,030
but the survival and the happiness and

00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:15,350
opportunities for all of us thank you

00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:21,720
alia thank you so much thank you thank

00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:25,290
you thank you all for making those

00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:28,470
speakers so welcome we have some minor

00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:30,900
mundane critical things to go over there

00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:33,120
are as I point out every year two kinds

00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:35,490
of people in this room some of you know

00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:37,740
that by arriving for plenary and being

00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:39,600
in a chair you have opted into the

00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:42,330
world-famous Mozilla festival group

00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,440
photograph a couple of comments that

00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:45,570
there will soon be a very talented

00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:48,630
photographer directly above me risking

00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:50,550
his life to take that photograph I'm

00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:52,590
gonna be asking folks while I blather on

00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:54,510
for three or four minutes right now can

00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:56,070
we be filling the chairs that are not

00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:58,410
yet full and so if you're out on the

00:22:56,070 --> 00:23:01,020
edges please think about sliding down

00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:02,850
you can pass the unclaimed books down to

00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:04,470
the empty chairs at the end if you're

00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:06,180
out on the periphery and willing to be

00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:09,570
in the group photo please help us fill

00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:11,430
the chairs as a perfectionist an empty

00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:13,470
chair in the group photo is like a

00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:15,600
broken pixel on a laptop screen it

00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:18,270
annoys you every time you look at it so

00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:20,550
please help us fill these chairs and get

00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:21,990
ready for the big loving group photo and

00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:24,720
also we'll be bringing people down the

00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:27,810
aisle in about five or six minutes after

00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:29,940
we introduced the Wranglers there are

00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:31,710
people here that have yellow lanyards on

00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:33,420
if you don't want to be in the photo

00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:35,130
that's totally cool but we'll be

00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:37,500
inviting you in just a minute to share

00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:40,770
your chair with someone who is more jpg

00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:44,190
ready all right friends I want to go

00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:46,920
over how we asked you to participate at

00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:49,200
this event I will first start with ways

00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:51,480
we invite you to show up and then I will

00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:54,780
talk about ways we invite you to not

00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:57,300
show up at Mozilla festival things that

00:23:54,780 --> 00:24:00,300
we do that make this event specific and

00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:02,670
special and unique we ask everyone here

00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:03,370
to demonstrate respect for everyone else

00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:07,120
here

00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:09,430
in all ways at all times that's a big

00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:12,190
ask and we mean it and I'd like to be

00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:15,220
specific one of the best ways to show

00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:17,890
respect is to help us keep the day on

00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:20,020
schedule I can't overstate how many

00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:22,540
amazing facilitators and Wranglers have

00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:26,200
prepared compelling sessions and those

00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:28,330
people are sad when folks arrive at

00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:30,310
their session halfway through when folks

00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:31,180
drift in or interrupt so if you're going

00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:33,490
to a session

00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:35,770
I know those coffee queues are long I

00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:37,750
know that coffee is amazing can we get

00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:40,680
some big love for our coffee baristas

00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:47,290
thank you for filling us with caffeine

00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:49,990
we love you but we beg of you take the

00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:52,750
drip option and run if you are late to a

00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:55,270
session please arrive on time and please

00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:56,710
help sessions to wrap-up on time as we

00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:59,020
are in sessions and as we are in

00:24:56,710 --> 00:25:01,180
dialogue we ask you to focus on

00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:03,700
listening so many times it events like

00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:05,890
this people assume that other people

00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:08,530
have the same definitions for the words

00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:10,510
we're using in our dialogue ask any two

00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:12,520
people here what the word open means and

00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:14,980
it could turn into an outright argument

00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:17,020
ask any two people here about what is

00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:18,130
the right future for the internet and I

00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:20,350
don't think we have enough time to

00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:21,940
settle that debate let us listen and

00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:24,100
honor what other people mean by the

00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:26,470
words they use let us welcome a

00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:28,900
diversity of opinions and analyses and

00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:30,970
perspectives a corollary on being a good

00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:33,040
listener have you ever suffered in the

00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:34,480
company of an interrupter someone who

00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,920
thought they were smarter and what they

00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,750
had to say was more important any

00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:40,360
survivors of interrupter situations

00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:42,160
thank you solidarity solidarity

00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:44,800
let us not interrupt if you want to

00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:46,690
speak in a session signal be polite come

00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:50,350
in like you're part of a synchronized

00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:52,330
dance crew not a mosh pit at a punk show

00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:55,840
though there's nothing wrong with that

00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:57,760
for all parties opting in finally the

00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:59,890
third guideline of respect and I joke

00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,570
about licenses and open versus free has

00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:03,490
anyone here ever survived an open

00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:06,280
licensing debate any survivors out there

00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:07,960
with me yeah I feel your pain and so let

00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:10,200
us agree to disagree in moments where we

00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:12,910
are in fact not on exactly the same page

00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:14,980
have you ever been three guidelines on

00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:16,990
inclusion have you ever been in a place

00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:19,170
where people used

00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:22,179
language as a passive-aggressive weapon

00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:25,120
jargon acronyms oh yeah another survivor

00:26:22,179 --> 00:26:27,220
over here I am with you please let us

00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:29,950
commit to using the simplest most

00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:32,440
inclusive language I self-identify as

00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:33,010
ugly American that means I talked too

00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,929
fast

00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:38,230
and I use words that are only understood

00:26:34,929 --> 00:26:40,990
in the state of California USA let us

00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:42,790
use simple inclusive language when we

00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:46,150
speak and I'm talking to my monologue

00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:48,040
errs out there make one point and let

00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:51,100
others talk in a group of in

00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:54,460
participants focus on speaking one end

00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:57,370
of the time so everyone's voice can be

00:26:54,460 --> 00:27:00,460
heard friends in an event like this it's

00:26:57,370 --> 00:27:02,920
not about fetishizing expertise it is

00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:06,309
about honoring learning and questions

00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:08,980
are always acts of leadership feel safe

00:27:06,309 --> 00:27:11,050
feel free feel empowered to ask your

00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:13,179
questions if it's in your head I

00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:17,320
guarantee you that you are not alone

00:27:13,179 --> 00:27:18,970
almost done with the asks but people go

00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:21,370
to big events like this it's

00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:23,410
intimidating oh my goodness all these

00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:25,660
humans what's the deal and what do

00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:29,110
people tend to do they get with people

00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:32,470
they know and they talk about stuff like

00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:34,210
the coffee and the setup and oh my god

00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:38,020
was the tube as hard for you as it was

00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:40,540
for me we beg we demand we implore all

00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:43,330
of you to talk to the friends and allies

00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:45,820
you have not yet met I really encourage

00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:47,559
you to feel safe introduce yourself in

00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:49,030
the coffee line sit at lunch with

00:27:47,559 --> 00:27:51,400
someone you have not ever talked to you

00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:54,460
before Mozilla Festival is a movement

00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:56,530
building event I ask all of you to see

00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:59,110
yourselves in some form of a community

00:27:56,530 --> 00:28:01,690
organizing ethos where you should be

00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:03,309
building power laterally with friends

00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:05,920
and allies that you have not yet

00:28:03,309 --> 00:28:08,290
connected with those are the ways in

00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:11,290
which we invite you to show up at this

00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:13,360
event help us get what you came for by

00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:17,530
helping everyone else get what they came

00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:19,720
for to Mozilla festival in addition on

00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:21,580
the back of a lanyard is a list of

00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:26,050
things that we aggressively frown upon

00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:27,880
and ask you not to do and so I will not

00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:30,280
try to awkwardly read my whole lanyard

00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:31,130
but in all seriousness please avoid

00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,750
anything that

00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:34,910
be interpreted as violence or threats of

00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:37,400
violence personal attacks derogatory

00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:40,090
language unwelcome sexual attention or

00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:42,740
physical contact disruptive behavior or

00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:45,080
influencing unacceptable behavior

00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:46,340
overall this event is special because

00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:49,070
everyone takes a collective

00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:52,040
responsibility to create a safe

00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:54,020
environment if you see anything that

00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:56,540
looks like someone is feeling unsafe or

00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:58,400
unwell you don't need to solve it but

00:28:56,540 --> 00:29:00,230
there's contact information on the back

00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:02,720
of the lanyard to reach those of us on

00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:04,670
the organizing safety team we want to

00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:06,830
help you help this event stay as

00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:08,300
inclusive and safe as possible and we

00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:10,940
thank you for letting us know if there's

00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:15,290
anything we can do to improve in that

00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:17,120
regard again I mentioned it earlier some

00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:19,580
people here are well wearing yellow

00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:21,740
lanyards your my up did you decide to

00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:24,230
take that out for the group photo all

00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:26,300
right I love you man all right but who's

00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:28,010
got a yellow lanyard on anyone up taking

00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:30,530
that off - I love it there's an opt-in

00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:32,300
hey you're cool cuz you picked yellow

00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:36,020
you're my privacy guy can I call you

00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:39,080
that yeah so if you see people in yellow

00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:39,770
lanyards show extreme documentation

00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:42,140
restraint

00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:43,880
please don't photograph folks who have

00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:45,470
asked not to be photographed and that's

00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:48,050
especially true of the people that like

00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:50,900
to get that panoramic 360 degree thing

00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:53,420
that phones now let you do and so in all

00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:54,830
seriousness honor the yellow and just

00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:56,600
overall I will say it again

00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:59,240
let us set a collective tone of goodness

00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:01,610
as has been pointed out this is not the

00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:03,710
best era ever in the world but we can

00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:06,020
make this an incredibly special and

00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:09,590
transformative space if we do take care

00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:11,900
of and respect one another speaking of

00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:14,720
taking care and respecting one another

00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:16,940
this event lives and dies based on the

00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:19,760
leadership of a group of people we call

00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:21,530
our space Wranglers they have made yet

00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:23,840
another sacrifice by being willing to

00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:26,300
sit in the front row while I talk on and

00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:28,670
on letting these large placards lean

00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:31,610
against their knees what we want to do

00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:34,970
now is invite the Wranglers to stand on

00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:36,710
up to turn your placards around so that

00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:38,810
the audience can be greeted with a

00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:41,789
rainbow of space goodness

00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:51,780

organized by spaces these are some of

00:30:58,530 --> 00:31:03,390
the people that have helped to wrangle

00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:06,630
those spaces I see other beautiful

00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:08,309

00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:10,799

and I'm gonna start down at this end

00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:17,100

so here's what we're gonna do again

00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:55,870
there's two there's two types of people

00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:59,080

00:36:55,870 --> 00:37:01,600
you don't but help us make the best

00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:03,610
possible group photo we do this in three

00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,049
rounds as my camera my camera's ready

00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:07,349

00:37:04,049 --> 00:37:09,869
up there love you man alright we are

00:37:07,349 --> 00:37:14,579
gonna take the photograph in three

00:37:09,869 --> 00:37:17,009
phases and I need everybody to be all in

00:37:14,579 --> 00:37:18,349
on all three phases the first phase we

00:37:17,009 --> 00:37:21,630
call this the nineteenth-century

00:37:18,349 --> 00:37:23,640
photograph it's everyone totally serious

00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:26,400
because we're serious about internet

00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:28,890
health we're serious about ethical AI it

00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:31,880
was illegal to smile and photographs in

00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:35,160
the 19th century we need to channel that

00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:37,799
1859 energy to show how serious we are

00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:39,630
about Internet health and ethical AI and

00:37:37,799 --> 00:37:41,400
I see a gap at the back and I get a

00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:43,049
couple more people filling in come on in

00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,609
I know I love you come on in the a

00:37:43,049 --> 00:37:46,799
little further come on Nietzsche

00:37:44,609 --> 00:37:49,890
all right once we've done that then

00:37:46,799 --> 00:37:51,749
we're gonna do what jaded people like me

00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:55,410
called the typical group photograph

00:37:51,749 --> 00:37:56,969
we're gonna smile and as we smile we're

00:37:55,410 --> 00:38:00,989
gonna do a little thing that explodes

00:37:56,969 --> 00:38:03,479
into joy I'm gonna count 30 20 10 and

00:38:00,989 --> 00:38:06,660
pardon anyone who hates sports analogies

00:38:03,479 --> 00:38:09,749
I'll scream goal but the idea is it

00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:12,269
makes an amazing animated gif and so can

00:38:09,749 --> 00:38:14,819
everybody practice with me at 30 your

00:38:12,269 --> 00:38:17,299
hands on your hips at 20 they're at your

00:38:14,819 --> 00:38:17,299
shoulder

00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:22,920
and the annoying part is I'm gonna keep

00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:25,109
saying goal and you have to hold it up

00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:26,640
there until the photographer tells us

00:38:25,109 --> 00:38:30,090
that he's got enough shots that one of

00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:31,830
them is in focus and then and I need

00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:34,500
everybody on this one this last one oh

00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:36,599
do I need you people the last one it's

00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:39,780

00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:42,390
our scariest craziest face in the name

00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:45,750
of a healthy internet with ethical AI

00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:48,510
and what goes wrong in this third one is

00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:52,650
that occasionally someone here does the

00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:55,020
