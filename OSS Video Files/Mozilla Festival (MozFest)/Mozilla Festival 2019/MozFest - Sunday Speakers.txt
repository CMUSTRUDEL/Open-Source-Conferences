00:53:01,510 --> 00:53:07,780
good great so yeah we're here to talk

00:53:04,810 --> 00:53:09,430
today about the toll of content

00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:12,490
moderation so I just kind of wanna start

00:53:09,430 --> 00:53:13,690
off with some background you know for

00:53:12,490 --> 00:53:16,630
anyone who wants to answer you know what

00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:23,140
is content moderation what qualifies as

00:53:16,630 --> 00:53:26,940
a Content moderator online I mean one of

00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:29,200
the corporate Facebook's mottos was

00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:31,840
giving everyone the power to share

00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:34,960
anything with anyone and the question is

00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:36,790
is anything true and the answer is no

00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:39,400
because all of these social media

00:53:36,790 --> 00:53:41,200
platforms have some specific guidelines

00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:43,780
some community standards what is allowed

00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:46,240
to post on Facebook or Google or YouTube

00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:49,240
or Twitter and what is not and the ones

00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:52,270
deciding about what to post and what not

00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:54,970
these people are called content

00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:56,440
moderators and most of them don't get

00:53:54,970 --> 00:53:57,670
their paychecks from Facebook Google

00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:59,770
Twitter themselves they get their

00:53:57,670 --> 00:54:01,510
pictures by outsourcing companies and

00:53:59,770 --> 00:54:04,120
what they do they are sitting in front

00:54:01,510 --> 00:54:07,170
of his desk 8 to 10 hours every day and

00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:12,130
they review all of the content which is

00:54:07,170 --> 00:54:14,130
suspicious flagged by an algorithm or by

00:54:12,130 --> 00:54:17,020
users and they have to decide if these

00:54:14,130 --> 00:54:20,140
posts are supposed to be online or not

00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:22,270
so this is what we researched about and

00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:24,220
the guys are called content moderators

00:54:22,270 --> 00:54:26,560
and I and I did want to give a little

00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:28,720
bit of history to help set the context

00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:31,090
of what was just said historically

00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:32,680
content moderation actually came from

00:54:31,090 --> 00:54:34,270
all of you guys here at the audience if

00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:36,370
you remember the early days of AOL chat

00:54:34,270 --> 00:54:38,380
rooms there were people that were

00:54:36,370 --> 00:54:38,920
volunteers that would go and help

00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:40,810
companies

00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:43,690
determine what is acceptable and what's

00:54:40,810 --> 00:54:47,050
not and really but the definition I have

00:54:43,690 --> 00:54:49,000
is individuals that help develop and

00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:51,130
enforce policies that deem what is

00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:53,320
acceptable content and what is not and

00:54:51,130 --> 00:54:55,090
there is actually a grading of different

00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:57,220
professionals that work in this field so

00:54:55,090 --> 00:54:59,740
what I just described historically has

00:54:57,220 --> 00:55:01,300
been content moderation as a volunteer

00:54:59,740 --> 00:55:03,550
industry in the early days of the

00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:07,360
internet where this professional field

00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:10,080
did not even exist and overtime company

00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:13,980
started hire individuals that came from

00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:15,900
rules from IP IP lawyers that were used

00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:17,990
to weighing content on the gray to set

00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:21,720
content policies all the way to

00:55:17,990 --> 00:55:24,360
individuals got started to do spam and

00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:27,180
deal with bullying online in customer

00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:30,120
support roles that move their way up to

00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:31,800
the top rungs of certain companies but

00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:33,900
user-generated content has been

00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:35,760
increasing you know every single year

00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:38,430
with more and more individuals online

00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:39,870
and so a lot of major companies they

00:55:38,430 --> 00:55:42,420
started to develop what's known today as

00:55:39,870 --> 00:55:44,940
trust and safety teams and a lot of this

00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:46,920
work cannot be done by individuals and

00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:49,170
companies alone and so a lot of

00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:51,210
companies what they've done recently is

00:55:49,170 --> 00:55:54,150
they've started to outsource this work

00:55:51,210 --> 00:55:57,080
to vendors from cognizance to Accenture

00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:59,960
and the number of third parties that

00:55:57,080 --> 00:56:01,830
estimates say they're around 100,000

00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:04,580
professionals that work in this field

00:56:01,830 --> 00:56:07,500
alone some in the US and some in

00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:09,180
emerging markets in which they really

00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:11,040
deal with the worst of the worst of the

00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:13,320
Internet's trash that comes from the

00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:16,110
Western world and so that's been a lot

00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:18,030
of discussion and framing of what is

00:56:16,110 --> 00:56:20,220
that professional ladder that people go

00:56:18,030 --> 00:56:22,200
through in this field how do we ensure

00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:24,840
that people in this field are respected

00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:27,600
and one of the discussions that Xavier

00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:31,110
and I had earlier is around a platform

00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:32,640
called Fleur Chan on 4chan people who do

00:56:31,110 --> 00:56:34,500
this rule of moderation and they're all

00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:37,650
volunteers they're literally called

00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:39,300
janitors they determine what's accepted

00:56:37,650 --> 00:56:41,520
on a floor Chanin it's all volunteer

00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:43,350
base but you know how can we actually

00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:45,930
uplift and ensure that there are fair

00:56:43,350 --> 00:56:47,940
working conditions in this community if

00:56:45,930 --> 00:56:49,710
that is the term that we're calling them

00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:51,870
right that's that's really good insight

00:56:49,710 --> 00:56:53,280
I definitely get Chris's opinion in here

00:56:51,870 --> 00:56:54,810
because you know could you tell us like

00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:59,550
what the day to day is like for a

00:56:54,810 --> 00:57:03,330
Content moderator for a censor yeah yeah

00:56:59,550 --> 00:57:05,820
I mean criticism of Facebook is

00:57:03,330 --> 00:57:07,560
permitted on the platform so and then

00:57:05,820 --> 00:57:09,960
people complain about the criticism and

00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:13,710
I will see messages telling me that I'm

00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:15,570
a Nazi or you know the killing I'm

00:57:13,710 --> 00:57:18,830
killing free speech I'm censoring people

00:57:15,570 --> 00:57:20,940
so we're quite happy about that because

00:57:18,830 --> 00:57:22,710
fine you know you can say what you like

00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:23,460
my job is actually to allow you to say

00:57:22,710 --> 00:57:26,010
that and I can say

00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:27,840
get back and say no not violating and

00:57:26,010 --> 00:57:30,120
then I click the button and I get

00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:33,320
another one and it's just to be honest

00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:35,520
most of the work is tedious it's just

00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:37,110
people reporting each other because

00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:39,450
they're having an argument and they want

00:57:37,110 --> 00:57:42,240
to use some process to get back at the

00:57:39,450 --> 00:57:45,150
other person it's people taking umbrage

00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:46,590
about small things or complaining about

00:57:45,150 --> 00:57:49,470
things that don't fit with their own

00:57:46,590 --> 00:57:51,180
personal morality and a lot of the time

00:57:49,470 --> 00:57:54,930
you're just sitting there saying oh for

00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:55,560
God's sake get a life this is fine not a

00:57:54,930 --> 00:57:57,570
problem

00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:59,340
you've seen in the news right you've

00:57:57,570 --> 00:58:01,770
seen all this oh it's all terrible

00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:04,230
content and it's eight hours a day of

00:58:01,770 --> 00:58:07,260
people butchering each other it's not it

00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:09,180
most of it is just Jesus what's wrong

00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:11,160
with these people and then and then you

00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:12,900
get something horrifying and and then

00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:17,120
you carry on and then you get something

00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:20,160
funny and it's the job is not as bad as

00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:22,470
they make it seem I think the worst part

00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:24,630
is being audited

00:58:22,470 --> 00:58:26,700
there's people checking to see if you've

00:58:24,630 --> 00:58:27,990
done your job properly they're reviewing

00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:31,860
the same tickets and making their own

00:58:27,990 --> 00:58:34,830
decisions applying the same rules twenty

00:58:31,860 --> 00:58:36,630
odd thousand words of instructions that

00:58:34,830 --> 00:58:39,180
I have to keep in my head all the time

00:58:36,630 --> 00:58:40,830
when I'm looking at this content and if

00:58:39,180 --> 00:58:42,840
their decision is very slightly

00:58:40,830 --> 00:58:45,240
different from mine there's about a

00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:47,130
hundred options to choose from then I've

00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:49,530
made a mistake and I'm facing getting

00:58:47,130 --> 00:58:51,030
fired if I get too many mistakes so I

00:58:49,530 --> 00:58:56,940
think Gaby wanted to talk a little bit

00:58:51,030 --> 00:58:58,050
about that right yeah yes I think

00:58:56,940 --> 00:59:00,480
earlier we talked about content

00:58:58,050 --> 00:59:02,250
moderators deciding what content stays

00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:03,840
on and actually they're not deciding

00:59:02,250 --> 00:59:06,330
they're just implementing a policy

00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:09,210
that's been decided for them and trying

00:59:06,330 --> 00:59:10,800
to make those decisions about which

00:59:09,210 --> 00:59:13,650
content should say online is very

00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:15,180
stressful especially if you have a very

00:59:13,650 --> 00:59:18,540
high accuracy rate that you're having to

00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:20,790
reach so I think the reason I'm on this

00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:22,830
panel is because the cookbook actually

00:59:20,790 --> 00:59:26,010
was a hobby because most of the time I

00:59:22,830 --> 00:59:28,050
spend on viewing graphic content for

00:59:26,010 --> 00:59:29,970
human rights violations so I spent a lot

00:59:28,050 --> 00:59:31,290
of my time looking at graphic videos and

00:59:29,970 --> 00:59:32,940
images

00:59:31,290 --> 00:59:35,220
and because of that I started to

00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:37,200
research vicarious trauma the idea of

00:59:35,220 --> 00:59:39,090
trauma through seeing something that's

00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:41,400
traumatic so not experiencing yourself

00:59:39,090 --> 00:59:43,859
but experiencing it through someone

00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:46,859
else's trauma and I started to interview

00:59:43,859 --> 00:59:48,570
people who were also viewing graphic

00:59:46,859 --> 00:59:49,980
content as part of their work so people

00:59:48,570 --> 00:59:53,250
working in Child Exploitation

00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:55,410
lawyers journalists and of course

00:59:53,250 --> 00:59:56,730
content moderators and I started to see

00:59:55,410 --> 01:00:00,210
what are the strategies what are the

00:59:56,730 --> 01:00:01,740
best practices and none of the

01:00:00,210 --> 01:00:04,440
strategies that I identified through

01:00:01,740 --> 01:00:06,840
talking to 60 people seem to work for

01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:09,420
content moderators they're the industry

01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:11,130
of commercial content moderators in my

01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:13,560
opinion none of them will work and one

01:00:11,130 --> 01:00:15,990
of the aspects of this is around feeling

01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:19,380
like you have no control so you have

01:00:15,990 --> 01:00:20,580
these policies you have these decisions

01:00:19,380 --> 01:00:21,960
that you're having to do and sometimes

01:00:20,580 --> 01:00:24,390
you won't be out you won't agree with

01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:25,800
them so you might be keeping something

01:00:24,390 --> 01:00:26,910
online that you actually don't agree

01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:29,460
there it should stay there but the

01:00:26,910 --> 01:00:30,630
policies say it should remain and all

01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:32,850
your taking something down that you

01:00:30,630 --> 01:00:35,369
think should stay up so this level of

01:00:32,850 --> 01:00:37,050
lack of control it's actually very

01:00:35,369 --> 01:00:39,390
harmful to you in the job that you're

01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:41,030
doing and other other professionals

01:00:39,390 --> 01:00:43,200
don't have this same the same issue

01:00:41,030 --> 01:00:45,359
you're implementing other people's

01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:47,580
standards there was a campaign a few

01:00:45,359 --> 01:00:48,780
years ago called free the nipple did

01:00:47,580 --> 01:00:50,869
anybody remember that one

01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:53,930
yeah hands up who doesn't like nipples

01:00:50,869 --> 01:00:56,250
you know but you have to take them down

01:00:53,930 --> 01:00:58,140
every time and then and then people

01:00:56,250 --> 01:01:00,180
start protesting and I'm in the middle

01:00:58,140 --> 01:01:03,960
say oh I just have to follow the policy

01:01:00,180 --> 01:01:06,330
I'm sorry one of my trainers did say to

01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:10,109
me one day we're not actually here to

01:01:06,330 --> 01:01:12,030
take things down we are here to look at

01:01:10,109 --> 01:01:13,920
something objectively and see if we can

01:01:12,030 --> 01:01:16,650
leave it up we're not actually here to

01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:19,290
clean up we're here to just keep things

01:01:16,650 --> 01:01:22,410
moving along and and give people the

01:01:19,290 --> 01:01:24,270
maximum freedom but at the same time we

01:01:22,410 --> 01:01:27,750
do have to implement these standards and

01:01:24,270 --> 01:01:29,640
yeah do what you're told and anything

01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:31,230
one really interesting question that you

01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:33,420
just brought up is what is acceptable

01:01:31,230 --> 01:01:36,000
content online and how does that

01:01:33,420 --> 01:01:38,310
actually bridge into cultural context is

01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:40,380
Right what is considered acceptable for

01:01:38,310 --> 01:01:42,480
nipples in the Middle East might be very

01:01:40,380 --> 01:01:44,010
different from what it is in France or

01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:44,530
in certain parts of the Western world

01:01:44,010 --> 01:01:46,330
and

01:01:44,530 --> 01:01:48,520
that is something that is really

01:01:46,330 --> 01:01:50,830
difficult in this job is determining

01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:53,560
with local context what is considered

01:01:50,830 --> 01:01:55,630
acceptable and the question of how

01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:57,820
companies shirts at these policies and

01:01:55,630 --> 01:01:59,770
who writes these policies to make sure

01:01:57,820 --> 01:02:01,330
that it is actually representative what

01:01:59,770 --> 01:02:05,260
we deemed to be socially acceptable

01:02:01,330 --> 01:02:08,770
online and if I may just add that from

01:02:05,260 --> 01:02:11,910
our experience there actually two main

01:02:08,770 --> 01:02:16,030
challenges I would sum up one is the

01:02:11,910 --> 01:02:18,610
psychological one and I totally got from

01:02:16,030 --> 01:02:21,250
your explanation that you not have to

01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:23,050
scream horrible content for eight hours

01:02:21,250 --> 01:02:26,620
a day but we know a lot of people who

01:02:23,050 --> 01:02:28,500
did and we cover them in our film and

01:02:26,620 --> 01:02:32,560
they are mainly in the Philippines and

01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:34,930
what they had to screen is I don't want

01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:38,080
to explain what but it was just so

01:02:34,930 --> 01:02:41,290
traumatizing to a lot of them that it

01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:44,680
would almost seem cynical for me to let

01:02:41,290 --> 01:02:49,420
it stand here as a as a claim that this

01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:52,660
job is not psychologically horrifying it

01:02:49,420 --> 01:02:55,480
is no it is and you know I say that 90%

01:02:52,660 --> 01:02:59,500
of what you see is benign or boring but

01:02:55,480 --> 01:03:02,590
that 10% I was working typically 600

01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:06,820
tickets a day so I imagined 10% of that

01:03:02,590 --> 01:03:07,960
is you know 60 really awful yeah so yeah

01:03:06,820 --> 01:03:09,160
why don't you talk more about that

01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:10,870
because you said you know you told me

01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:12,790
you know backstage that 90% of this

01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:14,710
stuff is not that graphic but then

01:03:12,790 --> 01:03:16,840
there's 10% that is I think there's a

01:03:14,710 --> 01:03:18,100
there's generally like a cachet or maybe

01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:19,600
there used to be when it comes to like I

01:03:18,100 --> 01:03:21,040
work at Facebook like you know

01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:23,200
six-figure salary living in Silicon

01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:25,030
Valley but you know this is not that it

01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:28,350
seems like could you talk about that

01:03:25,030 --> 01:03:30,820
duality of you know why don't they pay

01:03:28,350 --> 01:03:31,750
content moderators like the same way

01:03:30,820 --> 01:03:34,890
like why don't think at the same

01:03:31,750 --> 01:03:39,130
benefits 12 euros and 98 cents per hour

01:03:34,890 --> 01:03:41,110
yeah fantastic yeah and you and I pay

01:03:39,130 --> 01:03:41,859
taxes on that yeah I'm doublin rent and

01:03:41,110 --> 01:03:44,510
yeah

01:03:41,859 --> 01:03:46,010
between one and three dollars at this at

01:03:44,510 --> 01:03:49,369
the time we researched in the

01:03:46,010 --> 01:03:53,080
Philippines for an hour Wow

01:03:49,369 --> 01:03:56,470
and that was also the reason why we

01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:59,000
focused on these people there because

01:03:56,470 --> 01:04:01,790
actually for them it's even harder a lot

01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:05,359
of times to get the lobby or to at least

01:04:01,790 --> 01:04:09,530
get their thoughts on this work being

01:04:05,359 --> 01:04:12,710
heard and in our film we we cover people

01:04:09,530 --> 01:04:14,510
who just have to stay in the job because

01:04:12,710 --> 01:04:18,140
they were the breadwinners for their

01:04:14,510 --> 01:04:21,320
families sometimes six seven people and

01:04:18,140 --> 01:04:23,540
their lives they financed and they

01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:27,109
didn't get any psychological support I

01:04:23,540 --> 01:04:29,150
mean there was a psychologists come in

01:04:27,109 --> 01:04:31,010
every three months and then the whole

01:04:29,150 --> 01:04:33,590
staff was gathered in a room like here

01:04:31,010 --> 01:04:36,349
now and then the psychologist asked them

01:04:33,590 --> 01:04:40,040
how do you guys feel and they were like

01:04:36,349 --> 01:04:41,540
now I should I should share my my my

01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:45,740
thoughts on the job I should share my

01:04:41,540 --> 01:04:46,910
recycled finger-painting and yoga every

01:04:45,740 --> 01:04:49,010
couple of weeks I would get an email

01:04:46,910 --> 01:04:52,040
saying hey guys finger painting tonight

01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:55,280
come along great wellness team thank you

01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:59,030
guys nice I mean it's highly cynical the

01:04:55,280 --> 01:05:01,609
whole thing and so and a lot of people

01:04:59,030 --> 01:05:03,080
just stay in the job for let's say 3-4

01:05:01,609 --> 01:05:04,970
months and then they have to leave

01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:07,220
because otherwise they they just can't

01:05:04,970 --> 01:05:09,710
cope anymore with the psychological

01:05:07,220 --> 01:05:11,480
damage they are suffering from and then

01:05:09,710 --> 01:05:13,220
they they are just left alone

01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:15,170
there aren't any psychologists like

01:05:13,220 --> 01:05:16,940
following up with them they're just left

01:05:15,170 --> 01:05:20,930
alone and you never know when the trauma

01:05:16,940 --> 01:05:23,720
will will join you and like yeah it took

01:05:20,930 --> 01:05:24,920
me a year before I realized that this

01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:27,589
job knocked me on my ass

01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:30,589
it really did get the better of me and a

01:05:27,589 --> 01:05:32,869
year later I'm phoning my health

01:05:30,589 --> 01:05:35,150
insurance company to say hey you know

01:05:32,869 --> 01:05:36,890
I've discovered I have this problem and

01:05:35,150 --> 01:05:38,510
they said well your cover was canceled

01:05:36,890 --> 01:05:41,359
today you left and it doesn't cover

01:05:38,510 --> 01:05:43,369
mental health issues anyway and I have a

01:05:41,359 --> 01:05:45,920
friend who is paying for counseling and

01:05:43,369 --> 01:05:48,740
medication out of her savings she's not

01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:51,710
working she can't go back to work at

01:05:48,740 --> 01:05:53,850
this time and nobody cares we're

01:05:51,710 --> 01:05:58,020
disposable we are

01:05:53,850 --> 01:05:59,640
back to your question I think that what

01:05:58,020 --> 01:06:02,940
Clara was saying about how this thing is

01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:05,520
just kind of grown out of organically

01:06:02,940 --> 01:06:07,800
this situation has evolved without any

01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:11,700
clear top-level design in the early days

01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:14,610
and certainly in Ireland the people that

01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:16,830
were tasked with helping you change your

01:06:14,610 --> 01:06:18,870
password or you've locked yourself out

01:06:16,830 --> 01:06:21,500
and they need to verify your ID they

01:06:18,870 --> 01:06:23,790
were one day asked to deal with spam

01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:25,950
which is pretty clear is spam just

01:06:23,790 --> 01:06:27,330
deleted and then there was something

01:06:25,950 --> 01:06:29,220
else that's a problem and whenever

01:06:27,330 --> 01:06:31,920
something happens there's a whole new

01:06:29,220 --> 01:06:33,690
set of rules that Facebook creates to

01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:37,080
say well you can't do this on Facebook

01:06:33,690 --> 01:06:40,470
either anymore and now it's this massive

01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:43,650
massive set of documentation that you

01:06:40,470 --> 01:06:46,770
have to master to a 98% level of

01:06:43,650 --> 01:06:49,020
accuracy but you're still treated like a

01:06:46,770 --> 01:06:51,060
guy whose job is to say yeah this

01:06:49,020 --> 01:06:53,790
passport matches this profile picture

01:06:51,060 --> 01:06:56,130
and you're expected to reach the same

01:06:53,790 --> 01:06:58,290
level of accuracy all the time and you

01:06:56,130 --> 01:07:02,010
can't because there you will never make

01:06:58,290 --> 01:07:04,410
enough detailed rules to cover every

01:07:02,010 --> 01:07:05,700
eventuality and expect somebody to hold

01:07:04,410 --> 01:07:07,800
them in their head hmm

01:07:05,700 --> 01:07:09,660
and that is the problem about the the

01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:12,810
media that the debate we have in the

01:07:09,660 --> 01:07:14,750
media a lot of times about the problems

01:07:12,810 --> 01:07:16,770
of content moderation and whenever

01:07:14,750 --> 01:07:18,540
Facebook YouTube Twitter they're

01:07:16,770 --> 01:07:20,670
confronted with critique it's it's

01:07:18,540 --> 01:07:22,350
always about their policymaking and I

01:07:20,670 --> 01:07:25,440
guess that's mainly wrong and we should

01:07:22,350 --> 01:07:28,530
mainly focus on how it's executed and I

01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:30,510
guess already the word executing these

01:07:28,530 --> 01:07:33,120
rules is wrong because in a lot of cases

01:07:30,510 --> 01:07:36,450
you really freely have to interpret them

01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:38,370
you have to take decisions based on

01:07:36,450 --> 01:07:41,010
these guidelines but you you have to

01:07:38,370 --> 01:07:44,780
take them and it still you you have to

01:07:41,010 --> 01:07:47,310
receive what is in the image is this

01:07:44,780 --> 01:07:49,380
like promoting violence or is this

01:07:47,310 --> 01:07:53,310
documenting violence is this a

01:07:49,380 --> 01:07:55,920
caricature is this like covered by the

01:07:53,310 --> 01:07:59,130
First Amendment this kind of things or

01:07:55,920 --> 01:08:03,090
is this already out of the out of the

01:07:59,130 --> 01:08:05,940
borders like of free speech and this has

01:08:03,090 --> 01:08:06,940
to be done in such a speed that as you

01:08:05,940 --> 01:08:09,609
say it

01:08:06,940 --> 01:08:13,000
it's the mistakes which which are made

01:08:09,609 --> 01:08:15,339
are systemically made that it's not a

01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:17,290
question of how the guidelines are

01:08:15,339 --> 01:08:19,779
designed but a question of how much time

01:08:17,290 --> 01:08:23,230
is given and in the end how much support

01:08:19,779 --> 01:08:24,759
how much money how much resources are

01:08:23,230 --> 01:08:27,580
given to these people and they get a

01:08:24,759 --> 01:08:30,609
three to six day training in our case in

01:08:27,580 --> 01:08:33,130
the Philippines like they get they got a

01:08:30,609 --> 01:08:37,750
crash course on identifying Nazi symbols

01:08:33,130 --> 01:08:40,779
like on a on a one two day training base

01:08:37,750 --> 01:08:43,029
like they were told okay be be careful

01:08:40,779 --> 01:08:45,430
with ovens be careful with rats these

01:08:43,029 --> 01:08:48,989
might be anti-semitic but they didn't

01:08:45,430 --> 01:08:54,219
have any clue about the context of the

01:08:48,989 --> 01:08:57,660
the hate speech of neo-nazis in East

01:08:54,219 --> 01:09:01,989
Germany so um there are a lot of so many

01:08:57,660 --> 01:09:04,270
implications which are just made for so

01:09:01,989 --> 01:09:06,339
much made for money for profit reasons

01:09:04,270 --> 01:09:08,319
so we really need to question this we

01:09:06,339 --> 01:09:11,020
need need to question if it's a good

01:09:08,319 --> 01:09:13,739
idea to give our digital public to a

01:09:11,020 --> 01:09:17,319
private company or let's say three

01:09:13,739 --> 01:09:19,569
private companies deciding about free

01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:22,750
speech in the online world that is not

01:09:19,569 --> 01:09:23,949
the way it should be handled yeah I want

01:09:22,750 --> 01:09:25,390
to talk I want to actually pass the ball

01:09:23,949 --> 01:09:27,940
to Gabby for a little bit cuz we were

01:09:25,390 --> 01:09:29,440
talking a little bit about you know not

01:09:27,940 --> 01:09:31,960
just Facebook with a lot of big tech

01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:33,130
companies nowadays they for a while they

01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:34,540
would frame themselves as kind of like

01:09:33,130 --> 01:09:36,279
you know saving the world like you know

01:09:34,540 --> 01:09:38,770
we're doing this because we're doing for

01:09:36,279 --> 01:09:40,690
the better of humanity but everything

01:09:38,770 --> 01:09:42,130
you hear about constant moderation feels

01:09:40,690 --> 01:09:43,870
so opposite of that I was hoping you

01:09:42,130 --> 01:09:46,330
could talk about that duality a little

01:09:43,870 --> 01:09:49,029
bit yeah so and a lot of these companies

01:09:46,330 --> 01:09:49,600
they're marketing to get new and I don't

01:09:49,029 --> 01:09:51,250
know how it is

01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:52,509
because I just look to live in Germany

01:09:51,250 --> 01:09:55,060
and there's a thousand content

01:09:52,509 --> 01:09:56,680
moderators in Berlin so I just looked at

01:09:55,060 --> 01:10:01,300
mainly at Europe in the way that their

01:09:56,680 --> 01:10:03,699
marketing here they use superheroes as

01:10:01,300 --> 01:10:05,590
costumes that can be a superhero

01:10:03,699 --> 01:10:08,350
clean up the internet have a healthier

01:10:05,590 --> 01:10:10,300
internet one advert in Germany for a

01:10:08,350 --> 01:10:13,030
German content moderator ask questions

01:10:10,300 --> 01:10:14,410
like do you love social media and want

01:10:13,030 --> 01:10:17,080
to be up-to-date with what's happening

01:10:14,410 --> 01:10:19,010
in the world and if you know about what

01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:21,140
actually the job entails

01:10:19,010 --> 01:10:23,180
it doesn't include becoming a social

01:10:21,140 --> 01:10:24,890
media guru so I think that their

01:10:23,180 --> 01:10:25,700
positioning and then people apply and

01:10:24,890 --> 01:10:28,430
they think that they're getting these

01:10:25,700 --> 01:10:31,880
jobs and the actual reality is

01:10:28,430 --> 01:10:33,470
horrendous and that disconnect with what

01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:35,330
you think you're doing and actually

01:10:33,470 --> 01:10:38,420
keeping content online that you don't

01:10:35,330 --> 01:10:41,510
think should be online is extremely

01:10:38,420 --> 01:10:44,390
damaging even before you think about

01:10:41,510 --> 01:10:46,310
what people are seeing and for the work

01:10:44,390 --> 01:10:49,150
that I'm doing with human rights

01:10:46,310 --> 01:10:53,210
investigators the kind of six buckets of

01:10:49,150 --> 01:10:55,520
strategies that the most useful is to be

01:10:53,210 --> 01:10:57,500
able to control and know why you're

01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:59,750
doing what you're doing to be able to be

01:10:57,500 --> 01:11:01,730
selective to be able to identify what

01:10:59,750 --> 01:11:03,290
your triggers are to control your

01:11:01,730 --> 01:11:05,989
physical environment that you're viewing

01:11:03,290 --> 01:11:08,450
the content in to talk to other people

01:11:05,989 --> 01:11:09,950
like have peer-to-peer support and then

01:11:08,450 --> 01:11:12,050
be able to tell your managers that

01:11:09,950 --> 01:11:14,360
you're struggling all of those six

01:11:12,050 --> 01:11:17,480
things I just said that are the most

01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:18,890
helpful things are completely like the

01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:20,720
opposite of what you can do in these

01:11:18,890 --> 01:11:21,800
companies you can't tell anyone you're

01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:24,650
struggling because you're on a short

01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:25,970
term contract you can't be selective you

01:11:24,650 --> 01:11:28,310
cannot have any control over your

01:11:25,970 --> 01:11:29,870
environment so they go against it it

01:11:28,310 --> 01:11:32,900
means the system needs a complete

01:11:29,870 --> 01:11:34,820
overhaul and and I did want to add you

01:11:32,900 --> 01:11:37,070
know one of the reasons why this came

01:11:34,820 --> 01:11:39,290
about is most companies they don't

01:11:37,070 --> 01:11:41,780
really deal with the problem of terrible

01:11:39,290 --> 01:11:44,090
things happening on their platform until

01:11:41,780 --> 01:11:46,520
it's a crisis management situation where

01:11:44,090 --> 01:11:49,040
they're suddenly having to scurry find

01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:51,260
contractors at scale to suddenly deal

01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:53,239
with all the PR backlash that they are

01:11:51,260 --> 01:11:55,550
getting and that's a huge struggle not

01:11:53,239 --> 01:11:57,080
just for contractors that work for

01:11:55,550 --> 01:11:59,150
companies but also for employees that

01:11:57,080 --> 01:12:01,520
have been at companies for 10 15 years

01:11:59,150 --> 01:12:03,440
now that set the original content

01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:05,600
moderation policies they are dealing

01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:07,580
with the bureaucracy of fighting for the

01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:10,220
rights of users and some of the hardest

01:12:07,580 --> 01:12:12,050
things that they see day to day setting

01:12:10,220 --> 01:12:14,930
the right policies and pushing against

01:12:12,050 --> 01:12:17,300
the ROI of the business pushing against

01:12:14,930 --> 01:12:20,120
advertising policy teams who are looking

01:12:17,300 --> 01:12:22,280
to help the company make money and there

01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:24,590
are a lot of professionals today that

01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:26,920
work not only from the bottom of the

01:12:24,590 --> 01:12:29,750
ladder all the way up if you look at

01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:30,890
2016 there's a woman that I have talked

01:12:29,750 --> 01:12:32,960
to that

01:12:30,890 --> 01:12:35,420
currently heads up content policy at a

01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:37,250
major platform and she has been through

01:12:35,420 --> 01:12:39,860
the rungs of this professional ladder

01:12:37,250 --> 01:12:41,390
from the ground up but she struggles you

01:12:39,860 --> 01:12:43,580
know day to day and her job pushing

01:12:41,390 --> 01:12:45,560
against the PR team to be able to put

01:12:43,580 --> 01:12:48,530
out the right voice to be able to ensure

01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:49,880
that things that she sees online like

01:12:48,530 --> 01:12:52,370
the anti-vaccine

01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:54,890
can have policies at that platform that

01:12:52,370 --> 01:12:56,870
can be enforced against and that's the

01:12:54,890 --> 01:12:59,090
other side of the spectrum is we needed

01:12:56,870 --> 01:13:00,980
to stop having platforms deal with bad

01:12:59,090 --> 01:13:02,720
issues online in a crisis management

01:13:00,980 --> 01:13:04,790
mode and really think about the

01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:06,860
thoughtful practices on how you build a

01:13:04,790 --> 01:13:08,990
team right this is a new professional

01:13:06,860 --> 01:13:10,430
sector that has evolved come about in

01:13:08,990 --> 01:13:13,550
which you have as sophisticated

01:13:10,430 --> 01:13:15,470
processes as diplomats online in the

01:13:13,550 --> 01:13:18,290
offline world making policies that

01:13:15,470 --> 01:13:21,530
impact society I mean we saw back in

01:13:18,290 --> 01:13:24,050
2013 2014 what happened in Myanmar where

01:13:21,530 --> 01:13:27,260
companies go to new countries they're

01:13:24,050 --> 01:13:29,270
trying to expand into a market and do

01:13:27,260 --> 01:13:31,370
nothing in terms of moderation there and

01:13:29,270 --> 01:13:33,530
a lot of the offline violence and whole

01:13:31,370 --> 01:13:35,870
ethnic genocide that took place years

01:13:33,530 --> 01:13:37,550
later because there was no thoughtful

01:13:35,870 --> 01:13:39,350
planning in the types of

01:13:37,550 --> 01:13:41,240
professionalization and professionals

01:13:39,350 --> 01:13:43,340
that are needed on the ground to support

01:13:41,240 --> 01:13:45,710
how content is spread and could be

01:13:43,340 --> 01:13:47,450
maliciously spread there and this whole

01:13:45,710 --> 01:13:49,490
entire professional sector needs to be

01:13:47,450 --> 01:13:51,140
uplifted it needs to be recognized they

01:13:49,490 --> 01:13:53,060
should not be considered contractors

01:13:51,140 --> 01:13:56,480
they should not be considered janitors

01:13:53,060 --> 01:13:59,630
there are I think my my sense when when

01:13:56,480 --> 01:14:02,840
I was there was that there was no vision

01:13:59,630 --> 01:14:04,340
at the top it was all just there was you

01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:06,920
know some guy wants this and somebody

01:14:04,340 --> 01:14:09,280
else want that and at the bottom there's

01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:12,290
this set of rules for me but there's no

01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:13,730
leadership and I started asking the

01:14:12,290 --> 01:14:15,890
question so what is the business case

01:14:13,730 --> 01:14:17,960
for monta content moderation

01:14:15,890 --> 01:14:19,670
you know if I'm the boss of Facebook I

01:14:17,960 --> 01:14:21,860
have a legal obligation to make money

01:14:19,670 --> 01:14:25,040
for my shareholders how do how does

01:14:21,860 --> 01:14:26,840
content moderation support that goal and

01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:28,970
I've never heard any conversation around

01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:31,400
it there obviously there must have been

01:14:28,970 --> 01:14:34,160
a study you know do people spend more

01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:36,560
time online if we reduce and make it

01:14:34,160 --> 01:14:38,420
nice a kind of place or do they do they

01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:39,890
like it if it's nasty you know what what

01:14:38,420 --> 01:14:42,260
is good for the business they never talk

01:14:39,890 --> 01:14:44,599
about it so I assume that all this

01:14:42,260 --> 01:14:47,059
content moderation effort is because

01:14:44,599 --> 01:14:48,199
they have to they're reluctant to do it

01:14:47,059 --> 01:14:52,219
they're doing it at arm's length

01:14:48,199 --> 01:14:56,139
grudgingly because of the PR and the the

01:14:52,219 --> 01:14:58,909
legislative pressure threats of awful

01:14:56,139 --> 01:15:00,590
regulation not because it's front and

01:14:58,909 --> 01:15:03,349
center to the business so it's always

01:15:00,590 --> 01:15:06,079
going to be the lowest possible budget

01:15:03,349 --> 01:15:07,429
and the tightest controls and you know

01:15:06,079 --> 01:15:09,199
these people are disposable they're not

01:15:07,429 --> 01:15:11,149
part of the company they're not front

01:15:09,199 --> 01:15:14,449
and center to what we do yeah Gabby

01:15:11,149 --> 01:15:15,949
wants away yeah I think when Mark

01:15:14,449 --> 01:15:17,320
Zuckerberg started the company ever

01:15:15,949 --> 01:15:19,429
wanted to think about how to deal with

01:15:17,320 --> 01:15:21,769
the things that are being posted that

01:15:19,429 --> 01:15:24,289
you're having to look at and in 2009 I

01:15:21,769 --> 01:15:26,719
think Facebook had 12 moderators and now

01:15:24,289 --> 01:15:28,159
they're I think from last year to the

01:15:26,719 --> 01:15:30,229
year before they double their moderators

01:15:28,159 --> 01:15:32,359
so they're really throwing people at

01:15:30,229 --> 01:15:35,209
this problem which is just going to have

01:15:32,359 --> 01:15:37,039
hundreds of thousands each year of more

01:15:35,209 --> 01:15:40,820
traumatized people so yeah I think their

01:15:37,039 --> 01:15:44,629
lack of any kind of strategy or like

01:15:40,820 --> 01:15:47,570
bringing people into this in a yeah I

01:15:44,629 --> 01:15:49,519
did yeah and then the idea of AI if

01:15:47,570 --> 01:15:51,229
maybe this is a good segue oh for sure

01:15:49,519 --> 01:15:52,579
yeah because I was asking my question I

01:15:51,229 --> 01:15:54,739
had personally is like why can't a I

01:15:52,579 --> 01:15:57,649
just do handle this like why do we have

01:15:54,739 --> 01:15:58,969
to submit people to looking at these

01:15:57,649 --> 01:16:00,979
images and things like that but yeah

01:15:58,969 --> 01:16:07,789
maybe you can talk about why it's not

01:16:00,979 --> 01:16:10,070
really doable it was so the focus of

01:16:07,789 --> 01:16:11,809
Mozilla right now is AI healthy AI and

01:16:10,070 --> 01:16:15,320
obviously there's lots of issues with AI

01:16:11,809 --> 01:16:17,719
and those issues will just be replicated

01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:20,209
in this system the fact is AI can't

01:16:17,719 --> 01:16:22,879
handle the level of complexity the

01:16:20,209 --> 01:16:27,169
moderation requires it can't handle the

01:16:22,879 --> 01:16:29,719
scale I think last year Facebook said

01:16:27,169 --> 01:16:31,789
that 96% of nude and adult images they

01:16:29,719 --> 01:16:34,340
could detect automatically but that

01:16:31,789 --> 01:16:35,749
still leaves I think 1.3 million images

01:16:34,340 --> 01:16:38,780
for moderators to look through and

01:16:35,749 --> 01:16:40,429
that's just adult nude images so I think

01:16:38,780 --> 01:16:43,519
that the scale is a very simple problem

01:16:40,429 --> 01:16:46,459
relative to compared with you know if I

01:16:43,519 --> 01:16:50,269
get 500 words stream of consciousness

01:16:46,459 --> 01:16:52,789
because Doreen's boyfriend has got a new

01:16:50,269 --> 01:16:56,179
girlfriend and she's a junkie and yeah

01:16:52,789 --> 01:16:56,560
dad and I have to go through not line by

01:16:56,179 --> 01:16:59,830
line

01:16:56,560 --> 01:17:02,260
phrase by phrase saying okay that's a

01:16:59,830 --> 01:17:04,960
violation under Section four point two

01:17:02,260 --> 01:17:07,150
point six and that's a violation under

01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:09,670
Section da-da-da-da-da and after listing

01:17:07,150 --> 01:17:11,560
all of them this is the one that I take

01:17:09,670 --> 01:17:13,720
action on because it's the the highest

01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:16,420
on the we have a hierarchy of actions

01:17:13,720 --> 01:17:18,280
this is more important than this spam is

01:17:16,420 --> 01:17:21,010
more into important than child abuse for

01:17:18,280 --> 01:17:23,830
example you know and I have to make the

01:17:21,010 --> 01:17:26,740
right decision based on that and I don't

01:17:23,830 --> 01:17:28,660
see how any AI is gonna do that in the

01:17:26,740 --> 01:17:30,400
near future because you still also just

01:17:28,660 --> 01:17:33,250
won and you just you still need humans

01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:36,220
to create the training data sets a new

01:17:33,250 --> 01:17:37,780
new images still need to be categorized

01:17:36,220 --> 01:17:40,480
all the time so you're still gonna have

01:17:37,780 --> 01:17:43,960
people to categorize the training data

01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:45,490
sets anyway even if AI is more utilized

01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:47,110
yeah I had a question for Chris I mean

01:17:45,490 --> 01:17:49,270
this was just personal curiosity you

01:17:47,110 --> 01:17:51,400
know you not a lot of people have broken

01:17:49,270 --> 01:17:54,460
NDA to come out against Facebook what

01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:55,840
did you think it would be like pre NDA

01:17:54,460 --> 01:17:57,700
broken what do you think it would be

01:17:55,840 --> 01:18:00,280
like and then what has it been like

01:17:57,700 --> 01:18:04,930
after you've come out I didn't think

01:18:00,280 --> 01:18:07,540
about it I was annoyed I doubt I'd had a

01:18:04,930 --> 01:18:09,220
contact from journalist Jen O'Connell at

01:18:07,540 --> 01:18:11,140
the Irish Times and she just wanted to

01:18:09,220 --> 01:18:13,210
talk off the record get some background

01:18:11,140 --> 01:18:15,970
get some ideas and I found myself

01:18:13,210 --> 01:18:17,890
getting really upset in the interview

01:18:15,970 --> 01:18:19,450
talking about the content and this was

01:18:17,890 --> 01:18:22,060
the first time that I've actually talked

01:18:19,450 --> 01:18:25,000
about that and I kind of went away and I

01:18:22,060 --> 01:18:27,120
saw a doctor and I broke down and she

01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:30,190
told me I had PTSD and I came out like

01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:32,410
the of these people done to me and

01:18:30,190 --> 01:18:34,690
and then she called me up and said you

01:18:32,410 --> 01:18:37,000
know how's it going we'd really like to

01:18:34,690 --> 01:18:40,540
put your name on this piece and I said

01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:44,020
 yeah you know let's bring it on

01:18:40,540 --> 01:18:46,870
yeah big big because what I'd realized

01:18:44,020 --> 01:18:49,480
when I for the first time had had this

01:18:46,870 --> 01:18:53,350
open conversation with somebody on the

01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:55,720
outside was that we are we are silenced

01:18:53,350 --> 01:18:57,430
by these NDA's because they don't want

01:18:55,720 --> 01:19:01,990
anybody looking at what's going on

01:18:57,430 --> 01:19:05,230
they're avoiding any external oversight

01:19:01,990 --> 01:19:07,120
or criticism by using the law as a

01:19:05,230 --> 01:19:09,400
weapon we're being threatened

01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:11,950
and I had a call a couple of weeks ago

01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:14,200
from a former colleague still at Cpl the

01:19:11,950 --> 01:19:15,610
company I was working for for Facebook

01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:20,290
and they said hey I hear you're being

01:19:15,610 --> 01:19:23,980
sued by Facebook no I have not heard a

01:19:20,290 --> 01:19:25,840
word from Facebook not not one contact

01:19:23,980 --> 01:19:28,180
they didn't even give a statement to the

01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:30,880
journalist who asked them to respond to

01:19:28,180 --> 01:19:32,170
what I'd said they're keeping you know

01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:34,480
they're just hoping this problem will go

01:19:32,170 --> 01:19:37,570
away who told you I'm being sued

01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:40,240
well my team leader and your team leader

01:19:37,570 --> 01:19:43,330
is trying to manipulate you and threaten

01:19:40,240 --> 01:19:47,770
you and silence you your team leader is

01:19:43,330 --> 01:19:49,870
lying to you to obtain compliance and

01:19:47,770 --> 01:19:53,350
what kind of way is that to treat your

01:19:49,870 --> 01:19:55,840
staff in a modern democracy in a company

01:19:53,350 --> 01:19:58,210
that is dedicated to transparency and

01:19:55,840 --> 01:20:01,300
openness and sharing information privacy

01:19:58,210 --> 01:20:03,250
is dead mark yeah this this is supposed

01:20:01,300 --> 01:20:06,040
to be the world where everybody is

01:20:03,250 --> 01:20:09,250
accountable for everything except for

01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:10,510
the companies with the power I think

01:20:09,250 --> 01:20:12,370
this is really important because we

01:20:10,510 --> 01:20:14,260
experienced exactly the same in the

01:20:12,370 --> 01:20:17,380
Philippines that this is a very very

01:20:14,260 --> 01:20:19,210
secretive industry and everybody is is

01:20:17,380 --> 01:20:20,860
not allowed to talk about what they are

01:20:19,210 --> 01:20:22,810
doing and because everybody signs

01:20:20,860 --> 01:20:25,240
non-disclosure agreements and especially

01:20:22,810 --> 01:20:27,670
if you are traumatized this is the worst

01:20:25,240 --> 01:20:29,530
which can happen that you're not allowed

01:20:27,670 --> 01:20:31,510
to talk about your emotions not allowed

01:20:29,530 --> 01:20:34,900
to talk about what's happening don't

01:20:31,510 --> 01:20:38,140
talk to anybody that's real life about

01:20:34,900 --> 01:20:40,720
this work exactly yes and this is what

01:20:38,140 --> 01:20:42,700
it makes so so so difficult to research

01:20:40,720 --> 01:20:44,800
about that work and also for the

01:20:42,700 --> 01:20:47,440
employees to deal with that kind of work

01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:49,030
and whenever you have facebook or any of

01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:50,410
these companies talk about this they

01:20:49,030 --> 01:20:53,560
always pretend they are transparent

01:20:50,410 --> 01:20:57,940
because they share the guidelines come

01:20:53,560 --> 01:20:59,950
on a company which asks it's outsourcing

01:20:57,940 --> 01:21:02,980
company in the Philippines to let their

01:20:59,950 --> 01:21:06,190
employees use a code word and that is

01:21:02,980 --> 01:21:07,840
true they use the code word we are the

01:21:06,190 --> 01:21:09,790
first challenge we had in our research

01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:11,740
was to find out about this code word

01:21:09,790 --> 01:21:13,570
because only by finding out the code

01:21:11,740 --> 01:21:15,850
word we could then identify the people

01:21:13,570 --> 01:21:17,650
who work for the companies because they

01:21:15,850 --> 01:21:19,909
were never allowed to share with anybody

01:21:17,650 --> 01:21:23,329
not even internally inside

01:21:19,909 --> 01:21:24,949
the company who they worked for and they

01:21:23,329 --> 01:21:28,699
always had to use this code word honey

01:21:24,949 --> 01:21:29,959
badger project this was exactly it in

01:21:28,699 --> 01:21:32,090
the Philippines at the time we were

01:21:29,959 --> 01:21:34,489
researching honey badger project was

01:21:32,090 --> 01:21:37,249
Facebook and everybody inside the

01:21:34,489 --> 01:21:39,079
company inside this account knew that

01:21:37,249 --> 01:21:40,639
whenever they talked about with anybody

01:21:39,079 --> 01:21:44,809
else in the company they had to use it

01:21:40,639 --> 01:21:47,150
in in order to hide as as bad as

01:21:44,809 --> 01:21:49,880
perfectly as possible who what they do

01:21:47,150 --> 01:21:52,699
there and that that is I guess the

01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:56,360
opposite of being transparent they do a

01:21:52,699 --> 01:22:00,309
lot they hire a security company just

01:21:56,360 --> 01:22:03,019
patrolling around the office rooms they

01:22:00,309 --> 01:22:06,260
threatened us and threatened the people

01:22:03,019 --> 01:22:09,110
talking to us that in case they share

01:22:06,260 --> 01:22:12,489
anything about the company they can be

01:22:09,110 --> 01:22:18,380
sued they can not only lose the job but

01:22:12,489 --> 01:22:21,079
face fees it was really horrifying when

01:22:18,380 --> 01:22:23,360
we were there and we really had to find

01:22:21,079 --> 01:22:27,439
a way how to make this film and it took

01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:30,320
us so long to find a slight legal way

01:22:27,439 --> 01:22:33,289
how to on one hand protect the workers

01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:36,499
the employees and on the other hand to

01:22:33,289 --> 01:22:38,510
make this film and to make it in a in a

01:22:36,499 --> 01:22:39,349
way as clear as possible yeah Clara Dino

01:22:38,510 --> 01:22:40,909
jumped over you a couple questions

01:22:39,349 --> 01:22:43,880
before did you want to jump in yeah I

01:22:40,909 --> 01:22:45,889
did well I did want to go back to what

01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:47,900
Gaby I pointed out about AI right and

01:22:45,889 --> 01:22:51,679
automation and one of the biggest fears

01:22:47,900 --> 01:22:53,389
for AI is will a work force that usually

01:22:51,679 --> 01:22:55,669
does a lot of the manual work be

01:22:53,389 --> 01:22:58,639
automated away one day and when do we

01:22:55,669 --> 01:23:00,229
decide to bring in contractors into the

01:22:58,639 --> 01:23:02,719
fold versus using other types of

01:23:00,229 --> 01:23:04,550
technologies and processes and that's a

01:23:02,719 --> 01:23:06,679
lot of my research is really looking at

01:23:04,550 --> 01:23:09,679
the tools that most professionals use

01:23:06,679 --> 01:23:11,659
today to determine acceptable content

01:23:09,679 --> 01:23:13,789
online how do you do tection how do you

01:23:11,659 --> 01:23:15,829
do enforcement and how do we build it in

01:23:13,789 --> 01:23:17,599
a way that can map to the complexities

01:23:15,829 --> 01:23:19,459
of the decision making of what is

01:23:17,599 --> 01:23:22,090
allowable speech online and what isn't

01:23:19,459 --> 01:23:24,979
and enormous volumes and so for example

01:23:22,090 --> 01:23:26,179
for most people that have seen in the

01:23:24,979 --> 01:23:28,550
news what happened during the

01:23:26,179 --> 01:23:30,139
Christchurch shooting live stream video

01:23:28,550 --> 01:23:32,810
content there's a lot that we can learn

01:23:30,139 --> 01:23:35,030
from child online

01:23:32,810 --> 01:23:37,250
for pornography back in the early days

01:23:35,030 --> 01:23:38,660
that were operational practices but

01:23:37,250 --> 01:23:42,680
there are things that are really hard to

01:23:38,660 --> 01:23:44,720
do with AI alone and so an example with

01:23:42,680 --> 01:23:46,940
Christchurch was because the volume of

01:23:44,720 --> 01:23:49,040
content was spread it's such such strong

01:23:46,940 --> 01:23:51,530
speeds it was really hard to have human

01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:54,110
moderators come in and quickly take down

01:23:51,530 --> 01:23:57,260
one by one and so one of the operational

01:23:54,110 --> 01:23:59,150
practices Facebook did was use AI to be

01:23:57,260 --> 01:24:01,910
able to quickly take down that 17

01:23:59,150 --> 01:24:04,310
minutes of graphic content and to be

01:24:01,910 --> 01:24:06,170
able to do it quickly at scale but very

01:24:04,310 --> 01:24:09,230
there are very different processes for

01:24:06,170 --> 01:24:11,000
how a company for example responds in

01:24:09,230 --> 01:24:13,190
the instance of a foreign influence

01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:15,980
operation when there are foreign actors

01:24:13,190 --> 01:24:18,470
that come in and try to manipulate

01:24:15,980 --> 01:24:19,850
content on a platform and users seeing

01:24:18,470 --> 01:24:21,770
from the other side their accounts being

01:24:19,850 --> 01:24:23,390
taken down for no reason there are very

01:24:21,770 --> 01:24:25,250
complicated decision making in which

01:24:23,390 --> 01:24:27,920
more and more technologists are

01:24:25,250 --> 01:24:31,480
developing different tools for detecting

01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:33,950
deep fakes to other types of approaches

01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:35,510
for how we can respond to different

01:24:33,950 --> 01:24:38,570
types of content and how we can also

01:24:35,510 --> 01:24:40,700
minimize trauma when it comes to what is

01:24:38,570 --> 01:24:43,520
at the end of this and the end of the

01:24:40,700 --> 01:24:47,090
totem pole Facebook I think a few months

01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:49,130
ago with all the reporting from films

01:24:47,090 --> 01:24:53,210
and from Casey Mutants piece back in

01:24:49,130 --> 01:24:54,680
March really talking about they started

01:24:53,210 --> 01:24:57,170
to push out some tools that can actually

01:24:54,680 --> 01:24:59,110
blur out some images that content

01:24:57,170 --> 01:25:01,190
moderators see so there's different

01:24:59,110 --> 01:25:03,130
experiments that have been happening but

01:25:01,190 --> 01:25:06,050
again it's really really hard to

01:25:03,130 --> 01:25:08,930
completely use machines as the dependent

01:25:06,050 --> 01:25:10,580
way of assessing content because it does

01:25:08,930 --> 01:25:13,430
push against privacy pushes against

01:25:10,580 --> 01:25:15,650
freedom of expression online yeah I

01:25:13,430 --> 01:25:17,060
wanna I wanna ask couple more questions

01:25:15,650 --> 01:25:19,220
before you give cricket to the audience

01:25:17,060 --> 01:25:21,140
because running a long time I know when

01:25:19,220 --> 01:25:23,030
you say the honey badger project that's

01:25:21,140 --> 01:25:25,670
just wild to me I know Gaby you studied

01:25:23,030 --> 01:25:29,030
a lot about how other companies kind of

01:25:25,670 --> 01:25:30,590
work on moderation why can't the

01:25:29,030 --> 01:25:32,570
companies who maybe get it right why

01:25:30,590 --> 01:25:38,480
can't they apply some of the same things

01:25:32,570 --> 01:25:42,490
they do there I haven't found any

01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:42,490
companies that can because company's a

01:25:42,700 --> 01:25:48,890
motivated by like making money so the

01:25:47,090 --> 01:25:51,080
people I interviewed were people who

01:25:48,890 --> 01:25:53,060
worked on creating these data sets for

01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:55,010
AI so Child Exploitation people that

01:25:53,060 --> 01:25:57,260
work on transportation people that work

01:25:55,010 --> 01:25:59,600
on human rights violations journalists

01:25:57,260 --> 01:26:02,150
lawyers film editors and the reason they

01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:03,440
can get get it right even though no

01:26:02,150 --> 01:26:07,450
one's really getting it right

01:26:03,440 --> 01:26:09,380
and that's why I was working on this is

01:26:07,450 --> 01:26:11,690
because they're able to take the time

01:26:09,380 --> 01:26:15,560
and they prioritize people and that

01:26:11,690 --> 01:26:17,270
they're able to think about really

01:26:15,560 --> 01:26:19,550
important questions that all of this

01:26:17,270 --> 01:26:20,870
work brings and I think that the reason

01:26:19,550 --> 01:26:23,570
that these companies are struggling is

01:26:20,870 --> 01:26:25,270
because it does none of the strategies

01:26:23,570 --> 01:26:30,470
will work because none of them support

01:26:25,270 --> 01:26:32,960
quick speedy decisions yeah I also agree

01:26:30,470 --> 01:26:35,870
that the core problem is not technology

01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:37,990
the core problem is that we as different

01:26:35,870 --> 01:26:43,580
societies involved in this massive

01:26:37,990 --> 01:26:46,370
humanity project called social media we

01:26:43,580 --> 01:26:49,220
are not yet clear about how we what want

01:26:46,370 --> 01:26:51,350
to define freedom of speech for example

01:26:49,220 --> 01:26:53,110
like if you only compare the definition

01:26:51,350 --> 01:26:55,370
of freedom of speech in the US with the

01:26:53,110 --> 01:26:57,380
definition in Germany where we come from

01:26:55,370 --> 01:27:00,440
for example that's completely different

01:26:57,380 --> 01:27:02,870
like what do you consider to be

01:27:00,440 --> 01:27:05,720
acceptable what not and that should be

01:27:02,870 --> 01:27:09,340
something we as the not only users but

01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:12,650
the members of these social media

01:27:09,340 --> 01:27:14,900
projects should discuss about publicly

01:27:12,650 --> 01:27:17,030
and we don't claim that it's all about

01:27:14,900 --> 01:27:20,210
that all the fault is on the side of the

01:27:17,030 --> 01:27:23,990
companies that's not true the fault we

01:27:20,210 --> 01:27:26,840
consider at least is that they don't

01:27:23,990 --> 01:27:28,850
make it transparent that they don't open

01:27:26,840 --> 01:27:31,130
the discussion that they don't accept

01:27:28,850 --> 01:27:33,500
that they alone can't decide about all

01:27:31,130 --> 01:27:34,970
that and whenever you hear is like a

01:27:33,500 --> 01:27:37,460
book talking it's like yeah we will

01:27:34,970 --> 01:27:39,710
follow up on that with our team we can

01:27:37,460 --> 01:27:42,050
fix it and that's not the way it shows

01:27:39,710 --> 01:27:44,240
anything all the time that the Facebook

01:27:42,050 --> 01:27:47,480
can do no wrong oh maybe maybe it's not

01:27:44,240 --> 01:27:50,120
perfect but we can fix it yes the people

01:27:47,480 --> 01:27:51,740
who are doing the work have no chain of

01:27:50,120 --> 01:27:55,520
command to turn around and say look this

01:27:51,740 --> 01:27:58,400
is not working that there's if you think

01:27:55,520 --> 01:28:00,410
in terms of startup ecosystems there's

01:27:58,400 --> 01:28:02,920
all these disruptive people challenging

01:28:00,410 --> 01:28:06,400
the status quo figuring out a way to

01:28:02,920 --> 01:28:08,930
change bank banking for example FinTech

01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:10,220
we're all familiar with that model now

01:28:08,930 --> 01:28:12,860
we're seeing what's happened you've got

01:28:10,220 --> 01:28:14,810
challenges Facebook within Facebook

01:28:12,860 --> 01:28:17,000
there is a monopoly there is one person

01:28:14,810 --> 01:28:19,060
one department and all this all the

01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:21,680
people doing what they're told and

01:28:19,060 --> 01:28:23,510
there's an empire at the top that needs

01:28:21,680 --> 01:28:26,090
to be disruptive needs to be challenged

01:28:23,510 --> 01:28:28,400
but too many vested interests within the

01:28:26,090 --> 01:28:30,380
organization are preventing that from

01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:32,150
happening because nobody knows the

01:28:30,380 --> 01:28:33,800
solution nobody knows what's going to

01:28:32,150 --> 01:28:35,630
work you have to try this and this and

01:28:33,800 --> 01:28:38,420
this and this and a hundred different

01:28:35,630 --> 01:28:41,450
things a gather data and figure out what

01:28:38,420 --> 01:28:42,620
works instead of just insisting you know

01:28:41,450 --> 01:28:44,420
what we're doing and we're just gonna

01:28:42,620 --> 01:28:47,180
tweak it and we'll get it right Johnny

01:28:44,420 --> 01:28:49,460
yeah I'm running on time but my last

01:28:47,180 --> 01:28:51,650
question is about awareness for this

01:28:49,460 --> 01:28:53,210
issue like how can we bring more aware

01:28:51,650 --> 01:28:55,370
and also want to direct Chris like what

01:28:53,210 --> 01:28:57,860
do you need from us on this stage and

01:28:55,370 --> 01:29:00,710
the audience like what can we do to

01:28:57,860 --> 01:29:02,120
bring more awareness to this issue so my

01:29:00,710 --> 01:29:04,250
lawyer tells me that he has a rich

01:29:02,120 --> 01:29:06,190
prepared for the high quality in Ireland

01:29:04,250 --> 01:29:09,530
which will go in the next few days

01:29:06,190 --> 01:29:12,860
claiming damages for stress disorders

01:29:09,530 --> 01:29:15,380
caused by the work the things we have to

01:29:12,860 --> 01:29:18,110
see and deal with there are half a dozen

01:29:15,380 --> 01:29:19,640
offers in the case of the moment there's

01:29:18,110 --> 01:29:23,240
a whole bunch more waiting in the wings

01:29:19,640 --> 01:29:25,490
people that are afraid to even put their

01:29:23,240 --> 01:29:30,830
name on a list that they're terrified

01:29:25,490 --> 01:29:32,690
and also traumatized beaten down they

01:29:30,830 --> 01:29:35,300
just don't want to talk about this

01:29:32,690 --> 01:29:38,120
anymore and I'm here you know to speak

01:29:35,300 --> 01:29:41,090
publicly and and just say look it's okay

01:29:38,120 --> 01:29:43,670
to talk about it it's okay to just put

01:29:41,090 --> 01:29:46,250
your name on the list it's okay to call

01:29:43,670 --> 01:29:49,400
Dave Coleman and say how do I get

01:29:46,250 --> 01:29:51,950
justice whoever you are wherever you are

01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:54,500
in the world so I mean we've been

01:29:51,950 --> 01:29:57,110
talking about it looks like people in

01:29:54,500 --> 01:30:00,980
the Philippines can bring a case in

01:29:57,110 --> 01:30:02,930
Ireland people in Germany and Barcelona

01:30:00,980 --> 01:30:04,070
there's a center there they almost

01:30:02,930 --> 01:30:06,620
certainly can

01:30:04,070 --> 01:30:11,590
we want more people to come and get

01:30:06,620 --> 01:30:14,030
behind this and get justice and take

01:30:11,590 --> 01:30:15,890
agency take responsibility for their own

01:30:14,030 --> 01:30:18,200
lives instead of just being told what to

01:30:15,890 --> 01:30:21,650
do and told to keep their mouth shut so

01:30:18,200 --> 01:30:24,320
if you know anybody who does this work

01:30:21,650 --> 01:30:27,800
has done this work is connected with

01:30:24,320 --> 01:30:30,320
people or who has a budget to enable us

01:30:27,800 --> 01:30:33,050
to reach out and chase these people and

01:30:30,320 --> 01:30:34,520
find them and help them you know I'll be

01:30:33,050 --> 01:30:37,030
the lightning rod I'll be the one that

01:30:34,520 --> 01:30:40,970
gets shot up by Facebook if necessary

01:30:37,030 --> 01:30:42,370
but both we need more support from wider

01:30:40,970 --> 01:30:45,350
Internet Society

01:30:42,370 --> 01:30:48,080
all right well with that user cute art

01:30:45,350 --> 01:30:50,030
user Q&A uh audience Q&A I think we have

01:30:48,080 --> 01:30:55,580
some mics going around you so I'll let

01:30:50,030 --> 01:31:00,160
Kevin take the lead on that here we go

01:30:55,580 --> 01:31:02,330
they're here can you hear me yep yeah

01:31:00,160 --> 01:31:04,400
actually one of my questions I have a

01:31:02,330 --> 01:31:06,800
few friends in Moore in the Silicon

01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:08,360
Valley side were also hired through

01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:09,890
these contracting companies to do this

01:31:08,360 --> 01:31:12,260
work and a few of them did try to get

01:31:09,890 --> 01:31:13,820
some legal help but they were told that

01:31:12,260 --> 01:31:15,860
because of the way this is done through

01:31:13,820 --> 01:31:17,750
these contracting setups that you can't

01:31:15,860 --> 01:31:20,120
really get at the company which is

01:31:17,750 --> 01:31:22,460
hiring these contracting services so I

01:31:20,120 --> 01:31:24,290
was wondering what the legal side looks

01:31:22,460 --> 01:31:26,510
like there and how this is set up with

01:31:24,290 --> 01:31:28,970
these shell companies and if you have

01:31:26,510 --> 01:31:31,670
any sort of input on how that can be

01:31:28,970 --> 01:31:34,550
addressed yeah I'm not a lawyer but were

01:31:31,670 --> 01:31:36,920
under European law not not American law

01:31:34,550 --> 01:31:38,630
I I can give this when I go there's a

01:31:36,920 --> 01:31:40,700
class-action lawsuit happening in the

01:31:38,630 --> 01:31:43,130
state of California that Salinas Cole

01:31:40,700 --> 01:31:46,340
have started in September 2018 and

01:31:43,130 --> 01:31:50,480
initially she did for a third-party

01:31:46,340 --> 01:31:51,860
company and face workers in the claim

01:31:50,480 --> 01:31:54,200
and now that's just been changed to

01:31:51,860 --> 01:31:55,970
Facebook and she's added other people to

01:31:54,200 --> 01:31:58,850
the class-action and I think the issue

01:31:55,970 --> 01:32:00,800
is that in some of the contracts there's

01:31:58,850 --> 01:32:02,600
possible arbitration agreements that are

01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:06,260
being mentioned which is basically you

01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:08,420
can't sue us but I think that this case

01:32:06,260 --> 01:32:12,350
is ongoing and they're looking for more

01:32:08,420 --> 01:32:14,390
class-action claimants to join them and

01:32:12,350 --> 01:32:16,940
also I think there is a tide happening

01:32:14,390 --> 01:32:17,690
legally around this in Australia a media

01:32:16,940 --> 01:32:20,270
outlet called the

01:32:17,690 --> 01:32:23,570
age has just been successfully

01:32:20,270 --> 01:32:27,050
prosecuted for negligence and duty of

01:32:23,570 --> 01:32:29,989
care around PTSD and the claimant was

01:32:27,050 --> 01:32:31,190
awarded 180,000 Australian dollars so I

01:32:29,989 --> 01:32:32,660
think that there is a tight

01:32:31,190 --> 01:32:35,840
we are definitely the contracts that

01:32:32,660 --> 01:32:37,040
people are signing and not helping but

01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:39,410
there is I would look up Salinas

01:32:37,040 --> 01:32:43,010
scholars case it's worth mentioning that

01:32:39,410 --> 01:32:47,000
I came here at the invitation of Amnesty

01:32:43,010 --> 01:32:49,250
International and a new nonprofit called

01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:52,340
foxglove who are all about holding tech

01:32:49,250 --> 01:32:54,260
companies accountable and their view

01:32:52,340 --> 01:32:55,969
both of these organizations is that this

01:32:54,260 --> 01:32:59,960
is a human rights issue and human rights

01:32:55,969 --> 01:33:03,770
law Trump's employment law or insurance

01:32:59,960 --> 01:33:05,390
law for example so if you think you're

01:33:03,770 --> 01:33:07,610
on a building site and you're an

01:33:05,390 --> 01:33:09,650
electrician and you fall down a hole do

01:33:07,610 --> 01:33:12,070
you sue the electrical wiring company

01:33:09,650 --> 01:33:14,719
that you're working for do you sue the

01:33:12,070 --> 01:33:18,350
major contractor do you sue the guy who

01:33:14,719 --> 01:33:19,820
left though the manhole open at the end

01:33:18,350 --> 01:33:21,560
of the day it's the people that are

01:33:19,820 --> 01:33:23,840
operating the building site that are

01:33:21,560 --> 01:33:26,780
responsible and I think that principle

01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:28,910
holds true with these cases as well and

01:33:26,780 --> 01:33:30,830
that's why we think that people in the

01:33:28,910 --> 01:33:36,440
Philippines for example are able to join

01:33:30,830 --> 01:33:40,520
our action in Ireland next question over

01:33:36,440 --> 01:33:42,410
here thank you for this panel I have a

01:33:40,520 --> 01:33:44,810
question I sometimes feel like there's a

01:33:42,410 --> 01:33:46,280
disconnect between debates around ethics

01:33:44,810 --> 01:33:48,650
AI automation

01:33:46,280 --> 01:33:50,719
we're often time human intervention is

01:33:48,650 --> 01:33:52,730
seen as not may be the only solution but

01:33:50,719 --> 01:33:55,520
it's something that's very important and

01:33:52,730 --> 01:33:57,410
anybody who works on we all agree that

01:33:55,520 --> 01:33:58,550
there's certain content that has to be

01:33:57,410 --> 01:34:00,199
you unless you are completely

01:33:58,550 --> 01:34:02,540
libertarian we know that there's certain

01:34:00,199 --> 01:34:04,850
content then has to be removed but we

01:34:02,540 --> 01:34:06,710
also know that automating it isn't

01:34:04,850 --> 01:34:08,330
really working that well and that risks

01:34:06,710 --> 01:34:10,760
taking out things that really shouldn't

01:34:08,330 --> 01:34:12,230
be taking down and the only two solution

01:34:10,760 --> 01:34:16,280
to this seems to be having human

01:34:12,230 --> 01:34:19,030
moderators based on all your experience

01:34:16,280 --> 01:34:22,790
on this where would you draw the line in

01:34:19,030 --> 01:34:25,270
there seems to be a pay or like a cost

01:34:22,790 --> 01:34:27,650
to both either automation and the human

01:34:25,270 --> 01:34:29,360
involvement and I find this sort of like

01:34:27,650 --> 01:34:31,300
almost a dilemma that's very very

01:34:29,360 --> 01:34:34,039
difficult to resolve

01:34:31,300 --> 01:34:35,809
yeah and I think this is the really

01:34:34,039 --> 01:34:37,159
important point that I've been trying to

01:34:35,809 --> 01:34:39,769
drive home is we need to uplift

01:34:37,159 --> 01:34:42,979
operational practices in this space to

01:34:39,769 --> 01:34:45,110
the complexity that reflects freedom of

01:34:42,979 --> 01:34:47,030
speech while protecting people from

01:34:45,110 --> 01:34:48,619
seeing the worst that is possible right

01:34:47,030 --> 01:34:50,599
now companies don't have shared

01:34:48,619 --> 01:34:53,360
operational practices on how to deal

01:34:50,599 --> 01:34:55,130
with all types of crisis moments when it

01:34:53,360 --> 01:34:57,110
comes to terrible content landing on

01:34:55,130 --> 01:34:58,880
their platforms which for the first time

01:34:57,110 --> 01:35:00,709
never had to think about someone doing a

01:34:58,880 --> 01:35:02,479
live shooting you know a few weeks ago

01:35:00,709 --> 01:35:04,039
and they suddenly had to figure out an

01:35:02,479 --> 01:35:06,829
operational response should we take that

01:35:04,039 --> 01:35:08,539
down we leave it up how do we ensure

01:35:06,829 --> 01:35:10,729
that it's not spreading to third parties

01:35:08,539 --> 01:35:12,709
on encrypted messaging platforms right

01:35:10,729 --> 01:35:15,050
and how do we ensure that other

01:35:12,709 --> 01:35:16,969
platforms that are looser with their

01:35:15,050 --> 01:35:18,829
Terms of Service or not hosting that

01:35:16,969 --> 01:35:20,719
kind of content if illegal and it's

01:35:18,829 --> 01:35:22,369
really really hard a lot of countries

01:35:20,719 --> 01:35:24,440
all around the world are thinking about

01:35:22,369 --> 01:35:26,570
regulation of content because they have

01:35:24,440 --> 01:35:29,090
no idea what to do and they don't have

01:35:26,570 --> 01:35:32,239
any idea what they can do to ask

01:35:29,090 --> 01:35:34,340
companies to to better deal with all

01:35:32,239 --> 01:35:36,409
types of threats from foreign influence

01:35:34,340 --> 01:35:39,139
to terrorist content to disinformation

01:35:36,409 --> 01:35:40,550
and this is a huge struggle in which if

01:35:39,139 --> 01:35:43,249
we don't start having a more transparent

01:35:40,550 --> 01:35:46,099
and shared dialogue between industry

01:35:43,249 --> 01:35:48,440
members and also the general public it's

01:35:46,099 --> 01:35:50,599
gonna be really hard and Facebook you

01:35:48,440 --> 01:35:52,280
know set up an observation boards I try

01:35:50,599 --> 01:35:54,709
to bring civil society and a number of

01:35:52,280 --> 01:35:56,239
actors into the mix to show in more

01:35:54,709 --> 01:35:59,690
transparency their own decision-making

01:35:56,239 --> 01:36:01,459
but it is not very clear how transparent

01:35:59,690 --> 01:36:03,829
that is to the public how transparent

01:36:01,459 --> 01:36:06,110
that is to governments and so really

01:36:03,829 --> 01:36:08,539
what needs to happen at least from the

01:36:06,110 --> 01:36:11,150
industry side is much more information

01:36:08,539 --> 01:36:13,429
sharing around operational practices for

01:36:11,150 --> 01:36:15,409
us to be able to have the right tools to

01:36:13,429 --> 01:36:18,079
be able to deal with all types of

01:36:15,409 --> 01:36:20,929
content at scale maybe if I may add one

01:36:18,079 --> 01:36:23,079
example which is actually based here in

01:36:20,929 --> 01:36:26,239
London and it's called air wars

01:36:23,079 --> 01:36:26,749
some of you might may actually know it

01:36:26,239 --> 01:36:29,220
even

01:36:26,749 --> 01:36:30,400
it's an organization which focuses on

01:36:29,220 --> 01:36:33,919
[Music]

01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:37,999
proving guilt in the

01:36:33,919 --> 01:36:40,329
in the war in Syria or in Iraq and what

01:36:37,999 --> 01:36:43,579
they do is they try to archive videos

01:36:40,329 --> 01:36:48,169
which are uploaded to Facebook YouTube

01:36:43,579 --> 01:36:52,729
Twitter by citizen journalists in Syria

01:36:48,169 --> 01:36:55,039
or in Iraq proving airstrikes or the

01:36:52,729 --> 01:36:57,829
results of airstrikes on civilian

01:36:55,039 --> 01:37:00,610
entities in in Syria or in Iraq on

01:36:57,829 --> 01:37:04,130
schools and hospitals and so on and

01:37:00,610 --> 01:37:05,689
whenever these videos are uploaded most

01:37:04,130 --> 01:37:07,999
of the time it doesn't take much time

01:37:05,689 --> 01:37:10,039
until they are taken down for good

01:37:07,999 --> 01:37:11,719
reasons on one hand because in a lot of

01:37:10,039 --> 01:37:14,239
cases they're really cruel they're

01:37:11,719 --> 01:37:16,820
really they're covering their people

01:37:14,239 --> 01:37:20,030
they're the full of horrifying content

01:37:16,820 --> 01:37:22,130
so it's really hard to actually claim

01:37:20,030 --> 01:37:24,409
that these videos should be should

01:37:22,130 --> 01:37:28,249
remain on social media but on the other

01:37:24,409 --> 01:37:30,669
side if we think back on what dreams we

01:37:28,249 --> 01:37:33,679
had about social media about the

01:37:30,669 --> 01:37:36,559
emancipating effect of social media this

01:37:33,679 --> 01:37:39,079
is maybe one of the last things

01:37:36,559 --> 01:37:41,300
remaining as a potential on social media

01:37:39,079 --> 01:37:43,369
which we should defend that this is also

01:37:41,300 --> 01:37:45,320
a way that when the Western media

01:37:43,369 --> 01:37:48,979
conventional media is not interested

01:37:45,320 --> 01:37:52,550
anymore in covering everything from the

01:37:48,979 --> 01:37:55,610
Syrian or the Iraq war and that at least

01:37:52,550 --> 01:37:59,840
civilian citizen journalists have a

01:37:55,610 --> 01:38:03,889
forum there to still reach a worldwide

01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:06,380
audience and to make their points so why

01:38:03,889 --> 01:38:09,289
not defend the fact that these videos

01:38:06,380 --> 01:38:11,630
should remain visible though they are

01:38:09,289 --> 01:38:15,679
completely cruel on social media this is

01:38:11,630 --> 01:38:18,199
just to to make clear how difficult it

01:38:15,679 --> 01:38:21,889
is how to decide about these cases and

01:38:18,199 --> 01:38:23,959
that we actually all of us people from

01:38:21,889 --> 01:38:27,469
all over the world should debate it much

01:38:23,959 --> 01:38:31,159
more and not only like representatives

01:38:27,469 --> 01:38:33,619
at whatever board they're but all of us

01:38:31,159 --> 01:38:35,809
should debate it and what we want to use

01:38:33,619 --> 01:38:40,579
it for what social media should be like

01:38:35,809 --> 01:38:43,689
should it be like first of all a healthy

01:38:40,579 --> 01:38:46,550
environment what Facebook always claims

01:38:43,689 --> 01:38:47,640
where all the family can spend a lot of

01:38:46,550 --> 01:38:52,500
time

01:38:47,640 --> 01:38:55,800
and money portator or should it be an

01:38:52,500 --> 01:38:59,760
emancipating platform platform like

01:38:55,800 --> 01:39:01,980
which can help giving people a voice who

01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:03,690
normally don't have one and in which

01:39:01,980 --> 01:39:06,060
geographic content actually stay up

01:39:03,690 --> 01:39:07,560
right when it's proving out war crimes

01:39:06,060 --> 01:39:09,480
that are happening in other countries

01:39:07,560 --> 01:39:11,340
and these are really hard to beit's that

01:39:09,480 --> 01:39:13,410
early content moderators had to really

01:39:11,340 --> 01:39:15,660
feel with they might say hey this is

01:39:13,410 --> 01:39:18,600
really graphic violent violent content

01:39:15,660 --> 01:39:20,490
that should violate all our policies but

01:39:18,600 --> 01:39:22,410
they've started cultural movements and

01:39:20,490 --> 01:39:24,210
really helping you know push against

01:39:22,410 --> 01:39:26,280
governments that were you know doing

01:39:24,210 --> 01:39:28,110
very terrible things in there and we're

01:39:26,280 --> 01:39:29,670
getting into moderating policy here

01:39:28,110 --> 01:39:31,650
you're missing the point

01:39:29,670 --> 01:39:35,190
whatever the policy is people are going

01:39:31,650 --> 01:39:38,160
to report this stuff yeah you share

01:39:35,190 --> 01:39:41,310
images III would see pictures of what

01:39:38,160 --> 01:39:43,800
was happening in Burma people are

01:39:41,310 --> 01:39:46,200
posting that to raise awareness not not

01:39:43,800 --> 01:39:51,270
to celebrate it people are protesting

01:39:46,200 --> 01:39:56,400
and it's appearing on my desk and I've

01:39:51,270 --> 01:39:57,900
got to make a call is that baby dead and

01:39:56,400 --> 01:40:00,150
then I've got a press the right button

01:39:57,900 --> 01:40:02,990
and if I press the wrong button because

01:40:00,150 --> 01:40:05,520
my auditor thinks the baby's not dead

01:40:02,990 --> 01:40:07,680
then I've made a mistake and that counts

01:40:05,520 --> 01:40:09,690
towards my quality scores and I could

01:40:07,680 --> 01:40:16,860
get fired so I'm lying awake in bed at

01:40:09,690 --> 01:40:19,200
night seeing that image again and I'm

01:40:16,860 --> 01:40:23,040
trying to formulate an argument to keep

01:40:19,200 --> 01:40:25,680
my job and it doesn't matter what the

01:40:23,040 --> 01:40:27,720
 policy is the point is people

01:40:25,680 --> 01:40:30,300
are gonna post this stuff and people are

01:40:27,720 --> 01:40:38,370
gonna complain about it somebody's got

01:40:30,300 --> 01:40:40,290
to look at it I mean it just really

01:40:38,370 --> 01:40:42,510
shows the complexity of policymaking in

01:40:40,290 --> 01:40:43,860
this space right no and that's not it

01:40:42,510 --> 01:40:46,890
that's not what it shows I think it

01:40:43,860 --> 01:40:48,210
shows like how difficult this job is and

01:40:46,890 --> 01:40:50,220
how you have like eight seconds

01:40:48,210 --> 01:40:52,830
sometimes to make this decision and I

01:40:50,220 --> 01:40:55,320
think that in order to understand how

01:40:52,830 --> 01:40:57,180
this all works we have to understand how

01:40:55,320 --> 01:40:58,980
these companies operate there should be

01:40:57,180 --> 01:41:00,819
the NDA's are there in place so that

01:40:58,980 --> 01:41:03,609
people don't gain this system

01:41:00,819 --> 01:41:05,229
in order to accept like so that they

01:41:03,609 --> 01:41:07,359
don't get content past the moderators

01:41:05,229 --> 01:41:08,769
which is what Facebook said but it's not

01:41:07,359 --> 01:41:12,069
it's the silence people on that we can't

01:41:08,769 --> 01:41:14,319
see what's happening for like I was

01:41:12,069 --> 01:41:17,319
saying 100,000 people who have had this

01:41:14,319 --> 01:41:20,199
exact same experience and worse yeah

01:41:17,319 --> 01:41:21,280
should we do one more question I think I

01:41:20,199 --> 01:41:27,069
think that's it then

01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:30,039
so yeah I want the air walls here was

01:41:27,069 --> 01:41:30,510
there worse okay yeah a contact later if

01:41:30,039 --> 01:41:32,679
you like

01:41:30,510 --> 01:41:35,139
nice yeah I think with that we'll wrap

01:41:32,679 --> 01:41:37,780
up the panel thank you so much for our

01:41:35,139 --> 01:41:43,449
panelists today a big round of applause

expert group on AI same as Fanny yeah so

let's talk about AI I want to start off

02:32:51,279 --> 02:32:55,660
by asking you guys things and they can

02:32:53,500 --> 02:32:58,170
do bad things but it all depends on what

02:32:55,660 --> 02:33:00,670
kind of context and what kind of

02:32:58,170 --> 02:33:03,370
frameworks that we use them in and

02:33:00,670 --> 02:33:07,300
develop them in and design them in so in

02:33:03,370 --> 02:33:10,750
in general it all depends on on how it's

02:33:07,300 --> 02:33:12,490
built and how its adopted and that's how

02:33:10,750 --> 02:33:15,040
we have to think of a as well not as

02:33:12,490 --> 02:33:16,720
this new emergent thing that that

02:33:15,040 --> 02:33:18,340
changes everything and disrupts

02:33:16,720 --> 02:33:20,970
everything but it has to build into

02:33:18,340 --> 02:33:20,970
