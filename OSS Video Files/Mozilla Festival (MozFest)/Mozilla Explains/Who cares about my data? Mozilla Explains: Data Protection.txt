(upbeat music)

00:00:06,927 --> 00:00:09,200
- Hi, I'm Alice Munyua,

00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,080
I'm the director

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,600
of the Africa Innovation Program at Mozilla,

00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,920
and I'm going to explain data protection.

00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,440
So, data is any kind of distinctive piece of information

00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,480
which can be stored and which can be read,

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,680
processed or understood by a human or a machine.

00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,840
Data now extends to our images, our speech,

00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,320
our daily patterns, and so on.

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,600
So, why do companies collect data?

00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,920
Businesses have various abilities to contextualize data

00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,520
and draw insights from it.

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,040
And in fact, over the years, some companies have created

00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,280
and use very sneaky techniques

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,000
to understand customer behavior online and also offline.

00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,760
What are some of the specific reasons

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,720
that companies do this?

00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,000
To improve customer experience.

00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,440
A lot of companies can modify their digital presence,

00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,280
their goods or services

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,320
to better suit the current marketplace.

00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,880
Companies also collect data

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,000
to understand how consumers are engaging with

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,080
and responding to their marketing campaigns.

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,360
Data brokers or data service providers

00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,840
that buy and sell information on you

00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,200
have risen as a new industry

00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,680
alongside what we are calling big data.

00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,920
Your location, your activity, your preferences,

00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,880
your demographics is collected on a daily basis.

00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,920
Data can be used to increase efficiencies.

00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,000
For example, with the current public health crisis, COVID,

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,720
it can help improve how we react

00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,720
or how we address health challenges.

00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,040
It can also increase efficiencies in areas like agriculture

00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,280
by improving supply chains,

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,160
or in education by improving online delivery.

00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,200
The big question is, who owns my data,

00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,840
and how do I keep all of that private?

00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,000
To go back to the COVID crisis,

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,760
with contact tracing apps

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,440
that most governments were insisting

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,200
that you download on your phones,

00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,840
what is to stop states and companies

00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,280
from using this information?

00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,000
In Kenya, my country, they were requesting

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,120
that everybody residing in Kenya provide their DNA sample,

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,840
earlobe geometry, iris scan,

00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,640
your GPS, your fingerprint,

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,960
for a biometric digital ID system.

00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,040
If you recall back in 2017,

00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,840
there was a global scandal surrounding the British company,

00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,120
Cambridge Analytica, and that kind of served

00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,240
as a wake up call for much stronger data protection.

00:02:53,200 --> 00:03:00,000
GDPR lays out the rules of data capture, storage, usage,

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,680
and sharing for companies.

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,240
It's a law that's applicable to any business

00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:08,880
that targets or collects personal data of EU citizens.

00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,120
The California Consumer Privacy Act,

00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,680
it requires you as an individual

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,440
to opt out of data collection,

00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,920
rather than putting the responsibility on the companies

00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,160
or the service providers themselves.

00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,800
The African Union has a convention on cyber crime

00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,680
and personal data protection called the Malabo Convention,

00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,240
to protect users in the Africa region.

00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,640
And out of the 55 African countries,

00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,920
more than half have adopted some form of regulation.

00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,840
The protection of personal information

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,480
is really fundamental to non-discrimination,

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,080
to human dignity, to the freedoms that we enjoy;

00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,200
the freedom of speech, freedom of movement,

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,160
freedom of association, freedom of trade.

00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,240
And so, those rights are central

00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,880
to any open and democratic society.

00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,480
I'd like to call on everyone to join Mozilla

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,280
as we fight for a internet that is dependable,

00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,160
that is secure, that is trustworthy,

00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,120
where access is universal and accessible to all,

00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,800
internet that respects and adheres to ethics,

00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:16,720
that is open, decentralized, interoperable,

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,280
and also where we continue to advocate

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,480
for participatory governance structures

00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:29,040
that empower rather than extract and exploit individuals

00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:36,160
and users specifically.

00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:36,949
