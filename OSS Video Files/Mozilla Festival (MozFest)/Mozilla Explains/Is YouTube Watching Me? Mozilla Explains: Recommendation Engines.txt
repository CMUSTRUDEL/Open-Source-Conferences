Description: 
	Ever feel like YouTube is a little *too good* at suggesting the next video for you to watch? How does it do it? 

YouTubeâ€™s recommendation engine, sometimes called the recommendation algorithm, is incredibly powerful: It accounts for 70% of all videos viewed on YouTube. In this episode of Mozilla Explains, data scientist and researcher Jesse McCrosky tells us how it works.

Hi, I'm Jesse McCrosky

00:00:09,001 --> 00:00:11,990
a data scientist and researcher with the Mozilla Foundation.

00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:16,520
And I'm here to tell you how YouTube decides what video to recommend to you next.

00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,470
We'll focus on YouTube,

00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:22,700
but this sort of technology is used in most of the platforms and social media

00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:23,900
systems that you use.

00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:29,420
The technology we will be talking about today is a content recommendation engine.

00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:33,650
This is what YouTube uses to decide what videos to autoplay after you finish

00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:34,483
watching a video,

00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:38,330
and also what recommendations to make to you in the sidebar.

00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:41,630
The content recommendation engine uses three main components:

00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,340
The library of content,

00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:48,560
the context, and the user. YouTube of course has an enormous library

00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:52,760
of videos that their users have uploaded and that they might recommend to you.

00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:56,900
They use their machine learning systems to extract a lot of information from

00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:57,733
these videos.

00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:02,840
What topics they're about, how professionally they're produced. Context in this case

00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:06,680
is what video did you just watch, as well as what time is it?

00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:10,010
Where in the world are you? Is it a weekend or a holiday?

00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:14,150
Anything they know about the environment in which you're watching the video.

00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:18,620
What YouTube knows about you will depend on your individual user settings,

00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:22,730
but generally speaking, YouTube is tracking your entire use of the platform.

00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:27,500
What they know about you can be divided into three layers.

00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:32,030
First there's the information that you voluntarily provide.

00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:34,460
Second, there's what YouTube observes about your behavior,

00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:37,790
what you're doing within their products. And finally,

00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:41,420
there's what YouTube is able to infer about who you are as a person.

00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,660
So of course, we don't know exactly how YouTube works,

00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:47,900
but we do have a general understanding from their blog posts.

00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,410
Their published academic papers and especially their privacy policies.

00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:55,250
So first there's the information that you voluntarily give to YouTube,

00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,670
which should not be very surprising. If you like or dislike a video,

00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,580
You're telling YouTube, "I like this video", or "I disliked this video."

00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:05,300
If you add a video to a playlist, if you share it with a friend,

00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:08,900
these are all signals where you're telling YouTube how you feel about their

00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:13,430
content. The next layer is the information that YouTube observes about you,

00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,200
which might be a little bit more surprising.

00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:19,430
The unsurprising part is that they pay attention to which videos you watch.

00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:23,150
So whether you watch just one minute of a video or the entire video to

00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:26,900
completion, they'll notice that difference. If you skip through part of a video,

00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,760
they'll notice which part you skipped through.

00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:32,360
Where it gets a little bit weirder is if you're scrolling through a list of

00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,750
recommendations in the mobile app, for example, and you slow down

00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:38,540
your scrolling at some point because a thumbnail catches your eye,

00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:42,980
probably they can notice that. Similarly on their desktop website,

00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:46,040
if you hover your mouse cursor over a recommendation,

00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:47,600
even if you don't end up clicking it,

00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,990
they're probably paying attention to the fact that you hovered your mouse there

00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:51,823
for a minute,

00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:55,280
giving them an indication that you might be interested in that video.

00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:59,830
Using this information, YouTube is able to infer basic information about you.

00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:05,740
This could include your age, your gender, your income, your level of education,

00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:10,780
even more sensitive characteristics like ethnicity, your sexual preferences,

00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,370
or your political orientation.

00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:15,580
So of course these inferences are not always going to be correct,

00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:20,470
but there was one study in 2013 using Facebook likes and they

00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:24,790
found that they were about 90% accurate using only Facebook likes to predict a

00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:26,860
user's sexual orientation,

00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:29,950
whether they were African-American or Caucasian American,

00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:33,550
and also whether they identified as a Democrat or a Republican.

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,860
So YouTube does know a lot about us and they use this information to surface

00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,230
the "best" videos for us. In a sense,

00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:45,010
this is really useful because there's a lot of content on YouTube and it's

00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:48,753
difficult for us to wade through it all to find the stuff that we're interested in,

00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:52,960
but we need to think very critically about what they mean by "best", and "best" for

00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,080
whom? This is something we'll explore at a follow-up video.

00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,760
