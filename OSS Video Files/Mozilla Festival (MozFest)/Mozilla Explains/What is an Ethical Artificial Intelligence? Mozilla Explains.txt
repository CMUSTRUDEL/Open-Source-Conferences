Description: 
	Artificial intelligence (AI) takes in information and uses it to make informed predictions. But when opaque algorithms make decisions on your behalf, ethical problems can arise.

Director of AI Ethics Lab Cansu Canca explains.

I'm Cansu Canca, I'm the director and founder  of AI Ethics Lab and I'm a philosopher.  

00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,000
And I'm here to explain what is an ethical artificial intelligence.

00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,200
At this point we are interacting with AI all the time because

00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:24,400
we have our cell phones loaded with AI systems like your maps,  

00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,000
your search engines, your emails, social media.

00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
All of those use some sort of AI systems and then  

00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,520
there are those that you are not really aware of that you are being subjected to. 

00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,520
We make all of our decisions based on the information that we have

00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,400
and what kind of information you can access. 

00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:46,160
If you are shown only options that the system  finds fitting for you, that means that there are  

00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,080
a whole bunch of other options that you are  not even aware of.

00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,080
So you are being sort of stuck and pigeonholed in this in this particular 

00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:57,600
circumstance that some sort of AI system decided "that's who you are."

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,760
But you really need people who know how to deal with ethical  

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,560
puzzles to collaborate with people who are creating these products and projects.

00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,520
It has to be collaborative, even for the regulators it has to be collaborative, so that those who want to  

00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,400
regulate know what they are regulating and do it correctly and well because otherwise 

00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,000
you have companies who want to do the right  thing competing with companies who don't care.

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,720
