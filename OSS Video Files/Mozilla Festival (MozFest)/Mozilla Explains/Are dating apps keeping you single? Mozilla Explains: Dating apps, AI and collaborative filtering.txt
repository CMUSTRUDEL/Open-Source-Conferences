Hi, I m Ann Marie Carrothers, a Digital Dating Consultant and today we're going to talk about

00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,549
why dating apps could be keeping you single.

00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:20,230
Dating apps like Tinder, OKCupid and Bumble were already one of the main ways people find

00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:25,340
love today, and this trend has just been accelerated by the coronavirus pandemic.

00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:30,850
So when most clients come to me, they re asking me oh how can I make the perfect profile?

00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:32,269
What photos should I be using?

00:00:32,269 --> 00:00:38,620
Are there specific words I should be putting in my profile? And the honest truth of the

00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:47,020
matter is Tinder's algorithm gets to decide who you see, and who sees you on their app.

00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:53,110
Most people don't realize that the same kind of recommendation algorithm that uses collaborative filtering

00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:59,920
to recommend you movies on Netflix is very similar to the ones on dating apps like Tinder.

00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,820
Imagine an ice cream shop that says it has 31 flavors, but when you go into the store,

00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:07,430
it only shows you three.

00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:12,000
And it says the reason for that is that there are thousands of other customers that only

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,870
wanted these three options, and therefore you have no control over actually seeing all

00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:21,420
31 flavors based on the actions of other customers.

00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,990
This is a similar process to what happens when you're using a dating app.

00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:31,130
Within a few quick swipes, it's immediately cutting off thousands of profiles and deciding what your

00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:37,000
type is, not just by your actions but the actions of thousands of other users, limiting

00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,530
who you get to see and match with on their sites.

00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:46,470
The best advice I give my clients is to sit down and reflect on what you really want,

00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:51,840
and then make sure your dating profile reflects that as it will help you immensely in finding

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,530
