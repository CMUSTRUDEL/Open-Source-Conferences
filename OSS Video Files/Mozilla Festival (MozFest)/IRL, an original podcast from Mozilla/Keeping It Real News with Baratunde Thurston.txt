part of the reason that we are

00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:07,080
susceptible to misinformation is that

00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:09,269
these new platforms make all information

00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:12,360
look people a New York Times article

00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:14,610
looks the same as a bright bar article

00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:18,420
in the share model of a Twitter or a

00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:20,250
Facebook we have flattened years of

00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,769
distinction of quality and

00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:24,900
accountability and credibility to make

00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:26,760
everything look the same oh this is from

00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,800
an institution that's received Pulitzer

00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,470
Prizes and actually pays journalist and

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,930
has fact checkers on staff verses this

00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:36,180
was made from a content farm in another

00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:38,969
country that's been flagged three times

00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:41,219
for monetizing this information just

00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:42,580
because something says it's information

00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:53,490
doesn't make it so

00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:53,490
