being as we're hearing next from the

00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:06,600
digital Minister of Taiwan of course it

00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,340
is remote of course it is appropriate

00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,170
that she's speaking to us digitally and

00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,730
she's gonna play a video first

00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:14,099
Audrey Tang and then we'll get to have a

00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:16,199
conversation with her afterwards so um

00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:17,670
she I know she can turn and look at me

00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:19,800
but if we play him

00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:21,660
Audrey's this is very strange having a

00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:27,599
conversation with her with with a robot

00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:31,980
hi Audrey hi so let's go straight into

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:35,370
Audrey's video I like many people today

00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:38,460
I'm an optimist this strange condition

00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:41,520
began when I was 15 years old that was

00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:43,680
1996 I discovered that a future of human

00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,020
knowledge is on the web and my textbooks

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,300
are all out of date so I took my

00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:50,940
teachers I want to quit school and start

00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:53,370
my education on the web surprisingly the

00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:55,379
teachers all agree with it then founded

00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:56,879
a start-up working on web technologies

00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:59,250
and I get who joined his fabulous

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:02,190
internet community the res was this

00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:04,470
crazy idea an anarchistic no one was in

00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:07,680
control political system that powers the

00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:10,260
Internet till today today I'm Taiwan's

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,150
first digital Minister I put into

00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:15,299
practice the ideas that I learned when I

00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:18,470
was 15 years old rough consensus civic

00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:21,060
participation and radical transparency

00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:24,600
surprisingly it's working and it's

00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:27,030
transforming our society in the spirit

00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:29,369
of participation I would like to ask you

00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:58,110
is 10 minutes talk starting with the

00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:02,909
questions was the highest number of

00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:05,490
likes in 2014 it was a live demo of mass

00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:09,000
participation we occupy the Parliament

00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:10,950
for 22 days at a time the MPS in Taiwan

00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,480
were refusing to deliberate a tree

00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:13,129
service

00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,840
agreement was waiting and so the

00:02:13,129 --> 00:02:18,560
occupies got into the parliament at

00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:20,599
night and stayed there for 22 days we

00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,269
demonstrated how to deliberate a trade

00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:25,459
service agreement with a whole society

00:02:22,269 --> 00:02:27,110
there were over 20 NGOs participating

00:02:25,459 --> 00:02:29,900
the Greens the Labour is the

00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:31,519
independence everybody we supported this

00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:33,950
whole deliberation effort was a

00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,959
radically transparent broadcasting live

00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:38,180
streaming logistic system and it was

00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:41,959
powered by this community called Jeff

00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:44,690
serum gov zero is a civic tech community

00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:46,549
with a call to fork the government with

00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:49,489
a the government websites which all ends

00:02:46,549 --> 00:02:53,180
in govt 13w and make better open

00:02:49,489 --> 00:02:54,980
alternative that ends in g0v 30 EE for

00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:57,379
example the annual national budget is

00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:59,840
hundred pages long in a PDF file and

00:02:57,379 --> 00:03:02,000
it's very hard to read the Gosselaar

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,760
community's very first project was

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,319
budget of 0.8 Allu which shows the

00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:08,720
national budget in a way that everybody

00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:11,629
understands you can drill down to each

00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,579
and every budget details today this

00:03:11,629 --> 00:03:15,109
system is adopted by seven city

00:03:13,579 --> 00:03:17,180
governments and it powers the

00:03:15,109 --> 00:03:20,120
participatory budget platform for the

00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:22,340
taipei city at budget and taipei anyone

00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:24,380
can just look at his map find a part of

00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:26,569
city budget that they care and type in

00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:28,280
any question that they want to ask in a

00:03:26,569 --> 00:03:30,470
career public servant actually comes

00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:32,810
forward and answer for that part of the

00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:34,730
question so it becomes the direct

00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:36,829
dialogue platform not through the city

00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:40,639
council before the carry public servants

00:03:36,829 --> 00:03:42,620
to communicate with citizens so why are

00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:44,840
there so many Civic hackers in Taiwan

00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:47,329
like me who spoke to my clients during

00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:49,010
the Occupy movement saying okay I have

00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:52,069
to take a three week leave because

00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:54,290
democracy needs me I think it's because

00:03:52,069 --> 00:03:56,180
well I'm 36 now we're the first

00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:58,400
generation that enjoyed freedom of

00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:01,040
speech after three decades of martial

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,980
law and dictatorship now Frieden arrived

00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:06,049
in 1989 the year of personal computers

00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:08,120
so for us the personal computer

00:04:06,049 --> 00:04:10,040
revolution and freedom of speech is the

00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:13,639
same thing our first presidential

00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:14,900
election by popular vote in 1996 is also

00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:17,900
the year that the war our web got

00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:19,940
popular so internet in democracy they're

00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:22,940
not two things there's one and the same

00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:25,420
thing in Taiwan and so for the past 30

00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:27,310
years when we see free software

00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:30,790
we always think of freedom of assembly

00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:33,610
freedom of speech and never free of cost

00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:35,890
we know that freedom is never free of

00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:38,290
cost our parents generation our

00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:40,270
grandparents generation paid dearly for

00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:42,640
it and we need to use the software

00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:46,420
freedoms to keep it free as we did

00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:48,580
during the Occupy movement in 2014 an ax

00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:50,680
movement cost a revolution although a

00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:53,110
peaceful revolution there was a radical

00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:55,750
transformation of social expectations at

00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:57,790
the end of 2014 and many occupies just

00:04:55,750 --> 00:05:00,670
found himself elected mayors when they

00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:02,590
did not expect it and because of this

00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:04,930
the Prime Minister resigned and a new

00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:07,000
prime minister and engineer said okay

00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:08,800
from now on crowdsourcing and open data

00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,530
are just going to be the national

00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,540
direction so the occupiers and the Civic

00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:16,030
tech people who supported them were then

00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:19,800
invited as mentors as advisors to the

00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:23,050
public service to solve issues like uber

00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:25,870
now uber is very interesting because it

00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:27,910
is a meme a virus of the mind the mem

00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:29,890
was called sharing economy and assists

00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:31,860
the algorithms dispatch cost better than

00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:34,990
lost and so we don't have to obey laws

00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:37,060
the min spread through apps from drivers

00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:38,770
to passengers to drive us it can't

00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:40,660
really argue as a min just like you

00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:43,570
can't argue as the flu is thought in the

00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:45,700
same category as though there's protests

00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:48,160
the taxi driver surrounded a Ministry of

00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:50,020
Transport and demanding negotiation but

00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:53,050
how do we negotiate was a virus of the

00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:55,210
mind for us the solution is through a

00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:57,550
deliberation that involves thousands of

00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:59,410
stakeholders is the scaling down of the

00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:01,480
deliberation we just did with half a

00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:04,360
million people during the Occupy and so

00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:06,400
we think we can do it deliberation

00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:08,530
thinking deeply about something together

00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:11,170
is a effective vaccine against the virus

00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:13,210
of the mind and when everyone listen to

00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:15,640
each other and form a consensus we

00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:18,760
become immune to divisive PR campaigns

00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:20,770
in the future a proper deliberation with

00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:23,200
the focused conversation method involves

00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:25,300
four stages the first stage is fuck'd

00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:28,030
where we collect evidences first-hand

00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:29,740
experiences and objective data and then

00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:31,600
after that is confirmed we moved to

00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:33,730
collect everybody's feelings about us in

00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,280
facts you may feel angry I may feel

00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:37,889
happy is all okay and after people

00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:40,439
converge on their feelings

00:06:37,889 --> 00:06:42,629
with everybody we then talk about ideas

00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:44,729
the best ideas are the ones that address

00:06:42,629 --> 00:06:46,740
the most people's feelings and then we

00:06:44,729 --> 00:06:50,939
translate those ideas into legalese and

00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:52,379
sign them into decisions however if the

00:06:50,939 --> 00:06:54,389
decision-making process is not

00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:55,979
transparent people on the street would

00:06:54,389 --> 00:06:58,199
speak a different language than people

00:06:55,979 --> 00:06:59,819
in the government we need mediators we

00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:01,830
need facilitators because otherwise

00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:04,289
people are not even agreeing on basic

00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:07,800
facts let alone each other's feelings in

00:07:04,289 --> 00:07:10,439
that situation ideas become ideologies

00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,930
virus of the mind applies people to new

00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:15,719
facts and to each other's feelings and

00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:17,639
so our first step is open data that is

00:07:15,719 --> 00:07:19,469
making all the facts available not just

00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:21,750
numbers but also meeting records study

00:07:19,469 --> 00:07:23,430
analysis and ask the private sector and

00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:26,310
the civil society to share what they

00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:28,830
have next we created an interactive

00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:31,199
survey on polis to ask how people feel

00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:33,360
about as facts we send all stakeholders

00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:35,789
the POAS survey at a same time to ensure

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,860
that first group of participants four

00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:40,139
groups of people soon emerged taxi

00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:42,509
drivers uber drivers uber passengers and

00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:44,159
other passengers and the polis system

00:07:42,509 --> 00:07:45,960
shows each group how well their share

00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:48,060
sentiments are received by other groups

00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:49,919
encouraging participants to contribute

00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:52,289
other more inclusive statements that

00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:54,120
show up as majority opinions and the

00:07:52,289 --> 00:07:56,339
interesting thing is that it lowers

00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,990
people's antagonism because you can see

00:07:56,339 --> 00:07:59,399
all these people on different slides are

00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:01,080
actually your Facebook and Twitter

00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:03,539
friends you just didn't talk about this

00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:05,430
over dinner so over three weeks of time

00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:07,199
people actually converge on the sender

00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:09,180
at the beginning that people were under

00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,399
all different corners but because we say

00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:12,659
we only give binding power of anything

00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:14,849
that people can propose that can

00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:17,009
convince a super majority there's 80

00:08:14,849 --> 00:08:18,750
percent of people people compete to

00:08:17,009 --> 00:08:20,610
bring better ideas that resonate not

00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:22,740
only was like-minded people but across

00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:24,629
the aisle and after we get a set of

00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:27,029
feelings that resonance was practically

00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:28,139
everybody is now much easier for the

00:08:27,029 --> 00:08:30,330
government who meet with other

00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:32,789
stakeholders and check wisdom one by one

00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:35,010
here is the consensus of the people do

00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:37,860
you agree and if you do agree how do we

00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:39,180
translate into law Durbin to the worst

00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:41,279
that is said during the livestream

00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:43,440
consultation and so the stakeholders

00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,850
agreed when we ratified their agreements

00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,270
in August 2016

00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:50,240
everybody knew it's coming and everyone

00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:52,220
anticipated it so today goober opera is

00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,720
legally under the new framework but Sir

00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:55,340
via the taxi companies who are now

00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,650
adopting the same model there uber is

00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:59,930
using for dispatching his costs so this

00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:02,290
method works now the next question is

00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:05,270
can we scale this process of listening

00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:07,460
right after the ratification I joined

00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:09,530
the cabinet as the digital minister to

00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:12,200
explore this possibility through Pietist

00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:14,510
the public digital innovation space were

00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:16,670
like policy laps in the UK at a national

00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:18,020
level who have designers programmers and

00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:20,420
were automating away a lot of this

00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:22,130
chores of the public service we're

00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:24,230
bringing radical transparency to the

00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:26,150
cabinet by that I mean all the

00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:28,970
journalists and lobbyists get to ask me

00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:31,160
questions but I only answer publicly and

00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:33,050
it's not just to them but also for

00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:34,700
internal meetings for all the hundreds

00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:36,290
of internal meeting that I had since I

00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:38,720
was the minister everything was

00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:41,300
transcribed and published the written

00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:44,270
record was for everyone to edit for ten

00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:46,400
days and then we publish it the effect

00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:47,990
is very surprising the bureaucrats

00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:50,150
actually become very innovative and

00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:52,010
risk-taking because previously the

00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:54,470
minister gave credit if things go right

00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:56,150
but now with radical transparency if

00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:57,740
things go right they get accredit

00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:59,900
because their name was on the transcript

00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:02,150
and because this is experimental if

00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:03,530
things go wrong it's all my fault so

00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:05,390
under this condition they become

00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:08,030
innovative and open to a lot of very

00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:10,010
interesting ideas one of those ideas is

00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:11,960
adopting the same technology the free

00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:14,000
software community is using as our

00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:16,040
internal communication platform so we

00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,690
use either path we use either calc who

00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:20,180
use a common Borko weekend we used

00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:22,370
rocket chat and previously the roadblock

00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:24,980
was on cybersecurity but we were able to

00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:26,630
find assess on that I owe a community

00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:28,640
platform to solve the cybersecurity

00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:30,800
problems through sandboxing our

00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,420
cybersecurity department audits it and

00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,430
now all the free server that runs on top

00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:36,560
of it doesn't suffer from cyber security

00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:38,330
issues and we have a lot of interesting

00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,010
systems written by young public servants

00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:42,170
like an out for ordering lunch together

00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:44,930
or to plan travel together and it's

00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:47,060
really good to have this choice also we

00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:49,250
had a petition platform for people to

00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:51,560
participate online it's likely We the

00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:53,450
People platform in the u.s. it did not

00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:55,340
receive much attention because for cross

00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:56,630
ministry issues people would just get

00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:57,740
those very blank very bureaucratic

00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:59,120
answers

00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,630
it doesn't really solve their problem

00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,000
but just explains why they can't

00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:05,310
too much about it and after I become the

00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,530
digital Minister we ask each ministry to

00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:10,380
send a team at least one person to serve

00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:12,330
as participation offices we assemble

00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:14,160
this virtual team of 50 people online

00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:16,830
using rocket chat and others tour

00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,900
through our engagement so now in Taiwan

00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:20,730
when people start a petition they know

00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:22,590
that instead of just a duty for response

00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:24,660
they will actually get to meet with all

00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:26,760
the relevant ministries either in Taipei

00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:28,410
or will we travel to those rural areas

00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:31,050
and islands if they are petitioning for

00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:32,850
a local development together we'll stuff

00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:35,340
a lot of very interesting problems like

00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:37,740
this without exposing any public service

00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:40,050
to risk and so we relief their fear

00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:43,380
uncertainty and doubt around civic

00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:45,870
participation the idea is that voting

00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:47,730
and collectivism is very easy everybody

00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:50,010
can do it but there's not much bit and

00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:52,380
through open data through having

00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:54,360
interactive Q&A forums by studying up

00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:56,280
binding processes and by bringing the

00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:58,230
technology to people instead of asking

00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:00,240
people to use technology we're building

00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:03,510
a deliberation system that scales to all

00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:05,160
levels of this society as rudest were

00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:07,740
building a unified democracy not

00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:09,690
hijacked by ideologies and efficient

00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:12,300
democracy a response to the demands of

00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:14,070
the society in the empathetic democracy

00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:16,620
the less people take care of each

00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:18,870
other's feelings and we do this just by

00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:21,900
listening and building technologies that

00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:24,440
help us listen to each other thank you

00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,440
for listening

00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:34,200
[Applause]

00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,960
okay there are several questions that

00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:42,390
came in so I just want to take any one

00:12:39,960 --> 00:13:01,410
thing you particularly I feel feel that

00:12:42,390 --> 00:13:03,470
would be before joining the cabinet

00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:06,570
additional Minister I was a part of our

00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:07,780
k-12 curriculum committee and we

00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:09,520
designed it very cool

00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:11,770
for a first-time desk instead of

00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:13,870
building just skills and scores and

00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:16,000
whatever the curriculum is now you need

00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:18,520
to place autonomy from the occasion

00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,410
anatomic good esta what we call ratio

00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:23,560
base or literacy character based

00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:26,410
education system and the result is is

00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:28,900
that but we're requisitioning teachers

00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:30,940
as : with students and we're

00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:34,120
deliberately trying to let them know

00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:36,370
that it is appropriation could contain

00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:38,530
us do this on any given time mention is

00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:42,340
that if we with much more addresses all

00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:44,590
across school even team building and so

00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:46,150
that's a really big change that's going

00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:48,610
to go on in the next year or so

00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:50,230
and the classroom question does the

00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:52,930
quest great question we actually took

00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:57,270
the special budget to be fits every

00:13:52,930 --> 00:14:00,520
pigeon self school communication like

00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:05,350
300 is my mom and also enjoy that all

00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:07,180
the every two projector and thinking in

00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:09,340
mind is this death because we were going

00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:11,800
to steal other AI a lot of you know

00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:14,740
assisted learning in the next few years

00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:17,470
are rolling out to the to the classrooms

00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:20,860
it would be very difficult if the rural

00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:22,900
areas and so on so we're actually now

00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:24,610
you're talking to reality and then other

00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:27,910
technologies do much classroom together

00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:30,310
so that if kids can code this line or

00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:32,080
create projects and this is kind of a

00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:33,730
unfair advantage of Taiwan because we're

00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,680
really small and our internet

00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:37,570
penetrations like one of the highest in

00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,490
the world so it's very easy to say you

00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:41,740
know Internet broadband access is human

00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:43,390
right and then I'll just get the arrest

00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:45,370
like to prison or three percent on board

00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:48,790
so that's that's how we're helping

00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:52,710
education is that okay if I just move on

00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:52,710
until you know that time runs out and

00:14:56,339 --> 00:15:00,520
attract more technologists often the

00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:03,940
private sector it's big paycheck went

00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:06,460
out indeed I took like a I don't know my

00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:09,190
current salaries like one-fifth of what

00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:11,710
I was paid but I think it's it's worth

00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:13,570
it because above is third in paycheck

00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:16,330
level it doesn't really matter that this

00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:19,150
one and also technologists are naturally

00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:21,279
attracted to having real social impacts

00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:23,649
and so just like any other social

00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:25,329
enterprise I think the government's need

00:15:23,649 --> 00:15:27,910
to be very clear about its social

00:15:25,329 --> 00:15:30,009
mission how it does to fulfill the

00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:32,680
social mission and be very inclusive in

00:15:30,009 --> 00:15:35,769
the cross-discipline way and so I think

00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:37,600
that the key of talent retainment really

00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:39,699
is just to have everybody know what

00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,769
everybody is doing and just kind of

00:15:39,699 --> 00:15:43,149
working out loud is kind of difficult to

00:15:41,769 --> 00:15:44,889
implement a traditional workspace

00:15:43,149 --> 00:15:46,839
they're very easy if it's a digital

00:15:44,889 --> 00:15:49,300
workspace which is where I'm trying to

00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:52,240
kind of upload everybody to the digital

00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:55,149
workspace what are your thoughts on the

00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:58,509
recent election hacking I'm not quite

00:15:55,149 --> 00:16:02,439
informed on the on the whole story so I

00:15:58,509 --> 00:16:06,069
will refrain from saying anything but of

00:16:02,439 --> 00:16:07,720
course I'll say the obvious which is as

00:16:06,069 --> 00:16:10,059
much as cybersecurity is important

00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:12,160
cybersecurity out of the mind against

00:16:10,059 --> 00:16:14,050
fires of the mind is even more important

00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:16,540
this is also why we design into the

00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:18,579
curriculum not just ICT literacy but

00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:20,379
also media literacy critical thinking as

00:16:18,579 --> 00:16:23,259
part of the curricula and it's not just

00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:25,329
a two-hour class that you take it is

00:16:23,259 --> 00:16:26,620
actually well into every single field so

00:16:25,329 --> 00:16:28,120
the types where the teachers are

00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:30,329
actually co-learning with information

00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:32,410
coming from the internet and teachers

00:16:30,329 --> 00:16:35,019
critical thinking and learns it along

00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:37,480
with children I think that's really in

00:16:35,019 --> 00:16:39,399
the long-term the only way to to to win

00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:41,290
against this misinformation thing all

00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:43,389
the technological thing we do nowadays

00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:45,459
is the fact-checking and so on it may be

00:16:43,389 --> 00:16:47,410
useful in the kind of spam war you know

00:16:45,459 --> 00:16:49,209
adding a little bit of friction kind of

00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:50,889
way but in the long term it does take a

00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:52,689
critical thinking so that people won't

00:16:50,889 --> 00:16:54,939
believe things just because it's printed

00:16:52,689 --> 00:16:57,939
in some phones or spoken in some of the

00:16:54,939 --> 00:16:59,379
Rotarians the best ideas are the ones

00:16:57,939 --> 00:17:01,029
that address most people's feelings how

00:16:59,379 --> 00:17:03,790
does this approach address concern of

00:17:01,029 --> 00:17:06,100
marginalized communities well the idea

00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:08,020
is ambient computing it's assistive

00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:10,179
technology is taking the deliberation

00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:12,309
system to them right so like this

00:17:10,179 --> 00:17:14,199
Thursday I'm flying out to dip my land

00:17:12,309 --> 00:17:16,059
one of the remote islands in Taiwan

00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:18,880
because we're settling a dispute between

00:17:16,059 --> 00:17:21,280
the divers who want the Marine Park park

00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,110
to be banned in fishing and their local

00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,730
Fisher's people and now of course if we

00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:26,289
asked everybody to come online and vote

00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:28,630
and so on it would be totally

00:17:26,289 --> 00:17:30,159
inappropriate this probe disproportional

00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:32,710
but because we're bringing this whole

00:17:30,159 --> 00:17:35,169
360 camera gear this whole transcription

00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:36,369
might map everything to the people so

00:17:35,169 --> 00:17:38,169
part of people they are just speaking

00:17:36,369 --> 00:17:40,090
like they speak natural down at Town

00:17:38,169 --> 00:17:41,710
Hall and we use the principle of calm to

00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:43,749
acknowledge to make sure that just like

00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:45,399
slider everybody know what's on topic at

00:17:43,749 --> 00:17:47,590
the moment and it's just you know

00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:48,970
transfer it automatically into this life

00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:50,489
II and making sure that people inside a

00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:52,809
and every in the world can participate

00:17:50,489 --> 00:17:54,759
intelligently into this conversation so

00:17:52,809 --> 00:18:01,450
the idea is to bring text to people not

00:17:54,759 --> 00:18:04,809
to ask people to come to tech okay

00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:08,080
well so I do actually teach classes like

00:18:04,809 --> 00:18:11,080
like this one in and you know in the

00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:13,980
areas of the People's Republic of China

00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:16,389
and life Sutra nor Hangzhou and I even

00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:18,369
connected the virtual reality classrooms

00:18:16,389 --> 00:18:20,440
together with people in Kaohsiung so as

00:18:18,369 --> 00:18:22,570
long as it's digital I think and and

00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:24,549
it's open-source there really is no you

00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:25,989
know fear of conflict escalating or

00:18:24,549 --> 00:18:27,519
something so even after at the

00:18:25,989 --> 00:18:29,169
computational minister I'm very happy to

00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:30,909
share what I learned on virtual

00:18:29,169 --> 00:18:32,739
deliberations and I'll send storm and

00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:34,889
other things with people everywhere in

00:18:32,739 --> 00:18:36,999
the world including China and that's it

00:18:34,889 --> 00:18:39,330
that's great let's give her a round of

00:18:36,999 --> 00:18:39,330
applause

00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:46,259
