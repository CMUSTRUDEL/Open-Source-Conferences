hello this is the first talk I've ever

00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:12,389
given with slides so we'll see how that

00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:15,089
goes I was asked today to speak about

00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:17,160
web literacy as one of the executive

00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:19,320
directors of cache music a non-profit

00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,359
who's focused on empowering musicians on

00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,400
the web with open-source tools and

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:27,720
education this is something that I work

00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:29,609
on and think about a lot I think

00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,489
oftentimes we think about web literacy

00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:35,270
we think about things like skills

00:00:32,489 --> 00:00:37,250
learning skills building on the web

00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:39,719
understanding of how the internet works

00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:42,899
all of which is very important but

00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:44,219
doesn't speak to why the web works like

00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:48,270
it does

00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:50,340
I think it's deeply important that we

00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:52,230
add a working knowledge of business and

00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:55,129
business models to what it means to be

00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:57,270
web literate the sites that we use

00:00:55,129 --> 00:00:59,070
there's big money behind them and

00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:01,980
there's even bigger profit motives in

00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:04,589
front of them we need to be able to

00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:07,860
think critically about where we build

00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:11,220
our communities about what they're doing

00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:15,570
with our data and about when not if they

00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:17,430
monetize us so I apologize for the

00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:20,970
swearing I'll try not to do it very much

00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:23,810
it's naturally this happens but I came

00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:28,380
into the music industry as a musician

00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:29,970
about 25 years ago I started at an

00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:32,759
independent record label based in

00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:35,220
Olympia Washington in the 90s that's

00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:36,509
important because we were doing

00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,250
something that we believed was very

00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:40,799
political we were trying to build

00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:43,020
business models outside of the corporate

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:47,070
structure outside of the major label

00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:49,290
worlds we believed it was important to

00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:51,840
put artists first to make artists our

00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:54,570
partners in order to ensure that other

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,869
voices were heard other than just what

00:01:54,570 --> 00:02:00,390
the corporate structure wanted to hear

00:01:56,869 --> 00:02:01,560
so I came into this industry thinking

00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:04,649
about business business models

00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,210
politically and I've never stopped it

00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:08,929
also means that I had a front-row seat

00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:11,060
to the dawn of the digital era

00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:13,849
and saw all these destruction that

00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:16,459
ensued it effects artists lives

00:02:13,849 --> 00:02:18,950
livelihoods and it still does I have

00:02:16,459 --> 00:02:21,019
seen literally hundreds if not thousands

00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:23,030
of music tech startups come and go in

00:02:21,019 --> 00:02:25,400
that time period they have all told me

00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:27,109
they were the future of music I have

00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:30,760
watched as freemium models have become

00:02:27,109 --> 00:02:33,769
premium ones and I've seen artists build

00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:35,870
communities on closed platforms only to

00:02:33,769 --> 00:02:37,489
watch those platforms implode and then

00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:42,439
watch them go on to the next closed

00:02:37,489 --> 00:02:44,389
platform if anyone here uses a Facebook

00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:47,419
page at all for any sort of promotion

00:02:44,389 --> 00:02:49,159
events promotion project promotion that

00:02:47,419 --> 00:02:51,079
you know that you don't have access to

00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:55,010
your audience they control that

00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:57,530
relationship not you I've also seen

00:02:55,010 --> 00:03:00,950
artists embrace the open web and try new

00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:02,389
business models they are innovators at

00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:04,790
the core of what they do and when

00:03:02,389 --> 00:03:05,989
they're not scared of the internet kind

00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:09,019
of brilliant things can happen

00:03:05,989 --> 00:03:11,930
so one of the founders of cached music

00:03:09,019 --> 00:03:14,120
is an artist named Kristen Hirsch she

00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:17,930
was in abandoned the 90s called throwing

00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:20,930
muses and she built up a very strong

00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:22,879
core audience of supporters she wanted

00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:25,549
to figure out a way to then let them

00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:27,199
support her directly so nine years ago

00:03:25,549 --> 00:03:29,120
she built the very first subscription

00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:31,579
service it was the first tool that cash

00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:35,000
built it's how she makes her living to

00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:37,940
this day she is able to release records

00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:42,590
to own her own copyrights to go on tour

00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:45,109
all under her own control which is

00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:49,099
massively inspiring she was also the

00:03:45,109 --> 00:03:50,299
first artist to sell mp3s directly we've

00:03:49,099 --> 00:03:52,220
also worked with folks like run the

00:03:50,299 --> 00:03:55,400
jewels who have given away their first

00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:57,109
two records for free to their fans they

00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,639
become one of the most influential rap

00:03:57,109 --> 00:04:00,459
groups in the world for a variety of

00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:03,319
reasons but I think it's really

00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:05,389
important to look at how they

00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:09,829
distributed their music to their fans it

00:04:05,389 --> 00:04:11,329
shows a level of respect kind of like in

00:04:09,829 --> 00:04:13,340
another you know you trust that your

00:04:11,329 --> 00:04:15,650
fans are there for you and they are all

00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:18,320
they do is ask for an email address in

00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:20,960
exchange for a download of a free record

00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,700
they do not exploit that email

00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:24,800
they only use it when they're going on

00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:27,350
tour or they have a new album or they

00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:30,490
have new merchandise and their fans are

00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:33,320
very happy to support them

00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:36,710
musicians are leaders if you think of

00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:39,290
any cultural movement throughout history

00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:42,590
they're sort of at the forefront think

00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:45,530
about the civil rights movement think

00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:48,470
about the anti-war movement third wave

00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:50,780
feminism second wave feminism frankly

00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:54,710
there are always a song and a musician

00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:56,950
and music is at the core of it you know

00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:59,390
think of Bob Dylan's masters of war or

00:04:56,950 --> 00:05:03,310
Sam Cooke's it changes is going to come

00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:05,960
or Public Enemy's fight the power

00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:08,720
musicians are also leaders online they

00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:11,180
drive a lot of traffic if you look at

00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:15,220
the top followed accounts on Instagram

00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:18,190
and Twitter 75% of them are musicians

00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:21,260
musicians and music got us to torrent

00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:24,680
torrents are terrible it's a terrible UX

00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:28,730
and people wanted music so badly they

00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:30,710
learned how to do this so the internet

00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:34,550
this place of immense possibility and

00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:36,560
freedom is closing we are seeing users

00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:38,180
go for the easiest to use services

00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,510
without a second thought to their

00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:42,770
privacy their data or the long-term

00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:44,750
effects of where they're building their

00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:50,180
communities online or their businesses

00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:52,490
online PC funding has led to his

00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:55,070
obsession with scale but here's the

00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:57,860
thing not all business scales not all

00:05:55,070 --> 00:06:01,820
art scales scale is a shitty measure of

00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:03,470
impact scale means that everything has

00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:05,360
to get bigger and bigger and bigger and

00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:07,340
bigger and bigger and if we demand that

00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:11,950
of the web we're going to miss out on

00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:11,950
small changes that actually change lives

00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:20,300
sorry I didn't make the slides that

00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:23,630
they're cracking me up so we see these

00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:25,940
companies these startups they begin in

00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:28,490
this giant hole there's this deficit

00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:31,940
that they have to make up and so often

00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:33,620
they don't we see over and over again

00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:35,690
either by acquisition or

00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:39,310
Loden the largest corporations in the

00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:41,540
world taking control of these new ideas

00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:44,360
I've been working on this chart actually

00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:46,580
and I wish it was done right now but

00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:49,520
it's a very easy way to see you know

00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:51,410
maybe the top 20 music tech companies

00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,960
and then where they've been siloed into

00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:55,940
you know it's top spin went to Apple its

00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,560
band page went to Spotify and then to

00:06:55,940 --> 00:07:00,520
YouTube it's it's just watching

00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:06,470
everything go into these very small

00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:08,180
consolidated silos so we're gonna talk

00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:10,310
about Spotify and I don't want to talk

00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:12,470
about whether or not streaming is

00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:14,449
profitable for artists that's a totally

00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:16,760
different conversation what we need to

00:07:14,449 --> 00:07:19,789
talk about is is Spotify part of

00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:22,610
profitable at all as a business they

00:07:19,789 --> 00:07:26,240
have posted exactly one profitable

00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:30,440
quarter in one territory ever it was

00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:33,470
2014 in the UK they recently took on

00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:35,240
another billion dollars in debt meaning

00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:37,070
that they are now two billion dollars in

00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:39,530
debt and they are talking about

00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:42,650
acquiring another in debt music text

00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:43,780
service SoundCloud so let's think about

00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:47,150
that for a second

00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:50,300
we know that Spotify has to pay out 70%

00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:52,460
of all income to shareholders I mean -

00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:54,680
excuse me - rights holders

00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:57,200
so that's record labels that's

00:07:54,680 --> 00:08:01,910
distributors occasionally that's artists

00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:05,570
directly not very often with Spotify but

00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:08,210
70% just goes out we also know that in

00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:10,300
order to get a licensing deal in the

00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:12,919
United States they were asked to give

00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:14,240
equity to the major labels that is an

00:08:12,919 --> 00:08:16,340
undisclosed amount we don't know how

00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,110
much it is but it's something that major

00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:20,690
labels take in and they do not have to

00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:22,370
share with their artists so we're

00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:24,979
looking at Spotify having to pay back

00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:27,440
two billion dollars in debt on less than

00:08:24,979 --> 00:08:30,590
30% of all of their income as well as

00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:33,110
pay for all of their overhead doesn't

00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:35,180
really seem likely you know we've seen

00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:36,890
our do lose in this space there are

00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:39,560
rumors that title is going to be

00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:42,620
acquired by Apple next week that could

00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:45,410
be Google you never know but I think

00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:47,420
what we're seeing is that streaming is a

00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:49,730
business that's only going to work

00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:52,130
for people that are trying to sell you

00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:55,640
other things for people that are trying

00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:59,600
to sell you phones are trying to mine

00:08:55,640 --> 00:09:02,470
all of your data and that's a problem

00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:06,400
music is too important for that I think

00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:09,110
when you put so much corporate control

00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:11,090
into what we're listening to you're

00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:13,220
going to miss out on voices you're going

00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:15,680
to miss out on really important voices

00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:19,790
if you don't think corporate structures

00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:21,710
are going to censor what we listen to

00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:23,210
and what we discover and how we find

00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:26,500
things then you're not paying attention

00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:31,280
that is what will happen

00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:33,770
so music connects us in ways that almost

00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:36,740
nothing else does it's the universal

00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:39,800
language it connects people across

00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:43,070
physical barriers societal ones mental

00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:45,550
ones it is the way that we can truly

00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:48,590
find empathy with one another

00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:50,990
it also has power it gives voice to the

00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:55,790
voiceless it gives hope to the hopeless

00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:58,610
and if we do not have a variety of

00:09:55,790 --> 00:10:02,740
voices out there being listened to and

00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:02,740
being heard then we're all missing out

00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:10,940
so I know we're all overwhelmed we're

00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:14,450
all oversaturated we're all overworked

00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:18,260
and it's hard to really think about

00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:21,380
these things but we must you know we're

00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:23,420
all inundated with clickbait and with

00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:31,010
this never ending election cycle and

00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:34,160
with social media but it is vital that

00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:37,700
we think about where we're building our

00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:39,800
communities online how we're building

00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:42,380
them and what the long-term effects are

00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:45,200
we talked about the open web like it's a

00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:47,860
code problem it's a culture problem if

00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:50,420
we had artists embracing the open web

00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:52,010
understanding what it means talking to

00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:57,710
their fans about it

00:10:52,010 --> 00:11:00,050
we could really see big changes we need

00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:04,310
cultural leaders to continue to lead us

00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:13,370
on this path to the open web oh wait I

00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:22,340
forgot those things there you go okay

00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:22,760
that's a question for Maggie let me jump

00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,980
in there

00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:26,720
and and ask you a question so we were

00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:28,370
talking kind of just before about you

00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,660
know the what this means kind of for the

00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:31,130
music industry as a whole what do you

00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:32,990
what do you see happening the next kind

00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:40,850
of couple of years etc from your vantage

00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:42,950
point I see people getting less and less

00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:44,780
scared of the web which is something

00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:46,100
that needs to happen I also see artists

00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:48,410
getting more and more in control of

00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:50,030
their careers there's no reason why

00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:51,860
anyone should ever sign a contract in

00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:55,430
perpetuity ever again

00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:57,350
you have control and power and while I'm

00:11:55,430 --> 00:12:00,020
not gonna say that labels are a bad

00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:02,270
thing I worked at one for 17 years I can

00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:03,860
see that they have real power but

00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:06,170
understanding what that relationship is

00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:08,150
how those contracts look and ultimately

00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:12,230
keeping your copyright and the rights to

00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:13,490
your own art are vital optimistic

00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:17,630
thought oh we do have a question in the

00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:19,730
front hello you didn't talk so much

00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:21,740
about what cash music does oh yeah I

00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:24,470
know a little bit about your model it

00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:26,300
will be able to scale up to an extent

00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:32,090
that it can make a difference to this

00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:33,770
problem you described yes I do so I can

00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:36,800
give a brief overview of cash we're a

00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:38,450
non-profit we build open source digital

00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,370
tools so we everything from a shopping

00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:41,610
cart to subscription service to to or

00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:43,380
date management

00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:46,170
anything that an artist would need to

00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:48,089
connect directly with their fans we have

00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:50,760
a hosted version and a distributed

00:12:48,089 --> 00:12:53,519
version but what we we truly try to do

00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:56,070
is tell artists to make their website

00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:59,160
the central focal point for their

00:12:56,070 --> 00:13:01,950
interactions which sounds crazy but it's

00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:04,140
true and then we pair that with

00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:06,870
education so we've been doing education

00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:08,339
within the platform with those tools but

00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:11,250
recently just launched a publication

00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:13,370
called watt that is dedicated to talking

00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:16,110
about the economic and health and

00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:17,940
technology issues that face artists so

00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:21,540
we've done a lot of how-to is just

00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:23,100
explaining copyright and Trademark you

00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:24,690
know why you need to set up your your

00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,829
your band as a business that sort of

00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:27,750
thing but we've also had a lot of

00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:29,160
first-person artist stories about things

00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:31,079
that have worked for them or not worked

00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:34,500
for them and we're moving into research

00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:36,329
in case studies as well but yeah I mean

00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:38,760
the thing about cash is we don't

00:13:36,329 --> 00:13:40,890
actually need to scale I know that

00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:42,810
sounds crazy but it's we're three and a

00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:46,470
half people we've been around for nearly

00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:48,360
ten years and we built hundreds of

00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:51,899
projects directly with artists to make

00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:53,220
sure that the tools work for them that

00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:55,230
is one of the things and one of the

00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:58,230
problems I see with technology is that

00:13:55,230 --> 00:14:01,260
so often companies start up and think

00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:04,740
they have some kind of answer to a

00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:06,300
problem it doesn't exist and we do this

00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:09,300
flipside of that we're building

00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:12,380
solutions to problems that are there all

00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:12,380
right let's take Mikey

00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:17,470
