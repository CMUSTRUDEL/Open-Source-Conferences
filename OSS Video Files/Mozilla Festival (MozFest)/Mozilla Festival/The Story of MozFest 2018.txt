Title: The Story of MozFest 2018
Publication date: 2019-03-11
Playlist: Mozilla Festival
Description: 
	While MozFest weekend is over, of course the projects and ideas go on… and on and on. You can continue to explore the sessions you loved — and those you missed — on Guidebook and GitHub, where you may find facilitators have posted session documentation. Even if you weren’t at the festival, feel free to dive in, research ideas that resonate, and reach to to session facilitators and project leads.

The MozFest spirit of welcoming, openness, and collaboration doesn’t end with the Festival — we’ll bring it with us as we continue to work toward a healthier internet, together.
