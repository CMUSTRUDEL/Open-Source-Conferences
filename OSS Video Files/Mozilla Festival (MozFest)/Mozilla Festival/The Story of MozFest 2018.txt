Title: The Story of MozFest 2018
Publication date: 2019-03-11
Playlist: Mozilla Festival
Description: 
	While MozFest weekend is over, of course the projects and ideas go on… and on and on. You can continue to explore the sessions you loved — and those you missed — on Guidebook and GitHub, where you may find facilitators have posted session documentation. Even if you weren’t at the festival, feel free to dive in, research ideas that resonate, and reach to to session facilitators and project leads.

The MozFest spirit of welcoming, openness, and collaboration doesn’t end with the Festival — we’ll bring it with us as we continue to work toward a healthier internet, together.

my favorite thing about the Internet is

00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:16,080
its creative potential and the fact that

00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:18,510
I can talk to my mom and dad for free

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,970
the cat videos the openness and the

00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:23,130
potential for inclusion meet new people

00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:29,070
and actually connect with friends all

00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:30,630
across the world I'm a little concerned

00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,769
with like people tracking what I'm doing

00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:33,780
online and where I'm going

00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:35,190
my biggest worry about the Internet is

00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,930
that it's going to be incredibly boring

00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:37,680
the Internet is just becoming in a

00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,690
shopping mall

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,399
the amount of data we share about what

00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:44,040
are we doing about who we are or what we

00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:45,420
think harassment hurt harm those are the

00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,960
things that I worry about when I worry

00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,960
about the Internet

00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:14,849
[Music]

00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:32,739
[Music]

00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:38,490
the future that I would like for the

00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:39,990
Internet is a place of co-creation that

00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:43,040
it's a place that has been designed by

00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:43,040
everyone for everyone

00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:50,540
I use art and code to critique data

00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:53,160
tracking on the Internet

00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:54,750
but using art to manipulate the internet

00:01:53,160 --> 00:02:02,100
we can teach machines the other nests

00:01:54,750 --> 00:02:04,320
and complexity of our lives working to

00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:07,310
teach youth the web lers to skills they

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,450
need to have their best online lives

00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:10,890
it's been pretty incredible we've got a

00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:12,450
seven year old just behind me that's

00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:13,560
running a session he's been demoted for

00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:16,470
five years and it's now Ronnie's own

00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,300
session giving back I'm working to

00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:24,360
spotlight promising approaches to making

00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:26,340
the internet healthier I'm working to

00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,400
bring the values of openness and

00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:31,190
community to academic research

00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,290
[Music]

00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:34,860
I'm working for an Internet that treats

00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:37,230
people's data respectfully

00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:39,360
[Music]

00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:40,800
I'm working to make sure that the things

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:46,260
that are most precious to you are

00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:47,970
preserved on the web forever I'm hoping

00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,730
for a man tonight lettuce kind warm and

00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:59,140
welcoming

00:02:48,730 --> 00:03:01,200
