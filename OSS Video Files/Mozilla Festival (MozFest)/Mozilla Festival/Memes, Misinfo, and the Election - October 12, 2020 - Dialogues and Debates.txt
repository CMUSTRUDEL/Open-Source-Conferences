Title: Memes, Misinfo, and the Election - October 12, 2020 - Dialogues and Debates
Publication date: 2020-10-13
Playlist: Mozilla Festival
Description: 
	The most trenchant political messaging is no longer dispatched through pamphlets, newspapers, or blogs — it’s dispatched through memes.

These seemingly simple creations can be wildly influential: Anyone can make them, they spread at gigabit speed, and they tug at our emotions. Memes can also be pernicious: Ahead of a watershed U.S. election, they can spread misinformation about the candidates, the pandemic, and all issues gripping the American public.

What sort of election memes are proliferating on platforms right now? What’s the science behind a viral meme? And can they really influence the outcome of a national election?

On Tuesday, October 13, Mozilla will host a virtual MozFest Dialogues & Debates to explore these questions and others. Audience members are able to submit their questions ahead of time by tweeting @mozilla with the hashtag #DialoguesAndDebates.


Our 40-minute panel will feature:


Dr. Joan Donovan is the Research Director of the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy. Dr. Donovan leads the field in examining internet and technology studies, online extremism, media manipulation, and disinformation campaigns.

Dr. Donovan leads The Technology and Social Change Project (TaSC). TaSC explores how media manipulation is a means to control public conversation, derail democracy, and disrupt society. TaSC conducts research, develops methods, and facilitates workshops for journalists, policy makers, technologists, and civil society organizations on how to detect, document, and debunk media manipulation campaigns.

thank you yeah this is a this is a great

00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,159
day we all uh admitted that we were all

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,200
in sweatpants and pajama bottoms and

00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,720
basketball shorts

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,400
so i'm glad we're all on the same

00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,960
wavelength there

00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,560
um yeah i want to start with you because

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,640
i want to kind of give everybody a

00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,960
baseline level of understanding

00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,479
uh what and this is a tough question so

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,840
i hope you're ready for it

00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:27,520
uh here we go what is a meme

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,360
um yeah what does it mean there are so

00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,479
many definitions of what a meme is uh

00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,320
and it's weird because

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,079
we all see memes every day right i'm

00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,720
assuming everybody who's on this call

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,920
has seen uh a meme because you're you're

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,560
sort of part of that culture

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,600
um and so there's like this functional

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,880
definition

00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:47,119
that's like um a memes like any idea

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,000
that spreads from person to person or no

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:50,320
to node within

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
a network or within a platform uh

00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,040
sometimes a jump platform so like the

00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,079
image that you keep on seeing on

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,560
instagram

00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,920
or like a gif on reddit or a particular

00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,479
sound on tick tock

00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,680
like those are um when you see other

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,320
people going in and doing their own

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,759
versions of

00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,960
it those are memes and that's the

00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,560
interesting part about them is that

00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,479
anybody can take those memes

00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,160
and make their own version to make it

00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,680
more relevant to the people that they're

00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:15,760
actually sharing it with

00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:17,920
and um we can add one more thing to this

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,920
definition of memes which is mine and

00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,480
probably very disputable

00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,520
is that means at scale are really really

00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,640
fascinating because

00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,080
that's when you start to see that

00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,120
they're this like emergent form of

00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,520
communication

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,400
um it's culture it's more than just the

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,879
content

00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,560
and uh they only make sense within the

00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,959
communities that they're shared within

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,560
and that gives it a different feel than

00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,560
other types of media that we've

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,080
dealt with in the past that's a great

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,200
explanation um and i want to throw it to

00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,360
dr donovan

00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,280
i should mention also so dr donovan gave

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:51,200
me permission to call her dr

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:54,400
j throughout this panel so i may be uh

00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:57,040
only me i i appreciate that so dr j

00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,680
uh what what is it about the meme format

00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,080
that is

00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,680
so good at spreading ideas because i

00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,599
don't know if the intention is always to

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,200
spread an idea but they kind of go viral

00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:07,760
in the ways that other

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,280
types of images don't uh so what is it

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,560
about memes that make it so good at

00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,200
spreading ideas especially when it comes

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,879
to

00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:17,040
controversial or extreme political ideas

00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,480
yeah so thank you for having me a big

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,680
big fan of mozart

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:25,200
i wish we could all be at mozfest uh and

00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:28,319
uh excited to talk with my co-panelists

00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:31,680
so what what makes a meme a meme

00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,640
so one of the significant ways that we

00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,560
can

00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,159
okay so not everything that goes online

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,840
is right

00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,440
but sometimes people just kind of use

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,599
this as a blanket

00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,280
term but we try to look at four key

00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:46,799
qualities of

00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,720
memetic communication one is that means

00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,360
memes don't tend to have an author or a

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,040
brand they're relatively anonymous

00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,959
uh the second thing is they're really

00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,239
communing for people that are already

00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,040
part of an in-group

00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:01,120
and they tend to reinforce those bonds

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,599
so if you see a meme and you just don't

00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,519
get it

00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,519
it's because the meme wasn't made for

00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,159
you um

00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,000
and so this is why something like pepe

00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:12,080
can be a bit of a trickster

00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,599
in the sense that if you understand him

00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,000
in certain texts

00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:17,680
uh he's this liberation figure

00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,400
liberatory figure

00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,000
um but in other contexts he's just this

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,120
uh

00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,520
sneering smug figure that is associated

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,759
with

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,440
uh most prominently probably us white

00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:32,560
supremacists but

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:35,600
uh you know but for some time it was

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:38,880
that was not the case but by and large

00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,880
memes uh resonate with insiders

00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,639
the third feature is that they're sticky

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,639
which is to say that they have this kind

00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:47,360
of slogan attached to them

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,560
or there's something about the twist in

00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,600
the meme

00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,280
that uh it feels like it

00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,440
not just resonates with you but it

00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,479
sticks with you and so

00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:01,600
uh a meme that's been circulating lately

00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:02,560
cheese to meet you is a kind of pepe

00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,120
version of a

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,680
it's a mouse that looks like pepe and

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,039
it's

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,360
something that people might use when

00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,320
they are using an imposter account they

00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,080
just kind of come back

00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,680
on the platform and are like cheese to

00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,199
meet you

00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,960
did you have any affiliation with that

00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,720
meme i know you're mr cheese

00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,000
uh absolutely not it's a complete

00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,479
coincidence however

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,320
uh who knows what's gonna happen but

00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:26,240
it's you know it's funny and it gets the

00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,759
point across and if you get it you get

00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,600
it and if you don't you're just like

00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,880
what why would

00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,000
a green mouse be saying this it doesn't

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,000
make any sense

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,520
um and then they're participatory which

00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,120
is the sense of like

00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,360
you can remix them there's something

00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,639
about them where the template

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:48,400
or the picture uh you can quickly

00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:51,320
swap in and out different slogans or

00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,880
tweak some of the imagery and that

00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:55,280
participatoryness is where

00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,720
we end up in politics and uh i'll leave

00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,800
it at that

00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,960
no yeah that's a really good definition

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:04,080
so i want to throw it to brandy now and

00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,919
what i asked uh randy to do is

00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,080
you know kind of play show and tell with

00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:11,680
us kind of uh show us

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:14,080
a meme or memes that are misleading

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,919
uh and also election related that you

00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,240
you felt kind of stuck with you

00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:19,680
uh and hoping for you to show us that

00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,639
and also tell us why

00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,000
you thought it was memorable yeah so

00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:27,280
i've been looking

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,080
a lot at memes and

00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,479
political messaging um done made by sort

00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,319
of

00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,080
digital soldiers they're calling

00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:37,280
themselves on the right

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,880
and so one one genre that was really big

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,840
or has been really big and continues to

00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,479
be really big

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,560
is the mail-in voting misinformation

00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:46,240
that mail-in voting is somehow

00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,400
unreliable

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,840
that you know there's rampant voter

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,840
fraud or that there's a

00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,960
rampant mail dumping those kind of

00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,319
things so the first

00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,400
i picked two in the genre because

00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,160
usually um the memes

00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,599
whatever genre it is have two sides so

00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,000
we have the one from the far right

00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,680
spreading this disinformation and then

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,880
we have like the sort of progressive

00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,759
response so

00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,800
the first one is um it's from tick tock

00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:12,479
and you can see

00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:14,880
it's this um this man and he is

00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:16,319
sort of seeding distrust in with mail

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,720
mail-in voting and his

00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,840
he says you know the text says you know

00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,560
something about like if you

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,560
had a lottery ticket would you mail in

00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:28,160
the winning lottery ticket why not

00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,759
and so that is the prior knowledge is

00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,440
activated in terms of like

00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,440
we've seen president trump sort of

00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,120
seeding this idea that you can't trust

00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,960
male and voting for the last you know

00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,919
several years the rigged narrative he's

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,759
been carrying

00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:41,520
um across you know since the apprentice

00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,520
didn't win an emmy so that's a favorite

00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:47,120
of his that's tapped into here

00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:49,599
and um it's and this guy he is sort of a

00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,879
medium influencer um on the right on

00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:53,199
tick tock but this one

00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,479
really got him somebody got like tons of

00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,800
likes um

00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,240
and tons of shares so that was a real

00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,240
success and you'll see like

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,240
like you know dr donovan was saying how

00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,000
it sort of gets reinterpreted and

00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,599
changed we see a lot of those just

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,120
bare text um laid over you know a

00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,960
normal background saying you know if you

00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,000
had the winning powerball ticket would

00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,039
you mail it in why or why

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,639
not and so if you get that then

00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,319
it's sort of like it's just a feeling

00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,000
there's no like fact checking that meme

00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:23,120
right which is why it's really powerful

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,240
you can't say like you can only react um

00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,879
and so that's why that's a really good

00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,599
one and then in response to all of the

00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,960
um disparagement of the the postal

00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,959
service and mail-in voting

00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,560
there was a sort of reaction by the

00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:37,360
progressive left

00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,479
which was sort of a love of the postal

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,760
service so you can see

00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,959
this one um was a fan cam of a male

00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,279
worker a

00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:46,320
delivery person and it was just really

00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:48,800
great

00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,160
it's really fun and silly and cute and

00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:54,160
taps into that

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:55,680
k-pop fan cam genre which is really fun

00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,640
and what's fun about this one too

00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,160
is and interesting and you know uh

00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,600
kenyatta and joan can talk about it

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,080
better than i can but the lincoln

00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,360
project

00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:07,680
stole that meme and put a safe for work

00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,600
uh soundtrack on it and uh sort of

00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,680
sanitized a little bit and pushed it out

00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,640
without a tribute attribution to the

00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,880
original

00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,000
um creator which caused a whole another

00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,160
stir as in who

00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,519
is allowed to repurpose memes and who

00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,480
who is allowed to be part of the

00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,680
community

00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:26,240
can you know sort of a big money-making

00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,880
political organization steal a meme um

00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,000
and and

00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,440
that was a really interesting

00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,800
conversation so those are the two i'm

00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,800
looking at there's a whole

00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,839
bunch of other ones in the genre but uh

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,440
there you go

00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,120
wow yeah i do remember seeing that fan

00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,920
cam usps ad

00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,560
or not just video online uh but i want

00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,480
to kind of

00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,600
focus in on one thing you said earlier

00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,120
about trump

00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,800
kind of having a narrative and then the

00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,720
internet running with it last time we

00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,640
spoke you were talking about the kind of

00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,720
snowball effect that happens where trump

00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,000
has a narrative uh people online feed

00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,880
into it and then kind of build on that

00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,560
narrative and then

00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,320
the cycle continues can you talk about

00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:01,200
that a little bit

00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,800
yeah so again i really think that the

00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,040
word digital soldiers which is what q

00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,720
and

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,720
people call themselves really sticks

00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,720
with me because they get marching orders

00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,000
from president trump and there's a

00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,839
narrative that's seated

00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,680
and then they take that narrative and

00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,720
they create a bunch of content

00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,560
and then that content and local news

00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,200
sort of um maybe a local news story

00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:24,560
about mail dumping turned into a meme

00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:27,760
uh in a miss in a way that misinforms

00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:30,399
will then be make it to you know

00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:32,160
gateway pundit or other far far right

00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,519
websites junk news sites and then we'll

00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,079
make their way through

00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,800
you know talk radio and fox news and

00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,880
then back

00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,320
through kaylee and you know in front of

00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,399
the white house lectern so

00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,079
it really is it's a big feedback loop

00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,360
and it's not always like this easy to

00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:48,640
follow cycle because

00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,560
they feed off each other and they create

00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,000
um narrative and content that again

00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:55,120
feeds each other and it's just

00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,120
it's very messy

00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,720
yeah i i mean i think messi is the way

00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,720
it's really good friction describe it

00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,399
yeah um one thing i should mention at

00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,560
the top of the show is that

00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,240
if you want to tweet questions at us

00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,880
you're able to do that so if you tweet

00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,399
at mozilla using the hashtag hashtag

00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,920
dialogues and debates

00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,440
you're able to send questions our way

00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:18,399
and we can answer them live

00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,839
um so i want to throw back to kenyatta

00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,720
i'll go back to mr cheese

00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:24,640
so who did not start that cheese uh meme

00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,640
um

00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,480
when for me i remember when memes were

00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,760
just like funny and just wholesome and

00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,240
just like

00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,959
you know just like when did memes go

00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,440
from

00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:37,760
uh just advice animals and funny jokes

00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:41,279
to we're ruining democracy

00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:44,800
what did that shift happen well um

00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:47,839
i i think it's always been here i've um

00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,200
you know this is there's a uh long

00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:52,399
before i was doing this meme stuff

00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:55,040
um i'm black and chinese and so as a kid

00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:55,760
i remember hearing the same like racist

00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,399
joke

00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:00,800
over and over again but the setup would

00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,560
change based on like who was like saying

00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,360
to me and whoever they thought i was

00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,480
that day

00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,000
like if they thought it was black if

00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,040
they thought i was chinese then then

00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,160
like all of a sudden

00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:12,959
like bits of it would would morph right

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,000
um i think this kind of weaponized

00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,760
content

00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,040
has always been here it's been here long

00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,800
before any of us

00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,959
and what the internet has done is sort

00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:24,560
of made weaponized content

00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:26,000
more widely available there's uh we're

00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,720
uh i was thinking the other day about

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,800
how

00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,399
much the rise of web 2.0 kind of plays

00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,200
into this right it was a combination of

00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,320
like

00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:37,600
large search engine engines um

00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:41,360
like massive social media platforms and

00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:44,720
broadband that made all this possible

00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,839
right in that sense i i i think it's

00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,839
hard to

00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,360
maybe say that means we're necessarily

00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:51,120
weaponized i think the network itself is

00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,360
what's been weaponized

00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,240
yeah um that reminds me well i want to

00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,160
get dr j

00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,320
uh in on this conversation as well but

00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,079
uh before that you know brandy

00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,000
brought a really good point when we

00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:04,000
spoke last about the idea of

00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,839
recommendation engines kind of feeding

00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,880
into this can can you talk about that a

00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:10,240
little bit brandi

00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:13,360
how yeah yeah i mean well

00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:15,920
people so memes spread within groups

00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,560
a lot and so a big thing that you know

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,880
we

00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,079
sort of follow is is how these memes

00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,760
spread within

00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:24,160
a group whether it's an anti-vaccination

00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,639
group or save the children slash

00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,360
q anon's new brand group or whatever it

00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,480
is um

00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:32,240
or so like um part of that

00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,680
like i think the wall street journal

00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,600
said something like 67

00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,959
of extremists group according to one

00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:40,000
internal facebook audit

00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:41,279
um 67 of those um users that joined

00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,800
extremist groups were brought there by

00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,240
the recommendation machine

00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,920
the recommendation engine which we don't

00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:49,120
know how it works they won't tell us

00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,480
who knows uh what we do know is that you

00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,959
know

00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,800
we're seeing either either groups that

00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,519
sort of trade and these disinformation

00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,160
memes

00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:59,279
um are sort of thriving and growing and

00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,720
and if people get there by

00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:03,519
recommendation

00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,279
i think you know and that that's bad

00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,440
right like that that's a bad thing

00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,560
i think uh you know dr donovan and i

00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,279
have talked a lot about this actually

00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,880
because i'm a

00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:14,480
former librarian and you know

00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,760
the way that libraries work and a lot of

00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,680
people yell at me like you want

00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,079
censorship you're a librarian it's like

00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,839
well

00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:21,120
when i worked at the library you know if

00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,279
someone came in and said

00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,320
i want to check out mineconf yeah i'll

00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,839
probably give

00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,519
here i have that i'll find it for you

00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:27,920
i'll here is that information that you

00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,399
wanted

00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,519
what we're not gonna do and what it's

00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,839
what the recommendation

00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,560
machine is like to me is set up some

00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,480
sort of

00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,920
you know display case in the front

00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,440
saying here

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,040
you're going to love mineconf come take

00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,839
a look or if someone asks me for my

00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,600
confidence

00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,800
oh yeah we got that by the way if you

00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,760
love mineconf you're gonna love the

00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,040
turner diaries

00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,240
and if you love the turner diaries

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,399
you're gonna love these guys come on

00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,760
they're in the back um like and so i'm

00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,600
you know have organized with these

00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,199
people make them your people

00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,360
like it's just there's a difference

00:14:55,199 --> 00:15:00,480
between providing

00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,959
access to and amplifying and pushing

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,360
people

00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:05,279
into and that's what platforms have

00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,360
consistently done whether it's youtube

00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,639
um still recommends you know the worst

00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,279
of the worst videos

00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,800
um and the same thing like and facebook

00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,399
has done this as well with groups even

00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,800
though they say they're going to stop so

00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,519
for me that's that's a big part of how

00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,040
people see

00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,880
the memes that we're even talking about

00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:23,120
is because they're you know pushed

00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,480
into these groups where these memes are

00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,839
bound

00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,600
and yeah i mean that's such a good point

00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:28,880
uh go ahead go ahead please well let's

00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,399
say one of the things that and i think

00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,959
is absolutely fascinating about this is

00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,480
that

00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,240
um the more that we see how

00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,160
recommendations work and the more that

00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,440
other people users see how they work we

00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,360
start to change

00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,360
make changes in our behavior in order to

00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,720
make uh this stuff more accessible

00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,880
you're not gonna maybe you don't

00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,639
recommend mineconf but maybe you start

00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,320
off as a pinterest blog

00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,680
right or you start off as an instagram

00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,639
account that's like just pushing an

00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,560
aesthetic

00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,759
and then slowly you feed in save the

00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,279
children right

00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:57,279
slowly you feed in this other things

00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:59,519
because you've taken the trust

00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:01,120
that you've built in one domain that

00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,279
might just look like

00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,959
decorating my damn home and i'm able to

00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:08,480
take that and flip that into

00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:10,720
hey by the way you shouldn't vote

00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,480
yeah i think it's way more nefarious and

00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,079
that's far better than i said

00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,600
yeah it would be like coming and saying

00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:17,600
i'm interested in german history and

00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,480
then you know 10 steps down the line i'm

00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:23,680
giving you minecon

00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:26,320
all this is making me miss libraries um

00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,800
dr joan is there is there any platform

00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,680
that's

00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,000
doing this really well or i said doing

00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,759
this

00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,040
i mean combating this really well or

00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:34,639
even you know uh

00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,839
doing the opposite was really really

00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:37,839
harmful what do you think

00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,600
yeah i think it's really important that

00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,920
we disaggregate some of the tech

00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,560
companies and and think about

00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:49,279
accountability across them the reason

00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:51,839
why we don't necessarily talk about

00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:52,480
twitch or pinterest as a hellscape is

00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:56,160
because

00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:59,279
some of their uh policies early on

00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:02,560
and their you know teams were like we

00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:03,600
focus on x and if we're not serving

00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,640
those communities

00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:09,839
then it's not content for our platform

00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:12,240
right so and we know like within

00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:13,600
gamer communities and on twitch that

00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:17,120
it's not perfect

00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:18,000
but they also were can be very quick to

00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,400
react when

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,679
things start to bubble up and become

00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,839
more of a problem

00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:26,000
of course though that took a long time

00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:28,240
and a lot of harm and a lot of

00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,320
um horrible things went down but we

00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:33,760
don't get the same kind of

00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:36,960
network effects as we do when twitter

00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:40,559
youtube and facebook fail to moderate

00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:43,280
um because you know when

00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:44,559
platforms talk about scale that's code

00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:47,679
for profit

00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:51,200
and anything that reduces the scaling of

00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:54,160
information that is essentially free

00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,720
like the content is is you know produced

00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,400
by

00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,160
by different kinds of folks for

00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,240
different kinds of reasons

00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,919
uh but essentially they're not in the

00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:05,120
context production

00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:08,480
uh realm and so they've used that as a

00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:11,520
um as a way to uh

00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:14,080
parry any kind of uh

00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,440
call for accountability and so over the

00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,440
last few years it's been

00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,640
really interesting for pl to watch

00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,200
platforms

00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,960
uh change their tone on these just

00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,600
yesterday facebook came out and said you

00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,720
know the

00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:28,720
that holocaust denial content we figured

00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,480
out that was bad

00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,799
and we're gonna do something about it

00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,600
and if you just scratch the surface of

00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:35,440
like all the

00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,440
the memes that are being shared by those

00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,440
q anon groups they're

00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,880
anti-semitic they're full of dog

00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,400
whistles um

00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,640
and you know it doesn't take a

00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:47,280
sociologist to tell you that

00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,480
if you allow holocaust denial to

00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,799
proliferate

00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:53,200
uh unapologetically on your platform

00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:56,480
you're gonna get a bunch of people that

00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:58,640
are very focused on on

00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,480
putting that into the world and the

00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,720
other thing that that plays into

00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,559
is actually the technical systems that

00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,679
the algorithms are trained on things

00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:07,440
that are both fresh

00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,600
and relevant right they want you to come

00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:12,640
and get something new every time

00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:14,559
and so it's disingenuous for a platform

00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,160
like youtube to say well we're just the

00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,840
library

00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,200
everybody loves libraries we're just a

00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,640
library and um

00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,720
you know people put things on the

00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,600
shelves and i'm just like that's not

00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,600
what you do

00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,720
and that's not how your your system

00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,440
works and

00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:31,520
you know unfortunately um we end up in

00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:34,559
these situations i think because we lack

00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:36,480
good definitions about what platforms do

00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:38,799
what their public interest obligations

00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:42,000
are and then also

00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:44,720
who are their consumers not

00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,080
who are the users but like really who

00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,240
are the clients here and

00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,000
mostly you know we have to realize that

00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,919
the clients that they're serving

00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,039
are advertisers which are the ones

00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:55,039
who've had

00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:56,640
uh significant impact on getting

00:19:55,039 --> 00:20:00,080
platforms to do anything

00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,960
about um hate speech incitement to

00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:04,240
violence

00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:08,000
um weaponized memes because

00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:10,400
ultimately you don't want your ad for uh

00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,600
you know that cisco comes to mind but

00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:15,120
you don't want your ad for

00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:18,720
like whatever uh to be served up against

00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:21,919
um you know you know nazi

00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,480
nazi content or you know um and so it's

00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,240
it's a

00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,760
it's a difficult problem to talk about

00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,520
like where

00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,960
the problem is because each platform

00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,919
company is going to approach it really

00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,440
differently

00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:34,080
but ultimately the only thing that's

00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:37,760
really uh compelled them to change

00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:39,120
isn't legal it's not sanctions it's

00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:42,720
really the public

00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,760
and reporters and civil society folks

00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,320
just saying

00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,600
enough is enough um we're gonna make it

00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,880
really hard for you to

00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:52,799
do business if you don't uh become more

00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,480
accountable to the public

00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:55,840
yeah yeah i'm really glad you brought

00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,000
the profits angle because i think a lot

00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,360
of times companies have a lot to say but

00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,120
ultimately you can just look at their

00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,640
balance sheet and know exactly where

00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,360
they stand like the holocaust denial

00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,640
stuff

00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:08,159
uh i do wonder how much facebook

00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,200
profited off of just having that on

00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:11,280
their platform

00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,799
and also to take it down and probably

00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:15,360
wouldn't be that much

00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:16,559
of your bottom line to just remove it so

00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,760
i am glad you brought up

00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:20,159
the profits part and i kind of want to

00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:22,240
hone in on that a little bit you know uh

00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:24,000
would facebook be ruined if they kind of

00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,760
went the pinterest route and kind of

00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,039
uh didn't cater to certain audiences

00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,400
would they wouldn't they still kind of

00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,159
be in business

00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,600
is it really huge for them to keep on

00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:34,000
serving this kind of content these kind

00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,000
of memes

00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,960
uh it's yeah i mean when we're talking

00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:42,000
about profits it's really

00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,679
hard to figure out exactly uh what the

00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,640
bottom line is because they'll often

00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,840
push

00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,320
us to look at advertising um and that's

00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,720
just

00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,440
like paid for like did this group pay

00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,320
for

00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:56,000
x amount of advertising and that works

00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:58,400
in some respects but we're

00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,200
what we're talking about is monetizing

00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,120
in terms of

00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,360
creating sensational or scandalous

00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:05,440
content that just keeps people on the

00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:07,039
platform so that ads can be served in

00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,039
the sidebars

00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:10,400
um and that to me is something that we

00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:13,679
have had no

00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:16,320
accountability on and really very little

00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:18,559
uh insight into especially because the

00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:20,720
ways in which these advertising

00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:21,679
mechanisms are hidden from hidden from

00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,799
view but we do

00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:28,559
know that when platform companies take

00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:31,679
action and demonetize um

00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:34,559
you know strategic misinformation

00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:36,720
uh it does rile up the community it does

00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:37,840
get them to move platforms i mean some

00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,360
of these people this is their

00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,799
livelihoods and if they're not making

00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,640
money off the content

00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:44,880
they actually won't even produce it

00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:48,240
right and so profit can be

00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:50,720
a pretty significant incentive here um

00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,679
and then if youtube shaving 30 off the

00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,600
top um

00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:55,120
at the bot at the bottom line of their

00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,200
books right they're going to be like

00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,840
it's negligible you know a few hundred

00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,600
million

00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,960
it's not a big deal and then the rest of

00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:04,720
us are just like

00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:08,000
wait like 30 g's matters and

00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:11,440
the amount of impact it has on society

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,919
is is huge yeah that's a really good

00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,679
point

00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:16,240
uh i wanna you know bring it back to

00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:17,679
memes uh and talk to kenyatta about

00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,679
you know when a meme goes viral what

00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:21,440
does that journey look like it can't

00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:23,520
just be the simple oh hey here you go

00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,559
there's a whole journey there yeah i

00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,600
think um

00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:30,240
both uh uh dr j and brandi

00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:32,559
uh kind of pieced part pieces part of

00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,400
those uh that journey together earlier

00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:35,679
um but it's always good to like make

00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,720
sure we're clear on it what's

00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,120
interesting is that

00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,400
uh memes tend to have this uh first

00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,919
period of ideation

00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,520
right where somebody like comes up with

00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:44,799
the idea comes though he comes up with a

00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,120
really great joke somebody comes up with

00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:47,760
a

00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,559
really great text to put on a put on an

00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,919
image

00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:51,600
they put it out there into a community

00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:53,200
that they trust um

00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,960
where maybe it's they trust it because

00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,720
they're uh partially anonymous or

00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,720
because of people who they know

00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,320
um and it's a way of essentially testing

00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,360
that meme doesn't mean that it's done

00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,440
intentionally

00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:05,760
but you put means out there because you

00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:08,799
want people to react to it

00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:10,080
once they react to it if somebody looks

00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:12,880
at and goes oh well

00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,679
um i kind of get that joke but it can be

00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,440
a little fun

00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:16,559
i can make it five percent funnier so

00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,720
i'm going to actually make my own

00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:21,200
iteration of it then you see people go

00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,919
and make their own versions of that meme

00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:26,000
once those memes reach i don't want to

00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:28,320
do the darwin thing too much here

00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,000
but there is sort of a moment where

00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:33,120
somebody looks at me and says

00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:36,320
oh my god i love this it made me

00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:38,240
uh it made me laugh it made me rage um

00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:40,159
it got me excited in some way it aroused

00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,679
me psychologically in some way

00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:43,200
that i'm going to take it from this one

00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:44,400
community i'm in and i'm going to bring

00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,520
it over to this other one

00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,440
so i'm going to take this thing that i

00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,559
found on this forum i'm now gonna post

00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,480
it to facebook i'm gonna take this thing

00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,799
i found on reddit i'm gonna screenshot

00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,799
it

00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:54,400
and put it in my instagram story and

00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:57,279
that's when we start to see

00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:59,600
uh amplification happen um application

00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:02,799
is a lot more

00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:04,880
complex than it used to be

00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:06,880
amplification now includes like major

00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,640
media platforms it includes

00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,159
politicians and marketers and all these

00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,760
people who are looking to

00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:13,200
take these things and exploit them in

00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,360
some way

00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,440
but once you amplify it then you're

00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,880
giving it more surface area

00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,720
which means that other people can take

00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,480
it in mass and

00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,080
replicate it themselves and so you end

00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:27,279
up going through this sort of four phase

00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:29,600
thing ideation iteration

00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:30,799
amplification and then replication um

00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,600
and then eventually the whole thing dies

00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:33,440
off

00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,039
but the community though and the effects

00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:38,080
of this meme stay

00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:39,840
for a while wow yeah i mean i want to

00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,400
harp on uh one thing you mentioned

00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,760
earlier

00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:47,039
just basically like the emotional part

00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:48,320
of memes you know if you you see a meme

00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:49,919
and it makes you laugh

00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,600
because it's relatable it makes you

00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:52,240
laugh because it makes you pissed off at

00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,200
the world

00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,080
you know there's an emotional uh trigger

00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,840
there

00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,360
in a way and it feels like memes can be

00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:01,120
a little bit more of an emotional

00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:03,120
uh offer more emotion than say like a

00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,760
simple news story or a simple headline

00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,679
that rolls in on

00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,880
your notification on your phone so do

00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:08,480
you want to talk about how like kind of

00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,799
emotions kind of play into that and how

00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,520
they

00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:12,000
kind of planted being spread oh yeah i i

00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,480
this is

00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,919
this is uh in the years i've been doing

00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,039
it this has been the most important

00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:19,520
piece for me

00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:20,559
uh personally which is understanding um

00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,159
that we

00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:23,360
uh that memes aren't just this thing

00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:24,159
that happens on the internet they

00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,679
actually happen

00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:27,679
within ourselves to happen within our

00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:29,840
minds within our bodies um

00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:31,120
when we there's this thing that we all

00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,559
do which is

00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:35,200
as mammals which is that we look to

00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:36,480
others to make sense of the world

00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,080
there's a concept behind it called

00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,440
limbic resonance which is the idea that

00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:42,320
when we share something

00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,799
we unconsciously seek to sort of confirm

00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,799
um

00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:46,720
our own experience right this is the

00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:48,640
emotional reaction i had to this thing

00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,760
and if you have it too when i share it

00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,200
with you um

00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:53,760
if you if i laugh at this me and you

00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:56,960
laugh at it then it must be funny

00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:57,760
but also if uh i'm outraged and your

00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,320
outrage

00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,360
then we have a sort of empathic bond for

00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:04,159
one another

00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:05,279
because we get each other and we know

00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:08,080
from

00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:08,720
research into somatic experiences that

00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,039
um

00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:13,039
when we take in stimuli for our senses

00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:15,039
and then when we're aroused these are

00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:17,679
things that don't just happen up here

00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:19,120
they happen in the body and so when we

00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:20,640
talk about things like the attention

00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:23,840
economy when we're talking about

00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:27,039
the things that lead to decisions on

00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:28,799
where to put a feature or who to uh

00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:30,159
kick off the platform who to say who we

00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,640
keep we have to understand that the

00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:32,159
attention

00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,240
that there's an attention economy

00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:36,320
attached to this

00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,600
that where attention itself is more

00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,000
complex

00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:42,880
than we think right we present we we get

00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,440
we experience new ideas for our senses

00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,880
which creates an awareness once that

00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,039
awareness happens almost

00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,480
instantly like our emotional centers

00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:52,480
become aroused

00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,760
and then that's the part that compels us

00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,600
to take action

00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,919
right which is actual physical process

00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,640
it's actually me taking my finger and

00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:02,159
tapping

00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:03,760
on this thing to share to retweet um uh

00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:05,840
to like to get out there and i think if

00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,840
we look at memes this way

00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:10,159
for their effects on the mind for on the

00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:12,000
body and our relationships

00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:13,840
we start to see another dimension to all

00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,320
this um

00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:17,039
facebook twitter reddit instagram these

00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,080
aren't just

00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:19,919
information networks but they're

00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,799
emotional networks they're ways to be

00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:23,200
able to share

00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:23,840
and spread emotion through a system so

00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,760
that we can

00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,679
find out whether or not we resonate with

00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:29,840
the others around us

00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:32,240
it's so interesting to me how as tech

00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:35,520
gets better it really exposes

00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:37,840
how the human being makeup is so

00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:40,960
exploitable

00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,520
yeah absolutely um but also there's uh

00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,080
instead of

00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,520
i i try and like myself i try to look at

00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,840
it not as a bad thing

00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:49,279
but as like this is what i need this is

00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,559
what i'm looking to do i'm looking to

00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:52,640
make sense of the world

00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:54,559
and i'm looking to find those around me

00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:57,760
who share that experience

00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:58,000
and if i can do that then i can if i can

00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,000
share

00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,520
the emotion then maybe i can check to

00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
see whether or not we share values

00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:05,440
if we share values maybe we can trust

00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,679
one another

00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,799
and i think that is a and so that gets

00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:10,399
the piece that i think is

00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:13,120
absolutely key for understanding all of

00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:14,000
this it's uh it's not necessarily oh my

00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:17,520
god

00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:20,559
uh all the dopamine stuff is bad it's oh

00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:23,039
all that stuff was was was is

00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:24,399
exists in order to help solve problems

00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:26,080
in a way

00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:28,399
and one of those problems is figuring

00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,919
out who we can trust

00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:32,000
yeah that's a really good point we have

00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:34,880
a question uh on that just

00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,399
quickly because i think that um the

00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,840
points here are really important

00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:39,600
especially for what brandy was saying

00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,720
earlier about why facebook groups are

00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:44,000
such a nexus

00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:45,760
for this kind of connection and and

00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,679
thinking about these not just as social

00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:49,360
media networks or not just as social

00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:50,880
networks but also as

00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:53,200
emotional networks where people are

00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,240
reaching out it this is the thing where

00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:57,279
technologists say

00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:58,240
see it's awesome and then the rest of us

00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:00,000
got to be like

00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,679
yeah but when people are seeking out to

00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,279
connect with one another

00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:09,600
to form you know a hate group

00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:13,360
or to share uh specific kinds of

00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:15,200
um emotionally high charged high tension

00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,559
content that tends to circulate in

00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,480
groups that are getting

00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:20,720
amongst people who are becoming

00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,039
radicalized right that emotional piece

00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,240
is

00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:26,159
so important because you know back in

00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,440
2015 when i was studying white

00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,919
supremacists

00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,600
when you would google white supremacists

00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:33,440
or white nationalists it would connect

00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,880
you directly to white nationalists there

00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,960
wasn't like this

00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,720
knowledge panel that was like hey these

00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,840
groups are really bad it was sort of

00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,159
like if you want to talk to white

00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:44,080
nationalists this is the place you go

00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:46,240
right and that connective element

00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:47,919
without context without structure

00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,960
without curation

00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:53,200
is how we ended up here um and so i do

00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:56,080
think that it's a feature of the design

00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,279
and that's what we have to overcome here

00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:00,720
to deal with

00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:03,679
um misinformation and

00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,000
sort of the the normal course of the way

00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:05,600
in which

00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,919
we've interacted with technology has

00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:10,960
failed to see that some of the

00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:13,279
positive use cases are also features of

00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:16,080
the negative use cases

00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:16,720
yeah that makes me uncomfortable um we

00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,799
got a question

00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,799
from twitter so i want to make sure to

00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:22,799
get in some some audience questions

00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:23,840
this one's from julie it says what steps

00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:26,240
should tech companies

00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:28,559
take to mitigate the spread and impact

00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:32,559
of harmful content

00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:35,039
anyone can take that

00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:36,080
i mean i got a list of things like you

00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:38,880
know it's not

00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:41,200
um there was a really interesting uh

00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,679
op-ed that came out this week and wired

00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,000
from

00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:45,039
uh mike anthony and uh daniel crease

00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,159
about

00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:51,120
instituting a pause when certain

00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:52,000
high high impact political influencers

00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,519
tweet

00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,200
is it the case that there's sort of a

00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:56,399
three-minute pause where their content's

00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,440
reviewed before they

00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:00,000
potentially you know create a foreign

00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,840
policy

00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,360
crisis or a cascade of medical

00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:05,279
misinformation right

00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:07,279
and that notion of the pause actually

00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:09,279
comes from call-in radio

00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:10,640
back in the day when people wanted to

00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:12,880
have these you know

00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:14,159
fun talks with the public on radio and

00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:17,679
people would get on the radio

00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:19,679
and drop an f-bomb and and you know the

00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:21,360
the corporation that was broadcasting it

00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:24,159
would be culpable for that

00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:25,919
can that work at scale no but the the

00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:27,760
other piece of this is why have we

00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:29,679
gotten ourselves into a position where

00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:31,600
platform companies feel like politicians

00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:33,440
should be allowed to say anything

00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,880
and anybody who identifies as a

00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:38,000
politician should have

00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:40,320
no rules whereas people who

00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,240
are like you and me would probably get

00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:44,080
our content taken down if we were to say

00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,320
some of the things that these

00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:47,279
high-profile politicians have tweeted

00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:50,480
out

00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:52,320
and so it's it that is a values question

00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,919
that's about the values of the company

00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:55,840
facebook claimed

00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:57,200
they want to show you politician speech

00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,840
quote unquote warts and

00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,840
all and didn't really think about

00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:03,840
downstream of that what that might mean

00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,640
for people who look to political elites

00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:07,120
for

00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,760
advice on whether to wear a mask or not

00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,840
right

00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:11,919
and so that kind of value that gets

00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:13,600
baked into the design of these platforms

00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:16,640
is really what we're up against

00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:19,760
there are certain genres of content that

00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:21,440
require curation um you can think back

00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:23,440
to the old blockbuster video

00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,880
right if you wanted your pornography you

00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,320
know where you had to go which was all

00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:29,120
the way through the store

00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:30,880
and into the back room and so there's

00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:33,600
ways in which they should

00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,960
do much more in terms of curation and

00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,880
i'm not just talking about the hate

00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,600
speech and the political content but

00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,159
also

00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:41,039
you know we have a significant problem

00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:44,799
online with

00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:46,559
um suicidal ideation and self-harm

00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:48,320
and these things should not be allowed

00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:50,240
to proliferate right and these

00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:52,480
communities should not be allowed to

00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:54,559
to sort of form uh in the first place

00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:57,760
when people are looking for

00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:58,080
um help and they get run into people

00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,159
that

00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:01,440
want to encourage them to do these

00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:03,360
activities and so

00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:05,120
uh we need to have a way in which

00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:07,039
platform companies are

00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,800
doing much better curation and i've

00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:11,200
recommended you know they said

00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,839
we hired 10 000 content moderators to

00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:14,159
deal with

00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:14,879
our disinformation problem we're like

00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:17,599
actually

00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:19,440
show me the stats on that and also hire

00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:21,359
10 000 librarians like let's

00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,960
let's kick this up a notch and do good

00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:25,440
brandi you know like

00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:26,240
well brandy got a job we can't take away

00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,679
from what she's

00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:32,639
doing so let me get that so yeah i know

00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:34,000
right yeah i mean it but it's real you

00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:36,320
know it's real and then the other thing

00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,159
is i think the the quote-unquote real

00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:40,639
facebook oversight board instead of the

00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:43,440
independent facebook oversight board

00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:45,119
is a unique opportunity for critics of

00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,159
technology to get together and kind of

00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:48,320
pull their

00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:49,760
ideas and so i've been following along

00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,599
and participating in some of the

00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,280
dialogues with that group

00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:55,280
uh but it all gets to the question of

00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:58,400
like what is the web we want

00:34:55,280 --> 00:35:00,240
uh versus the web that we've got and i

00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:02,240
think the web we got is

00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,680
not really servicing the public and so

00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:06,400
we need to uh

00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:07,119
to rethink if we need platforms at this

00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:11,040
scale

00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:11,359
um anymore uh now that the experiment

00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,320
has

00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:16,320
has really shown us that the dangers of

00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:19,200
information consolidation

00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,599
for sure i mean i'll go ahead okay can i

00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,720
ask

00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:25,440
a question of both uh randy and joan

00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:27,440
um it's fun one of the things i've

00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,640
noticed is that platforms seem to you

00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:30,079
know they're they

00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:32,640
their responsibility stops at their

00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:34,240
borders and yet it seems like so much of

00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,520
the work that you two are doing and some

00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,119
of the work i'm seeing

00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:39,599
shows that this stuff is actually

00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:42,640
happening more across platform

00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:44,560
uh than than uh than platforms tend to

00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:47,119
to recognize do you think there's a

00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:49,920
responsibility there

00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:50,720
um i i have an anecdote there it's um

00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:54,400
when

00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:56,480
we we told a story about how um

00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:58,400
facebook did an internal audit of q and

00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:00,880
on groups and what they found was

00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:03,920
um there were thousands of groups

00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,920
millions of members

00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:13,599
tens of millions of members probably so

00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:15,200
um as part of their uh campaign to

00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:17,119
to do something about this there there

00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,160
were a lot of uh you know departments

00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:19,520
that were working together

00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:21,040
there were you know the investigation

00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,520
team there was a pr team and they

00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,800
decided

00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:25,359
we're gonna do something about this but

00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,560
one of the bullets in the pr notes was

00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:28,800
don't look like we're doing this just

00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:32,240
because twitter did something so like

00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,480
there is something very um real about

00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,680
the

00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,920
because twitter had just done something

00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:38,160
a couple of weeks before had really um

00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:39,200
just throttled q anon's reach on that

00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,640
platform so

00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,760
there is something to be said they are

00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,720
watching each other they're watching

00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,760
what everybody does

00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:47,440
with coronavirus there was more of a of

00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,880
a connected effort to stop

00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:51,040
that medical misinformation on the

00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:52,480
platform because um

00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,599
you know that was something that

00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,240
everybody could get behind it wasn't

00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:55,680
necessarily

00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:57,760
political yet when they made that

00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:59,520
decision it was more like the grifter

00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:01,440
sort of snake oil salesman that was

00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:03,119
doing that this the misinformation at

00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,720
that point so like that everybody hates

00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:06,160
those guys no problem no one's gonna

00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:08,160
claim censorship we can wipe it off

00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:09,599
let's work together but when it comes to

00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:12,880
all the other stuff the

00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:14,720
extremism stuff the um the you know

00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:16,320
um political misinformation and

00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:18,160
disinformation that stuff just

00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,760
seems way more siloed to me and that

00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:21,760
they're very protective

00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:24,160
of what they're doing and they're very

00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,640
aware of how what other platforms do

00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:27,520
makes

00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:29,040
them look yeah no brandon i'm glad you

00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,160
brought that up because i i was going to

00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,839
ask you know

00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,680
when these memes disseminate is it a

00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:34,960
single person is it a group of people it

00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,599
seems like there's a lot of invisible

00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,760
labor

00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:40,240
that you know the end user may not see

00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:42,960
uh involved in this stuff

00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:43,599
yeah i think and you know i think

00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,760
probably

00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:47,280
joan and kenyatta can talk to this uh

00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,880
more intelligently than i can ever have

00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:51,280
more knowledge here but what i can say

00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:54,720
is that it seemed in 2016 like more of a

00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:56,079
sort of grassroots chan like the donald

00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:57,839
effort to sort of spread

00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:59,440
these political memes sort of far and

00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:02,880
wide and now

00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:04,000
because um in part q and on in part you

00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,960
know just

00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,480
far uh you know very very conservative

00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,960
um

00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:12,720
anti-censorship sort of people they're

00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:15,520
more involved in the meme making

00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:16,000
and it seems like um it seems like memes

00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,800
are

00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,480
sort of more prevalent and from more

00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,079
diverse starting lines

00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:23,920
so like and even when you say like you

00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:24,560
know our memes sort of big business you

00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,280
have to

00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:28,320
project lincoln which is you know a

00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:32,800
gazillionaire

00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:34,880
pack like using um using memes and and

00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,720
co-opting means and stealing memes maybe

00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:39,280
to to forward that and then bloomberg

00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,760
also like got on the meme team with

00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,079
jerry

00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:44,240
and that band so it's like people i

00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:46,480
think i think it's no longer

00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:49,040
sort of we're no longer in the great

00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:50,240
meme war as it was in 2016 like we've

00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:52,960
definitely

00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:53,359
graduated and people are using them in

00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,160
like

00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:57,839
smarter and scarier ways where like now

00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:00,640
i'm seeing you know pepe memes

00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:02,320
on my anti-vaxxer's wall i'm like this

00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:04,320
lady who makes candles and who doesn't

00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:06,960
totally understand the origination

00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:08,880
but now it's you know i don't know

00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,640
they've just changed so quickly and

00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,720
and they're being adopted and created by

00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:17,119
such a more diverse

00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:17,119
base i think yeah

00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:21,760
if i can xavier because i think it's

00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:24,480
important that we understand that there

00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:27,040
are two things going on at the same time

00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:28,000
which constitutes a kind of feedback

00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,680
loop but is very

00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,240
recursive in the sense that it learns

00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:34,960
from itself and then it adapts

00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:36,160
uh and that adaptation phase is so

00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,320
crucial

00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:39,839
for you know thinking about what is

00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:42,800
really going to stick

00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:43,920
and so for instance we we have a um a

00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:47,040
very large

00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:48,560
new project coming out um hopefully on

00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:50,240
october 20th

00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,760
uh called the media manipulation

00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,640
casebook and one of the case studies

00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:56,240
that we trace

00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:56,880
um through time is this slogan jobs not

00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:00,560
mobs

00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:01,599
and the way in which that sentiment and

00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:03,920
that slogan

00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:04,960
came into being has a lot to do with

00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,800
different strategic

00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:10,000
actors trying to get it in front of

00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:11,839
trump and in 2017 in 2011 right

00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,520
the game was like try to get something

00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:16,240
to trend on twitter right how many

00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:18,960
people do we need in this tweet storm to

00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:22,079
make occupy happen or to make you know

00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:24,160
bank of america bad for america trend

00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:26,400
but over time people learn those

00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:28,160
techniques and they adapt and adapt and

00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:30,800
add on them and and the use of

00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:33,040
influencers and political elites

00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,720
from some of these grassroots campaigns

00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,520
that might start on a message board and

00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:37,920
they're like how

00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:39,280
how how do we get donald trump to tweet

00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:42,319
this was the

00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:44,240
the game behind jobs not mobs and it

00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:46,720
took about 11 days

00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:49,040
um but people were really stuck on the

00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:51,920
phrase and the images they made

00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:54,079
t-shirts they were showing up at rallies

00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:56,160
right it's there's definitely a wires to

00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:59,119
the weeds moment where things are

00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:01,280
happening online but also have this

00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:03,520
recursive conduit going through

00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:04,720
you know our our meat space or our

00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:07,040
offline lives

00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:08,960
although we're never really offline and

00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:10,960
so jobs not mobs is a really interesting

00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:13,040
one because we thought it had died

00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:14,880
trump tweeted it there wasn't a lot of

00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:17,359
you know it kind of dissipated

00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:19,119
but then during the irnc one of the

00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:21,839
groups that was nominating trump

00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:23,040
all had made these jobs not mob signs

00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:24,800
and were just like

00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:26,560
standing there holding their signs for

00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,839
this thing that had like really stuck

00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:30,560
with them and i think

00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:32,319
what um kenyatta is saying about it

00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:35,359
having this emotional resonance

00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:38,000
uh the book by whitney phillips that uh

00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:38,480
she just published um with a co-author

00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,359
uh

00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:43,040
you are here like talks a bit about that

00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:44,800
you know that resonance that needs to

00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:46,079
happen and so some of these things just

00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:48,520
stick with people

00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:50,079
and then politically the way they get

00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:51,839
operationalized

00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:53,599
those are teams of people that are

00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:56,960
making those decisions that are like

00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:58,640
this is gonna hit different and so we're

00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,599
gonna take that and we're gonna make it

00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:02,240
a thing

00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:03,520
um which is why the theft of memes is

00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:06,319
kind of an interesting

00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:08,079
moment here because in most instances if

00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:09,680
you're a meme maker you don't really

00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:12,319
care if someone takes your stuff

00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:13,280
without attribution but you do care when

00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:15,440
someone takes it

00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:17,599
to do a thing like to you know

00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:19,760
politically persuade people

00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:22,079
uh or they have money and they're using

00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:23,680
it as a resource boost of course we've

00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:25,599
we've all seen what happens if you don't

00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,920
protect your copyright with the case of

00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:28,400
uh

00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:30,079
pepe which now you know matt fury's

00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:33,040
going back and trying to

00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:33,760
exercise some control and so that that

00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:36,000
piece of this

00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,800
is really important because if the meme

00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,000
tests well

00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:42,480
online politicians then um

00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,319
see a different use case for it and

00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:46,880
that's where we get into

00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:47,839
some of these um political use cases

00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:50,000
which i think

00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:51,680
by and large like are pretty boring like

00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,520
riding with biden like yeah that's a

00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:56,640
forced meme it's not gonna happen

00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:59,520
nobody wants to be riding with biden um

00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:00,240
but it's funny and the cringe factor of

00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:03,520
it

00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:05,200
um but yeah it's not that mu memes often

00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,760
work but there are these moments when

00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,359
they do

00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,960
and then you keep seeing them over and

00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:10,960
over and you realize

00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,079
there's some something political or

00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:15,280
something emotional

00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:17,680
happened that turned them uh into

00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:19,200
into something else yeah i'm hoping you

00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:21,200
can talk about a little bit about

00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:22,480
the potential memes have for kind of

00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,680
misrepresentation because you've written

00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:27,440
in the past about how

00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:29,839
uh it's kind of like low grade info apps

00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:31,680
yeah so one of the things that um irked

00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:34,960
me a little bit recently was a

00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:38,000
report that came out uh about

00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:40,800
um anarchist networking online

00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,560
and all of these acab means and ftp

00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:44,640
means so acab

00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:46,640
has been around since the 60s and it

00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:48,960
stands for all cops or bastards and you

00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:52,079
can literally find graffiti of acab

00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:54,400
in probably every city across the globe

00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:57,280
i have a picture of an

00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:58,240
af a cab graffiti from venice like

00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:01,119
venice italy

00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:01,839
not venice beach and uh it's just

00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:05,119
something that's

00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:07,040
been around and ftp has been around for

00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:10,000
a really long time and probably is best

00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:10,560
well known for being the title of an nwa

00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,800
song

00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:14,240
um but there were these researchers that

00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:17,119
picked it up as a meme

00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:18,800
and then tried to insert these social

00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:21,760
consequences saying that

00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:23,440
where we see this meme we also see these

00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:26,560
calls for violence against

00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:28,720
police officers uh but one of the things

00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:31,040
that the report doesn't really look at

00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:32,000
is the context and the irony and the

00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:34,800
humor

00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:37,359
aspects of what memes really are so like

00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:39,599
calls for violence and memes

00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:41,359
aren't always calls for violence that

00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:41,680
sometimes they're the exact opposite of

00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:43,680
that

00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:44,720
like look at how crazy this thing has

00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:48,079
become

00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:48,720
um but with the acab memes as a source

00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:50,480
of data

00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:51,839
these data scientists were really trying

00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,680
to say that

00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:55,040
uh well they were really saying that

00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:57,920
there was this broad

00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:58,319
network of anarchists that were plotting

00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,560
this

00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:02,319
violent insurrection and that if you

00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:04,000
just looked at the preponderance of

00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:06,480
times people tweeted

00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,760
or posted a cab on reddit then you would

00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:09,680
understand

00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:11,200
what's happening right now with the the

00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:13,760
summer of protests

00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:15,760
and so for me they misunderstand what

00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:17,440
the role the memes are playing here

00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:20,160
where people are just

00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:22,160
coming together making comments and then

00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:24,319
downstream of that which is like

00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:26,800
an entirely different issue we've known

00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:29,359
since 2017 that a bunch of white

00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:32,560
supremacists have been pretending to be

00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:34,880
antifa online to gin up this

00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:37,040
opposition to them to legitimate their

00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:38,880
own violence so like the alt-right were

00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:40,800
trying to make the alt-left happen

00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:43,119
when that wasn't gonna be a thing right

00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:45,760
like stop trying to make fetch happen

00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:46,880
they pivoted to just generating antifa

00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:48,560
accounts and like

00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:50,480
some of them are really joking like

00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:53,920
antifa mar-a-lago right

00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:54,240
beverly hills antifa but this summer

00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,960
when

00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:58,480
trump said i'm going to declare antifa a

00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:00,880
domestic terrorism

00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:02,319
group several of these accounts just

00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:04,160
like outed themselves they were like

00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:06,000
listen bro we're double agents we're not

00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:08,560
really antifa like we're just

00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,200
we're just here for the memes uh we were

00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:12,400
trying to get

00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:12,880
intel on anarchists like so the ways in

00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:16,640
which

00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:18,480
the internet facilitates this kind of

00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:21,440
anonymous communication

00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:23,520
researchers have to be really careful

00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:25,920
about what we say about memes

00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:27,200
because at the end of the day when we're

00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:29,280
trying to paint

00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:30,800
communities with these broad strokes and

00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:34,000
these broad brushes

00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,319
memes are evidence of a lot of things

00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,839
but

00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:38,079
ultimately when you're claiming that

00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:40,319
memes are evidence of intent

00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:42,560
you have to have some really solid

00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:44,640
evidence um and i just

00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:46,720
found reports like that to be like

00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:48,960
really contrary to how we should be

00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:51,280
studying memes in the first place

00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:52,560
yeah that's a really good point uh

00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:54,160
there's a question we keep getting on

00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:57,119
twitter and youtube

00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:58,640
that i want to post to you all uh and it

00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:00,079
has to do with kamala harris and i'll

00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:01,359
throw it to kenyatta but anyone can kind

00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:03,440
of tackle this one

00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:06,000
uh do we see we're seeing like a lot of

00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:08,880
memes uh about kamala's parents

00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,800
uh do you guys think we see more harmful

00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:12,480
misinformation when it comes to memes

00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:14,720
for public figures who are people of

00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:17,839
color and or women or both

00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:20,480
and why do you think that is if we do

00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:21,839
um i think it's possible i don't know i

00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,319
haven't done the research to figure out

00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:25,680
whether

00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:28,079
that that's the case um but um

00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:28,960
i would not be surprised if that were

00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:30,800
that

00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:33,119
um that weren't the case or if that were

00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:35,680
the case um i will say in my own

00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:37,119
work uh and i shouldn't even call it

00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:38,880
work i mean it's my day to day it's my

00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:41,920
family i see

00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:44,960
this playing out especially around uh

00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:48,400
memes where um where

00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:50,839
uh certain groups uh

00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:52,000
uh in this case i've been seeing

00:47:50,839 --> 00:47:55,040
chinese-american

00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:58,400
family members who are part of uh wechat

00:47:55,040 --> 00:48:00,640
groups in california targeted

00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:02,800
with targeted very sophisticated

00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:06,000
campaigns to try to get them to not

00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:09,920
vote by talking about

00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:12,319
uh uh harris as a shadow candidate

00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:13,680
um in particular uh this particular

00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:14,240
strain is fascinating because it talks

00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:16,079
about

00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:18,160
uh it basically says that biden isn't a

00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:19,520
real candidate it's actually harris

00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:21,200
and if you look at everything going on

00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:23,359
in california

00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:24,480
which they try to make the case of to

00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:27,359
say that there's a

00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:28,960
increase in crime uh they say that uh

00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:32,559
kovid's not contained

00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:34,559
um they even say that she is responsible

00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:36,160
for the wildfires not being contained

00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:39,200
and ruining the air

00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:39,599
that she that this was all practice for

00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:43,040
her

00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:46,559
to take over harris government and all

00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:48,640
in all of that um the eventual argument

00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:50,720
is so therefore there is no good choice

00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:54,240
so you shouldn't vote at all

00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:56,800
but as part of it along the way they

00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:58,000
uh there's lots of dog whistles um that

00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,599
are all about race

00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:02,400
there are lots of dog whistles that are

00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:04,400
all about uh class

00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:06,800
there are pieces that are about using

00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:09,200
religion and using values and trying to

00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:10,880
trying to proclaim that things are about

00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:14,079
traditional chinese values

00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:16,720
in order to make an argument

00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:17,119
that is based on emotion and not about

00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:19,440
uh

00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:20,640
and not about the uh facts or or real

00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:23,200
information

00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:23,680
and it's um it it makes it hard to

00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:26,640
combat

00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:27,839
because of the fact that a lot of these

00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:30,800
uh a lot of these

00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:31,359
uh memes against uh harris and i would

00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:34,240
say

00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:34,880
against uh bypoc um candidates on the

00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:37,680
whole

00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:38,240
are often grounded in places that are

00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:41,839
about

00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:45,599
um uh that draw on um

00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:48,640
uh uh stereotypes um and

00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:49,920
um use uh and use trust that's flipped

00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:52,720
from one space

00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:53,280
uh for example again the the chinese

00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:55,040
folks

00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:56,559
the chinese uh wechat groups that have

00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:57,280
been that were started in order to

00:49:56,559 --> 00:50:00,160
create

00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:01,200
uh mutual aid groups around covid are

00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:03,359
now the same ones

00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:04,720
that are now talking about uh why you

00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:05,920
can't why you should not go out and vote

00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,400
at all because that's and then how

00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:09,440
that's the

00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:11,119
somehow the the right choice yeah yeah

00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:12,720
brandi i want to get you in this because

00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:14,240
you know you write about this all the

00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:15,839
time have you seen this this kind of

00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:16,720
disinformation what are your thoughts on

00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:18,480
it

00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:19,760
i haven't seen any sort of like

00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:23,760
qualitative

00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:26,640
look at um you know memes subjects

00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:27,920
of women versus you know other groups

00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:30,720
but i i have

00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:32,480
i mean i've seen about a thousand

00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:35,040
bazillion studies saying that

00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:36,480
you know women especially women of color

00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:39,680
are

00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:40,720
definitely more targeted with harassment

00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:44,319
hate speech

00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:44,960
um you know threats etc um online and

00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:47,280
basically

00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:48,800
you know any venue or platform there was

00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:52,079
just one from isd

00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:52,559
um a week ago that showed definitively

00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:55,440
that

00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:57,200
women politicians especially women

00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:59,359
politicians who are of color

00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:00,880
uh face you know twice or something like

00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:03,040
that an

00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:04,720
uh extra amount of harassment when

00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:06,960
compared to their male colleagues except

00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:09,520
for mitch mcconnell who got a lot of

00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:09,520
hate and

00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:14,559
generally as a rule that doesn't

00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:17,119
surprise me

00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:18,319
that um women are the subject of

00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:20,319
disparaging memes

00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:23,200
and women of color especially right

00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:25,680
there's a great report that came out

00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:26,480
i don't even know what time is anymore

00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:29,680
uh

00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:30,720
in the past uh but recently uh from

00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:34,720
ultraviolet

00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:37,200
um about how reporters should talk about

00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:38,559
gender in this election cycle and this

00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:41,200
came out before

00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:42,640
harris had become the nominee um so i

00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:44,559
highly recommend that people

00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:46,240
look it up and take a read because i

00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:47,040
think even though it's instructive for

00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:49,680
journalists

00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:50,319
it helps us all think about when gender

00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:53,119
comes up

00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:53,839
what the disinformation opportunity is

00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:56,319
there

00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:58,000
and there's sometimes it's kind of fun

00:51:56,319 --> 00:52:01,760
to look at the disinformation

00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:03,440
about other uh candidates just to get a

00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:04,079
sense of like what's out there and what

00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:06,319
people think

00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:07,119
are insults because it's it wrapped up

00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:09,599
in some of this

00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:11,440
um disinformation about harris targeting

00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:13,599
chinese americans as this

00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:14,720
idea that she's the quote-unquote female

00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:16,880
obama

00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:18,640
and i'm like maybe that could be

00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:19,359
mobilizing actually that'd make a pretty

00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:21,920
good meme

00:52:19,359 --> 00:52:24,240
right if it was you know if you're like

00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:27,200
if if that's your flavor of politic

00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:27,920
right then calling her the female obama

00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,680
like maybe

00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:30,960
maybe that's a hit right john's like

00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:32,640
that's actually better than riding with

00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:33,839
biden maybe that yeah i know like

00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:36,520
this might this might

00:52:33,839 --> 00:52:38,160
be better than it's it's actually

00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:40,400
quantitatively different

00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:42,480
but like it's it's actually better like

00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:44,559
let's just say that right and but i just

00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:46,400
yeah so sometimes when you look at

00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:47,920
what counts as disparaging in one

00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:50,000
community can actually be

00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:50,960
motivating in another and that's why

00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,400
like i talk about

00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:54,520
memes having these kind of like

00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:56,720
multi-sided um

00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:58,880
interpretations and so you have to think

00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:00,319
a lot about the community that is

00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:02,960
discussing them

00:53:00,319 --> 00:53:04,240
uh in order to understand what they're

00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:06,079
what they're really about and what

00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:07,760
function they're really playing

00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:09,119
um but that one i thought i was like

00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:11,920
looking at it and i'm like

00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:12,960
the female obama like that could be a

00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:15,920
good tag line

00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:17,280
um if you know if if that's your if

00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:19,280
that's your politic

00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:21,280
but it's like uh yeah i think that

00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:24,240
political campaigns though

00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:24,720
don't necessarily understand what to do

00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:27,599
with

00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:29,839
these kinds of attacks especially the

00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:32,480
ones against harris who both

00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:34,640
uh come at her identity they come at her

00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:35,119
race they talk about her not being black

00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:37,839
enough

00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:38,480
and like playing these different roles

00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:41,040
um

00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:42,559
but i think ultimately that women and

00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:45,440
especially women of color

00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:47,520
down ballot candidates um as well as you

00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:50,800
know the quote unquote squad

00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:53,599
um face a disproportionate amount of

00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:54,160
public harassment which was why it was

00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:56,640
really

00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:58,720
kind of gnawing to see twitter come out

00:53:56,640 --> 00:54:02,240
and remind people not to wish

00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:05,040
the president ill knowing that um daily

00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:06,000
thousands thousands of threats are

00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:10,480
lobbed against

00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:12,640
um maxine waters ayanna presley and

00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:14,640
especially ill on omar has been the

00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:15,440
subject of different disinformation

00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:18,319
campaigns

00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:20,960
uh particularly one a couple weeks ago

00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:22,720
by project veritas that was removed from

00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:23,920
different platforms and so

00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:26,640
i think it's really important that we

00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:29,040
look at who is being attacked

00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:31,040
uh and understand that platform

00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:32,240
companies are really facilitating a lot

00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:35,119
of that

00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:37,200
interaction and in some ways it's acting

00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:39,359
as a ddos on certain

00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:41,040
candidates where if you're trying to

00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:42,160
communicate communicate with a

00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:44,240
politician

00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:46,640
and anytime you get in their mentions

00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:49,200
you're getting harassed in your replies

00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:51,440
that's a problem uh but it's also a

00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:53,359
feature

00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:54,720
that's a really good point uh we have to

00:54:53,359 --> 00:54:57,680
wrap up the show soon

00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:59,119
i don't think i want to end on okay i

00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:01,280
want to keep going

00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:03,040
we can keep going for another five hours

00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:04,240
is what my producer is telling me all

00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:05,680
right let's do five uh

00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:07,359
this is not a producer of mine here the

00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:09,839
internet is forever we don't

00:55:07,359 --> 00:55:10,720
there's what is time online that's true

00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:14,079
no honestly though

00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:16,480
i work now till like 9pm i feel like

00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:17,359
um but i do want to end on some kind of

00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:19,920
advice

00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:21,040
that we can give the people to uh take

00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:24,079
into the world with them

00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:27,200
as they encounter memes everywhere

00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:28,640
uh so i want to ask you know and i'll

00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:32,319
start with kenyatta

00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:34,640
meme literacy you know what should folks

00:55:32,319 --> 00:55:36,640
do look out for how can people meme

00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:39,920
responsibly

00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:42,960
meme literacy um

00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:44,160
yeah i think there there is uh there's

00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:46,960
definitely a case be made that there

00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:49,200
needs to be immune literacy i think that

00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:51,119
folks who spend more time on these

00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:53,680
platforms in these communities

00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:55,680
um i don't want to i don't want to say

00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:58,160
that it's a generational thing

00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:59,359
by um xy mold and i just spent a lot of

00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:01,280
time in places

00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:02,640
the more that you spend in those times

00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:04,559
in those spaces the more

00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:06,319
uh the more you kind of understand them

00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:07,680
um which is good because as joan was

00:56:06,319 --> 00:56:09,440
saying it's really about the context

00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:12,640
more than anything else

00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:14,799
um as advice though

00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:16,880
uh i'm asking people to kind of

00:56:14,799 --> 00:56:19,040
concentrate on themselves

00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:20,240
and say when if you feel compelled to

00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:24,079
share something

00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:25,520
um to uh to pause to stop to do that

00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:28,240
seven second delay

00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:30,480
and like notice what it is that grabbed

00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:32,799
your awareness um

00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:34,640
what try to like try to figure out what

00:56:32,799 --> 00:56:35,920
part of it actually aroused you or

00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:37,520
triggered you

00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:39,599
how does that connect to your your

00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:41,680
values your emotions

00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:43,280
and then notice how that actually

00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:46,480
manifests in your body

00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:47,280
which um which uh i absolutely

00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:49,280
absolutely mean

00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:50,799
these are all things that when they make

00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:52,240
us feel like we have to do something

00:56:50,799 --> 00:56:53,839
about it

00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:55,280
we feel it in a place and we have to

00:56:53,839 --> 00:56:57,599
understand where those things

00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:59,839
how those things manifest because the

00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:03,119
actions that we're being prescribed

00:56:59,839 --> 00:57:06,319
to take which is tap the share button

00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:08,400
tap the tap to forward button um uh

00:57:06,319 --> 00:57:09,359
copy and paste over to this other place

00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,640
these are all

00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:12,720
these aren't necessarily the things that

00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:14,160
we would do in another context these are

00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:16,559
the things that are have been prescribed

00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:19,839
to us by these platforms these features

00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:21,200
and so maybe if you can take an

00:57:19,839 --> 00:57:24,160
alternative action

00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:25,760
like do something else i feel like we

00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:26,799
have to start with ourselves and this

00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:28,880
isn't saying that

00:57:26,799 --> 00:57:29,839
that platforms don't have some

00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:32,000
responsibility they have

00:57:29,839 --> 00:57:33,280
all the responsibility but in terms of

00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,079
the things that we feel like we can take

00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:36,079
action on

00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:37,599
and have a positive outcome on right now

00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:40,000
it's it's us

00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:40,640
it's it's you it's me it's everyone's

00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,480
call

00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:44,640
it's how do i how am i make sure that

00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:47,680
i'm more aware of what i'm doing when

00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:49,280
i'm taking part in the medium economy

00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:51,839
yeah it's really good advice just think

00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:55,040
twice uh brandi z what do you

00:57:51,839 --> 00:57:58,079
recommend how do you meme

00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:59,200
responsibly um i mean i think i think

00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:01,599
kenyatta you really

00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:02,799
got to the heart of it i think in terms

00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:05,040
of awareness

00:58:02,799 --> 00:58:05,839
also like how you fit knowing how you

00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:08,720
fit in

00:58:05,839 --> 00:58:09,359
the platform's sort of machine and that

00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:11,440
like you're

00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:13,119
it's not like like you win something if

00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:14,799
you share this meme actually you're just

00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:16,480
dropping a penny in their bucket

00:58:14,799 --> 00:58:18,559
so like you are help keeping the lights

00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:19,760
on if you hate facebook and you think

00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:20,400
that they're censoring everyone what

00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:22,880
you're doing

00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:24,960
is you are contributing to their profits

00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:26,079
like every time you engage every group

00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:28,960
that you join

00:58:26,079 --> 00:58:28,960
um so it might

00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:36,319
never take myself which is to log off

00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:37,520
uh go take a walk but like get get

00:58:36,319 --> 00:58:40,079
offline like

00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:41,920
we're just way too online way too online

00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:43,760
and i know it's hard and pandemic but i

00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:45,200
truly truly believe that people need to

00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:48,240
log off

00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:51,839
yeah watch mozilla stuff first and then

00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:52,240
we're finished then log off um dr joan

00:58:51,839 --> 00:58:57,200
dr

00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:59,599
j how do i mean carefully

00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:00,960
yeah i think uh i think brandy's right

00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:03,440
the the impulse to get

00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:05,599
into a memoir with folks is just not

00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:07,280
it's not helpful although if it's funny

00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:09,200
it's funny right if you're sharing some

00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:11,280
jersey shore memes and you're

00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:12,480
oh yeah and you know your way through

00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:15,040
life and

00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:17,760
like that's okay but it's like when it's

00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:18,160
political in nature when it's triggering

00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:20,559
these

00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:22,880
outrage emotions where you're like can

00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:25,599
you believe this kind of stuff

00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:27,680
um yeah that is like low grade and from

00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:28,799
influence operations and they're working

00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:31,280
on you

00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:32,079
right there they need your legitimacy

00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:34,880
they need your

00:59:32,079 --> 00:59:36,880
networks they need your participation

00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:38,799
and if you opt out

00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:41,599
you can often think about yourself as a

00:59:38,799 --> 00:59:43,920
more responsible steward of information

00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:46,480
amongst people in your networks that uh

00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:49,839
depend on you but i want to close on

00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:50,559
a note about advocacy which is to say

00:59:49,839 --> 00:59:53,599
that

00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:57,119
flat earthers holocaust deniers

00:59:53,599 --> 00:59:58,640
uh vicious racists in this moment

00:59:57,119 --> 01:00:00,720
they're they're getting their point

00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:02,720
across they are out there

01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:04,559
they are working the algorithms they are

01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:06,720
gaming the systems they are thinking

01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:09,920
strategically about how they get

01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:11,839
taken up by politicians and journalists

01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:13,760
and there's just nobody out there saying

01:00:11,839 --> 01:00:15,760
the earth is round

01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:17,920
you know and it's because the truth is

01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:20,880
so obvious to some of us

01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:21,839
but at this stage when we have very few

01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:23,440
of our young

01:00:21,839 --> 01:00:25,119
younger folks that even know what the

01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:27,680
holocaust was

01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:28,160
uh recent research has pointed that out

01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:30,799
uh

01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:31,760
we do need to think again about these

01:00:30,799 --> 01:00:33,760
systems are not

01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:35,440
built for truth they're not built for

01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:38,960
trust they're built for

01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:41,359
quick communication and unfortunately

01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:42,079
right now these platforms are the best

01:00:41,359 --> 01:00:44,480
we have

01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:46,240
in terms of getting ourselves medical

01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:47,280
advice which is then bound up with all

01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:49,040
this grift

01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:51,119
so right now i want to impress upon

01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:53,200
people that truth needs an advocate

01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:55,359
so no matter what your issue is make

01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:58,559

01:00:55,359 --> 01:00:59,599
