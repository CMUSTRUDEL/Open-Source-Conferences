00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:09,990
good afternoon my name is Chris Soghoian

00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:11,759
I work for the ACLU the American Civil

00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:14,420
Liberties Union and one of the things I

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,740
do is I study surveillance I study how

00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:19,320
governments spy on people which in many

00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:22,230
ways is a study of power surveillance is

00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,779
a tool used by those with power against

00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:27,480
those without power so for more than a

00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:29,609
hundred years our telephone companies

00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,009
are what are now our broadband companies

00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:34,980
have facilitated the surveillance of

00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:37,230
their users for the state and this is a

00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:39,480
long relationship that goes very deeply

00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:41,460
and it's a close relationship these

00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,290
companies have been helping the

00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:46,170
government as I said for a hundred years

00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:47,399
and when you receive requests for a

00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:49,559
hundred years

00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:52,370
you end up with a very close and

00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:54,449
friendly relationship and as the as

00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:58,800
telecommunications technologies have

00:00:54,449 --> 00:01:02,180
evolved from Telegraph and telegram to

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,229
cell phones and broadband the

00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:07,860
surveillance technologies have evolved

00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:10,200
to essentially what has happened is that

00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:12,689
the telecom companies have been forced

00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,820
to build surveillance features directly

00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:16,470
into their networks mm-hmm and I want

00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:18,630
that to sort of sink in for a second

00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:20,400
our communications networks were

00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:22,110
designed first and foremost with

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,369
surveillance in mind this wasn't

00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:26,220
something that was sort of bolted on

00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:28,140
after the fact but as each key feature

00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:29,640
was being deployed each new

00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,909
communications feature whether it was

00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:34,590
cell phones text messages email the

00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:37,890
government ensured that they would be

00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:41,960
able to spy on the on these new

00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:43,799
communications methods and in many ways

00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:46,110
surveillance for the lost

00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:47,939
I guess eighty or a hundred years has

00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:50,369
been possible because so much of our

00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:53,759
information was sent over unencrypted

00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:56,880
links our data went over wires or over

00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:59,280
the ether without any protection and so

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,659
to be able to monitor our calls to be

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,869
able to monitor our text through our

00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:08,119
emails a government merely had to put

00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:09,979
themselves between one of the users so

00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:11,690
this is one of the one of the Snowden

00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:15,260
slides that was released a few years ago

00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:18,290
this is actually a GCHQ slides and this

00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:21,080
is relevant to a UK audience this is

00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:23,510
from 2009 and now of course the web in

00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:25,069
2009 looked very different from the web

00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:27,019
today and one of the things that has

00:02:25,069 --> 00:02:30,110
changed of course is the use of

00:02:27,019 --> 00:02:32,000
encryption but back in 2009 most of the

00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:33,709
sites that you would have visited would

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,959
have been unencrypted that meant

00:02:33,709 --> 00:02:37,940
social media companies like Facebook and

00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:40,670
Twitter and MySpace because people still

00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:44,269
use myspace back then email providers

00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:46,310
like Google and Yahoo and hotmail and

00:02:44,269 --> 00:02:49,280
even news organizations and

00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:51,440
encyclopedias like Wikimedia were all

00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,140
sending data over the Internet

00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:56,319
within plain text which meant that with

00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:58,940
the help of a friendly internet provider

00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:01,790
either a broadband provider or an

00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:03,859
upstream provider who would who would

00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:05,420
provide access through international

00:03:03,859 --> 00:03:08,359
cables governments could watch

00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:10,790
everything that we were doing so that's

00:03:08,359 --> 00:03:13,849
changed and it's changed in a big big

00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:16,959
way starting sort of in 2010 Google was

00:03:13,849 --> 00:03:21,440
the first major provider to move towards

00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:23,060
HTTPS by default 2011 2012 the ball

00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,549
really started rolling we now have

00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:27,620
Facebook and Twitter and Microsoft and

00:03:25,549 --> 00:03:30,530
Wikimedia and news organizations like

00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:33,769
the Guardian and The Washington Post and

00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:36,340
the intercept we've moved to a web that

00:03:33,769 --> 00:03:38,900
is increasingly encrypted by default

00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:42,680
which means that governments can no

00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:45,859
longer spy just by monitoring one of the

00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:47,060
links this was a tweet that I saw just a

00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:49,579
week or two ago this was Mozilla

00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:51,799
announcing that more than 50 percent of

00:03:49,579 --> 00:03:54,980
web pages that were loaded by Firefox

00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:58,370
users were going over HTTPS that's a

00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:59,930
huge huge milestone and efforts like

00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:03,310
let's encrypt are helping to move the

00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:07,910
web even further in that direction

00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:11,090
so of course Edward Snowden revealed to

00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:12,709
the world in 2013 really how bad things

00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:14,840
were and one of the points I really want

00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:16,729
to emphasize there have been so many

00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:18,289
Snowden stories there concern many

00:04:16,729 --> 00:04:20,269
surveillance stories and for those of

00:04:18,289 --> 00:04:21,890
you who don't read every article this

00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:24,530
they can sort of blur it say

00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:26,900
as someone who has read every article

00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:30,320
that's come out and every slide that has

00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:32,000
been published for the most part the

00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,220
intelligence agencies don't have any

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,070
magic tricks they've been taking

00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:39,140
advantage of low-hanging fruit and of

00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:41,150
the fact that the engineering community

00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:44,180
and the tech community we've been really

00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:47,330
lazy right we knew how to encrypt data

00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:50,000
and we weren't we knew how to encrypt

00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:51,380
webpages we knew how to encrypt emails

00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,390
as they were going back and forth

00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:55,310
between email servers we knew how to

00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:57,650
encrypt text messages and telephone

00:04:55,310 --> 00:05:00,050
calls but many of us weren't doing it

00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:03,110
and for in in many ways this wasn't

00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:05,270
because of the cost of doing so it was

00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:07,940
because of inertia we hadn't gone around

00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:10,340
doing it or because protocols were not

00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:12,890
designed to be secure by default and of

00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:15,500
course we're all lazy so that's been

00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:18,650
starting to change and so the the web is

00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:20,750
increasingly encrypted by default many

00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:23,600
many email services now use encryption

00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:25,669
not from the user to the user but from

00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,919
one server to another which again means

00:05:25,669 --> 00:05:29,570
that governments or other parties that

00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:33,020
are trying to monitor communications

00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:35,990
will no longer be able to do so and of

00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:38,270
course this has reached the front pages

00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:41,090
of newspapers there was a very

00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:42,680
high-profile fight between Apple and the

00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:45,260
Federal Bureau of Investigation this

00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:47,540
year in part because Apple has put so

00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:50,720
many resources into securing its

00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:52,400
products and its services so what is

00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,370
Apple done they think cryptid data

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:57,860
stored on mobile devices and desktop

00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:59,600
devices by default which means all you

00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:02,570
have to do is have a password or a PIN

00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,100
number and law enforcement agencies or

00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:05,810
intelligence agencies will have a very

00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:09,290
difficult time extracting information

00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:11,570
from your device they've also turned on

00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:14,120
encryption for text messaging via

00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:17,270
iMessage and video and voice

00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:19,910
conferencing with FaceTime critically

00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:22,370
what Apple has done with with iMessage

00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:24,380
doesn't require any opt-in on on behalf

00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:26,390
of the user if you have an iPhone and

00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:29,390
your friend has an iPhone you

00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:31,099
automatically get encryption without

00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,910
having to do anything this is a real

00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:35,180
game-changer

00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:35,529
so Apple did this in 2010 the iMessage

00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:38,889
and face

00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:42,519
something and then other companies have

00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:44,199
followed most sort of famously whatsapp

00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:47,259
which turned on end-to-end encryption

00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:50,979
just a few months back and now a billion

00:06:47,259 --> 00:06:53,619
users benefit from a secure attacks

00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:55,869
message service enabled by default that

00:06:53,619 --> 00:07:00,279
governments cannot readily monitor or

00:06:55,869 --> 00:07:02,139
hack into so for those of us who care

00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:03,819
about privacy for those of us who don't

00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:05,889
want governments to be able to easily

00:07:03,819 --> 00:07:07,689
monitor individual users and

00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:09,099
particularly who don't want governments

00:07:07,689 --> 00:07:11,649
to be able to engage in bulk

00:07:09,099 --> 00:07:14,289
surveillance of populations this is a

00:07:11,649 --> 00:07:17,349
game changer encryption is finally

00:07:14,289 --> 00:07:20,319
available and not just to the nerd elite

00:07:17,349 --> 00:07:23,289
who can deal with tools as difficult to

00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:26,199
use as PGP but finally encryption is

00:07:23,289 --> 00:07:30,039
being built into widely used consumer

00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:33,129
services and turned on by default so for

00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:35,469
us this is great but governments are of

00:07:33,129 --> 00:07:37,329
course not taking this lying down

00:07:35,469 --> 00:07:40,959
in the United States in the United

00:07:37,329 --> 00:07:43,929
Kingdom in on the continent in Europe in

00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:46,629
Asia government leaders are speaking out

00:07:43,929 --> 00:07:48,879
about the fact that one consequence of

00:07:46,629 --> 00:07:50,110
this is that they can no longer monitor

00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,809
the people that they consider to be

00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:54,069
threats and of course some governments

00:07:52,809 --> 00:07:55,809
consider the greatest threat to be

00:07:54,069 --> 00:07:56,949
terrorism other governments consider the

00:07:55,809 --> 00:08:00,159
greatest threat to be human rights

00:07:56,949 --> 00:08:01,569
activists and journalists but government

00:08:00,159 --> 00:08:04,209
leaders around the world assert that

00:08:01,569 --> 00:08:06,699
they have a responsibility and a right

00:08:04,209 --> 00:08:09,219
to target the communications of people

00:08:06,699 --> 00:08:11,229
they consider to be a threat and they

00:08:09,219 --> 00:08:13,239
are very upset that companies

00:08:11,229 --> 00:08:15,339
particularly American technology

00:08:13,239 --> 00:08:18,009
companies are essentially thwarting

00:08:15,339 --> 00:08:20,939
their ability to do their jobs so this

00:08:18,009 --> 00:08:23,649
is a this is our FBI director Jim Comey

00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:26,229
who has sort of been the public face of

00:08:23,649 --> 00:08:28,659
the anti encryption debate in the United

00:08:26,229 --> 00:08:29,949
States he has said that they don't want

00:08:28,659 --> 00:08:32,319
a backdoor and encryption I actually

00:08:29,949 --> 00:08:36,849
want a front door I'm not really sure

00:08:32,319 --> 00:08:38,800
what the difference is but but this is a

00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:41,919
front page news in the US and this is

00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:44,740
front page news around the world you

00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:47,240
know we as everyone knows we have an

00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:49,220
election in a couple weeks in the US and

00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:51,680
artists of which way it goes next year

00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:54,680
this issue will come back there will be

00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:58,430
another round of the encryption fight I

00:08:54,680 --> 00:09:00,110
suspect it will not involve law

00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:02,600
enforcement agencies trying to pressure

00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:04,339
companies who make encryption I think

00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,899
that ship has sailed and I think that

00:09:04,339 --> 00:09:09,020
most people in the government realize

00:09:05,899 --> 00:09:10,310
there's no way to claw that back but

00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:13,250
governments are not gonna take this

00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:14,959
lying down governments will respond to

00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:17,899
the threat that they feel encryption

00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:20,360
poses and the major way that I think

00:09:17,899 --> 00:09:23,750
governments are gonna respond is through

00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:26,089
the use of hacking software so for more

00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:27,500
than 15 years the FBI has had the

00:09:26,089 --> 00:09:30,170
capability it's a hack into people's

00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:32,360
devices it people's phones into laptops

00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:35,360
turning on webcams and microphones

00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:38,480
remotely this is not just a capability

00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,980
that has that has stayed with the elite

00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,260
federal agencies this is something

00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:43,790
that's trickling down in my country

00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:45,800
eventually will trickle down to state

00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:47,709
and local law enforcement agencies and

00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:50,270
around the world is now available to

00:09:47,709 --> 00:09:51,890
basically any government willing to

00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:53,750
spend a few hundred thousand dollars on

00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:56,510
hacking software because of the

00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:58,250
emergence of a market an international

00:09:56,510 --> 00:10:01,399
market for surveillance technology a

00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:02,630
hacking team an Italian firm has been in

00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:05,990
the headlines but they're just one

00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:09,079
player in a global industry and so the

00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:13,550
governments of Vietnam and Ethiopia and

00:10:09,079 --> 00:10:19,220
Saudi Arabia and Qatar Abu Dhabi they

00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:22,120
all have these tools and of course while

00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:24,529
there are criminals in these countries

00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:26,300
for some reason governments seem to keep

00:10:24,529 --> 00:10:28,430
getting caught using these tools against

00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:33,350
journalists and dissidents and political

00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:35,720
opponents why does this affect the

00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:38,270
Mozilla community well if governments

00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:41,720
cannot trick people into downloading

00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:43,760
spyware in many cases they will need to

00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:45,380
leverage previously unknown

00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,300
vulnerabilities and so there's a big

00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:50,000
conversation that's taking place at

00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:52,300
least in my country about whether or not

00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,220
law enforcement agencies should be

00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:57,770
acquiring and then stockpiling so-called

00:10:55,220 --> 00:11:01,149
zero-day vulnerabilities and widely use

00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:04,040
software like Firefox

00:11:01,149 --> 00:11:05,720
so this is a global conversation that's

00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:07,369
taking place around surveillance and I

00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:09,470
think it's important to understand that

00:11:07,369 --> 00:11:10,759
there are cyber security issues I think

00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:13,160
it's important to understand that there

00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:15,439
are privacy issues but there are also

00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:17,209
some very basic human rights issues that

00:11:15,439 --> 00:11:18,980
have not been part of this debate and I

00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:22,129
think really need to be part of this

00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:25,160
debate and really what I mean by this is

00:11:22,129 --> 00:11:26,869
that we are not all equally vulnerable

00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:30,709
to surveillance let me explain what I

00:11:26,869 --> 00:11:32,360
mean by that so as I said before Apple

00:11:30,709 --> 00:11:35,179
has put a lot of time and money into

00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:38,629
securing its platform Apple has turned

00:11:35,179 --> 00:11:40,970
on disk encryption by default so that if

00:11:38,629 --> 00:11:42,949
a device is seized data cannot be

00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:45,350
extracted from it the company has turned

00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:47,389
on encryption for text messaging voice

00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:50,319
and video chats by default so that

00:11:47,389 --> 00:11:53,720
governments increasingly cannot wiretap

00:11:50,319 --> 00:11:55,790
users with iPhones apple also has put a

00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:58,249
lot of time and resources and commitment

00:11:55,790 --> 00:12:00,290
into ensuring that users receive regular

00:11:58,249 --> 00:12:02,329
security updates so if you buy an iPhone

00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:05,480
you can expect to get regular updates

00:12:02,329 --> 00:12:07,100
for four or five years as soon as flaws

00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:09,920
are found and then the company is

00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:12,309
notified so what that means is that

00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:15,259
governments who wish to hack Apple users

00:12:12,309 --> 00:12:16,369
because they cannot wiretap them are

00:12:15,259 --> 00:12:17,899
gonna have to use zero-day

00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:20,119
vulnerabilities they cannot rely on the

00:12:17,899 --> 00:12:23,600
fact that Apple users will be using

00:12:20,119 --> 00:12:26,600
out-of-date insecure software and cannot

00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,889
use flaws for which patches exist that

00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:30,410
users haven't rolled out those patches

00:12:27,889 --> 00:12:32,869
so what that means is people who have

00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:34,759
iPhones are increasingly off-limits to

00:12:32,869 --> 00:12:37,129
law enforcement now part of me thinks

00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:40,100
that's great it's great that that this

00:12:37,129 --> 00:12:43,240
company has made it easy for users to

00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:45,949
keep to keep protected from the state

00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:48,559
but the other part of me is concerned

00:12:45,949 --> 00:12:52,339
that not everyone can afford a $600

00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:55,879
device digital security should not be a

00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:58,100
luxury but it is a luxury and so because

00:12:55,879 --> 00:13:00,230
of the security of the Apple's platform

00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:03,049
because of the security that Apple has

00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:04,910
built-in it means that those in our

00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:07,579
society who have the greatest resources

00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:10,100
those in our society who have access to

00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:11,629
lawyers who are less likely think it's

00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:13,430
Hargett advice date in the first place

00:13:11,629 --> 00:13:15,920
are increasingly off

00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:19,130
that's to law enforcement while those

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:21,110
who do not are more exposed so there's

00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:23,440
sort of two smartphone operating systems

00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:27,640
that dominate the market ios and android

00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:30,200
android is a security shitshow so

00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:33,529
Android users rarely get security

00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:36,020
updates only 20% of Android phones on

00:13:33,529 --> 00:13:38,750
the market right now are using Android 6

00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:40,520
so the most recent release many Android

00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:42,459
users are using versions of the

00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:44,480
operating system that are years behind

00:13:42,459 --> 00:13:46,250
which means that law enforcement

00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,320
agencies don't even need to leverage a

00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:49,790
zero-day vulnerability you are if you

00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,100
have an Android phone in your pocket and

00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:54,200
you do not have a Nexus phone or the new

00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:56,540
pixel phone more than likely you are

00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:58,220
using a device that is insecure and that

00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:02,420
can be hacked without a zero-day

00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:04,760
vulnerability in addition to the the

00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:06,589
security update issue many Android

00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:08,510
phones still do not use disk encryption

00:14:06,589 --> 00:14:10,550
by default which means if your phone is

00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:13,850
seized by the authorities they can

00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:15,649
extract data off the device and androids

00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:17,720
default text messaging app does not use

00:14:15,649 --> 00:14:21,650
end-to-end encryption or even offer it

00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:23,810
so if you compare an iOS user to an

00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:26,029
Android user the iOS user gets security

00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:28,670
updates they get default end to end

00:14:26,029 --> 00:14:31,550
encryption and they get disk encryption

00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:34,490
to Android users get none of these

00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:36,830
things which means the Android users are

00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:39,500
hopelessly vulnerable to the state now

00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:41,870
again if Android phones cost 600 bucks

00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:43,490
and iOS devices cost 600 bucks I

00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:46,130
wouldn't care I would say let the market

00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:48,320
decide but Android is dominating the low

00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:51,070
end of the market which means those in

00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:53,990
our society who are the most vulnerable

00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:55,880
those in our society who are more likely

00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:57,890
to be harassed by the state who are more

00:14:55,880 --> 00:15:00,170
likely to be wiretap who are more likely

00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:01,730
to have their devices seized are using

00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:04,339
devices that leave them hopelessly

00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:06,770
vulnerable to surveillance and so the

00:15:04,339 --> 00:15:10,579
difference in the security features in

00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:13,730
iOS versus Android it's creating what I

00:15:10,579 --> 00:15:15,860
call a digital security device it means

00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:18,110
that those in our society who are the

00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:20,630
most vulnerable who need encryption the

00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:23,959
most are the least likely likely to get

00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:26,510
it while those who have all the

00:15:23,959 --> 00:15:27,050
resources who are the least likely to be

00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:29,360
survey

00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:31,910
have devices that put them completely

00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:34,700
off-limits from the state so this is a

00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:36,260
problem I don't have a solution but I

00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:38,750
think we need to start talking about the

00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:41,149
fact that encryption and digital

00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:43,180
security has become a luxury and that

00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:45,829
this threatens to perpetuate existing

00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:48,070
inequalities in our society thank you

00:15:45,829 --> 00:15:48,070
very much

00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:55,940
[Applause]

00:15:53,560 --> 00:16:04,279
time for one or two questions anybody

00:15:55,940 --> 00:16:05,930
got a burning question for Chris whoever

00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:08,360
gets the microwave phone first okay

00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:10,880
then the other one is done here so being

00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:13,579
a software engineer I feel I'm probably

00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,050
tempted to be on the side of as much as

00:16:13,579 --> 00:16:19,040
encryption as possible and all those

00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:23,209
things but I do wonder when we talk

00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:24,760
about the encryption obviously serving

00:16:23,209 --> 00:16:28,730
the good of the privacy of the people

00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:29,959
versus actually stopping you know not

00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:31,160
just terrorists because I don't think

00:16:29,959 --> 00:16:32,990
it's very effective there but it's

00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:34,490
probably more effective in areas like

00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:36,380
child pornography and things like that I

00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:38,660
have friends in law enforcement they do

00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:41,329
actively use these these types of

00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:44,690
exploits to combat those things much

00:16:41,329 --> 00:16:46,310
more than actual terrorism isn't it a

00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:48,290
concern that in two countries where

00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:52,399
people are most vulnerable places like

00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:54,230
Qatar places like Saudi Arabia or or you

00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:56,570
know anything like that governments

00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:58,370
could intervene at a different level and

00:16:56,570 --> 00:17:02,750
simply make sure people have been secure

00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:04,280
phones even even if in Western countries

00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:06,230
like us where the governments are

00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:08,569
somewhat less likely at least to use

00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:10,189
those methods against political

00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:12,949
opponents and things like that

00:17:10,189 --> 00:17:14,839
we get secured phones how do we ensure

00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:17,569
people in those countries get secure

00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:18,980
phones because you know those phones

00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:20,839
will be shipped there and governments

00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:23,980
could easily intercept delivery routes

00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:26,720
and things like that and and install

00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:29,059
security loopholes after the fact sort

00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:32,300
of before between the vendor and the

00:17:29,059 --> 00:17:33,910
user I mean I don't think that we need

00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:36,290
to worry right now about government's

00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:37,790
doing things to force users to have

00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:39,080
insecure phones because I think that

00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:41,740
Google and Samsung are doing a pretty

00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:44,710
good job of making that happen

00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:47,020
look I'm not gonna stand up here and try

00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:49,210
to convince you that extreme privacy is

00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:50,799
the right choice or that the government

00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:52,390
should never be able to monitor

00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:54,370
communications I personally believe that

00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:55,840
and that's why I worked for a civil

00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:57,940
liberties group that sues the government

00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:00,460
and it tries to make surveillance as

00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:02,020
difficult as possible it'd be great if

00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:04,990
you came to my side but I don't really

00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:07,120
care the purpose of this talk is is to

00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:08,590
emphasize that whether or not you think

00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,660
that the state should always be it to

00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:11,410
listen or never be able to listen that

00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:13,150
doesn't matter

00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:15,340
but it's a problem when the state can

00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:23,340
only listen to the poor and the rich are

00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:26,830
off-limits that's a problem and they're

00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:28,530
so my favorite Fourth Amendment law

00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:31,510
review article this is like super nerdy

00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:33,100
is an article by a now deceased law

00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:34,360
professor called Bill stunts and it's

00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:36,160
called the distribution of Fourth

00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:37,690
Amendment privacy it's behind a paywall

00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:40,179
it's it's criminal but it's behind a

00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:42,880
paywall but he talks about the ways in

00:18:40,179 --> 00:18:45,160
the pre-internet era of how the poor

00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:47,890
gets screwed on privacy so the rich have

00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:50,020
cars that cannot be easily searched by

00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:51,880
the police the poor ride the bus to work

00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:53,830
and the police can bring drug dogs on

00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:56,140
the bus the rich have air-conditioning

00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:57,730
in their homes but the poor don't and so

00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:59,590
in the summers the poor sitting on their

00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:01,150
Stoops drinking a beer and then they get

00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:03,730
harassed by the police for drinking in

00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:05,940
public he goes through all of these ways

00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:08,650
that the poor suffer when it comes to

00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:11,320
privacy and and law enforcement now the

00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:12,520
problem with stuns his argument is his

00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:14,530
solution is to just take away the

00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:16,090
privacy rights of the rich I don't

00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:18,010
really like that approach

00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:21,250
but I do think as a community we should

00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:22,960
be talking about the fact that the most

00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:24,669
privileged the most privileged in our

00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,520
societies are getting the benefits of

00:19:24,669 --> 00:19:29,860
privacy and digital security and those

00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:32,290
who are harassed daily by the police are

00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:33,700
left completely vulnerable we need to do

00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:35,740
a better job of ensuring that these

00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:37,960
security tools are trickling down and

00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:40,630
that law enforcement has as difficult a

00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:42,610
time hacking low-income users and less

00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:44,440
educated users as they do hacking those

00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:46,390
of us who are getting updates who are

00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:50,400
using antenna encryption because of our

00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:50,400
our tech experience in privilege

00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:58,279
is that working um so when Jim Comey the

00:19:55,580 --> 00:20:00,889
director of the FBI and talked about the

00:19:58,279 --> 00:20:04,100
front door I took that to meant due

00:20:00,889 --> 00:20:05,929
process so the social compact that

00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:07,879
exists between people and governments

00:20:05,929 --> 00:20:11,359
that the government will follow certain

00:20:07,879 --> 00:20:12,950
processes judicial and otherwise do you

00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:15,200
think there's no place for due process

00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:18,529
in this world is there is there anything

00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:20,210
like key escrow that will allow due

00:20:18,529 --> 00:20:24,350
process to happen or do you reject the

00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:26,659
whole idea I mean so I've been working

00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:29,059
in the surround space for for nearly a

00:20:26,659 --> 00:20:32,239
decade and it it tends to create some

00:20:29,059 --> 00:20:33,980
degree of cynicism and I apologize for

00:20:32,239 --> 00:20:37,129
bringing my cynical baggage to the stage

00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:38,779
here you know I think what we've seen

00:20:37,129 --> 00:20:41,090
time and time again through the Snowden

00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:42,649
disclosures is that the government asks

00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:44,029
for a front door they use the front door

00:20:42,649 --> 00:20:47,899
and then they go in the back door as

00:20:44,029 --> 00:20:49,879
well right so every day tech companies

00:20:47,899 --> 00:20:51,980
like Google like Twitter like Facebook

00:20:49,879 --> 00:20:53,929
receive law enforcement demands from

00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:55,820
governments around the world there are

00:20:53,929 --> 00:20:57,830
dedicated teams of employees at these

00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:59,929
companies who do nothing but turnover

00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:03,619
user data in response to appropriate

00:20:59,929 --> 00:21:05,899
legal process and if that was if that

00:21:03,619 --> 00:21:06,799
was it that might be fine but what did

00:21:05,899 --> 00:21:09,679
we learn through the Snowden disclosures

00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:10,820
just you know while governments were

00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:12,919
going through the front door and

00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:13,850
demanding in the information by

00:21:12,919 --> 00:21:16,609
individual users

00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:18,470
GCHQ was then monitoring that the

00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:20,149
private links between Google and

00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:21,710
Microsoft and Yahoo's data centers and

00:21:20,149 --> 00:21:23,379
collecting everything they possibly

00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:26,720
could about those users communications

00:21:23,379 --> 00:21:29,539
governments are greedy and I'm loathe to

00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,340
give them more front door access because

00:21:29,539 --> 00:21:33,679
I know they will continue to go through

00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:36,049
the back door as well and so if we give

00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:39,200
them key escrow they will still hack our

00:21:36,049 --> 00:21:40,669
devices it's not like we're gonna trade

00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,950
one for the other this isn't Indiana

00:21:40,669 --> 00:21:47,029
Jones where we swap you know the bag of

00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:49,039
sand in my reluctance is if we give them

00:21:47,029 --> 00:21:50,059
key escrow they're gonna take that and

00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:51,289
then they're gonna continue to do

00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:56,160
everything else they're doing behind

00:21:51,289 --> 00:21:58,220
closed doors okay thank you

00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,220
