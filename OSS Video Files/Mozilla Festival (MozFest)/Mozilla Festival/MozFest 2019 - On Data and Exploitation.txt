00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,440
all right I got a view over there my

00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:07,440
name is Xavier Harding this is Mozilla

00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,929
Foundation festival 2019 this is the

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,519
tenth anniversary

00:00:08,929 --> 00:00:12,530
I'm not just some random guy I'm a tech

00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,420
journalist based in New York City

00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:18,060
because I work at the market org we

00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:20,820
cover tech its impact in society and

00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:22,050
ethics but you're definitely here for me

00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,960
I'm not an interesting well you're here

00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:26,910
for our the speakers and panelists

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,840
including the first one we have up for

00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:31,050
you today

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,250
kata Jana show me Olivet she is the

00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:34,649
co-founder and president of the

00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,940
panopticon foundation and she's a lawyer

00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:38,850
and activist specializing in human

00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:51,449
rights and tech so no further ado

00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:53,850
Cartagena okay so you arrived at Moss

00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:55,800
Fest which and it's a tenth one or the

00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:58,260
first one so that makes me think that

00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,809
you must be believers

00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:04,320
you must be people who actually believe

00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:07,049
that a better more humane form of

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:09,840
technology is possible probably when you

00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:12,510
hear a trustworthy AI you don't think of

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,430
this as another buzzword that tech

00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:16,740
people will use to sell products to

00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:18,600
their existing client but actually as

00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:20,610
something more ambitious than them as a

00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,130
real project that we can all work

00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:26,040
towards so I'm not here to complain that

00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:28,380
our reality is very very different from

00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,299
this beautiful vision I'm not here to

00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:32,549
tell you that this is not possible or to

00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:35,009
stop you from dreaming if you are ready

00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:36,869
to build these solutions just go and do

00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:39,810
it don't wait for people like me lawyers

00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:42,689
to tell you how but I also assume that

00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:45,810
some of us might be a bit lost

00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:48,750
that we might need some road maps on how

00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:50,670
to move in this better direction I'm

00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:52,920
here today to share with you a couple of

00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:56,610
insights from my own intellectual

00:01:52,920 --> 00:02:00,060
journey from my own struggle to imagine

00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:02,460
this better data ecosystem because I'm

00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:05,340
also one of the believers I also want to

00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:08,250
move things just before I move them I

00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:12,000
like to have some sense of direction I'm

00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:13,510
going in so about directions and about

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,370
road maps

00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:17,950
when I start I usually search from

00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:20,500
defining the place where I don't want to

00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:23,170
be the spots on the map that I've know

00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:25,090
only too well and I don't want to visit

00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:27,549
them again and again and get stuck in

00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:31,060
the same paradigm this is one of these

00:02:27,549 --> 00:02:34,420
places our condition of being users

00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:37,629
which was defined by commercial actors

00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:40,480
that invited us to this space two

00:02:37,629 --> 00:02:43,690
decades ago is one of these places that

00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,269
we don't want to visit again and this is

00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:49,629
a deeply commercial paradigm that is not

00:02:46,269 --> 00:02:51,910
really focusing on human it's not really

00:02:49,629 --> 00:02:54,670
putting human in the center that's a

00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:58,060
fallacy what it really does well yes it

00:02:54,670 --> 00:03:00,760
pro its promising choice to us but that

00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:03,220
choice is really limited you can only

00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:05,079
choose better privacy settings well if

00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:07,090
there were privacy but they are not even

00:03:05,079 --> 00:03:09,310
about privacy settings but still we

00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:11,680
remain within the same deeply

00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:15,099
commercialized paradigm where we have to

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:18,340
accept that the key core central deal is

00:03:15,099 --> 00:03:21,519
to exchange data for a service and that

00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:23,950
deal is not fair many of us accepted it

00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:27,190
long time ago because I believe we were

00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:29,769
not fully aware of the amount of data

00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:30,430
that is actually flowing in this

00:03:29,769 --> 00:03:32,650
transaction

00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:35,169
we probably imagined something along

00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:37,480
these lines that we feed the system with

00:03:35,169 --> 00:03:40,120
the data of our choice that will tell it

00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:43,000
what we want the system to know about us

00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:44,859
but by now obviously we know that the

00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,410
reality is different

00:03:44,859 --> 00:03:49,660
it's much more complicated that the key

00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:52,359
element of this transaction is something

00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:55,180
that Susanna Zubov defined as behavioral

00:03:52,359 --> 00:03:57,609
surplus and in this tech bubble we've

00:03:55,180 --> 00:04:00,790
been discussing this flow of data for a

00:03:57,609 --> 00:04:03,849
very long time this is the whole number

00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:07,239
of metadata observations made about

00:04:03,849 --> 00:04:10,209
humans how we move how we interact how

00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:12,459
we click how we think how we react to a

00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:15,370
content that is presented to us and this

00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:17,979
is what really feeds these systems we've

00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:20,019
read on knowledge this is what gives its

00:04:17,979 --> 00:04:22,390
power over us humans because it

00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:24,849
generates these observations generated

00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:27,060
by billions of people at that point they

00:04:24,849 --> 00:04:29,940
really generate extremely

00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:31,470
vailable knowledge about humankind it's

00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:34,080
a big word but I think that's exactly

00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:35,370
what it is and when you go deeper in

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,530
that knowledge this is when it gets

00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:41,100
really interesting this is when you find

00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:43,410
all these predictions always intelligent

00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:45,840
guessing all the inferred hidden data

00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:48,360
that we would never agree to reveal like

00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:51,930
our health conditions our psychometric

00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:54,540
profile our vulnerabilities life changes

00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:57,210
life choices difficult situations we go

00:04:54,540 --> 00:05:00,090
through all sorts of vulnerabilities

00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:03,210
that can be used and are used against us

00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:05,639
obviously we know why this knowledge is

00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:08,550
generated it is generated for the sake

00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:12,300
of influence it is there for commercial

00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:14,970
actors to come with money buy tools like

00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:17,270
targeted advertising or buy place in the

00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:21,360
newsfeed that we will watch and

00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:24,120
influence us influence our choices this

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,700
is not a fair deal in this deal

00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:29,460
we are constantly observed on one hand

00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:31,890
and constantly targeted on the other

00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:34,710
hand we understand this by now but do we

00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:36,630
really accept this I don't and that's

00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:39,030
why I suggest that we move to something

00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:41,130
to something else but before we move to

00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:45,360
something else this is more or less how

00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:48,870
I see existing data ecosystem the deeply

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:51,510
commercialized one when service is just

00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:54,300
a smokescreen for influence service is

00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:56,460
just something that we are seduced with

00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:59,039
that we are trotted ways to play this

00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:01,650
game but really we are the targets and

00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:04,370
we are constantly being influenced and

00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:07,110
our data is used as a tool of power

00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:09,419
against against us this is something

00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:12,479
that we want to depart from but it's

00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:14,910
very tricky how to leave that condition

00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:17,400
it's very tricky for yet another reason

00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:20,130
which can be summarized in the following

00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:22,950
way that the same powerful actors the

00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:26,310
same dominated companies today control

00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:27,840
both the storage of your data all the

00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:30,120
data you generate and all the data that

00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,220
is generated about you all the content

00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,889
you put in the system and the

00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:37,110
interpretation of this data the story

00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:39,720
that is told by this data I came up with

00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:40,450
this very simple way of explaining it

00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,190
thanks to

00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:44,170
Ahmir brother and an artist and a

00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:46,090
storyteller based in New York who helped

00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:48,400
me with this in one brainstorm so I owe

00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:51,580
this to Amir and I think it's a great

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:54,400
way of explaining the very complex power

00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:56,920
that we are subjected to yes right now

00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,990
storage and story is controlled by the

00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:01,390
same entity but it doesn't have to be

00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:03,490
this way right I can imagine that there

00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:06,180
is a split between the two there is a

00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:09,880
crack in which we can start introducing

00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:12,190
new actors like ourselves we can start

00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:14,650
creating different types of well maybe

00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:16,960
not services maybe experiences that are

00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:19,510
not services that are between the data

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:23,050
stored by one entity and a story told by

00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:25,720
another or a story told by us this is

00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:28,600
the kind of shifting power that I really

00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:30,870
want to see and then if that happens I

00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:34,300
can imagine that the new data ecosystem

00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:36,550
starts delivering value value not

00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:38,530
service that we stopped thinking in

00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:40,690
these deeply commercialized terms where

00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:42,760
it's all about the service let's imagine

00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:44,740
the world without the business models I

00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:47,110
think it should also be possible not to

00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:48,850
eliminate them but just not to get stuck

00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:49,960
in thinking that we need a business

00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:52,810
model for everything

00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:54,400
what about solving societal problems we

00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:56,380
have so many of them right and we've

00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,780
been dreaming about data becoming a tool

00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:01,270
for this solutions how about we just

00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:03,220
start doing it or how about delivering a

00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:04,960
very personal value to us something that

00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:06,520
like playing with data like being

00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,950
creative with data being playful

00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:11,800
without thinking immediately of us as

00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:15,220
pursue Murs who will create new services

00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:17,950
I think that new roles new patterns of

00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:21,820
using data should become possible if

00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:25,620
only if only we created crap we create

00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:28,480
that space and we get control over data

00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:31,720
sure I mean it gets complicated in this

00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:34,840
point I'm aware of this so in my picture

00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:36,820
of a better data ecosystem data clearly

00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:38,440
remains in the center clearly is

00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:40,930
important element of the whole faith but

00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:44,200
the power dynamics around this and the

00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:47,110
potential roles and patterns of using it

00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:49,210
can be very different they could be very

00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:51,610
different if we got the real control

00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:53,740
over data I'm not going to give you

00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:56,440
today answer for how to

00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:57,970
yet there if I have it you know I would

00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,680
come with a final solution and I'm

00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:02,950
coming with some form of a roadmap

00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:05,380
hoping that also we as a movement not as

00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:08,020
individual sitting in closed rooms but

00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:10,120
as a movement can come up with some but

00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:12,330
I have one idea that I can test

00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:14,970
something that we can imagine as

00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:18,580
possibility on the way which I call

00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:21,940
regulated API I'm thinking about new

00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:24,190
type of interface which opens access to

00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:26,050
data that are now that is not controlled

00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:28,570
by these dominant platforms but the

00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:31,779
biggest players and that access to data

00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:33,940
becomes non-discriminatory becomes open

00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:36,339
to everybody who want to play with data

00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:39,430
be creative of data create own services

00:09:36,339 --> 00:09:42,310
question the existing services why I'm

00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:44,709
saying this why I need a new API if all

00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:46,660
of you know this we have api's for

00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:48,940
developers that work quite well for the

00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:51,700
market that's exactly the problem we

00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:54,250
have API is that work for the market for

00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:56,709
commercial services that transfer money

00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:58,990
from developers to dominating platforms

00:09:56,709 --> 00:10:01,180
if I don't want to talk about money if I

00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:03,790
want to imagine non-commercial solution

00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:05,980
solutions then I'm stuck in a user role

00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:08,200
I'm stuck in a role of somebody who's

00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:10,300
sitting in a passive position with these

00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:12,730
privacy settings and can only click yes

00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:13,510
or no or go away I want a different

00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:16,899
situation

00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:19,089
I want API that can give access to us as

00:10:16,899 --> 00:10:21,279
users well maybe not all of the users

00:10:19,089 --> 00:10:23,920
may be problem solvers or simply

00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:25,959
citizens and also give access to public

00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,360
service providers who have the courage

00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:30,190
to offer non-commercial solutions we

00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,779
need a regulator in this game because

00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:33,730
without the regulator I'm afraid that

00:10:31,779 --> 00:10:35,980
the existing dominant companies will

00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:39,399
simply follow us into something which is

00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:41,290
not a truthful picture of the data they

00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:43,390
generated about us it's not a full

00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:46,170
picture that the third layer I was

00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:48,940
showing you on the graph is still

00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:51,370
invisible it's still non transparent and

00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:54,850
I want to see it I wanted to be able to

00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:58,300
correct it to discuss with it to modify

00:10:54,850 --> 00:11:00,640
the story that is told about me based on

00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:03,370
my data and for that thing I need this

00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:05,050
this new API and if we have it if we

00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:07,180
have that situation where we control

00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:09,010
data and where we have

00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:11,440
some kind of interface which is

00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:13,930
independent from existing dominant

00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,860
players then we can imagine different

00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:19,630
use cases I can imagine a municipality

00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:21,640
solving transportation problem with uber

00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:24,100
data I can imagine health care provider

00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:27,340
learning from Google search data about

00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:29,500
the next disease coming up and enrolling

00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:32,620
vaccination programs and I can imagine

00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:35,290
myself correcting my profile to get

00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:37,710
better newsfeed of my choice and I can

00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:40,030
imagine us as movement creating

00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:42,730
non-commercial solutions that might

00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:44,770
modify news feeds news feeds of all

00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:46,630
sorts not just on Facebook but basically

00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:50,350
the content people receive modified

00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:51,970
algorithms that curate this content to

00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:55,270
solve certain problems like this

00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:58,570
information or hate speech or you know

00:11:55,270 --> 00:12:00,490
gender issues or LGBTQ issues we could

00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:03,400
solve them by curating content in a

00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:06,190
different way if if we can access this

00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:09,220
data ecosystem as active agents as

00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:11,830
co-creators and not just passive users

00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:14,380
so this kind of scenarios I have in mind

00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:18,160
when I imagine this new deal on data and

00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:20,530
yes I do think it is possible I think it

00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,570
must be possible the question here is

00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:24,850
whether it will be possible as a

00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:28,120
market-driven project something with

00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:30,820
commercial business in mind or whether

00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:33,040
it has to be a political project if

00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:34,450
that's the latter if we think about this

00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,780
as political project then we need

00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:39,520
somebody to deliver it I cannot right

00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:41,860
now think of any better place than

00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:44,860
European Union and honestly if they

00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:48,900
propose green New Deal why wouldn't they

00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:48,900
propose New Zealand data or maybe

00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:58,560
other societal problems and solve them

00:12:56,009 --> 00:13:00,870
all together as one package I think it's

00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:03,449
a clearly an ambitious project but a

00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:05,670
realistic one we only need to generate

00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:07,740
some political will and this is my job

00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:09,930
this is what I'm doing in panopticon

00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:13,399
foundation thanks for listening and I

00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:13,399
hope we can discuss a road map together

00:13:15,769 --> 00:13:22,230
all right so we can now open it up to

00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:27,240
audience Q&A if ever has any questions

00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:29,339
for a cappuccino anybody have any

00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:31,949
questions I think you did such a good

00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:35,420
job that nobody has cancer ideas okay

00:13:31,949 --> 00:13:35,420
all right yeah see No

00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:46,200
well it might coming by the way so I'm

00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:48,330
more than sure that companies won't be

00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:52,440
willing to give that their hard-earned

00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:55,050
data just for free so how would you kind

00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:58,770
of incentivize people to to be aware of

00:13:55,050 --> 00:14:00,710
it and to make politicians aware of it

00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:03,620
as well because politicians tend to be

00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:06,480
not up to date usually most of the time

00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:08,880
so how will we do that because that

00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:12,780
requires a lot of effort I'm I don't

00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:15,330
expect it to to answer it perfectly and

00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:17,400
to know all the answers but it would be

00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:19,980
encouraging to know please somehow how

00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:21,570
would we do that thanks good question

00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:24,180
yes I don't have all the answers but I

00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:26,460
have some first we have GDP our we have

00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:29,610
data protection law that actually gives

00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:31,590
us even today right to fully access all

00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:33,660
the layers of this profile I was drawing

00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:35,970
it just doesn't work because companies

00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:38,490
refuse it but their law is already there

00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:41,700
so if we come to this ecosystem if we

00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:44,010
start using these api's as data subjects

00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:46,440
as people who come to access own data

00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:48,360
companies cannot really say no they

00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:51,990
already have legal obligation to review

00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:55,350
it to even move it if we request they

00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:58,020
just don't do it or do it partially so

00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:59,970
on one hand it is about existing using

00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:03,780
existing laws but in a more forceful way

00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:06,210
or putting another form of supervision

00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:08,670
another regulator for this digital

00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:12,840
market to basically force them to do so

00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:14,300
on the other hand it is about a new form

00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:18,840
of market regulation you can think about

00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:20,580
energy or gas or broadcasting different

00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:22,680
markets that were regulating in the past

00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:24,570
in a similar way we're a regular was

00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:27,570
created to supervise it and say hey

00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:29,730
certain harms caused by the current

00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:32,310
ecosystem have to be prevented and that

00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:34,710
thinking is quite mature and it's quite

00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:37,050
metro on both sides of the Atlantic I

00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:39,510
keep seeing headlines also in us-based

00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:40,890
media about well chopping them are the

00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:43,700
breaking them up I'm not a big fan of

00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:46,230
this scenario I think we should rather

00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:49,260
leave the data where it is in a sense

00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:50,790
that I want I don't want to destroy the

00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:53,090
knowledge generated by these platforms I

00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:54,550
want to be able to build on their

00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:55,899
infrastructure

00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:58,930
better and more humane and more

00:15:55,899 --> 00:16:01,480
delivering value to us so even without

00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:04,209
destroying these existing structures we

00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:05,890
can expect them to share a lot of the

00:16:04,209 --> 00:16:08,560
knowledge they generate under this

00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:11,130
paradigm that you know either we either

00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:14,410
regret was come and destroy them or they

00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:16,570
start depending delivering some kind of

00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:18,670
societal value and that thinking is

00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:20,320
quite mature also in European Commission

00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:22,120
when you see the current composition of

00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,640
it there is Margaret versus tiger

00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:26,350
quite famous for having that thinking

00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:29,019
also in past five years so I think

00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:30,760
politically it's becoming a really

00:16:29,019 --> 00:16:34,209
realistic that we have that move that

00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:40,810
push bring a microphone over to you

00:16:34,209 --> 00:16:42,579
thank you I'm very uncomfortable about

00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:46,420
the idea of people controlling their

00:16:42,579 --> 00:16:48,550
data companies like Big Data because

00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:50,820
they consider it more objective because

00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:53,079
the data we put online we often lie

00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:55,690
particular about sensitive issues like

00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:57,399
race and sex and other issues could you

00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:59,170
just talk about how you see us

00:16:57,399 --> 00:17:01,540
controlling our data so that we can be

00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:05,559
if the data can be objective and we're

00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:07,390
not just lying to everybody well I don't

00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:10,000
think it's so easy to lie this base I

00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:11,890
think that's exactly why this system of

00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,720
power and influence works so well today

00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:15,790
because even if you trying to lie even

00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:21,069
if we try to modify this first layer

00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:23,819
with some you know intelligent picture

00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:26,709
of ourselves it's not really going to

00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:28,630
the algorithms know that we lie they

00:17:26,709 --> 00:17:31,960
know that we are different in reality

00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:35,440
and for me it's not about creating more

00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:37,390
space for us to to lie or to avoid you

00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,760
know showcasing our real selves it

00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:42,730
really is about us controlling how that

00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:44,050
knowledge is then used right I I have

00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:46,510
nothing against this knowledge being

00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:48,400
generated I have something a lot against

00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:50,890
this knowledge being being being used to

00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,990
influence me without my consent and

00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:55,030
awareness so that's why I'm advocating

00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:57,669
for control I'm not advocating for

00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:59,620
control to to you know help people hide

00:17:57,669 --> 00:18:01,750
or help people avoid being visible

00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:04,570
online the control mechanism I have in

00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:07,260
mind is really about deciding how that

00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:10,650
knowledge about us can then the

00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:13,050
come useful for society rather than for

00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:15,630
for these companies and it doesn't have

00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:17,240
to be a individual controlling his/her

00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:20,430
data it doesn't have to be all of us

00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:22,050
extremely busy every day you know using

00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:24,450
data management systems I don't buy this

00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:26,210
scenario I rather think about some forms

00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:28,890
of data trials or collective

00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:33,450
organizations nonprofit organizations

00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:36,330
that we trust we let them know how we

00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:38,100
want to be managed our data how we want

00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:40,590
to manage it and they do it for us I

00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:42,870
think that's a new service model or

00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:47,030
nonprofit model it depends which one you

00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:47,030
prefer that can be a really generated

00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:56,040
yeah right here in the front thank you

00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:58,650
I'd like to explore a bit more where you

00:18:56,040 --> 00:19:01,320
see politically that this is going to be

00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:04,310
picked up most in the u.s. there is a

00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:07,280
bill now being floated or thought about

00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:09,510
regarding data portability which is

00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:12,330
building up on building sort of on

00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:15,180
what's in the GDP are regarding data

00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:18,600
portability on the other hand we see the

00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:21,960
new Commission in the EU talking a lot

00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:25,440
about legislation regarding AI related

00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:27,630
things which part do you think this as a

00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,600
political movement would link in most

00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:32,310
strongly I strongly believe that we have

00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,870
to think about both of them and they

00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:36,690
have to be in communication these

00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:38,970
companies mostly are based or come from

00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:40,650
the US but they also operate in Europe

00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:43,380
and they will not ignore Europe Europe

00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:45,510
is still far too big in a wealthy market

00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:48,600
to be ignored so it probably has to be a

00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:52,200
dialogue or a concert of these two major

00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:53,490
powers European Union also has something

00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,960
else on the table which is called the

00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:57,330
digital Services Act I believe people

00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:00,180
will talk about more and more about this

00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:01,290
tomorrow in a panel with actually a

00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:03,870
person from the European Commission

00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:06,860
working on that thing so that's the

00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:09,780
first political realistically speaking

00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:11,460
moment or place where we can expect some

00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:13,890
of these changes to be introduced not

00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:17,010
all of them I use this metaphor with

00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:18,480
having digital digital Emperor's today

00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:20,370
it's you know Facebook's and googles of

00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,950
this world they behave like Emperor

00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:24,540
and we can either impose Constitution on

00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:26,460
them and that's the next coming

00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:28,830
legislation from the EU or we can take

00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:30,600
some power from the Emperor's hopefully

00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:32,970
removing the Emperor's at some point

00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:35,010
that second shift in power is far more

00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:37,710
difficult and I think that's that the

00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:39,060
next deal together with the u.s. some

00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:41,100
kind of breaking up some kind of

00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:43,740
functional separation like I suggest

00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:46,020
data from service or data from interface

00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:49,050
layer I really think it's doable and

00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:49,860
thinkable nice well I think that's a

00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:52,140
good note to end on

00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:55,170
Cartagena schemey Olivette everyone to

00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:58,250
rely on applause thank you so much for

00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:58,250
