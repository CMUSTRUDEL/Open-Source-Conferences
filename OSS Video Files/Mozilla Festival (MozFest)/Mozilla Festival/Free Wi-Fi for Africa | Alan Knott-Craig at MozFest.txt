we have Alan not Craig who's come in

00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:06,600
from South Africa and hit the title of

00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:09,240
his talk is a free Wi-Fi for Africa so

00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:32,099
just a just a tiny ambitionally has Alan

00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:35,370
I see him okay so thank you for the

00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:37,860
invitation to be here my presentation is

00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:40,800
about free Wi-Fi for Africa it's not

00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:42,510
it's not very theoretical maybe the guys

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,890
can just go to the next slide they're

00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:45,420
just three slides I need to start with

00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:47,160
just to give people some perspective

00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:52,050
about what internet infrastructure is

00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:54,600
like that's a father mech for

00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,219
sub-saharan mostly and as you can see

00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,570
there's virtually this father virtually

00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:59,190
everywhere at the moment and there's a

00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:00,870
lot of fibre connecting the continent to

00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:03,239
the rest of the world so when people

00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:04,799
talk about internet access in Africa and

00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:06,630
they say you know maybe the problem is

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:11,400
fiber there's no fiber problems if you

00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:16,020
could go to the next slide one back the

00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:18,360
I mean you skipped a slide there 69

00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:19,680
smartphones are also not a problem for

00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,810
those of you don't live in South Africa

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,210
two out of three families have access to

00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:26,159
a smart device but any one out of three

00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:27,930
people are actually switching on 3G on

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,700
their phone the reason for that is it's

00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:31,470
a bit like when I come to London ah I

00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,180
switch off 3G on my phone and I rent a

00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:35,400
run around looking for free Wi-Fi the

00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,630
roaming costs are too expensive 3G costs

00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,119
are too expensive if you go to the next

00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:41,130
slide if you watch an eight minute

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:44,100
YouTube video in South Africa it will

00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:45,810
cost you about $7 so average family in

00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:48,299
South Africa owns 210 dollars a month

00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:50,369
that means you can watch about 30 movies

00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:54,479
in one month on YouTube for 10 minutes

00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:57,079
and then your money's gone so if you

00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:59,790
look at the the internet environment of

00:01:57,079 --> 00:02:02,399
Africa and South Africa if you go to the

00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:03,689
next slide the problem is not fiber

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,520
because there's lots of fiber but the

00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:10,830
problem is not smartphones the problem

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:11,310
is there's no affordable Wireless so

00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,170
let's just

00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:14,520
put that in context behavioral patterns

00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:16,650
for people using the Internet in South

00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,810
Africa as mostly to do with mobile

00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:20,280
phones see on your phone you connected

00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:21,959
to the Internet most people are not

00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,580
using computers at home or Wi-Fi at home

00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:25,440
they're using their mobile phones most

00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:27,780
people are using 3G and they're using

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,459
prepaid data now historically when you

00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,989
use prepaid data you can measure the

00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:32,069
amount of a time you're using because

00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:33,450
you can count the seconds

00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:35,069
you can't the seconds you know how much

00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:37,140
eight times been taken you can budget

00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:39,540
when you're on data if you open a

00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:42,450
website like Wikipedia or YouTube etc

00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:43,830
it's been charged in megabits and you

00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:46,140
can't be sure how many megabits are

00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:48,420
being used so if you're sitting with

00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:50,280
called a $10 of airtime in your wallet

00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,840
as soon as you go on the internet you're

00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,970
a time starts getting sucked out and

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,160
it's and before you know it's all gone

00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:58,319
so people can't measure how much they

00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,299
have so even though the internet is very

00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:03,870
expensive and I forget say eight dollars

00:03:00,299 --> 00:03:05,610
for a seven minute video if you took it

00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:07,410
90% down you would still have people

00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:08,880
saying off the internet simply because

00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:10,950
they can't figure out how much a time is

00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:12,390
going off they account and when you've

00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:14,340
done the math enough for the whole thing

00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:16,470
you realize the the solution is not more

00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:19,019
affordable Internet the solution is free

00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:21,030
into it if you want to get people online

00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:23,430
in South Africa and in Africa you need

00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:27,510
to make the intent completely free next

00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:28,950
slide so before I go into how we've

00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:30,390
figured out how to make the internet

00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:31,950
free they may give a little bit of

00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:33,780
background about myself I'm actually a

00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:36,630
chartered accountant I have a numbers

00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:38,489
background in 2003 I came back to South

00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:40,380
Africa from New York and I couldn't get

00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:42,209
a job so I started my own business and

00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:44,450
I've been until he comes for about 15

00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:46,799
years now doing till he comes and tich

00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:48,750
in 2010 I started a business called

00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,549
world of Avatar we invested in lots of

00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:52,200
tech startups one of which was the

00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:55,470
biggest social network in Africa at the

00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:57,329
time a company will mix it and in 2012

00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:58,530
or so I finished all of that and I

00:03:57,329 --> 00:04:00,420
realize the big problem for tech

00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:03,000
companies in South Africa and Africa is

00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:04,889
we don't have a beginner local audience

00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,730
so it's quite difficult to build a

00:04:04,889 --> 00:04:08,010
business when you don't have enough

00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:10,260
people in your in your own country to

00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:11,700
kind of have a critical mass part of the

00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:13,200
reason China and America keeps producing

00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:15,810
the tech giants is because there's such

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,940
a big local audience of people online so

00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:19,890
until countries in Africa have lots of

00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:22,109
people online we can't expect to build

00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:24,360
big tech companies so I thought before

00:04:22,109 --> 00:04:26,360
we go and build any I spend any more

00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,470
money trying to bull tech companies

00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:30,659
maybe we can tackle the problem of

00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:32,490
getting people online fist which got me

00:04:30,659 --> 00:04:34,560
to this realization that the problem is

00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:36,690
not fiber the problems not smartphones

00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,460
the problem is the cost of connectivity

00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:41,640
and the only way you can solve that

00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:43,740
problem is to get it down to free so we

00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:45,840
started in India in 2013 called Project

00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:47,190
DC's where and he sees where two

00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,310
missions one was to figure out a way to

00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:52,320
reduce the cost of Internet networks to

00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:54,180
as low as possible and then we try to

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:57,120
figure out ways to fund that internet

00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:58,400
without charging consumers so the first

00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,740
point we have to tackle was technology

00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:03,570
there's two big ways you can connect to

00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:06,030
the internet one is through fixed-line

00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:07,289
and one is Wireless most people in

00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:08,760
Africa and pretty in the world will not

00:05:07,289 --> 00:05:10,200
be using fixed lines to get on the

00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:13,320
internet so you can only really look at

00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:14,969
Wireless as a option again in Africa you

00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,360
have two choices when it comes to

00:05:14,969 --> 00:05:19,800
wireless

00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:21,240
3G LTE that technology or Wi-Fi the

00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,849
problem with 3G is it cost quite a lot

00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:25,530
of money to roll out those networks and

00:05:22,849 --> 00:05:28,680
the skills are quite expensive as well

00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:30,570
so we decided to go with Wi-Fi Wi-Fi has

00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,310
got some massive advantages one

00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:33,450
advantages that almost every device now

00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:35,070
has Wi-Fi inside it

00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:37,110
in fact more devices nowadays are coming

00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:39,000
out with Wi-Fi only and leaving the 3G

00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:40,680
heart so we didn't have to worry about

00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,419
devices as soon as you get into the game

00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,130
of trying to provide devices in a market

00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:46,110
like South Africa a very poor economy

00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:50,550
you have lots of theft and security and

00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:52,409
it cost a lot of money so the vast

00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:53,700
penetration works for Wi-Fi the second

00:05:52,409 --> 00:05:55,710
thing that works for Wi-Fi is the cost

00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:57,599
of the network if you're all at a Wi-Fi

00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:59,820
base station an actual access point so

00:05:57,599 --> 00:06:02,460
say outside this building you put a big

00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:04,979
by five dish up and cover the whole

00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:06,330
square that costs you say two thousand

00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:08,190
five hundred dollars something

00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:09,900
equivalent for 3G would cost you about

00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:11,909
twenty five thousand dollars so the

00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:13,620
actual cost of building a network when

00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:16,320
it comes to Wi-Fi is a much cheaper than

00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:18,780
the other wireless technologies like LTE

00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:21,330
and the last thing is which is very

00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:23,010
important our context is it's the skills

00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:25,890
are pretty cheap to train and recruit

00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:29,880
and employ so you can't necessarily

00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:30,930
build a big 3G network in Africa without

00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:33,000
being a hell of a lot of money on

00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:34,830
salaries because it's so technical and

00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,540
the skills are so scarce we're

00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:38,190
Wi-Fi is pretty simple files actually

00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:39,810
been designed so that average person

00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,920
just installed it in their house you

00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:44,480
just have to be able to climb a ladder

00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:47,280
plugging the HSD clamor for not die so

00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:49,200
we we figured out Wi-Fi is the most

00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,450
affordable technology in the world if

00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:53,730
you wanted to lower the cost of Internet

00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:55,560
access the next one we had to figure out

00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:57,600
was okay if you can reduce the cost of

00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,820
connectivity how do you find people to

00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:03,540
pay for that connectivity on behalf of

00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:05,520
of the user now in South Africa I'm not

00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:07,140
sure what the rules they have but and

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,970
the constitution of South Africa says

00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:10,830
that everybody should be entitled to

00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:12,960
certain basic goods like water and

00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:14,220
lectricity and roads and sanitation so

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,200
regardless of whether you have any money

00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:18,120
you should have a daily quota for free

00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:21,480
of water and a daily quota for free of

00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:23,030
electricity those Goods are funded by a

00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:25,530
tax so

00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:26,820
20% of the country pays taxes and 100%

00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:29,100
of the country gets the benefits of

00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:30,240
these basic goods so we felt we could go

00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,440
to the government and convince the

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,090
government that the Internet should be

00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,290
so they should start treating the

00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:36,060
internet the way they treat to water

00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:39,240
electricity so basic good and there

00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:42,360
should be a subsidy and in 2013 I met

00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:44,160
the mayor of 2020 is the capital of

00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:46,980
South Africa used to be called Pretoria

00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,810
I met the mayor Coco she and ceramic

00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:50,400
oppa and he kind of agreed with us that

00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:52,200
that's not a bad idea and when we

00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,180
explained him how the numbers would work

00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,770
it was a lot cheaper and the equivalent

00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:58,230
of British Telecom was quoting for him

00:07:55,770 --> 00:08:00,330
so we started the slow project and in

00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:03,300
November 2013 we rolled out five sites

00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:05,550
of public view public free Wi-Fi it's

00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:07,980
very simple there's no user name there's

00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:10,170
no login it doesn't require you know

00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:12,180
it's absolutely no complexity to getting

00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:14,720
online it's completely anonymous which

00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:17,190
is quite important for first-time users

00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,200
it's pretty fast and you get a daily

00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:22,080
it's about 15 mix per second and you get

00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:23,610
a daily quota of 500 mix and there's

00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,680
only one censorship and that's adult

00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:27,240
content so you can't because we don't

00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,430
know how old you are the only thing we

00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:31,290
we block all these global black lists of

00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:33,060
adult content I mean almost every day

00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:34,890
today we get an email from somebody with

00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:36,930
a scanned copy of their ID and an

00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:40,979
affidavit promising that they're over 18

00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:44,100
can we unblock something so that's the

00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:46,050
only censorship and since the and what

00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:47,430
happened for the politicians as as soon

00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:48,450
as they started rolling out the public

00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:51,840
Wi-Fi they started

00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:55,770
the votes of the youngsters so today 20

00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:58,200
has 1076 sites about 130,000 people log

00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:59,730
in every day it's it's regarded as the

00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,370
biggest municipal public Wi-Fi network

00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:03,990
in Africana and we thought like we've

00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:05,220
cracked the code we reduced the cost of

00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:06,510
the internet and we've managed to

00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:08,970
convince the government to start funding

00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:10,710
it but in four years of me meeting many

00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:12,330
mayors and many governors and premiers

00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:14,430
and ministers I haven't met the

00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:16,080
president yet we haven't managed to

00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:17,970
succeed in convincing anybody else to

00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:22,350
copy 20 Wi-Fi unlikely I haven't met

00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:24,600
Jacob zoom here haven't managed to

00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:27,390
convince anybody to copy but Ronnie

00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:29,730
Wi-Fi model now the reasons for that the

00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:31,470
first reason is a lot of the political

00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:33,270
leaders are too old do you think the IMP

00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:34,980
teen is important I've basically come up

00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:36,540
with the rule of thumb if a person's

00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:38,190
over the age of 60 they don't think the

00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:39,600
Internet is important and a lot of our

00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:41,550
leaders are just too old but I'm fully

00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,180
appreciated but if they do you

00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:44,310
appreciate it

00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:45,360
sometimes they're corrupt and we're

00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:47,160
dealing with the government and we're

00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,350
dealing with African governments which I

00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:51,000
like all governments in the world is all

00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:53,130
as the potential for somebody asking for

00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,540
something funny and the third big

00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:55,950
problem is even if you find people who

00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:57,690
buy into the concept of the internet

00:09:55,950 --> 00:10:00,990
being important and they're completely

00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:02,220
honest you don't always have budget so

00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:03,600
you know this always comes back to money

00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,610
everything always comes back to who's

00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,600
gonna pay the bills

00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:08,670
now South Africa is quite fortunate

00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,540
we've got quite a big tech space and we

00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:11,700
can pay for these infrastructure

00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:13,440
projects not every country is like that

00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:15,150
but even South Africa is now going into

00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,500
a recession so there's not enough money

00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:19,050
to go around and assume you're not gonna

00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:20,370
start new infrastructure projects so

00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:22,320
we've had to start thinking okay how do

00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:23,550
you roll out these public Wi-Fi networks

00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,250
without relying in the government to

00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:28,170
fund them so we've come up with a couple

00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:29,820
of other models now first thing we did

00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:31,410
is rolled out Wi-Fi around one of the

00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:35,610
high schools in Khayelitsha which is a

00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:37,920
township in the Cape Flats and instead

00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:39,720
of being completely you know just

00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,340
clicking you're on the internet when you

00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,810
click on the it's called hi-fi when you

00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:44,490
click on kaya fire it takes you to a

00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:47,070
page and ask you who are five or a Wi-Fi

00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:48,870
voucher number in order to get a Wi-Fi

00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:50,910
voucher you need to bring litter to the

00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:52,500
school so for every kilogram of litter

00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:55,110
you bring to the school you get a 100

00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:57,180
Meg wife a voucher every day kids bring

00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:58,590
hundreds of kilograms of litter at the

00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,940
end of the week the litter truck comes

00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:01,529
and picks up the litter and we get paid

00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:03,540
for the recycling of the litter

00:11:01,529 --> 00:11:06,360
we take the funds out of that to fund

00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:09,509
the local Wi-Fi the second project we've

00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:12,449
tried is micro learning we trying to do

00:11:09,509 --> 00:11:13,949
its learning for Wi-Fi so when you go on

00:11:12,449 --> 00:11:17,670
the Wi-Fi you click on this landing page

00:11:13,949 --> 00:11:19,319
it says Lynn you click learn it gives

00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:21,420
you a little five minute or two minute

00:11:19,319 --> 00:11:23,189
little via we've tried three different

00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:25,769
things one of which is how to be an uber

00:11:23,189 --> 00:11:27,449
driver so you become this was a basic

00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:29,069
video how to be an uber driver then we

00:11:27,449 --> 00:11:30,329
give you a little test a text but one

00:11:29,069 --> 00:11:31,649
minute to do this little test to see

00:11:30,329 --> 00:11:34,170
whether you absorb the information if

00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:35,970
you pass the test you get given Wi-Fi

00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:37,529
depending on how much we can sell that

00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:39,360
outcome for that depends on how many

00:11:37,529 --> 00:11:40,949
Meg's you get so the regarded companies

00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,829
like uber we say how would you like to

00:11:40,949 --> 00:11:46,680
fund people becoming rubber drivers at

00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:47,850
least being competent repo drivers how

00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,759
much is that worth to you and we take

00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:52,529
those monies and we fund the local Wi-Fi

00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:54,029
that the big funding source for these

00:11:52,529 --> 00:11:56,579
types of projects is becoming mining

00:11:54,029 --> 00:11:59,999
companies so there's a lot of mines in

00:11:56,579 --> 00:12:02,399
South Africa and have lots of local

00:11:59,999 --> 00:12:05,040
communities which are you know not the

00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,600
richest communities in the world but

00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,339
they have a legal requirement to spend

00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,930
between one and two percent of their

00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:12,420
revenue on local socio-economic

00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:13,949
development so what do we do then we go

00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:16,259
to them and say okay if you give us

00:12:13,949 --> 00:12:18,300
let's say the khumba iron ore mine in

00:12:16,259 --> 00:12:20,069
the northern cape generates about a

00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:21,540
billion dollars in revenue a year so

00:12:20,069 --> 00:12:24,420
about twenty five million dollars gets

00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:26,279
it's aside every year for for these

00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:28,680
types of projects if we succeed in

00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:29,879
convincing a company like uber to take

00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,829
that money and put it into the local

00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:33,779
public Wi-Fi projects you can actually

00:12:31,829 --> 00:12:35,399
provide walking distance Wi-Fi for every

00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:39,029
citizen all three million citizens

00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:41,339
living in the northern cap so those are

00:12:39,029 --> 00:12:44,100
our missions I mean in the end I think

00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:46,110
the funding models for these types of

00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:48,809
projects have to become very much more

00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:50,100
profit this is only really one

00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:51,449
sustainable thing in the world that's

00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,949
making a profit if you can make your own

00:12:51,449 --> 00:12:54,929
profits and use those profits to drive

00:12:52,949 --> 00:12:56,730
the free Wi-Fi then it becomes a much

00:12:54,929 --> 00:12:58,379
more self-sustaining thing he sees

00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:59,999
where's role right now is really a jot

00:12:58,379 --> 00:13:01,499
innovating funding models and trying to

00:12:59,999 --> 00:13:02,850
find things that stick and then split

00:13:01,499 --> 00:13:05,249
the parts or other people could try and

00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:07,980
copy them so now when I started all of

00:13:05,249 --> 00:13:09,449
this I was just trying to get more

00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:10,920
people online so that it would be easier

00:13:09,449 --> 00:13:13,740
for me to make money when I start take

00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:15,510
businesses have a big local market but

00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:16,790
you know four years later

00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:19,500
not because it makes a big difference

00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:21,390
I've realized the massive impact that

00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,890
people once people get on the Internet

00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:24,960
how it can change their life

00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:27,060
and I realized that digital inequality

00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:29,040
is just as bad as any other inquiry

00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:31,500
inequality just like economic inequality

00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,790
or educational inequality the difference

00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,200
though is that this digital inequality

00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:35,310
thing can be dealt with

00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,780
you know sometimes feels that other

00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:38,550
things are intractable but this is one

00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:40,350
thing we can actually tackle it's

00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:43,140
already being tackled this is it's not a

00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:45,170
pipe dream it's not academic the city of

00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:47,370
20 is already providing free Wi-Fi

00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:49,560
within walking distance of a million

00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:51,330
citizens if the city of 20 can do it in

00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:53,850
the holiday Africa dirt and that's why I

00:13:51,330 --> 00:14:01,250
know that one day all Africans were left

00:13:53,850 --> 00:14:03,350
free Wi-Fi thank you very much Wow

00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:05,910
amazing

00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:07,110
before I open it to to you guys for

00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:08,820
questions and of course this is called

00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:11,010
dialogues and debates so it's it's about

00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:14,340
the discussion it's about asking

00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:15,120
questions to Alan and I want to ask I'm

00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:16,800
a journalist

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,690
and I'm kind of always interested in to

00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,610
think about the applications for news

00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:24,020
and kind of open societies and in that

00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:26,850
way so so do are there any tie-ins

00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:28,590
so once we'd rolled out the 20 Wi-Fi

00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:30,750
names book we said okay you've got

00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:33,120
public Wi-Fi was the what we put on top

00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:36,660
of the Wi-Fi we created something called

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:38,640
Wi-Fi TV very original name we recruited

00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:39,990
youngsters and the inlet our ships put

00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:42,540
them into teams and become local

00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:45,930
journalists we set up a locus into a

00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:48,090
centralized editor suite and everyday

00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:49,650
the youngsters go and do local stories

00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:51,210
about interviews with the local Reverend

00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:52,950
or interviews with the local politician

00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:55,650
interviews with the local taxi drivers

00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:57,960
we put that stuff we curated we publish

00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:59,990
it and it's like a local online video

00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:02,460
news and then we found company

00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:04,200
foundations like open society foundation

00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:06,300
and a media networks and not actually

00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:09,270
the Western Cape government my starting

00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:11,250
to fund local online news as part of

00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:12,960
their mandates but what they realize is

00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:14,580
that there's no way people can watch it

00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:16,260
unless they've got access so now we

00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,670
don't necessarily always solve the

00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:19,650
concept of free Wi-Fi we sell the

00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:22,710
concept of local online news and you get

00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:26,620
the free Wi-Fi for free hello who else

00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:31,480
has a question okay red top at the back

00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:35,050
yeah yeah public health prevention

00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:37,570
public education isn't this a way that

00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:39,940
government would use the hot free Wi-Fi

00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:43,240
and contribute towards it

00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:43,780
I know instead of learning to be a uber

00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,810
driver

00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:50,620
you could learn how to take better care

00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:52,930
of your health well you know what we're

00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:54,580
trying to do is exactly like that put

00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:56,530
different lipstick on this you know sets

00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:58,090
of appeals to different types budgets

00:15:56,530 --> 00:16:00,850
you know the government has this massive

00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:03,220
kind of pot of money and that gets

00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:04,750
sliced and diced so what we're trying to

00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:05,980
do for instance on this news stuff as we

00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:09,610
try to tap into the government's budget

00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:11,590
for communications instead of tapping

00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:13,450
into budget for infrastructure we tap

00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:15,430
into communications budget health care

00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:17,020
is an obvious one as well economic

00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:18,700
development another one as well as soon

00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:19,810
as you find somebody who says okay

00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,490
internet access leads to economic

00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:24,250
development let's take our budget that's

00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:25,420
for economic development fund why far we

00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:27,340
haven't had any success with any of

00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:30,820
those things I think we don't have the

00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:32,560
most responsive government but but I

00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:34,240
don't think the future is actually going

00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,310
to be always having a government by

00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,200
because they're just too many risks with

00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:40,480
political change and corruption etc you

00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:42,160
have to as it's a hard sell the easiest

00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,690
sell in the world is free so if I can

00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:47,380
offer you free Wi-Fi for free it will be

00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:49,890
easier to get it out there other

00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,890
questions

00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:59,579
my front Kevin on the front I can see

00:16:56,299 --> 00:17:02,369
someone over there right okay thanks

00:16:59,579 --> 00:17:04,620
my question is could you expand on you

00:17:02,369 --> 00:17:06,750
said digital literacy changes people

00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:08,220
lives can you flesh that out for us so

00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:09,390
we can understand better what sort of

00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:12,539
changes you've seen in the community

00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:15,689
once people have Wi-Fi well these three

00:17:12,539 --> 00:17:19,289
stories to that I mean there was this

00:17:15,689 --> 00:17:21,120
youngster Keiko Martin who unemployed as

00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:22,709
20 when we rolled out the twenty Wi-Fi

00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,720
projects it's stuff that he's on a

00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:26,610
credit local online radio station so he

00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:30,149
created his own radio station ended up

00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:31,830
with about 5,000 followers in 20 in

00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:33,090
Pretoria who were following him using

00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:34,980
the public Wi-Fi that he was using to

00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:36,059
broadcast he actually built himself a

00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:39,000
little business that generates about

00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:41,190
$400 a month and he's been in Parliament

00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,419
knives presented in Parliament so there

00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:44,220
was an example of someone who was

00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:46,590
unemployed really had no opportunity and

00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:48,690
just access to the internet changed his

00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:51,000
game and also Gordon in touch with a lot

00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:53,100
of other people in his community the

00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,679
second team which I realized over time

00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:58,260
was when is the last time any of you

00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:59,250
printed your CV and handed it in when

00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,929
most people haven't done that a long

00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:02,309
time I haven't done that in 15 years but

00:18:00,929 --> 00:18:04,169
most people in South Africa are still

00:18:02,309 --> 00:18:06,539
doing that so the way the job market

00:18:04,169 --> 00:18:07,740
works in South Africa is you if you're

00:18:06,539 --> 00:18:09,990
looking for a job you go to a local

00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:12,299
community center the community centers

00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:14,100
have job boards on the wall you send in

00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:15,210
a long queue when you get to the front

00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,649
of the queue you write down the jobs you

00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:18,000
want to apply for sometimes we will grab

00:18:16,649 --> 00:18:20,909
the job of the wouldn't eat it and run

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,169
away so nobody can apply for it then

00:18:20,909 --> 00:18:23,700
they get into a taxi and then they go to

00:18:22,169 --> 00:18:25,200
a print shop they print their CV and

00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:27,330
they've get in a taxi and go handed in

00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,440
the demure spare to order Bank and they

00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:30,330
go home and they wait for somebody to

00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,860
find Meneses

00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:33,870
it's competitive reef there's too much

00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:36,419
friction and metal places but for job

00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:38,429
matching and submitting your CV so there

00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:40,049
was a massive change but I think the

00:18:38,429 --> 00:18:41,340
biggest change is going to be the fact

00:18:40,049 --> 00:18:43,350
that there's more political information

00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:46,440
washing around in a country like South

00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:49,440
Africa you know the vast majority of

00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:52,080
people are reliant on state broadcaster

00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,250
the equivalent of the BBC and the BBC in

00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,080
South Africa isn't telling everybody

00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:56,399
what's going on and the more people that

00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:58,470
get access to the internet the more they

00:18:56,399 --> 00:18:59,970
found out what's actually going on

00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:01,030
politically and the more political

00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:02,500
accountability we all have

00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:04,270
a bit of politics will that I think

00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,590
that's that session for me the the thing

00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:07,960
that gives me hope about our country and

00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:09,280
I have hoped for a miracle as well over

00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,900
time the instant washes enough

00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:17,650
information around that better political

00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:20,010
decisions get made any negatives there

00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:22,330
are lots of negatives the internet

00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:25,840
enables us aver people as well as good

00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:27,760
people but I don't think about that

00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,770
stuff I think there's more to be gained

00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,510
by I'm hiring people than the negatives

00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:34,990
and I think the way you overcome these

00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:36,280
things like fake news and maybe a sexual

00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:38,710
harassment or those types of things that

00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:40,510
the internet enables is to give more

00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:42,640
internet I think the more you shine a

00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:43,900
light and everything the more likely are

00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,730
to end up with a good result but this

00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:48,250
kind of instinct to hold back and slow

00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:49,840
things down you know that that you can't

00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:51,100
stop the internet you can't if you want

00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,860
to punish your kids nowadays you take

00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:55,240
away the Wi-Fi you make them watch TV no

00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,320
stopping it you've gotta make if you've

00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,690
got to watch you got to roll it up

00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:01,660
faster that's great well we're

00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:03,670
absolutely on time thank you for joining

00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:06,130

00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:08,140
