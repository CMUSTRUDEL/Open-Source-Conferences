hopefully we'll see you all back here

00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:07,440
again next year

00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,480

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,559
gorkinsky

00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,320
um sarah is a writer with the verge and

00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:13,759
emily is a data scientist and engineer

00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,480
and they're going to come up and present

00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,920
together

00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,920
over to you two

00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,880
let's move this closer yeah let's yeah

00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:31,840
all right let me get my water actually

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,840
i'm gonna get thirsty

00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:40,800
so emily and i were not supposed to give

00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:44,000
uh this this talk together

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:47,039
um we met last night and we're like

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,640
actually we both kind of feel like we

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,800
can't even get into the meat of what

00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,879
we're talking about in 20 minutes

00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:56,160
um and also she was talking about fake

00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:58,640
science i'm talking about fake news

00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,160
we should just talk to each other um so

00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,559
that's what we're doing today

00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,799
yeah yeah and i think um it it is very

00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:08,000
much in the spirit of mozfest to sort of

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:11,200
um mix things up and and you know we're

00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,240
bringing the dialogue into the dialogue

00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,680
panels and uh so yeah i guess uh what

00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,600
would be the

00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,920
what is the sort of distilled essence of

00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,880
what you of what i wanted to talk about

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,840
yeah well i was

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:27,759
i was going to so with fake news

00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,360
i'm sure with like the bajillion fake

00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,479
news panels that everyone has been

00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,759
attending

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:35,360
it's a very difficult uh

00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:38,000
definition like there isn't really a

00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:41,040
definition it's a bit like seeing

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,240
um like a grouping that's like a b b

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:47,119
c c d and uh d

00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,399
e right where it's like there's no

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,040
relationship between a b

00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,240
and d e but it all belongs in sort of

00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,240
the same thing

00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,360
um and i wanted to do some

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,840
disambiguation

00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,719
talk around kind of a lot of the

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,960
hysteria

00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,799
around russian interference and what

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,840
that actually means for fake news as a

00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,640
concept

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,280
because that's it's very hard to pin

00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,399
down

00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:13,840
literal falsity with incidents where we

00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:15,680
can confirm foreign interference

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,400
and kind of trace back all of these

00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:21,200
incidents to

00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,040
actually the advertising model that the

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:26,160
internet currently runs on

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,040
and um sort of the hegemony that

00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,160
facebook has

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:33,280
on our information ecosystem uh it is

00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:35,840
creating some really perverse incentives

00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,360
and you were going to talk about yes so

00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,879
i was going to talk about fake science

00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,280
and this is maybe not as prevalent the

00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,080
problem

00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,879
as fake news but it sort of underscores

00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,640
a lot of what

00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,000
empowers fake news and that is the

00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,120
ability to

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,959
aid legitimacy or or to

00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,040
make a story seem legitimate when it's

00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,599
not and

00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,040
sort of originally i was planning when i

00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,400
normally give this talk it's 40 minutes

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,800
long and i go through a case study of

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,280
one

00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,000
incident and so there's no way that i

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,480
could add in

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,080
all of the new content um and then also

00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:11,599
cut it down to 20 minutes

00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,280
um but there's sort of a very

00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,599
interesting case that happened last year

00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,640
with

00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:18,000
okcupid where a bunch of users had their

00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,680
information exposed by

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,519
somebody who was trying to do

00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,280
he was passing it off as scientific

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:29,599
research and it wasn't

00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:32,319
it was really a thinly veiled attempt at

00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:33,200
sexism in white supremacy and his goal

00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,080
was to

00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,680
try to shift the narrative around

00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,480
politics around

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,519
in particular muslim immigration in

00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,560
denmark

00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:47,440
and he used this you know

00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,799
he's a very he was a very intellectually

00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,599
capable person

00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,879
um a very good computer programmer and

00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:56,000
statistician

00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:59,040
but used that to generate fake stories

00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,080
um through the scientif you know a

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,439
corruption of the scientific

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,319
method um can you speak more

00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,480
specifically to

00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,239
exactly what he did with the with the

00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,040
data and how he propagated it and what

00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,120
the effects were

00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,280
yeah sure so what's interesting about it

00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,640
is um

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,799
there's a platform out there there's

00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,919
actually let me kind of roll it back a

00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:19,519
little bit there's a problem

00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:21,680
in the field of psychology right now

00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,680
called the replicability crisis

00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,440
and what that is is a lot of these

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,320
psychology studies that are really well

00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,360
known

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,960
things like the power pose study turn

00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,560
out to be

00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,199
irreproducible and psychology studies

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,080
are really

00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,520
hard to get good data in to begin with

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,040
and so when we've

00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,840
when researchers have found like that

00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,800
these 30 year old studies are not

00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,759
reproducible

00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,120
a organization formed called the center

00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,720
for open science

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,560
and they have built a framework that

00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,639
allows data sharing and

00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,160
preprint services particularly for

00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,800
psychology

00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,040
and so what he actually did was scraped

00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,280
a bunch of okay cupid user data

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,880
and then dumped it on the open science

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,600
framework

00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,639
and in the process of doing so not only

00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,000
did he like

00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,000
completely corrupt the scientific

00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,479
process but he also you know failed to

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,680
anonymize it so he docks like 70 000

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:17,840
users um he you know

00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,080
did this he he publi published this

00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,840
paper in a journal that he created and

00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:25,600
was the editor of

00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:27,199
um and and didn't do this you know he

00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,919
listed his university but there was no

00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,600
irb

00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,039
and so there's you know all of these

00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,039
problems that kind of

00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,240
came down but what was interesting about

00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,520
it is

00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,039
well two things were interesting to me

00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,560
about it one is that the center for open

00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,080
science is headquartered in my home city

00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,120
of charlottesville

00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:46,479
which has been in the news

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,800
but also that in order to debunk

00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:50,560
his what he's done you need to be a very

00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,600
good statistician to realize that

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:56,240
what he's doing was fake

00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,280
i think that sort of what's interesting

00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,560
with with what

00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,039
and i'm assuming there was a lot of

00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,080
harassment that came in the wake of all

00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:05,520
of this

00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:07,680
um and and it sounds like

00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,039
what was what was exactly sort of his

00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,759
his paper what was

00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:12,880
his conclusion um yeah so his conclusion

00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,160
was

00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,479
he really really really reached to try

00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,440
to

00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,080
draw a correlation a negative

00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,319
correlation

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:28,319
between religiosity and intelligence

00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:31,919
oh so his through

00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:34,080
ridiculously advanced statistics and

00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,280
a horribly biased data set because like

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,280
okay cupid users

00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,880
like 70 000 okay cupid users is not

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,240
really

00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,520
representative of like the general

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,520
population um

00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:48,560
managed to like draw this connection

00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,000
or claim that he drew this connection

00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,560
and of course the headline wasn't you

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,919
know

00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:56,880
um racist jerk

00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:58,560
comes up with a false correlation the

00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,400
headline was like

00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,400
you know researcher finds correlation

00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:05,280
between religiousness and

00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,240
intelligence and like it i mean it was

00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,479
literally

00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,919
fake news generated from the ground up

00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:12,240
yeah and

00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:13,440
so this is actually sort of a perfect

00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,919
place for me to

00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,360
to talk about the taxonomy that i put

00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:20,240
together for the

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,280
one of my prime examples um it's

00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,400
pizzagate

00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:27,120
if you don't know what pizzagate is um

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,880
one you're very lucky two i'm sorry i'm

00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,479
about to spoil that for you

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:35,599
uh so in the podesta email dump

00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:37,680
that wikileaks put out there's a weird

00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:40,080
email

00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,319
between people including democratic

00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:46,560
operative john podesta

00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:48,080
and uh marina abramovic like an artist

00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,440
and there's just like and then there's

00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,160
and then there's like a pizzeria also

00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,599
involved

00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:56,319
um and it it makes no sense if this this

00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,960
sort of logical connection doesn't make

00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,560
sense to you

00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,319
like it's because it literally doesn't

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,560
make sense um so

00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,160
they took this email and they just went

00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,080
oh actually like

00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,599
we think this pizzeria is engaging in

00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,599
child trafficking

00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,639
and these emails are coded coded

00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,680
messages for

00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,960
for trading uh trafficked children among

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,599
democrats

00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,120
um and this sort of pizzagate conspiracy

00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:21,360
uh got really

00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,879
popular online it was pushed by a lot of

00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,599
alt-right personalities there were a lot

00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,319
of like news

00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:28,240
news stories spun up about it and then

00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,240
it actually culminated in a gunman

00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:34,399
showing up to the pizzeria and shooting

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:36,880
his rifle in the air um and

00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,919
there is no child sex trafficking

00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,680
conspiracy

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:42,320
i think the famous quote from the gunman

00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:44,080
is um uh i may not have had

00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,920
like the the the facts might not have

00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,120
all been like on the level or something

00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,480
like that is like

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:53,440
uh something like that and um it's

00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,000
it's like the interesting thing about

00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,200
pizzagate

00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,480
to me is it's this perfect confluence of

00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:03,519
three things um one is

00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,440
oh my god russians because the podesta

00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,440
email hack can be attributed to

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,440
a hacker who is very determined not to

00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,600
be identified as russian

00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,920
and yet a lot of a lot of factors would

00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:17,279
indicate that he is

00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:21,440
and the the second piece is

00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:23,839
um 4chan like there is a

00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,800
deep culture of toxicity online that has

00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,760
brewed up sort of

00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,279
into the heart of the new fascism and

00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:32,560
that was a big part of

00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:34,720
spreading this weird theory

00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,640
which wasn't really like necessarily

00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,080
attached the email dump it was spun up

00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,480
out of the email dump

00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,279
and then the the third part is clickbait

00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,839
profiteers

00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,880
like there was a real financial

00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:48,080
incentive

00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:50,240
in generating this outrage around

00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,760
this improbable story and around

00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,880
spreading it and getting

00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,080
people to believe in it um and it's

00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,720
it's the confluence of those three

00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:01,120
factors um we can

00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,320
identify specific actors who are kind of

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,560
they straddle

00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,000
the like two of those factors um for

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,440
instance i'd say breitbart

00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,920
is uh part of sort of a toxic online

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,440
culture

00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:16,959
and a clickbait profiteering um

00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:19,519
but i think the the commonality here

00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,560
other than you know horrible

00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,480
hate-mongering

00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,000
is is actually that the very core of

00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,959
pizzagate

00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,640
there's a fact that email dump is real

00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:31,200
those emails are real

00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,240
there is something true at the very

00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,240
heart of it

00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,600
and it's it's the same with this this

00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:39,040
okay cupid thing

00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:42,000
is that the okcupid data was real

00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,839
the stuff that spun up on top is not but

00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,800
at the core of it there there is

00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,279
a truth to it and so you have to like

00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,320
wonder

00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:52,800
like what has gone wrong

00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,600
such that if you've got a truth at the

00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,240
very bottom

00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,839
why is it that you're getting this

00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:01,839
elaborate

00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:03,600
artifice of uh of of

00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,600
things that are misleading things that

00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,360
are outright false things that are

00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,880
you know just extremely damaging to the

00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,040
fabric of society

00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:13,040
um like why like what has happened to

00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,560
sort of our information ecosystem such

00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:18,079
that that's

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:19,920
that kind of thing is is being amplified

00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:21,519
yeah i think well there's two things one

00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,120
i i just want to like add to the

00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,320
conspiracy especially now that like

00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,839
we're streaming and all that like there

00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,079
is actually a photograph of me

00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,839
at comet ping pong which is the pizzeria

00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:32,160
in northeast dc where this happened

00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,920
like i was actually there eating um in

00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,320
early 2016 so

00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,079
um now that i am like this

00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,920
anti-alt-right personality

00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:42,000
um i'm sure that will like get that

00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,760
pizza yeah re-spinning

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,360
um but i think it's a it's really about

00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,839
confirmation bias it's

00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,839
um that we've figured out how to

00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,600
weaponize people's confirmation bias

00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,279
that it doesn't matter whether a story

00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,040
is true it matters if it

00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:57,279
is something that they want to hear and

00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:00,720
if there's enough to it that

00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:02,000
allows them to like latch onto something

00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,040
you know just one thing that they can

00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,480
hook on to

00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,800
that makes them you know say oh yes this

00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,160
is

00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,000
you know i want to believe that the

00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,079
democrats are like evil

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,360
people so you know here's this like one

00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:16,240
little fact and now i have

00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:18,000
established this whole new um fiction or

00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,959
whatever around it but there is that

00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,720
fact

00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:25,120
and so because that fact is undeniable

00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,160
um i can now create this framework

00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,160
around it that

00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,760
makes me makes whatever i already

00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,760
believe justifiable

00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,880
and there's this halo effect around data

00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,040
dumps in particular

00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,720
right so like uh there's a halo effect

00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,240
around the podesta email dump so even if

00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,760
you're taking one email out of context

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,480
and spinning up something stupid around

00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,079
it

00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,399
suddenly it's like oh but it came from

00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:45,839
wikileaks it's this email dump it's real

00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,440
and same thing with okay keep it thing

00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,279
even if you're you're not

00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,360
applying the scientific method correctly

00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:53,519
it's like oh but that is real like there

00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:56,720
is this big

00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:59,600
dump of stuff and it's all real

00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,399
yeah yeah and it's it's interesting that

00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,560
um

00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,240
this is not even like something that's

00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,000
abstract like we talk about fake news we

00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,720
can like have all these panels and and

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,720
stuff about it but it actually is

00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,519
something that manifests and has

00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:15,120
manifest in very real dangerous ways and

00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,000
you know one of the examples being this

00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,959
gunman who like

00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,040
brings this ar into a pizza shop and

00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,240
like if you ever walk into this pizza

00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,720
restaurant you're like where would they

00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,560
even possibly do this it's like

00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,760
like you can barely find a table let

00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:31,600
alone like run

00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:33,440
a child trafficking ring out of it um

00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,959
but he walks in there with an ar and

00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,399
like shoots up the place

00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:38,560
and like thankfully he didn't shoot

00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,560
anybody um

00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,680
and i just don't understand like why he

00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,279
didn't just say oh well that

00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,680
that's obviously nonsense and then turn

00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:47,279
around and walk out

00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,880
but you know that's that's a very real

00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:50,399
consequence and what we saw in

00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,800
charlottesville was

00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,839
um also a very real consequence because

00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,600
when

00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,920
we get surrounded by the nazis at the

00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:01,040
statue they were actually

00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,560
citing statistics at me about queer

00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,120
people and about trans people

00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:07,040
and these are like statistics that are

00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,920
really common to find online but they're

00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,040
also

00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,720
completely um

00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,399
misleading like they're not they're

00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,160
they've been like

00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,480
you take a kernel of something that is

00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,199
real and then you morph it and you twist

00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,839
it until it

00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:23,440
meets what you want to believe and so

00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:26,560
one of the things that somebody

00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:29,600
like literally a nazi wearing a swastika

00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:31,199
screamed in my face at the statue well

00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,240
carrying a torch was

00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:37,600
um you're trans you have a 41

00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:39,519
chance of committing suicide and that's

00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,600
like not true it's not actually borne

00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:44,800
out in any statistics whatsoever

00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,680
um but it has been this um a result of a

00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,800
study that

00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:52,000
that looked at suicidal ideation

00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:55,440
in transgender teens in britain

00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:58,800
and it was something that

00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,079
it was a survey from people who said

00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,600
have you ever been

00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:03,199
at this point like have you ever been so

00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,920
depressed that you're thinking about

00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:06,800
suicide

00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:08,560
and 41 of people said yes and that's a

00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,399
horrible thing that is

00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,560
something that needs more attention but

00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,079
it has morphed into

00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,160
like if you're trans you're going to

00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,600
have a 41 chance of killing yourself

00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,959
and then they use that to justify their

00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,920
bigotry and then like beat us up with

00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:23,839
torches

00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:26,399
um so it is something that is like

00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:28,320
a very real like it it very quickly

00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,399
becomes a very real threat

00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,440
i think it's like interesting because

00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,360
and i'm sure this has been said a

00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,360
million times in these panels it's like

00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,279
confirmation bias isn't new confirmation

00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:40,079
bias existed but for the internet

00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:42,399
tabloidism rumor uh misinformation

00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,000
propaganda lies they all existed way

00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,920
before we had computers

00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,639
um and but it's just like like

00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,399
everything the scale

00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:52,959
we've never seen this before we've never

00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:55,839
seen the speed before

00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:56,560
we thought that you know we thought that

00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,240
uh

00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,680
like moore's law and sort of the

00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,279
increase in processing speeds was going

00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,880
to make everything better but then it

00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,680
turns out some things just shouldn't get

00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,839
faster

00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,120
some things shouldn't get better um and

00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:10,560
that's just like

00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:12,000
it's catching up with us now yeah so

00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,759
let's talk about russia a little bit

00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,440
yeah because so

00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,040
um richard spencer actually came back to

00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,920
charlottesville with torches just a few

00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,000
weeks ago

00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,360
on october 7th and one of the things

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,920
that he like he

00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,720
marched through our downtown area and

00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,279
chanted

00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:30,160
um like his group of people chanted

00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:32,160
russia is our friend

00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:34,000
and it was like a really pathetic chant

00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,480
it was like really awkward if you watch

00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,240
a video

00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,360
they're like really not into it and

00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,639
they're just like i'm just here for the

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,839
nazi stuff i don't know what we're

00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:43,120
talking about

00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:45,600
um but what is it about russia

00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,800
like specifically so for one thing i

00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,000
like suspect a lot of the russia

00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,040
narrative is being spun up because

00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
people want to believe someone's in

00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,800
control right

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,040
um and and like to be clear there are

00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,320
specific incidents that can be traced to

00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,360
foreign interference but let's run

00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,399
through some of them

00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:03,360
um so we've got like uh

00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:04,559
uh the atlantic council which you know

00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,480
they they did

00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,839
an okay job but it's like the funding

00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,839
source i think is kind of a

00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,439
uh like people should keep that in mind

00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,240
when looking at sort of the studies that

00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:15,360
they put out

00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:19,679
they found um basically like a botnet

00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:22,160
pushing pro kremlin um lines on twitter

00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,199
um and this is super worrisome right

00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,880
like they like it's

00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,360
it's hundreds of thousands of accounts

00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:33,120
like this is like you can trace

00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:36,000
the messaging to um rt into sputnik

00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,480
but if you look at the messaging it's

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,679
they're

00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:42,799
comparing antiphon black lives matter

00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:45,840
to ukrainian neo-nazis i think

00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:47,840
and it's like well i don't think that

00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,559
messaging really got much purchase in

00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,799
the us

00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:52,480
actually i don't think this i don't

00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:53,360
think this fake news campaign worked out

00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,480
too well

00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:58,480
uh for some reason um and and then

00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,280
you've you've got another new story

00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,840
that's like

00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,400
oh russians use facebook events to

00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,919
organize

00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:09,200
anti-immigrant rallies on u.s soil

00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:11,360
one true two buried deep in the article

00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:14,640
like five paragraphs down it mentions

00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:17,919
oh well 48 people rsvp'd

00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:20,720
and four people showed up

00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:22,400
uh and it's just like so so this sort of

00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,120
cause and effect it's like really hard

00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,720
to

00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:27,120
match up cause and effect in the in the

00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:30,080
real world um

00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,919
another example uh i think this is the

00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,039
most recent one and the senate is

00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:35,520
looking into it

00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:36,720
uh russia the russian operatives like

00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,280
through cutouts

00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,960
appear to have bought um i think it's

00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,240
like something on the order of like tens

00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,000
of thousands

00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,280
uh maybe hundreds of thousands of ads on

00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,559
facebook um

00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:51,760
basically pushing racial divisions

00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:54,160
in the us um and

00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:56,000
one it's like facebook of course says

00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,280
well it's a very tiny fraction of

00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,760
all the ads that are bought and it's

00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:02,240
like yeah but they also

00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,679
targeted uh specific people they target

00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,480
they targeted a very specific

00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:09,679
demographic to push these ads onto

00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:12,880
and but if you look at sort of the core

00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:13,919
of that story you kind of get this funny

00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,000
sensation because

00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,440
the way that they exploited racial

00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,520
tensions in america was to draw

00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:22,640
attention to police brutality

00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:24,720
um like real police brutality

00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,000
uh like the death of freddie gray and at

00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,880
that point you're just like well

00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,320
one yes these are russian trolls but two

00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,360
the russian trolls have a point

00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:35,280
actually um and

00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,559
so one of the things that you're getting

00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,640
at is

00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:40,240
not so much that the heart of all of

00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,400
this is russia but rather

00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,320
that these incidents of foreign

00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,919
interference appear to be writing on top

00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:48,480
of a larger infrastructure

00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:50,880
that when you take another look at it

00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:54,000
it's propagating misinformation

00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,760
from other sources as well um so one of

00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,120
the things that my slide deck which i

00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,840
will not be showing you guys

00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,360
runs through is like incidents in which

00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:04,480
like the new york times or npr

00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:06,000
chase down people who actually just

00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,440
write up literal fake stories

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,880
on the internet like things that are

00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,640
complete don't even have a kernel of

00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:14,159
truth to them like things that are like

00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:15,760
oh uh uh hillary clinton murders 52

00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:18,320
people or like uh like

00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:20,000
tens of thousands of of uh of

00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,679
pre-written ballots have been found in a

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,559
warehouse in ohio right

00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:25,600
um these stories when you chase down the

00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:27,280
people who wrote them

00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,960
it's just some dude in a basement who's

00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,039
like oh yeah i'm making like

00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,720
a hundred thousand dollars a month off

00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:36,080
of this stuff

00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:39,280
people who run sites like uh

00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:41,280
like politics usa.com or like the denver

00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:44,640
guardian there is no denver guardian

00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:46,480
um it's like it's just a dude and

00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,799
these people make quite a lot of money

00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:51,679
and when you ask them

00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:52,480
it's because of facebook it's because of

00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:55,360
facebook

00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,799
uh clicks essentially like when you win

00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:00,400
the facebook lottery

00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:01,360
you cash out um and google ads is to an

00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,679
extent also

00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,200
complicit but one of the things that

00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,039
like another consistent theme in

00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,480
in sort of these case studies was that

00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:08,880
they're like oh yeah once google figured

00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,000
it out

00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,159
figured out what we were doing we got

00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,159
de-listed and then we

00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:16,400
lost we lost out and but and then we had

00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:18,720
to go and find ad networks on our own

00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,480
and but the facebook thread was

00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:24,559
consistent through all of this

00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:28,000
um and so why

00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:31,360
why wouldn't russia use facebook right

00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,640
it's not that misinformation is starting

00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,960
with russia

00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,799
it's that russia sees an opportunity to

00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,480
use a technology that is

00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:40,240
completely designed around like it's

00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,200
it's profit motive it's sort of raison

00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,280
d'etre

00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,679
is to sell to people that they

00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:47,600
didn't want in the first place

00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,799
and so of course you'd ride on top of

00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,400
that infrastructure

00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:52,000
to sell people they didn't want

00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,080
in the first place

00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,360
yeah and it's interesting because um

00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,200
there's in

00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,720
in looking at what facebook has done and

00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,840
how they've managed to optimize this

00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,600
process

00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,039
they've actually done psychological

00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,760
research studies

00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:07,120
and last year they released an

00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,200
internally

00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,640
generated ethics report of course

00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,559
exonerating themselves because why

00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,640
wouldn't you

00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:15,679
but in it they they go through extreme

00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,960
lengths to justify

00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:21,440
why they don't need to have an irb

00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:24,080
to to do like straight up psychological

00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:26,159
manipulation research which they did

00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,280
um and so does everyone remember the

00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:29,350
sentiment analysis

00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,640
thing that they did um

00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:31,679
[Music]

00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,919
do you want to run through that yeah

00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:35,039
yeah so briefly like they they had this

00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:38,080
experiment where they would

00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:39,520
like take posts and they would

00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,280
selectively show you posts where like

00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:44,320
your friends were miserable

00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:46,159
or or if they were happy and see how

00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,679
that affected what you would post and do

00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:49,600
sentiment analysis on that

00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:51,440
and they actually found that like by

00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,200
modulating what they present to you what

00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,360
content they present to you

00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,480
they can actually affect your emotions

00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,799
and they admit that they can

00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,159
affect voter turnout and then they in

00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:01,200
the same breath they say but we had

00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:05,280
nothing to do with

00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:08,720
the results of the 2016 election and

00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:11,200
so they released this ethics report

00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,880
and there's been quite a bit of effort

00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:16,080
in

00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:19,280
corporate spaces to justify

00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:21,679
why we don't need to use irbs and

00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,799
the frameworks of academic and medical

00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:24,240
research

00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:25,679
to do what we would do in a corporate

00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,360
environment which might be like a b

00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:29,200
testing stuff like that

00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:31,440
but what they actually ignore is that

00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:35,120
the elements of informed consent do not

00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:36,640
actually they are not exempted and so

00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,000
i actually haven't gone back and looked

00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,200
at their terms of service for this

00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,880
period of time but

00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,799
there is a real question as to whether

00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,000
any of us actually consented to be party

00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:47,440
to this research

00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,039
at any point uh and so it's a really

00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,159
interesting angle that like facebook has

00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:53,520
used

00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:57,679
all of us as research subjects

00:23:53,520 --> 00:24:01,120
probably against our consent to

00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:04,559
build this platform that has basically

00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:06,720
made streamlined interference

00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:07,760
in some degree with our news

00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,559
manipulation

00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,679
yeah um yeah i i was telling emilia last

00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:14,960
night actually

00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:18,000
um the extent to which facebook controls

00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:20,559
the journalism industry um

00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,919
and this is something you may be more

00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:23,440
aware of now but like

00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,279
just a year ago people didn't realize

00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,600
this outside of journalism

00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:28,559
um facebook drives a lot of traffic it

00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,320
can like

00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:32,480
basically make or break digital

00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:35,360
journalism like digital media

00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,400
outfits um basically live or die on the

00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,840
algorithm

00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:40,240
do you guys remember like a couple years

00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:42,080
ago when upworthy links were all over

00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,600
facebook and it was really annoying

00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,039
well facebook engineers also find it

00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,000
annoying and they tweaked the algorithm

00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:48,320
upworthy links

00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,600
no longer seem to dominate the the

00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,919
facebook algorithm

00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,679
like it just it they were suppressed and

00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:55,360
upwardly contracted like they're not

00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:57,440
the media property that they used to be

00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,039
they used to be much more valuable as a

00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,200
media property and then

00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:02,080
the algorithm changed in the art anymore

00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,720
um

00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,600
and uh this sort of pattern is actually

00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:09,440
continuing

00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:10,880
um there is first of all there's like a

00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,360
famous pivot to video

00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,880
going on right now where facebook

00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,240
changed its algorithm to privileged

00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:19,600
video over

00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:21,919
uh written news articles so there's

00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,960
mass layoffs at a lot of these companies

00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:24,960
right now

00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,880
and just sort of a lot of panic in the

00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:30,159
air because

00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:33,039
the companies are um basically reshaping

00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:35,520
themselves to fit the facebook algorithm

00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:36,720
and then there's um the really

00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:39,120
disturbing thing i was telling you

00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:41,279
last night was uh there's this thing

00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,880
where facebook will punish you

00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,919
essentially for having a viral story

00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,039
like your other stories will be

00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,400
suppressed

00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:48,480
because they just they kind of want more

00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,760
diversity in the news feed so what ends

00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:53,120
up happening is that if you have two

00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:54,640
really important stories that week

00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,240
good luck to one of them because one of

00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,080
them is going to go up and the other one

00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:01,120
is kind of like

00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:03,520
it's it's not going to appear as much um

00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,559
and like this is it's really troubling

00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:07,760
because of

00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:09,679
of how much power facebook has like

00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:12,159
if it were just any other platform like

00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:14,880
who cares like it'll be over soon like

00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:15,440
the money will dry up um but it's you

00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,720
know

00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,480
everyone talks about like oh well it's

00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,679
just it'll be like myspace no it's been

00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,080
like 10 years

00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,720
uh like yeah myspace only lasted like

00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,279
three years

00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,720
yeah yeah there's like people growing up

00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:29,279
now who have like

00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,200
not known a time before like people who

00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:33,039
are almost fully formed human beings who

00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,880
do not remember a time before facebook

00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:36,320
so like i think it's time we we set

00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,799
aside that argument

00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:40,000
yeah so there's there's been we talked

00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:41,360
about this a little bit like there's

00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,520
been some discussions even

00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,960
even here about like should facebook be

00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:47,600
be nationalized

00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,039
like should google be nationalized and i

00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:51,679
think that there's like

00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:52,559
some people that really see that

00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:55,039
facebook is

00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:56,480
a critical component of our internet

00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:58,720
infrastructure and our

00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,159
social infrastructure and because it is

00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,279
so important because google is so

00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:02,880
important like we can't live without

00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:05,039
google like

00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,000
i don't know what we would do right that

00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:07,919
it is so important that

00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,360
maybe the government should take it over

00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:11,039
but also like

00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,480
which government yeah i think we're

00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:13,520
we're in agreement with this one where

00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,760
it's like

00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,799
i mean i think sort of that feeling in

00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,159
the air is

00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:19,520
is right like it's just gone too far

00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:20,799
right like something has to be something

00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,080
has to be done but no one knows what

00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:25,200
that something is

00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,679
and i mean it's do you really want the

00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,600
federal

00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:29,840
the united states federal government to

00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:32,480
interfere with facebook right now like

00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:35,440
like what world are you living on uh

00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,960
whatever it is it's better than my world

00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,960
um and then and then there's just sort

00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,360
of the issue of like yeah like do you

00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,720
really

00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,720
like for instance do you want the

00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,960
government of pakistan to nationalize

00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,600
facebook does that sound good to you

00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:49,760
um yeah it's i think it's just super

00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:51,360
complicated like we live kind of

00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,679
in this new world where we're just

00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,960
beginning to get a sense of what has

00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:57,840
gone wrong and we

00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,480
don't have any solutions for it yet yeah

00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,320
and i think

00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,399
you know i guess we're going to kind of

00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:04,080
want to shift this around because

00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:05,440
one of the challenges with with dealing

00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,760
with the facebooks and the googles and

00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,480
and

00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,600
all these companies that control our

00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,000
information is that

00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,640
there's people you know who work there

00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,279
right

00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,720
and uh we can we can no longer like

00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:18,080
assume that the people that work there

00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,360
have the best intentions

00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,880
even though some of us might work at

00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,559
these companies or know people who do

00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,720
and i'm sure we're all lovely people

00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:26,159
um but then there are people like uh our

00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,000
friend james damore

00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:30,080
um and so this was going to be something

00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,600
i was going to talk about where he used

00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:35,039
fake science um where he cited

00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,279
if you don't know who james damore is he

00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:39,440
was um the google manifest bro

00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:41,120
um there's there's going to be someone

00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,320
in this audience who before the session

00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,440
didn't know what pizzagate or james

00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,360
tamora was and they're going to leave

00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,240
very unhappy yeah and i'm really sorry

00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,080
and if that's you

00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,520
let me know and i'll like make

00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:53,840
reparations

00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:57,279
um james namor was a google engineer

00:28:53,840 --> 00:29:00,000
who wrote a memo that

00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:02,159
said that the emphasis on diversity was

00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,039
too strong that the value of empathy was

00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:04,640
too strong

00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:06,240
and that we should really just focus on

00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,600
hiring more white men because they get

00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:11,279
things done

00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:13,799
and he cited a bunch of science

00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:16,399
science and quotes um and

00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:19,039
decontextualized it and wrote it in very

00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:20,240
academic language which was enough to

00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:23,679
fool

00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:25,440
people that weren't critical but if you

00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:26,720
again if you're like a professional

00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,200
working in these spaces you read this

00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,640
memo

00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:32,399
and you're like this is garbage yeah

00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,679
thinly veiled white supremacist

00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:36,960
propaganda yeah

00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:40,799
very sexist very racist

00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:42,720
nonsense and so the challenge is that

00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:45,279
when we look at like how do we fix

00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:49,039
facebook we have to realize that like

00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:51,520
a significant portion of their engineers

00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:53,120
share these beliefs like a significant

00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:55,440
portion of twitter engineers and like

00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:58,399
people who do anti-harassment at twitter

00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:00,480
share these beliefs so how do we like

00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:04,240
even begin to approach that problem

00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:05,360
and it is like for me right it does seem

00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:08,080
like a problem that's

00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,399
far far too big but once we start to see

00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,279
it

00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:12,960
actually as an issue of like

00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:14,320
institutions that need to be tackled i

00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,799
think

00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:18,480
this is this is kind of a hopeful

00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:19,760
message right like it's either that

00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,520
we're looking at sort of the state of

00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,000
the world like sort of engulfed in

00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:25,039
fascist

00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,720
flames right and either that's because

00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:29,039
of an inherent darkness of the human

00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:30,960
heart that we cannot really control

00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:33,200
or it's because something has gone

00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:35,200
really awry with our institutions

00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,880
and we need to change them we need to

00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,720
change them from the bottom up

00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,559
and yes it's it's very hard to even

00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:43,600
think about challenging

00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:45,840
um you know institutionalized racism and

00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,679
sexism in the technology industry it's

00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:50,480
very hard to think about living in a

00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:54,240
world where facebook is not facebook

00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:56,559
um and yet isn't that like it's a little

00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:59,200
more of a cheerful prospect than living

00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:02,000
in a world where the majority of people

00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,480
um are actually just very evil people

00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,519
like

00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:06,960
i think that that

00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:08,880
i mean you wouldn't be here at moss fest

00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:18,640
if you didn't believe in fighting for

00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:19,600
hopeless causes

00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,039
all right i'm just going to check

00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,799
whether any does anybody have any

00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:25,840
questions i thought that would be

00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:25,840
the center here

00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,000
hi thank you so much i have 20 questions

00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:32,240
but i will ask

00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,960
three and feel free to just answer one

00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:37,360
um so my first question is to sarah

00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,159
um the focus is a lot on foreign

00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,960
interference

00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:43,039
of like foreign to the u.s yes whereas

00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,399
if i apologize for that no no not at all

00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:46,159
but if you look at like let's say the

00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:48,159
snowden documents they're also evidence

00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:49,120
that western intelligence agencies also

00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:50,799
engage in

00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,640
absolutely computerized propaganda and

00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:54,640
just wanted to know if you have more

00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:56,080
sort of examples stories or whether i

00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,760
think there's a debate on this

00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,440
uh so i i was actually just talking to

00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,080
someone the other the other day who told

00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,200
me that

00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:07,200
um nato engaged in sort of systematic

00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:07,760
uh like ad buyout in afghanistan during

00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,720
the war

00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:12,000
um to basically spread nato nato

00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:16,080
propaganda um

00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:17,440
so so yeah uh the the newly released jfk

00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,720
files um

00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,880
there there's a line in there about

00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:24,559
having something like 60 journalists

00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:28,000
on the dole for the cia it's

00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:29,360
yeah it's it is definitely

00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,120
what is happening to the united states

00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,799
now is karma

00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,559
uh but it doesn't mean that the people

00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:36,480
who are suffering deserve it

00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:37,679
like it doesn't mean any of this is good

00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:41,440
um but yes yes

00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:43,919
it this one of the reasons why

00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,640
all of this is so much worse than it

00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:46,960
could be

00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:48,799
is because the powers that be have

00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,559
engaged in these tactics for a very long

00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:52,000
time and have become very good at it and

00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:53,120
those methods have been out there for a

00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,360
really long time

00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,159
and the powers that be have not seen fit

00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:59,039
to suppress

00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:01,360
the channels by which um they've engaged

00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:01,360
in that

00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:05,360
but sorry do you had did you have

00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,360
another question

00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,840
okay

00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:17,440
um yeah i have a question for both of

00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:18,559
you to kind of like uh maybe tuned a

00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,840
little differently for each

00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:22,799
i've been grappling with this quite a

00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:25,279
bit um so on the science side

00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:26,320
i wonder if part of the challenge is

00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:27,840
that as the science

00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:29,440
is getting out into the world

00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,240
journalists have this motivation to get

00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,679
it out quickly

00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,360
and don't have the knowledge that you

00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:35,039
described to kind of interpret

00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:36,799
uh whether something is correlation or

00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:37,440
causation or what have you so i wonder

00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:39,039
if there's

00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,120
you've found anything around the model

00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:45,360
that's could be fixed that's going to

00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:47,200
help and i think for um sarah

00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:49,120
it was on the tube on the way over here

00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:51,200
and i saw this ad from russia today that

00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,679
says the cia causes propagandists you

00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,399
should

00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:56,159
check us out to see what we call the cia

00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:57,440
in both of these cases i'm like

00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:59,440
there's something at work here which is

00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,480
like an economic model that's empowering

00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:03,679
all this to happen

00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:05,760
so in what way can you know mozillians

00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:07,360
fight back against that

00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,720
yeah so what's really interesting about

00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,200
the fake science side is that we've

00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,720
actually

00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,720
there's a model that exists and has

00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:17,040
existed for quite some time

00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:18,839
and it is really the open data and open

00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:23,040
science movement

00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:25,119
um in the case of the okcupid story

00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,240
what we saw was that open data and open

00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:29,280
science platforms were

00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:31,520
were used to try to

00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:33,280
push a narrative and it ultimately

00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:35,679
failed because what

00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:37,520
we are able to very quickly do a peer

00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:39,359
review and critique his work

00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:41,760
and not only critique his work but also

00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:43,440
kind of shut down all of his future work

00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,520
and so to the point where like if you

00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:47,679
search emil kierkegaard

00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:49,119
it comes up that he is basically a fraud

00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:51,440
and he got kicked out of school and all

00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:51,440
of that

00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:57,200
so this model actually exists and

00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:58,800
pre-print services have existed in the

00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,280
field of math and physics for quite some

00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,040
time

00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,880
and if you're in math and physics like

00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,720
every week somebody posts to like

00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,480
like a used net or whatever like i've

00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,920
proved the riemann hypothesis

00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,680
like i'm pretty sure the second used

00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,280
netpost ever made was like i've proved

00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:13,200
the riemann hypothesis

00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,320
and we don't actually see this being

00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,640
reported on

00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,760
with regularity because it's very quick

00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,920
for people to

00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,040
shut that down so if we can just get to

00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,200
the point where

00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:25,280
we use open platforms for peer review

00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:27,119
and also break down the barriers to

00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,599
existing scientific research

00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:31,760
by like upending the publishers then

00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:34,160
we'll get to that point

00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,800
so yeah we can we can combat that but it

00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:37,599
does take

00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:39,440
effort and we have to understand that

00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:42,480
the scientific process is not just

00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:44,160
researching analyzing writing but also

00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:47,520
reviewing critiquing

00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:48,960
and revisiting

00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,599
i i also think that journalists should

00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:54,400
be more responsible honestly um

00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:55,599
but it's i know that's like easy to say

00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,040
but as a journalist i'm like journalists

00:35:55,599 --> 00:36:00,400
should be more responsible

00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:04,320
um kind of a hilarious anecdote from the

00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:06,560
the james damore uh week

00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,920
in which our science team was full of

00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:10,160
full of just flames on the side of their

00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,160
face

00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:13,280
one of our science reporters reached out

00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,960
like started to

00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,160
reach out and she just really didn't

00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,960
want to do this she's like do i really

00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,480
have to

00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,160
uh look at look at the journals he's

00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,079
citing like one is like it's a

00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,520
random estonian one like i don't really

00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:25,920
like why do i have to do this

00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,880
like like science good science reporters

00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,560
are aware of

00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,920
the journal issue and they're aware of

00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:32,800
peer review and all that

00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:33,280
um but yeah she reached out to i think

00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,040
like a

00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:37,760
like a neurobiologist or something for

00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:39,520
comment on the d'amore memo

00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,359
and this was like the first man that she

00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:43,200
reached out to and he goes

00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:44,560
haven't read it about to go on vacation

00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,820
but as far as i can tell the science

00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:48,960
seems sound

00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:52,560
[Laughter]

00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:54,720
um so scientists could probably do

00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:56,240
better too is i guess what i'm saying

00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,920
scientists we definitely need to do

00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:59,359
better um and

00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:02,240
uh what was my side of the question

00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:04,640
again something about cia

00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,359
and advertising oh what can mozillians

00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,640
do

00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:10,560
um well like bringing sort of like the

00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:12,079
the power back to the people kind of

00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,760
element of that is like really really

00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:17,280
important um

00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:20,839
i whatever is going on right now with

00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:24,240
uh sort of the entire web

00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:26,400
being weaponized against people

00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:28,000
for profit like that's something that

00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,520
like you know missoulians have been

00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,520
railing against for like what like a

00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:33,839
decade at this point um like

00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:35,520
it's like oh ads are bad tracking is bad

00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:36,560
like the privacy concerns are trouble

00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,800
and they just

00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:40,560
never quite resonated with people and i

00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:44,560
think like truly

00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:47,359
casting a light on what the

00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:48,320
advertising system is doing to us and to

00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:52,400
democracy

00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:53,839
and to like ideas and our ability to be

00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:56,720
people with each other

00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:57,359
i think is that's a that's a big part um

00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,359
is

00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:01,200
when people start to understand that

00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:04,000
like we might actually have like

00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:06,000
a real consumer revolt on our hands

00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,880
final question

00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,599
corporations are really getting into

00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,760
this

00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:13,520
sort of public game right you know apple

00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,160
wants to build town halls and city

00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:16,400
squares

00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:18,079
and and facebook wants to bring people

00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,760
together google wants to organize

00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:22,320
the world's information and you get

00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:24,720
these big corporations who are now

00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:26,320
doing things that maybe should be

00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,640
separate from the corporate sphere like

00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,160
oh

00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:30,079
we're a research institution it's like

00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:32,079
well no you're a sharehold

00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:33,280
your shareholder own profit making

00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:36,480
enterprise

00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:39,280
how do we start to request a

00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:42,000
a firewall between these sorts of

00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:43,599
endeavors again between

00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,440
government between the governmental or

00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:48,560
non-governmental organization work

00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:51,200
of research and infrastructure and

00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:53,119
how to i mean i'm asking i'm asking like

00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:56,640
to the easy answer of how do we

00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:58,640
unprivatize all this stuff but what's do

00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:00,560
do you see any avenues by which we could

00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:04,320
begin to push back

00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:07,440
against this sort of corporate

00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:08,880
in pervasive revision into our lives

00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,640
do you want to start with this one i

00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:13,119
think i have to form my thoughts on that

00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:15,839
um i don't have an answer that i'm ready

00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:15,839
to give on camera

00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,920
um yeah that's that's that's a really

00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:24,240
hard one

00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:24,880
um i think there's a common thread that

00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:27,920
i have been

00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:30,000
preaching throughout many of these

00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:32,640
debates and that is that we

00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,400
um are entering an era where we need to

00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:37,280
get back to

00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:38,880
real physical space community defense

00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:40,400
community involvement

00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:42,880
and that means that we need to make the

00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:45,440
conscious choice to exclude these

00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,880
powers from our life and that means not

00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:50,079
just the facebooks

00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:52,079
but also the government and

00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:53,599
this is i'm putting on my anarchist hat

00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:55,920
at the moment

00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:57,520
but one of the the ways that we can do

00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:59,440
that is to reject the

00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:01,520
the idea of the state and the state's

00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:03,359
actors and we need to treat

00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,720
facebook and google even though they're

00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:06,880
private companies we know that they're

00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:08,720
in in concert with the state

00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,000
and so building up capacity in our

00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:13,839
communities for how

00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:17,040
to deal with things that doesn't involve

00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:19,040
like for example calling the police

00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:21,119
is is a way that we can push back

00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:22,720
against that and

00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:24,880
i'm seeing this thread all throughout

00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:26,960
the country i'm seeing this thread

00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,920
throughout the world really of how do we

00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,680
build

00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,920
community involvement to take care of

00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:33,359
each other

00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:39,839
you know the chant is who keeps us safe

00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:39,839
we keep us safe

00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:46,400
