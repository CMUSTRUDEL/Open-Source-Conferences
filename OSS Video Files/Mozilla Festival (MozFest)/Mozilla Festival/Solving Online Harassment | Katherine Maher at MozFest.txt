hello there

00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:09,719
I'm here today from the Wikimedia

00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:12,389
Foundation as you just heard which is

00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:13,830
the organization behind Wikipedia we

00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:15,809
were asked today to speak about open

00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:18,119
innovation and Wikipedia is an

00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:19,680
incredible example of this communities

00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:21,000
coming together collaboratively to

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,310
create something that is greater than

00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,779
the sum of its parts at Wikimedia our

00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:26,670
vision is a world in which every single

00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:27,119
human can freely share in the sum of all

00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,640
knowledge

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,230
and we take this incredibly seriously we

00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,550
comedians have spent millions of hours

00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:34,829
building one of humanity's most

00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:36,960
remarkable resources 40 million articles

00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:38,850
300 languages used by half a billion

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,730
people every month from every corner of

00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:43,050
the planet from McMurdo Station in

00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:45,000
Antarctica to here in London

00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,890
but we there are some problems on our

00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,879
path to the sum of all knowledge and I

00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:49,800
want to share them with you today

00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:52,289
because they're not just Wikimedia as

00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,969
problems there are problems the problems

00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:55,890
of the internet and the problems of

00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:57,989
society and if we're truly here to

00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:01,020
realize the power of openness we need to

00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:02,609
solve for them together so I want to

00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:05,339
start my presentation today with this

00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:07,020
story on Wikimedia you can be anyone

00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:08,700
we're pretty into the anonymity and

00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,960
pseudonymity thing which means we

00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,720
comedians often have some pretty

00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:14,460
creative usernames one of my favorite

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,770
usernames and one of my favorite users

00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,880
is a user named guerrilla warfare

00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:19,680
guerrilla warfare has been editing on

00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,299
English Wikipedia for more than 10 years

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,920
they have been elected to a number of

00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:24,780
leadership positions within the English

00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,479
Wikipedia community including

00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:29,610
administrator check user oversight er an

00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:31,290
arbitrator and for those of you who are

00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:32,970
not familiar with the Wikimedia universe

00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:35,400
these are pretty important positions

00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:37,650
these volunteers often handle sensitive

00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,600
information or urgent situations on

00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:41,610
Wikipedia they're trusted by the

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,680
Wikimedia Foundation and by their peers

00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:46,110
they're charged with keeping policies

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,909
adhered to arbitrating community

00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:49,770
disputes and investigating some of the

00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:52,290
most challenging issues such as threats

00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:56,030
to self health of self harm or harm to

00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:56,030
others they're not to be taken lightly

00:01:57,259 --> 00:02:01,530
guerrilla warfare also happens to be a

00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:03,689
young woman who was open about her name

00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:06,119
and gender on Wikipedia guerrilla

00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:07,610
warfare is Molly white Molly gave me

00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:10,140
permission to tell her story here today

00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:12,120
molly is a software engineer who also

00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:12,920
loves to rescue cats and encourage women

00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,720
in tech

00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:17,450
she's a real-life person with the job

00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,400
interests skills and accomplishments

00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:20,660
she's also the target of repeated

00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,920
harassment because of her involvement

00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:23,930
with Wikipedia

00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,370
she's been targeted by people who

00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:26,209
disagree with a call she's made as an

00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:27,860
administrator

00:02:26,209 --> 00:02:30,050
she's been targeted for her physical

00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:31,760
appearance she's also been targeted for

00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:33,560
no apparent other reasons than she was

00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,900
an editor is an editor who openly

00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:39,020
identifies as a woman Molly has been

00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:40,790
harassed on Wikipedia and off posts had

00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:42,380
been made implying that she was elected

00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:44,239
to her leadership roles because of her

00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:46,130
appearance because of a sexual

00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,739
involvement with other way comedians or

00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:50,030
because she has tongue piercings

00:02:47,739 --> 00:02:52,160
recently she told me she was greeted by

00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:54,080
a message on a talk page on wiki by

00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,880
someone saying she was a homosexual do

00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,510
 who'd alert deserves to be shot

00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:01,400
dead while these posts are reverted on

00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:03,620
Wikimedia the harassment continues

00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,780
across the Internet she's been doxxed

00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:08,360
her private Facebook account has been

00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:10,700
posted to 4chan encyclopedia dramatica

00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:12,739
and reddit people have dug into her

00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:14,180
relatives Facebook pages with fewer

00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:16,730
privacy settings than hers

00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:18,620
they've shared photos of Molly with to

00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:20,780
various web sites photoshopping her face

00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:22,340
on to lewd images and they've taken a

00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:24,860
photo of her with her baby niece and

00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:26,660
captioned it with racial slurs they've

00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:27,650
added data to these images to make sure

00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:29,209
that was there are some of the first

00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:31,820
results you see when you search for her

00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:33,530
name or username a slew of twitter

00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:34,850
accounts have been created to harass her

00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:37,670
commenting on her physical appearance

00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:39,739
her weight her family her sexual

00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:41,570
preferences calling these comments

00:03:39,739 --> 00:03:43,430
calling these comments is actually a bit

00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:45,500
of a euphemism they're pretty terrible

00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:47,530
and of course when reported twitter

00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:49,430
decided they were not in fact abuse

00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:50,959
occasionally when the harassment is

00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:52,150
pretty bad it begins to affect her

00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,440
offline as well

00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:56,390
molly worked on an arbitration case

00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:58,549
involving gamergate she stopped

00:03:56,390 --> 00:04:00,079
answering calls from unknown numbers she

00:03:58,549 --> 00:04:01,850
told me that she goes so far as to

00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:03,739
impose privacy protections on her

00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:04,940
friends as well who are often not as

00:04:03,739 --> 00:04:07,400
concerned about these kinds of things

00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:08,840
for example recently asking someone to

00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,489
take down an image that had been geo

00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:13,370
tagged on instagram from her apartment

00:04:10,489 --> 00:04:15,019
she no longer believes that privacy on

00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:17,120
the web can be real and has become very

00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:18,650
cautious about 10 is saying about

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,329
anything that she says on the internet

00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:21,650
she feels that everything that she does

00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:23,240
will be viewed through the lens of

00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:24,540
people who already believe that she's a

00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:27,890
terrible a person

00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:30,390
so why am I telling you all of this

00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:36,660
because unfortunately Molly's story is

00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:39,360
not unique a 2015 survey conducted by

00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:41,280
the Wikimedia Foundation found that 38%

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,110
of responding users had experience being

00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,510
harassed on or about the Wikimedia

00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:47,640
projects many of them are women people

00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:49,500
of color people of non-binary gender

00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:53,100
identities people from places other than

00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:54,900
Europe or North America and more than

00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:56,460
half of these people reported leaving or

00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,590
decreasing their participation in the

00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:00,360
Wikimedia projects as a result of this

00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:02,600
harassment we're missing their voices

00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:05,640
and we're missing their knowledge and

00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:07,230
why does this matter well English

00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:09,750
Wikipedia which is widely regarded as

00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:11,910
the most complete Wikipedia has about 5

00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:14,430
million articles but on English

00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:17,490
Wikipedia only 16% of them want more

00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:21,060
than 1.3 million biographies are women

00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:22,770
in a 2012 evaluation by the Oxford

00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,970
internet Institute they found that more

00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:26,700
than half of the articles on Wikipedia

00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:28,800
are about places events and people that

00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:30,900
only represent 2.5 percent of the

00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,990
world's land area and of all the

00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:36,150
geotagged articles on Wikipedia only 2.6

00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:37,950
percent actually represent anything on

00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:40,470
the continent of Africa which holds 14

00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:41,910
percent of the world's population the

00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:43,800
Wikimedia Foundation we know that

00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:45,510
representation and quality of articles

00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,240
improve when more people contribute and

00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:50,940
when more diverse people contribute and

00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,620
over the five million articles that's

00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,820
just the beginning never mind all the

00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,920
world's knowledge we're just getting

00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:57,210
started there's a current estimation by

00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:59,100
one of our Wikimedia --nz that they're

00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:00,570
about a hundred and four million notable

00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:02,580
things out there in the world which

00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:04,890
leaves 99 million things that have not

00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:06,750
yet been represented in part because we

00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:08,250
are not seeing representation of the

00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:09,690
people who actually are familiar with

00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:12,570
these subjects and can contribute that

00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:14,670
knowledge and this isn't just a problem

00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:19,400
of Wikimedia this is a problem of the

00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:21,690
Internet our internet 73% of Americans

00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:24,000
adult users have witnessed online

00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:27,060
harassment and 40% of them have

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,330
experienced it themselves this is not

00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:31,590
what our internet was supposed to be I'm

00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:33,780
old enough to remember the early

00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:36,060
internet and it was a magical place

00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:38,350
where you could find almost anything and

00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:40,270
anyone it was a place for creativity

00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:42,520
and freedom a place for connection and

00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:44,530
belonging Wikimedia was born in the

00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:46,360
early Internet and we still believe in

00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:48,010
that magic we believe in freedom of

00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,720
expression and freedom of information

00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:51,400
and the ability to share our knowledge

00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:54,010
thoughts and desires for the future

00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:56,380
freely with the world harassment

00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:58,240
threatens that sharing many of us here

00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:00,160
are advocates for the open web and as we

00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,080
comedians advocates of collaboration and

00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,150
openness we are fiercely committed to

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,860
protecting that but if we protect the

00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:07,630
open web for those for it to simply

00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:10,120
become a place of hatred and of fear

00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:11,650
then what are we protecting it for if we

00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,420
closed out the voices of those are who

00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:15,280
are harassed and nor told that their

00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:16,900
contributions are not valid that they

00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:20,140
are not welcome here then what is

00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:22,030
openness we don't just need an open web

00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:23,530
we need an inclusive web and I'm here to

00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:25,570
tell you that well we may not have it

00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:26,860
right yet Wikimedia is here to fight for

00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:30,100
the right to participation and

00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:31,600
inclusivity after all our vision is a

00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,950
world in which every single human can

00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,560
freely share in the sum of all knowledge

00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:37,360
that's not just a statement that is a

00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:39,970
promise of inclusivity it's at the heart

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,820
of what we do every single human all

00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:45,370
knowledge for us inclusivity isn't just

00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:46,390
an aspiration it is a necessity it is

00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:48,550
not a nice-to-have

00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:50,470
it is a need to have for us to have all

00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:53,260
knowledge we require the participation

00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:54,640
of all people we need all voices

00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:56,140
together so that we can create something

00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:58,450
greater than the sum of our individual

00:07:56,140 --> 00:08:00,640
parts which brings me back to Mali

00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:02,560
we need more mollies but people

00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:06,340
shouldn't have to be as tough as Mali in

00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:08,620
order to participate so how are we gonna

00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:10,210
do this I don't have all the answers

00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:11,710
these are systemic issues these are

00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:15,100
buried deep within our cultures and

00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:16,840
societies as human beings but I believe

00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:18,970
we must start with intention we must

00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:20,800
start by naming the problem by

00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:23,140
articulating what it is we stand for

00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,390
standing on stage and declaring that

00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:27,850
this matters backing it up with the data

00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:31,180
that I've just shared with you changing

00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:33,099
the narrative so how can you do this in

00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:35,890
your community how can you support this

00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:37,560
open inclusive web that we need start

00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:40,150
with active outreach and listening

00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:41,830
identify the people who are not here yet

00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:44,620
the people that you want to work with

00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:47,110
and go and talk to them listen to them

00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:48,400
more importantly than talk you have to

00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:50,080
understand why they're not working with

00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,030
you yet what are their objections

00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,040
what are they why aren't they here

00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:55,630
and not dismiss those objections because

00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,950
this is the way that we work and this is

00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:58,840
the way that our communities work and

00:08:56,950 --> 00:09:00,970
our culture's work but actually reflect

00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:03,640
on them and think about where we need to

00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:05,680
make changes for us for example this

00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:07,930
meant serving our users about harassment

00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,280
and publishing the results of that in

00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:11,280
fact a recent article in The Guardian

00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,970
identified Wikimedia is one of the only

00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:15,160
organizations out there that actually

00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:16,360
does this we do this because we believe

00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:18,370
that we need to be honest with ourselves

00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,680
we need to name the problem in order to

00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:21,190
address it which gets me to my next

00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,710
point

00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:25,150
respectful diverse inclusive communities

00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:27,580
don't just happen because you want them

00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:28,810
to you actually have to resource it we

00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:30,700
used to do this thing where we sat

00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:32,500
around and we talked about having a more

00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,730
compelling community if for women and

00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:36,220
people of color and people from the

00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:38,590
global south it didn't really get us

00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:40,990
very far so now we actually have

00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:42,520
dedicated budget resources and staff who

00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:44,140
actually work with our emerging

00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:46,750
communities to help these groups

00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:49,000
participate and grow and understand what

00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:50,890
their needs and barriers are part of our

00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,630
model is community grants in the last

00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:54,790
two years we've set aside half a million

00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:56,320
dollars to fund resources for divert

00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:58,360
increasing gender diversity and

00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,339
addressing tools and initiatives to

00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,960
support healthy culture we're working

00:10:00,339 --> 00:10:03,580
with our community members in order to

00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:05,860
understand what the issues are that they

00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:07,630
see and give them training and tools so

00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:09,580
that they can identify toxic behavior

00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:11,290
and take effective action on their own

00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:15,580
so that it comes from within the

00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:17,980
community not from above or outside set

00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:19,210
clear expectations in addition to

00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:21,010
letting people know that you want them

00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:22,630
to join your community it has to be come

00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:24,610
from the community as to what the rules

00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:26,290
of engagement actually are so that you

00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:27,850
can identify when people are acting

00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:30,490
outside of those barriers and of those

00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:31,900
rules you need to be clear within your

00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:33,790
community on how to welcome people

00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:35,860
engage people and make space for people

00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:37,900
to participate for us this means

00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:40,210
friendly spaces and codes of conduct and

00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:42,220
much more but it also means clarifying

00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:44,050
our values so that they're not just

00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:46,060
about open but they're about diverse and

00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:48,040
inclusive so that we as a community can

00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:49,870
make decisions about the culture that we

00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:53,290
want and reject the culture that we

00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:56,500
don't want that is unhealthy we have a

00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:58,870
lot of work to do I know that we know

00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:01,240
that as Molly's story illustrates we are

00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:03,070
not there yet but we want to make space

00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:04,440
for everyone we need to make space for

00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:06,480
everyone this is

00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:08,880
just an aspiration this is a necessity

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,010
and I know that all of us here in this

00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:13,650
room are committed to it because you're

00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:15,420
here in this room so I encourage you all

00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:18,570
to go forward with these thoughts and

00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:20,640
minds continue your work and continue

00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:22,890
working with us because as I said we're

00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,930
not perfect we have a way to go but this

00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:26,610
actually matters and it matters not

00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:29,160
just because it's something that we feel

00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:31,500
is important it is not an aspiration as

00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:33,150
I said it is actually a necessity to

00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:43,740
represent the web in the world that we

00:11:33,150 --> 00:12:05,060
want thank you who has a question for

00:11:43,740 --> 00:12:09,290
Katherine first of all thank you for Oh

00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:12,570
amazing for the amazing talk secondly

00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:14,790
one thing I hear a lot is that when

00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:18,630
people talk about the importance of an

00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:21,660
open Internet these negative examples of

00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:24,810
harassment are shown and sometimes in

00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:26,730
such a light so as to say look this is

00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:29,670
what happens when you have a completely

00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:31,500
open community we can't have that we

00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:35,190
need to control the internet so that we

00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:39,560
have the power to not let this happen so

00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:44,340
beats situations are used to just buy

00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:46,440
something I imagine equally negative so

00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:49,650
how do you answer it to that in those

00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:51,390
cases yeah I think that this actually

00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:53,490
came up right before I came on stage

00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:55,230
someone was asking about for example the

00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:57,390
issue of anonymity which is something

00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:59,640
that we firmly believe in in fact we

00:12:57,390 --> 00:13:01,020
used to have this saying about Wikipedia

00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:03,089
that part of the reason it works is

00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:04,770
because more people actually want good

00:13:03,089 --> 00:13:07,670
things than want bad if people only

00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:10,800
wanted bad we would never be possible

00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:12,420
you know from from our perspective it is

00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,230
actually about that it's that we believe

00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:16,210
that most people who participate in

00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:17,590
community and in the open web are

00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:19,690
generally there because they are

00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:21,130
appreciative of the of the good parts

00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:23,860
about it the creativity the innovation

00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:25,810
the connection and one of the things

00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:27,220
that we have found is that we actually

00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:32,500
think that addressing some of these

00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:34,870
issues for us is possible and not impose

00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:37,090
I think there's a feeling that these are

00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:39,250
really pernicious issues and they could

00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:41,020
be impossible to address but one of the

00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:42,820
things that we found is that by starting

00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:45,790
in a place where we have a culture

00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:47,380
around expectations around what the

00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:49,270
things are that the community actually

00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:51,490
wants and what those sort of guidelines

00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:53,560
are for for participation it's around

00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:55,480
clarifying within that culture that

00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:57,760
expectations and it's building and

00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:59,770
strengthening and reinforcing it I think

00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,630
that if you start from zero it becomes

00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:03,640
very difficult and we've seen that in a

00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:05,980
number of communities on the web in

00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:07,840
general is it if you have no rules and

00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:10,240
you have no expectations about how to

00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:12,370
participate it becomes very difficult to

00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,080
then later set them but if you start

00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:15,670
from a place with understanding around

00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:18,130
belonging and understanding about

00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:19,510
community norms and behavior then you

00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:23,680
can actually start to bring people back

00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:26,410
into those community behaviors and so

00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:28,630
I'm sorry I'm hopeful that that that can

00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:30,940
solve that based on the fact that we

00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:33,100
have a sense of commitment to norms and

00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:34,870
behaviors around what we want in the

00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:36,850
community it's about strengthening them

00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:40,930
and seeing them succeed I'm not sure if

00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:43,000
that answers your question but any other

00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:45,720
burning questions yes

00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,720
in the orange

00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:56,670
hi thank you for speaking in which ways

00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:58,769
are you supporting the people who are

00:14:56,670 --> 00:15:01,139
contributing and our administrators and

00:14:58,769 --> 00:15:02,819
editors who are coming with you

00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:05,730
with concerns about being harassed

00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:07,259
online sure so we have a support and

00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:10,759
safety team that works with individuals

00:15:07,259 --> 00:15:13,319
who experience issues of harassment and

00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:14,670
those individuals are deeply involved in

00:15:13,319 --> 00:15:17,130
the communities they work at alongside

00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:19,019
community members and what our goals are

00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:20,639
over right now what we're working to do

00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:22,860
and what we're anticipating doing in the

00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,899
future is actually building resources

00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:26,550
for community leaders so that they can

00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:28,470
identify some of these issues from the

00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:30,680
beginning one of the way that Wikipedia

00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:33,360
works is that community members actually

00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:34,589
identify issues often before they ever

00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,690
become issues that the Wikimedia

00:15:34,589 --> 00:15:38,850
Foundation engages with a great example

00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:40,709
of this is is actually the issue of open

00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:43,230
licensing so everything on Wikipedia is

00:15:40,709 --> 00:15:44,940
openly licensed we very rarely find for

00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:46,259
example violations of that because

00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:48,600
community members are very good at

00:15:46,259 --> 00:15:50,279
identifying issues when they arise and

00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,839
addressing them right away one of the

00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:53,790
things that we'd like to move tor is it

00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,560
towards is a community culture where

00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:57,240
there's the same attention to toxic

00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:59,459
behavior and harassment in the

00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:03,029
communities as there is for example to

00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:04,470
licensing violations and so in addition

00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:05,970
to resourcing I mentioned the half a

00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:07,709
million dollars of resources that have

00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:09,209
gone into training allies skills

00:16:07,709 --> 00:16:10,709
workshops and the like

00:16:09,209 --> 00:16:12,839
we're working to support community

00:16:10,709 --> 00:16:14,579
groups who want to organize to become

00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:17,550
leaders in this issue and advocates

00:16:14,579 --> 00:16:20,880
advocates internally on the on improving

00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:22,500
community culture right let's thank

00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:25,790
Katherine oh we have one more but just

00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,790
before he looking you look very keen

00:16:31,189 --> 00:16:36,480
about harassment and then it occurred to

00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:39,589
me that Wikimedia is have three women as

00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:42,029
executive directors consecutively now

00:16:39,589 --> 00:16:45,620
it's just something Twitter's missing

00:16:42,029 --> 00:16:45,620
maybe or Facebook is missing

00:16:51,389 --> 00:17:01,889
sorry what was the I think I mean there

00:17:00,779 --> 00:17:03,800
was a bit of a leading question but I

00:17:01,889 --> 00:17:05,600
actually think that this is an issue

00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:07,160
that people who don't have any direct

00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,900
experience with what it means to be

00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:10,610
vulnerable or to be marginalized have a

00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,900
very difficult time understanding what

00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:13,970
it means to be vulnerable or to be

00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,870
marginalized and then actually investing

00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:16,910
in those issues

00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:18,079
I recognize that by standing up here and

00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:20,030
telling these stories and even

00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,560
mentioning gamergate on a stage it

00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:24,110
increases my likelihood of being

00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:25,910
harassed docstore or otherwise targeted

00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:27,890
that's kind of a scary thing but I think

00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:29,810
it's a responsibility that I have within

00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:31,970
the Wikimedia Foundation and all of us

00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:33,560
as leaders within these communities have

00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:35,240
is to be able to name this and address

00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:37,520
it and sort of confront it head-on at

00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:39,140
the same time I would never demand that

00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,460
someone just does that I think it's a it

00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:43,370
is a personal choice but I feel it's a

00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:45,830
responsibility as to why Twitter or

00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:48,170
Facebook make bad decisions or don't

00:17:45,830 --> 00:18:00,920
seem to have invested in these issues to

00:17:48,170 --> 00:18:03,140
the same extent good question okay let's

00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:09,589
thank Kathryn thank you

00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:09,589
