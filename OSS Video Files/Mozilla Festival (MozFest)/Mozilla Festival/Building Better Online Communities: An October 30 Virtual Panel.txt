Title: Building Better Online Communities: An October 30 Virtual Panel
Publication date: 2020-10-29
Playlist: Mozilla Festival
Description: 
	Right now, online communities are more important than ever.

Amid a pandemic, millions more people are relying on digital interfaces in their everyday lives. Everything from school and weddings to protests and art exhibitions are unfolding online, using tools like Zoom and Google Docs.

The tools we’re using to connect while physically apart can be helpful. But they’re not perfect. Many of them were designed for enterprise use by businesses, not communities. And their flaws — from poor security to lackluster moderation features — become even more pronounced as their user bases grow more diverse.

On Friday, October 30 at 11 a.m. ET, Mozilla will host a virtual panel exploring how we can improve these tools to make them safe, more inclusive, and more community-oriented.


Our 40-minute panel will feature:

researcher and a former mozilla fellow

00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:18,000
and i look at the ways that technology

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,680
intersects with society

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,039
i'm really glad you can join us today we

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,080

better online communities so

00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:30,960
during the pandemic and the ongoing

00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,960
pandemic millions of people are relying

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,160
on digital interfaces in their everyday

00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,920
lives

00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,320
we are on zoom having a conversation

00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,640
about that everything from schools to

00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,280
weddings to protest art exit

exhibitions are opening or opening and

00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,760
unfolding online using tools like zoom

00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,360
and google docs and slack

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,360
so the tools we're using to connect

00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,840
while physically apart can be helpful

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,800
but they're not perfect many of them

00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,199
were designed

00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,039
for enterprise use by businesses and not

00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:01,520
communities and their flaws from

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,320
poor security to lackluster moderation

00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,000
features

00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,000
become even more pronounced as their

00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,240
user bases grow more diverse

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,080
so today we'll hear from three experts

00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,760
community organizers designers and

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,119
artists about how we can improve these

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,799
tools to make them safe and more

00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,400
inclusive

00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,880

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,920
really work across

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,040
digital equity and community building

00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,720
spaces and have

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,720
really uh diverse and unique

00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,479
practices and experiences in terms of

00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,759
building and creating

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,439
different kinds of digital content be it

00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:56,960

in the digital space so i'm really

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,920
really excited

00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,439
to to start this panel

00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,399
and i'm going to start with a very broad

00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:11,039
and perhaps philosophical question

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,959
which is how do you define an online

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:16,239
community

00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:19,680
fay do you want to want to kick this off

00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:23,200
yeah sure um i i feel like my answer

00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:25,360
isn't really like a general um

00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,640
description at all but it just like

00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,440
looking over the the

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,400
preparation notes for this uh for this

00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,680
panel i like

00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:37,280
immediately thought about um the

00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,080
bts you know we all know bts now right

00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,080
like of course

00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,519
because they're on like uh was it jimmy

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,720
fallon or whatever anyway

00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:47,440
bts um fan cams um

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,200
and the fan organizers uh what did they

00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:52,319
do they overwhelmed

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,800
the dallas police department app

00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,480
that was asking for videos of protesters

00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,800
and they just like flooded it with like

00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,920
all of the fan cam footage from bts

00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:04,640
and it just makes me um really

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,280
excited but terrified i guess for like

00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,000
these

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,720
um weapons of fan destruction i'm just

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,200
gonna

00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,080
go for that pun but um like it's just

00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,400
amazing what

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,360
a community of people on online like

00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,920
sharing one

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,720
mutual interest can do and it's very

00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,239
powerful

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:25,360
and inspiring and i just feel like

00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:27,760
an online community is is a tool

00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,400
to to some and i just don't i hope it

00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,599
doesn't fall

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,360
into the wrong hands um

00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,799
and that's kind of like my my

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,560
pre-election

00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:40,799
comment about that totally thank you

00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,080
oh go ahead sorry i was just gonna say i

00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,319
think something that you said was really

00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,440
wonderful it was like a tool of um

00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:49,599
mutual interest or like of a

00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,879
network of mutual interests and i think

00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,040
one of the things that's that's really

00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:55,599
important to me about community is like

00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,360
acknowledging that not everybody like

00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,879
needs to like each other or like not

00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,640
everybody needs to be like super

00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,360
interested in all of the same things

00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,400
it's just

00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,560
and you also pointed out like

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,120
communities are tools um

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,879
and networks in particular um i think

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,519
really illustrate this like sort of

00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,519
nodes

00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,799
connected to one another and i think one

00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,239
of the things right now that we need to

00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,519
acknowledge is that we're a bit of a

00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,320
global community

00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:20,239
everybody online is in um multiple

00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,639
communities but also the same community

00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:22,800
and

00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,400
um there there's a bit of like a tacit

00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,280
consent involved in what

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,880
online communities can be and are at the

00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,040
moment which is not always

00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,160
historically the the truth i think but

00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,440
right now

00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:39,120
um this is definitely i think

00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:41,440
a truth about online communities

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,479
totally would you like to add some

00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,639
thoughts the

00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,680
the topic of community is one that i

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,040
have struggled

00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:52,080
with for um i would say

00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:54,560
many years um and particularly this year

00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:57,280
um i guess the way i've come to think

00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:00,639
about community is

00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:04,240
that it is

00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:07,680
a group of people very large

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:12,160
or small or something in between

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:15,280
that is centered around either

00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:18,880
a mutual interest um but also

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:20,800
often a unified subject um like a

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,320
you know a sort of common user as it

00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,840
were collapsed by

00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,080
you know the sort of assault of all the

00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:28,639
people in it um or the majority

00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,320
interests of the people in it and um i

00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,880
think the complication

00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,120
at the root of community for me is that

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,120
um

00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:42,400
the more the less

00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,919
diffuse a community um which to me means

00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,720
like the stronger and more

00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,520
bonded a community there's it's there's

00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,039
often this

00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:54,400
um necessary element of exclusion

00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:56,639
uh by which i mean a community

00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,000
also partially exists because of its

00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,520
boundaries

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,199
and that can look like a whole lot of

00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,960
different things in a whole lot of

00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,840
different contexts but particularly

00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,800
online

00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:09,199
um and we've seen time and time again um

00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:12,720
various online communities sort of

00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:14,240
um enter into sort of a original

00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,440
user-based crisis

00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:20,639
when new new people who don't um

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:22,960
match the match that sort of unified

00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:26,160
subject start to come in

00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:28,479
yeah i think that um christina

00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,720
or chris shoe like also part of bedside

00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,639
strong like mentioned this at some point

00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,720
and said that it's like the perpetual

00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,800
autumn and i'm not sure

00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,400
what exactly she means but it's like new

00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,199
users are always coming in

00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,080
always needing to be onboarded um and

00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,880
just like

00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,319

00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,479
lot about

00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:15,440
um a way i often describe communities

00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:18,240
community is not

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,360
friendship but it is a group of people

00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,080
and like any

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,680
ecosystem there are interactions or

00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,800
people that won't necessarily get along

00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,639
but a community does

00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,479
at times i think sarah as you pointed

00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,680
out have boundaries to it

00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:33,280
um or that there are communities inside

00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,919
of communities inside of communities

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,560
which is

00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:38,160
um sort of a beautiful spill over into

00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,400
our next question

00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,319
um so like one of the things i love

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,720
about bed stuy is strong other than

00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,240
everything um is the dedication to the

00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,400
community just of

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,560
bed stuy that it's really only for the

00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:53,360
neighborhood right so a community

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,800
a neighborhood inside a big city right

00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,840
and this feels like a really beautiful

00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,000
comment on scale

00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,680
something i know dr alex hannah has just

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,199
written about and they use bedside

00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,720
strong as an example

00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,800
so sarah one thing i'm curious about is

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,479
what have you all learned from scale

00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,080
why this particular framing or

00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:09,280
constraining of scale

00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,919
and how do you think that this could

00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,039
inform or even like better teach

00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:16,240
technologists

00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:18,400
um on community design

00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,000
that is a great question so um i should

00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,240
say that you know

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,440
i found it that size strong in a moment

00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,000
of

00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,680
deep anxiety you know and in a lot of

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,879
ways it was sort of the

00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:33,360
um impulsive product of um an

00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:35,360
anxiety spiral about the coronavirus um

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,320
in early march as watching the news come

00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,560
out of italy

00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,440
and just thinking what would happen if

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,440
um

00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,519
you know there was a full lockdown in

00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,279
new york something that went beyond the

00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,800
shelter in place that we eventually

00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:49,760
ended up seeing um

00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,920
and i just had this sort of general um

00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,480
like strong intuition that we were maybe

00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,080
like

00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:59,839
14 or 16 days behind um china italy

00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:02,560
and so um yeah and the thought that kept

00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,839
arriving you know in my mind was we need

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,560
to get organized

00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:08,240
and we need to do it you know um by

00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,880
geographic proximity in case of a

00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,680
lockdown

00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,760
so that and mostly i was thinking about

00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,360
elderly neighbors immunocompromised or

00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,519
disabled neighbors who wouldn't be able

00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,800
to leave to get food or medicine or

00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:22,480
hormones or

00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:25,279
whatever and so um i i guess that

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,720
you know a lot of the sort of gestalts

00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:30,720
of best eye strong

00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:34,959
um for me centered around this

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:38,000
need um to be

00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:41,680
hyper inclusive in a particular way

00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,600
right you know um and it informed a lot

00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,000
of choices like the decision to try to

00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,240
like

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
get people to hear about it through

00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,880
flyering instead of pushing it out

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,440
online

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,519
um you know just because i think online

00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:56,720
is not this parallel world to our own

00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:58,080
um and i think like 15 of americans on

00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,800
twitter or something like that

00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,839
but the other pieces i mean i just kept

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,880
coming back to there needs to be

00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:06,000
boundaries

00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:08,240
you know and um to me i thought that the

00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,760
neighborhood could be a unit

00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:14,800
um of boundary that could sort of

00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:18,079
let enough people in um

00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:20,000
to that it was sort of a pre-existing um

00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,279
you know identifier people would be like

00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,480
well i do live here

00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:26,480
you know so i can join this and um i

00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,079
created this sort of resource for people

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,560
to sort of replicate

00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:32,000
this infrastructure and the slack and

00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,440
the flyers and all the rest of it in

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,720
their own neighborhoods and so my hope

00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,920
was that there would be sort of this

00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,200
honeycomb

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,480
um of different mutual aid networks um

00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,959
does that answer your question or not

00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,279
completely

00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,480
no it totally does um i mean that i

00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:49,200
think that was a really

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,000
it was a really beautiful answer um no

00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,160
people are

00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,360
um so the physical flyering which i

00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,040
think is a

00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,560
i put on my designer hat is a very

00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,880
beautiful design choice

00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,399
um but also obviously very intentional

00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,720
one um other

00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,000
panelists faye shawnee do you all want

00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,360
to add anything

00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,880
or any thoughts on scale and designing

00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,399
i guess for smaller and bigger

00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:13,120
communities like how how does

00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,000
scale even affect how we think of

00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:18,160
creating spaces

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:20,480
for community i mean i think in arts

00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,800
which is where i work in community i

00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,920
suppose

00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:28,000
you know we have these questions of you

00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,320
know what do we do because typically

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,680
you know we're in maybe this space and i

00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,720
as an internet artist really have never

00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,519
had that problem

00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,519
and so i've been witnessing sort of this

00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:40,000
industry

00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:41,760
field-wide um kind of

00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,279
i like you know sort of the brain

00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:47,600
explosion emoji but

00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:50,320
like from uh you know sort of all of our

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,279
higher um institutions uh museums things

00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,440
like this that

00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,480
that they could get their content out to

00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,360
even more people

00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,279
um and it's been interesting to watch uh

00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:02,480
sort of the whole field of like

00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:04,160
exhibition design um look back to

00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,480
through the history of like maybe

00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,800
internet artists work which are like you

00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,079
know

00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:13,200
0.5 of the population of artists

00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:15,279
period um and say like how do we do this

00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,959
better and it's it's been really

00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,600
interesting for me also to just feel

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:20,800
like

00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:22,399
those avant-garde artists um are sort of

00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,320
being honored in a way maybe that we

00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:27,200
never thought that they could be

00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,839
um and so designing for the online

00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,480
community

00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,200
from the arts um perspective has become

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,560
a very

00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:36,720
like actually academic kind of

00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,639
pursuit and an intellectual pursuit and

00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,360
it has to be because there's no

00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:44,079
capitalist structures that like

00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,560
have been enabled kind of in order to

00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:49,440
support this particular type of growth

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,959
and so um you know in terms of scale

00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,279
like we've seen people like

00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:54,399
people institutions like the leslie loma

00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:57,440
museum of art um

00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,079
formerly the gay and lesbian uh museum

00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,279
of art

00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,760
um the leslie lemon game lesbian museum

00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,079
of art

00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:06,320
be which is really tiny in new york city

00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:08,480
get a really sort of international

00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,760
wide audience because of this kind of

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,360
figuring out

00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,200
and the more mistakes that people are

00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,120
making also like the more sort of

00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,279
idiosyncratic and like unique

00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,480
perspectives that we get on this kind of

00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:21,279
scaling up

00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,560
um but as sort of prefaced by people

00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,480
that were working on the internet

00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,480
you know in like the 80s and 90s and

00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:29,680
sort of really um laid out

00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,160
in an article i believe michael connor

00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,959
wrote it

00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,760
um for rhizome.org which is sort of like

00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:36,480
the internet artist

00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:38,000
foundation um and so yeah it's just from

00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,079
the arts perspective

00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,360
more people are introduced to creativity

00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:43,120
within this pandemic

00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,279
lens which has also been i think a

00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:48,720
really beautiful escaping point for

00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:51,279
for folks

00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,000
yeah thank you any um any other thoughts

00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,440
to

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,240
to any of the co-panels you want to add

00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,240
or riff on that

00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,720
um i actually have a quick sort of

00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,320
follow-up um to what i said about scale

00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,040
because i talked a lot about sort of

00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,600
early early choices i think that big

00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,079
picture

00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,800
the way that i personally think about

00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:12,240
scale

00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:14,880
in online communities is um

00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,079
that with some exceptions right like i

00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,639
think that um

00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:19,920
scaling up can often make things feel

00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:23,120
less human

00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,079
um and i think that this is this is sort

00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,839
of the constant

00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:30,800
um struggle that a lot of um

00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:32,079
that that a lot of community space a lot

00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,720
of online communities face

00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,360
and it's informed by this larger like

00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:39,120
this very

00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:41,279
powerful um imperative in our culture

00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,519
which is that growth is always good you

00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:45,920
know and it just permeates the

00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:49,760
atmosphere in a variety of ways

00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:52,240
um and i think the complex reality

00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,800
within the culture of bed-stuy strong is

00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,079
that

00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:58,880
i think i think it was an incredibly

00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:59,760
positive experience for experts from so

00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,399
many people

00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,800
for everyone participating in the first

00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,399
like

00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,760
couple of weeks you know in the sense

00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,480
that like i think that people have like

00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:10,399
this real

00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:13,199
um you know um connection

00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,160
um to people and then once we started to

00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:16,639
cross like

00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,920
the 2000s mark you know it began to feel

00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:19,760
less personal

00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,360
um and i think in a lot of ways i think

00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,560
the decisions that i and other

00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,839
organizers

00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:28,079
um have to sort of work with the larger

00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:30,880
collective network to decide is

00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:32,639
what do we do about that um you know i i

00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,680
described it once as like the mega

00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:37,440
church problem

00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:40,639
um which is uh you know sometimes like

00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:42,000
mega churches in the us um are sort of

00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,759
many of them are structured to be

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,160
enormous um

00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:47,440
and there are incentives behind that for

00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,519
the institutions

00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,720
but people also been trying to find ways

00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:53,279
to keep their

00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,000
keep their massive size but also create

00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:56,639
pods

00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,240
or like small groups or what have you to

00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:01,279
to deal with a problem of

00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:04,320
connection um

00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:07,199
yeah i also wanted to say something

00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,399
that i think other organizations maybe

00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,079
are facing this

00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,839
the same challenge of like okay we were

00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:14,320
working on covet 19

00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:14,959
like community response right and then

00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,519
um as

00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:18,240
time passes hopefully uh you know that

00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,240
will abate

00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,440
right and then what do the organizations

00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,440
work on next

00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,680
and like how does the mission statement

00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:29,040
change um and i feel like that's

00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:30,560
a point to be concerned about or to talk

00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,920
about like in terms of scale

00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,839
like how does the mission statement

00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:37,040
change um and i feel like

00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:40,959
that is kind of um a differentiation

00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:43,759
between um solidarity and charity

00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:45,519
right which um if you've read like

00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:48,320
dean's they work on that it's

00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:49,199
it's like how do we shift and be

00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,440
appropriate

00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:53,519
to the needs and to the um the

00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:56,320
relationships between the community

00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:58,000
um at a scale that focuses on solidarity

00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,560
and not charity um and i feel like

00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,959
that's

00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,920
it's just something really hard to to do

00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:03,600
especially when

00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,959
um you are working on something that's

00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,120
about mutual aid it's like

00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,319
where is the line drawn between those

00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,559
two things um

00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,520
and is it so bad that sometimes the line

00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:14,959
does shift

00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:19,839
um so yeah just something that has been

00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:19,839
really interesting to me to think about

00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,760
totally thank you for that that's also i

00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:25,360
think a really good actual segue into

00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:28,240
our next question which is

00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:30,080
for you faye um sophie you gave a a

00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,000
really amazing workshop

00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,400
on how and it was like a series of

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
workshops on how design can learn from

00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,039
mutual aid for gray area in san

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,240
francisco

00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:39,520
i was wondering if you could tell us

00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,480
more about that like what are some of

00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,640
the high level

00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:46,240
uh learnings and how has mutual aid

00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,720
informed your own design work uh yeah

00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,200
totally

00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,320
um so it was like a four day long um

00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,520
introduction workshop

00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:56,080
on user experience um and we use uh

00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:58,240
bartering and sort of anti-capitalist

00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,760
models um and mutual aid as like a

00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,039
pedagogical tool

00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,200
and we went through this like whole

00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:04,880
standard design product design cycle

00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,799
right so you do the user research

00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,640
you do the user research synthesis you

00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:10,720
do design exploration

00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,919
um and we really try to look at mutual

00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,320
aid efforts

00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:15,760
um through the lens of this like product

00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:19,440
or service design

00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:20,960
um and um most like actually all the

00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,840
participants like

00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,840
didn't have full ux experience like they

00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:28,080
might have done some research before

00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,679
or they were like graphic designers um

00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,720
or their artists sort of like coming

00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:33,760
into this like

00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:36,160
as an adjacent field um and

00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,679
the way that we sort of framed the

00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,880
projects because everyone's sort of

00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:41,360
thinking about

00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,000
um that in june right like oh i have a

00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,600
bread

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,440
but i have a piece of bread like can i

00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,280
get that from you like call your friends

00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,520
you know and meet up in a street corner

00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,919
um so sort of just like leveraging the

00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:54,320
sentiment at the moment to um

00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:55,440
create this like pedagogical framework

00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,480
um and i

00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,240
i will say like as a critique of it um

00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:03,760
in my own approach is like

00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:07,120
you should not be creating mutual aid

00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:09,200
efforts um with only a designer's

00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,400
lens of thinking right like not

00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,799
everything

00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:15,760
most things are too complicated and

00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:18,559
nuanced to be solved in this like

00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,760
circle cycle diagram right um but it was

00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:23,039
like a useful thing

00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:24,480
um just to get uh beginners to to grasp

00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:27,360
some of the design concepts

00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,080
um but yeah we went through like the

00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,200
history

00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,840
of um local and uh grassroots mutual aid

00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,760
efforts

00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,440
definitely talked about that strong

00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,760
awesome infrastructure

00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,440
but yeah we talked about occupy sandy

00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,960
the common ground collective

00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,559
uh black panthers for one of these

00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,640
projects made me think about

00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:45,600
how you know they definitely proceeded a

00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,200
lot of them preceded

00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,760
the internet right like what would the

00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,440
internet um and online communities have

00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,039
been like if they were founded by like

00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,840
the black panthers you know instead of

00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:57,200
uh

00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:59,600
like military um

00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,039
so yeah uh anyway at the end of the

00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,799
workshop um i

00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:04,159
solicited an open call with the

00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:07,919
participants um

00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:11,600
and i was like okay i will help

00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:12,400
um fund an mvp right so minimum viable

00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,200
product um

00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:17,360
i'm sure lots of people on twitter know

00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:20,240
what that is but it's basically

00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:22,240
like a a rough usable version of the app

00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:26,799
that demonstrates like its key

00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:30,080
values um and so um we picked a project

00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:30,960
um that was designed by a participant

00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,600
named deirdre

00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,880
shea and she's actually like a ceramics

00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:38,000
fabrication designer

00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:40,240
but the project is called pull to pull

00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,360
and it's a platform to support

00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,159
citizen-led

00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:46,159
reporting on local polling stations and

00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:48,000
organizing communities in the event of

00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:50,000
pulling location out that

00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,520
there were people who were not able to

00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:56,720
cast their ballot in june because of the

00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:58,480
last minute pull site change

00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,840
so we worked with a non-profit

00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,320
organization

00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,120
called emergentworks which offers

00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,440
opportunities

00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:07,280
in um engineering to previously

00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,880
incarcerated people so yeah please work

00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:13,280
with them i will put it on twitter

00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:14,960
um to build uh this mvp and um

00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,559
it was just really interesting for her

00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,840
to learn

00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:22,320
through making um and like work with

00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,960
people who are also learning like how to

00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,559
become

00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:28,799
um like a product manager or

00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:30,720
something at the same time to create

00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:34,000
this project and it was like a really

00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:36,080
great um great thing that

00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,840
uh to be able to work like that um and

00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,039
no one was really sure of like what the

00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:42,240
outcome would be

00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:44,240
but the fact that we had even discussed

00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,320
you know the the potentials of this

00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:50,000
project was like already amazing

00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:53,679
um and to work with um dejean who's like

00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,440
uh i think um like sort of wrestling

00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:57,600
with the idea of voting you know as like

00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:00,720
a previously incarcerated person

00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,120
was also i think very fruitful for for

00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,159
him

00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:07,440
and the organization as well

00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:11,520
um yeah so i i guess

00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:13,520
i would really hope to be able to carry

00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:16,480
on this method of working through

00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,679
my own practice which now feels a bit

00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,520
like i'm just

00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,880
playing support you know for other

00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:24,080
people to kind of

00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:26,799
have their own agency and to

00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,840
materialize or manifest their own ideas

00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:31,280
um and that's

00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:34,640
i think a shift um that i felt through

00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:36,080
um the the crisis you know

00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,320
like there's a lot of people doing

00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:40,159
really great work already who just need

00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:42,000
um an extra push you know whether that's

00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:44,559
like uh emotionally

00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,360
or financially or or whatever else you

00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:49,440
know and

00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:53,280
that my role um can sort of recede

00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:55,919
and yeah it's it's uh it's a

00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:58,159
weird time to be doing that i guess but

00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:58,159
yeah

00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,120
totally well thank you so much for that

00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:05,520
answer um

00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:07,039
do pants want to add or i can jump into

00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:10,159
the next question

00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:11,440
i would love to um yeah i think there's

00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:14,000
something that you said that was really

00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,600
wonderful also it's like you know

00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,559
there's a lot of really great work going

00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,039
on right now

00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:21,280
and you know there are times to receive

00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:23,679
time

00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:25,600
join in or times to fund or times to you

00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:27,760
know do these different things and

00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,039
across this pandemic um i've been

00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,080
teaching this class called researching

00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,760
art and change on the west side of

00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,640
chicago and this class is a community

00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,200
practice class

00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:37,280
in which we in theory go into the

00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,400
community um that this particular

00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,159
building is in we have

00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,679
um at school of the arts of chicago we

00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:44,960
have a um a building

00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:46,880
um and a place resources you know

00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,559
or you know i don't know just like

00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:51,360
things from the outside in

00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:53,200
in unity even if it says like oh yeah

00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,000
okay it'll help or create space in this

00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,279
way whatever

00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,679
but one of the things i had to battle

00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:59,840
against was like yeah just

00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:02,400
bringing in something new because it was

00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:05,440
like the pedagogical

00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:07,520
sort of aim of this course and i

00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,640
really got me thinking about like the

00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,480
intellectual class

00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,760
sort of how much we do in this design

00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,600
world to sort of like

00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,360
boost these mutual aid projects but also

00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,960
like there are you know what you know

00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,480
really when you think about mutual aid

00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,919
it's communities who are helping each

00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,880
other and the communities that a lot of

00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,559
these design-y

00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,480
sort of mutual aid projects sort of

00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,960
claim to help or claim to sort of bring

00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,120
up

00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,799
um are actually undermining some of the

00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,159
kind of

00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:31,440
projects and efforts that are going on

00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:32,559
in the community that we don't know

00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,440
about because we're not part of these

00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:35,600
communities

00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,880
and i'm really curious like just you

00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,400
know it's clear that the

00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,400
the work that you're doing is really

00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,679
amazing um and the work that you know so

00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,880
many of us are doing

00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:44,320
in the design field are is really

00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,320
amazing and does help because there's

00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:49,520
never enough mutual aid right

00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:53,440
um but how how do we as designers become

00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:55,520
responsible and um kind of responsive

00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,559
right to the community um kind of

00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,480
efforts that are

00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:00,320
actually existing in the communities

00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,880
that we think

00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,880
right need this help um and how in a

00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,840
pandemic do we go out and really ask

00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,440
these questions

00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,039
uh because also a part of this course i

00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,480
think historically has been going out

00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:12,320
into the community and they're just like

00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,480
surveying people that's like one sort of

00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:16,080
design research method yeah and so i'm

00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,120
curious like how y'all have been dealing

00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,919
with that question

00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:21,360
um and if you've seen anything go very

00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:24,799
right

00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:28,000
in that way um

00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:30,400
i i i really struggle with

00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,440
this because i like you know if i'm

00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,880
writing

00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:36,159
um like a proposal right to do something

00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,799
in some place like

00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:39,200
i it's always really hard for me to say

00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:41,600
like

00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,480
oh i want to provide this for these

00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,880
people

00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,600
um and it just it feels so awful you

00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,720
know

00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:51,039
um to be like proposing

00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,960
something like that um and i guess

00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:56,080
recently i've been thinking about like

00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:59,600
how would it be like to just

00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:01,360
um like uh

00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,200
like have the ability to help an

00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:06,320
organization sort of

00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:10,640
um create um

00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:12,799
or just see an idea that they can do

00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,919
something else you know and that that

00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:17,200
something else

00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:19,919
can can uh exist in like xyz

00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,880
form you know and just give them the the

00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:23,840
tools for self

00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,559
organizing maybe um like i just learned

00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:27,200
recently

00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:28,159
that a mutual aid group in bushwick um

00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,840
bushwick

00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:36,400
um ayuda like doesn't have enough money

00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:39,120
to um do to to pay for their sms like

00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,400
text tree service which is like only 60

00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,960
dollars a month you know

00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,840
so like how do you set up an

00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,240
organization

00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,120
to be able to pay for like little things

00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,840
like that

00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:51,120
um and i don't know that's not really an

00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:54,240
answer but i feel like

00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:56,880
i i fall um under that

00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,360
axe a lot i guess it's like just because

00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,960
i'm

00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,400
not privy to something doesn't mean it

00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:03,120
doesn't exist um

00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:04,400
it definitely exists you know like in in

00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,559
maybe smaller scale

00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,000
than than i personally would like it to

00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:09,840
be just because i'm

00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,840
like trying to create something but but

00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,520
i think there there's like constantly

00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:16,080
a struggle that i feel between like my

00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:18,960
own um creative ego let's just say

00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,440
and like what are you doing oh sorry no

00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,159
it's okay

00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:23,360
that was an amazing question and uh yeah

00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:24,320
and i was just playing that way i think

00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,880
that's

00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,360
right on you know um one thing that i

00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,240
was

00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,679
i and i think other um etc organizers

00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,080
were startled by

00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:35,520
was you know particularly in the early

00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,799
months um

00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:40,559
of sort of up building the operation

00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:41,279
right and building the infrastructure

00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:44,320
and

00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:48,960
organizing um you know

00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:51,200
um like the people on board um

00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,880
i think that i personally was sort of

00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:56,480
startled by the number of

00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:59,840
people who thought that we were um

00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:01,360
uh pioneers of any kind you know um

00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,880
immediately that was sort of both

00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:06,720
shocked and alarmed me

00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:07,120
um we you know took very quick steps to

00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,200
sort of

00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,799
in a variety of lanes and we turned down

00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:14,080
basically any media

00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:15,840
um request that was um that didn't

00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:18,080
contextualize us like we basically

00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:21,200
turned down a whole bunch of profiles

00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:23,039
um you know um and said we don't want to

00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,960
be in your story unless your story is

00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:25,600
sort of about mutually generally and

00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,520
you're going to

00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,039
provide historical context and then we

00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:32,720
would recommend like

00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:36,159
six other um sort of non-shiny and new

00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:37,520
and techie um we have like an organizing

00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:38,559
meeting to decide on our guiding

00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:41,520
principles and

00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:42,240
you know one of um one of them is that

00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,039
we

00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:46,240
are informed by our neighborhoods legacy

00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:48,320
of resourcefulness

00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,919
which was a language shift from we are

00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:53,039
resourceful you know

00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:53,760
um and so we've we've tried to do what

00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:56,880
we can

00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:58,559
um but the reality is and you know and

00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,159
i'm just hoping that repetition sort of

00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,480
brings it across i'm grateful too that

00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:03,440
as

00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,919
mutual aid has moved from um i think a

00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:07,200
term

00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:09,279
sort of most known um within

00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,880
leftist spaces and also just within

00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:13,039
communities practicing it

00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,320
internally more into the mainstream

00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:16,559
there's been a

00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:18,399
maturation of a slow maturation of the

00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:20,799
discourse around it right

00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:21,760
what mutual aid fundamentally is is

00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:23,760
something deeper

00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,039
than people helping people i think that

00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,440
is the core

00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:28,559
of um of a lot of it but it is like the

00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,840
voluntary

00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:34,399
reciprocal exchange you know of

00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:35,440
um support of a whole um of a whole

00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:39,600
variety

00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:41,440
of kinds and all like whenever possible

00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,440
and organizing to change

00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,559
conditions and to change political

00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:48,320
conditions and i think

00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:50,320
losing that um is a disservice

00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,440
really and i and i think the complicated

00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,960
thing that i

00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:55,679
as an organizer struggle with all the

00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:58,159
time is that um

00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:59,039
it's a really difficult time in certain

00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:02,320
ways

00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:06,559
to practice the second part um

00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:07,039
while while while also trying to sort of

00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:10,480
fully

00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:13,279
respond to crisis right

00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,960
um and so um yeah and and so a lot of

00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:18,240
what we try to do is sort of

00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,880
decide um what do we want to do to make

00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,039
sure that we're

00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,399
not duplicating any you know for example

00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:24,799
like advocacy

00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:26,480
radical revolutionary groups effort but

00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:28,080
supporting them so a lot of what we did

00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,080
during the uprising was

00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:32,080
you know we created organizers created

00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:34,559
these like supply hubs for protests

00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:36,000
and then we worked you know to make sure

00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:37,919
that people have like

00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,360
resource like organizers on the ground

00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,520
have resources

00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,960
um of different kinds but yeah i think

00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:45,360
bottom line um

00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,640
it's really important to me that this

00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,640
concept

00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,880
you know which has radical roots and

00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:53,200
political roots not get co-opted

00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,960
and sometimes i fear that it already is

00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,640
you know i have gotten

00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,880
at least two emails that are like

00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:01,360
fundraisers from non-profits

00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,880
saying like you know please support us

00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,159
in a spirit of mutual aid and i was like

00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,279
you're just asking me to donate

00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:10,559
to your annual fund what

00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:12,960
and so yeah it really frustrated me

00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:14,240
i love that criticality and i think that

00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,320
that's

00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,000
i i want to hear so much more of the

00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:20,080
things that you both are saying both

00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,159
like you know in this design sort of art

00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,200
field of saying like my creative ego has

00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:25,120
to sit down

00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,799
you know and i and i think that um you

00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,440
know everything you're saying too about

00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:30,640
like

00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:33,039
we have to turn down down these press

00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:34,000
things is so important and so urgent and

00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:35,600
so also

00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,360
important in our classrooms and i'm an

00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:41,039
educator first and foremost

00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:42,880
and um i am just so glad that not only

00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:45,600
is there a refusal right but there's

00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,000
also tactics and tools sort of belonging

00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,360
to that

00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,760
refusal and i think that that's what we

00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:52,240
miss on instagram sort of in

00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:53,440
um this discourse and so i just i

00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,760
appreciate um

00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,799
yeah like all those things because you

00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,720
know

00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:00,960
when it's your job also to do these

00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:04,320
fundraisings and do these kind of

00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:06,240
keeping your mission um you know within

00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:08,320
in the in these institutional structures

00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,360
of which we all belong in one way or

00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,279
another

00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:13,519
you know and how do you also like

00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:14,640
continue to not be afraid to speak up in

00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:16,640
those moments

00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,240
because you know in theory if you were

00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:20,080
to done those profiles you

00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,840
could have perhaps also gotten more

00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,840
people but are those the people

00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:26,080
that also belong in that network i yeah

00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:28,559
and i just appreciate that thank you

00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,919
yeah um thank you so much like shawnee

00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:32,000
for asking a question and sarah for like

00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:33,360
talking about the press aspect it's so

00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,559
interesting to

00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:39,120
remember that we um

00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:41,039
you know work with the press in this way

00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,760
that what we don't say or what we don't

00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:44,240
allow

00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:45,679
to be said is um sometimes just as

00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,039
powerful as what is

00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:49,760
said and i think that's a really

00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:52,159
important point um and i had a question

00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,279
um maybe this segues into caroline's

00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:56,399
question um

00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:58,399
for shawnee too it's like as an artist

00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:00,320
when you are working with institutions

00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:03,279
you know cultural institutions that

00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:04,080
um want to curate you know the tone of

00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:06,640
voice

00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:09,519
the purpose you know because they then

00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:11,679
report back to their board of trustees

00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:13,440
et cetera et cetera goes up the chain um

00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:16,720
like how do you

00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:19,760
um think about the mutual aid aspect and

00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:22,559
and like building a better um

00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:24,399
i guess like formula you know or be like

00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:25,679
a role model for other artists i think

00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:28,080
that that's really

00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:29,200
um hard as an artist because you're kind

00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:31,679
of on your own

00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:34,799
and you you need the institution to

00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:38,240
support you in some ways

00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:40,320
yeah i mean first of all i'm definitely

00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:42,960
no role model in this and this is

00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:44,720
like maybe i don't know where i sit in

00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,080
this because i'm also really

00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:48,000
just entering in some of these

00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:49,760
conversations um i've been given the

00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,279
opportunity luckily to have these

00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:54,480
conversations by

00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:54,960
um amazing people at my institution that

00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,120
trusts

00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,000
me because of you know i don't know why

00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,000
but they do

00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,000
and one of the things in terms of

00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,760
changing those structures is making sure

00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,799
before i enter into these agreements

00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:10,159
that the people who are supporting me um

00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:11,760
actually have the same ideals at home

00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:13,760
and square the people there

00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,200
um you know at this sort of like

00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:18,399
off-site thing

00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:22,159
like the work that they do there is so

00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:24,960
profound and sort of um

00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:26,800
it opens up so much for artists

00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,399
especially from that community

00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,800
to come in and be supported by

00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:33,119
institutions and i support that

00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,079
you know but i think it was a long kind

00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:35,919
of like

00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:37,280
drawn out process of of really getting

00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:38,960
to know um

00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:40,800
the directors there and the

00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:43,520
administrators there and saying like

00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:46,000
is it okay if i'm critical of this while

00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:47,599
i'm entering into the space and luckily

00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,200
you know while i'm working in the places

00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:50,960
that i'm working and i'm not alone

00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:52,240
like my students i treat them like they

00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,919
are full

00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:56,079
you know they are adults they are the

00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:57,040
ones like do making the scholarship now

00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:58,800
and so

00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:01,280
because they're they're taking on that

00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:04,800
responsibility i expect them to also

00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:05,599
carry the kinds of like um burdens that

00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,839
we all do

00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:09,920
like me as a facilitator is is great but

00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:11,680
we share this responsibility and

00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,200
i'm really lucky because my students at

00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,599
the school the artist the two of chicago

00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:17,040
really

00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:19,359
also understand that and they all

00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:21,200
are within the world in a certain way

00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:24,800
and so i think that

00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:27,440
as we move together in this um

00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:29,520
we have to talk about yeah just like

00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:30,000
when can our voices be heard how do we

00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:33,599
share

00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:36,000
our voices um yeah and how do we sit

00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:38,320
down and be quiet when we need to

00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,359
but also yeah how do we also have those

00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,359
hard conversations

00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:46,800
thank you so much shaunie for that and i

00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:49,359
i really love all of the questions y'all

00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:51,440
are asking each other because this is

00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:54,480
secretly what i had hoped for this panel

00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:55,280
because i love all of your individual

00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,599
practices

00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,880
and so as like an artist and designer

00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:01,359
that works across

00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,920
like human rights and internet activism

00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:04,480
and then

00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,000
in like the traditional design world and

00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:10,320
the art space

00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:12,079
um what i have sort of hoped for

00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,599
like the way that you approach working

00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:16,960
in human rights is you have to work

00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:18,800
with activist groups on the ground

00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,640
right you have to sort of you have to

00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,000
support what they're

00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,520
working on what they're fighting for and

00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,720
that doesn't mean that you insert

00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:28,400
yourself right as the as

00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:30,320
more knowledgeable one you don't

00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,000
helicopter in even though

00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,440
lots of really big design firms are very

00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,560
guilty of this

00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:39,520
idea um and like you

00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:40,079
have to there's like a certain community

00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,839
building you

00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:43,200
have to engage in that's like a natural

00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:46,720
part of the process

00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:49,200
and um for me that's what's i'm

00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:50,720
so glad to see these conversations

00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,640
leaving the human rights space

00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:54,400
and like coming into the forefront

00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:57,839
especially now for me

00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:59,280
i see i see it a lot more in mainstream

00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:00,320
conversation like the things we were

00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,440
talking about the fact that we're having

00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,960
this panel right now

00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:05,200
right and like these are the

00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:08,240
conversations we're centering like live

00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:10,079
um i've i find that to be so important

00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,359
and i feel like this is a great

00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:13,760
i hate to say a moment because i feel

00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:16,800
like we're in a series of

00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:20,400
necessary upheavals that are also very

00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:22,240
um like they are dangerous to certain

00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:25,359
communities and that this is a time

00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:26,400
of like fear and also like necessary

00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:28,960
confrontation

00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,640
and also a time of necessary refusal

00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,079
right as like shawnee has totally

00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:34,480
pointed out of like

00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:35,119
no you cannot co-opt the movement or

00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,320
brand

00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:38,880
the movement that i'm in for your brand

00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:40,160
no you cannot co-opt or present this as

00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,680
something no i am not

00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,119
an individual representative of the

00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,400
whole group but rather we are all

00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:46,720
individuals together

00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,000
right and that this this is something

00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:49,760
that i think is so

00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,920
intrinsically important especially

00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:53,440
inside of technology especially inside

00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,960
of a space where

00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:57,040
you know we're they're supposed to be

00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,760
the lone rock star or like the lone

00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:01,200
genius

00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:03,200
and to see that consistently broken down

00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,960
and see that consistently confronted as

00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,599
a wrong idea that it is this group

00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,800
effort

00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:09,520
to me is what's one of the most

00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:12,560
important things as we fight for equity

00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:16,160
and and justice social justice

00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:17,920
human rights and like varying forms of

00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,520
freedom including internet freedom that

00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,599
like these are things we're re-centering

00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:24,640
over and over and over again is not

00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:27,280
an individual responsible for this it is

00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:28,720
many people many hands many groups

00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:32,400
coming together

00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:34,480
um so i'm so glad that that

00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,520
these questions have like naturally come

00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,520
up and are like

00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:39,760
in inside of this conversation we're

00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,480
having um so it feels weird to like jump

00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:44,320
back in

00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:46,560
to these pre-scripted questions that i

00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:47,359
have um i figured we could do just two

00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,119
more but

00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:50,880
are there other things like other

00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:52,720
thoughts y'all are having that you want

00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,240
to share we can keep riffing like that's

00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:56,960
totally fine with me we can throw the

00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,960
questions out

00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:04,560
i i guess that i'd love to talk about um

00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:06,000
access you know access and

00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:08,560
intersectionality

00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,240
um partly because you know like it's

00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:13,440
something that

00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:15,200
you know i am sort of and i am and have

00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,839
been sort of mentally struggling with

00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,000
for

00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:19,040
a very long time you know maybe since

00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,079
day one

00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:26,000
um and it's just sort of this knowledge

00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:29,200
right um that not everybody

00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,480
like is super online not everybody wants

00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:33,760
to use

00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:36,800
you know um a platform like slack

00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:40,079
or twitter or what have you um

00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:42,640
not everybody has a smartphone and so

00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:43,599
um you know from the very start i think

00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:46,480
we tried to

00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:47,520
come up with workarounds for this

00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:51,520
reality

00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:53,839
um you know the like one of the

00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:55,280
like we we communicate with for example

00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:57,839
like if a neighbor

00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,560
um you know needs need some kind of

00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:01,280
support

00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:02,640
from day like day one or day two of the

00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,280
network existing there was like a

00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:06,480
hotline

00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:10,319
that they could call right and um we

00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:12,480
use mass texting now um and uh that's

00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:13,760
you know like basically as long as you

00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:16,560
don't have a landline

00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:18,079
um there's a way for for you to be in

00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:21,760
contact back and forth with

00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:23,760
um um with the larger network um

00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,760
but you know we we've talked for months

00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,480
about do we want to use something like

00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,000
whatsapp

00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:30,560
right which is like a little bit lower

00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,079
tech and the challenge is like there are

00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:36,560
i mean they're just limits like you can

00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:36,560
only have 250 people in a whatsapp group

00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:41,760
affordances for moderation are very slim

00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:44,960
and so i feel like there's this um

00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:47,440
ongoing question for me about um

00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,480
equity and access and who gets centered

00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:51,359
and how

00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:52,319
um that seems tough and you know i keep

00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:55,200
coming back to

00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:56,480
like it's actually not my preference to

00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:59,599
organize online i

00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:00,160
prefer doing it person to person um in a

00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:03,200
room

00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:05,920
you know um but because of

00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,960
this year and the fact that we're all

00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:09,119
trying to do what we're trying to do

00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:10,800
during a pandemic

00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:13,200
things just have to be you know served

00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,640
primarily online for public safety

00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,319
and so yeah this is just sort of this

00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:19,680
like loop i keep circling

00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:21,680
um circling in and um

00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:23,599
and in my mind it ties to this question

00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:25,359
of scale too which is that

00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:27,040
if everything was sort of small and on

00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:29,440
the level of the block or

00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,160
you know like a group of 20 friends or

00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,800
whatever

00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:33,920
um sort of engaging in the principles of

00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,040
mutual mutually together then you don't

00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,000
have you don't have any of these

00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:38,240
problems

00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,880
um but the flip side is what scale can

00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:43,599
afford you you know which is that in

00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,000
just in um our case you know they're

00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:47,040
like

00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,319
i think we've just redistributed over

00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:50,880
half a million dollars

00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:51,440
back into communities and i feel glad

00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,160
for that

00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:55,280
because that needed to happen it's been

00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:58,319
a very hard year

00:41:55,280 --> 00:42:01,280
um yeah so i'm just curious what

00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:02,000
um how you know how you all are thinking

00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:05,839
about this

00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:08,319
question about access and online

00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:10,079
totally and if i can piggyback into that

00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:11,520
by adding in a little bit of

00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:14,000
one of our pre-scripted questions i

00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:15,760
think it fits perfectly is also

00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,280
building off like scale and access i am

00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,400
also curious about y'all's thoughts of

00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,960
using

00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,599
these um i guess these tools made by

00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:24,640
really big

00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:26,240
technology companies um so

00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:28,240
sarah you just mentioned like whatsapp

00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:32,000
for example owned by facebook

00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:35,280
um i'm thinking of for example how

00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,960
zoom censored classes at nyu i think

00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,960
somehow in retaliation to the subject

00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:41,280
matter or like an argument over

00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:43,200
if it fit their terms of service and

00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:44,800
also what does it mean when we use these

00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:47,119
bigger platforms

00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:48,560
uh over communication like we are using

00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:52,000
zoom right now

00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:52,720
and live streaming to youtube um owned

00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,720
by google

00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:56,319
but these are also where people are

00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:59,359
right and these zoom is

00:42:56,319 --> 00:43:00,000
the most reliable tool for all of us

00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:01,280
across

00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,280
different time zones with different

00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:06,240
kinds of internet connectivity

00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:07,839
um could another tool sort of hold up to

00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,720
the robustness that we need it to like

00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:10,400
maybe not

00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:12,079
right so i'm curious building off that

00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,839
again that idea of access

00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:15,359
scale and i want to add in just this top

00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:16,960
layer of like tool choice

00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:19,599
and like do we have a choice really

00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:22,640
within that if we're also thinking of

00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:22,640
access and scale

00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:27,839
one of the things that i think

00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:30,000
those of us involved in open source

00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:31,200
communities um have to grapple with is

00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,400
definitely this question

00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:35,119
of like do we use the slack you know do

00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:38,880
we use

00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:40,960
um you know these different tools and

00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,640
i work a lot with um clinic for open

00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:45,680
source arts and right now

00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:46,800
um we're we're using element i o um

00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:50,800
which is basically

00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:52,960
um like a very similar version of slack

00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:54,960
but an open source version of slack

00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:56,319
we're also using an instance that we

00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,599
build of etherpad

00:43:56,319 --> 00:43:58,960
and etherpad for those of you who don't

00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:00,079
know it are like it's kind of like a

00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:03,040
google docs

00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:04,720
but different google docs but open

00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:06,240
source them and you can sort of host it

00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:08,960
on your own server

00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:10,400
um and you know i think it takes a

00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:13,920
certain amount of retraining

00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:17,680
regardless of like how tech literate you

00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:20,480
are in this space um

00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:22,640
and you know at a certain point though

00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:25,680
things just need to get done

00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:28,800
um and you just have to make a decision

00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:30,560
and these sorts of tools that are maybe

00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:32,079
open source or more niche are not

00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,720
necessarily the things that you're going

00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:35,920
to just

00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:36,480
get use right away right i think that

00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,079
one of the

00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:39,920
questions in our class that comes up is

00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:41,839
like what does it mean to

00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:43,520
organize for crisis intervention and

00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:45,040
what does it mean to organize sort of in

00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:47,440
this long-term sustainable

00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:48,240
situation and you must think of both

00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,599
right

00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:52,079
and that's why you must have a network

00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:52,960
of people who are very very trained in

00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:55,280
both crisis

00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:56,720
and sustainability when it comes to

00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:59,760
these mutual aid projects

00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:02,960
and um you know another sort of like

00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:04,079
instance of this um was in this class

00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:06,640
that i teach we

00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:08,720
um we supported an organization here in

00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:11,119
chicago called 360 nation

00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:14,240
who um when the pandemic hit realized

00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:15,760
that chicago public schools

00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:17,359
maybe either needed help or weren't

00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,680
feeding families in the same ways as

00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:20,319
they

00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:22,079
were before and so they they having sort

00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:24,079
of been focused on maybe arts

00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:25,920
um sort of efforts or different things

00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:28,960
sort of switched to this like food

00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:30,880
drive mutual aid project and so our job

00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:34,319
as this class was to re-insert

00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:35,359
that sort of art situation and the tools

00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:36,720
that we used

00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:39,200
had to be quick because i think we had

00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:41,359
like two weeks to make 50 bags of an art

00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,920
project that would then sort of go out

00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:43,920
and

00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:45,520
be in the community and so i'm also

00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:48,960
responding this question of access

00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:49,680
and technology of like um you know how

00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,520
can we

00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:52,960
replicate these projects or these things

00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:55,359
for for folks to do

00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:56,000
or these things for folks to engage with

00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:58,160
um

00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,200
both sort of like in the process of how

00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:01,280
do we access the

00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:03,040
immediacy right but on the other end

00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:05,680
like these sort of

00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:06,400
quick turn projects do not have to be

00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:10,000
digital

00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:12,720
and you can recreate the a kind of

00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,079
sort of togetherness that maybe right

00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:17,200
now we're thinking that only

00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:18,720
technology can do um sort of within the

00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,440
kind of things that you're seeking to

00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:21,280
support

00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:22,560
um you know and then there's there's a

00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:25,839
balance there

00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:28,880
we ended up making a uh

00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:30,560
50 bags full of these um puzzles that

00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:32,160
turned into mobiles that then you could

00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:33,440
decorate and sort of hang in your home

00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:35,680
as sort of a

00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:37,440
reminder of these networks right of the

00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:38,800
fact that there is an organization or

00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,440
that there are people sort of supporting

00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,599
you

00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:42,560
and that you work on this with with your

00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:44,160
family

00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:46,480
and you can still engage on the internet

00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:47,200
with those or not but all of these sort

00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:49,599
of

00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:51,680
tools and things were sort of yeah like

00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:52,800
organized to be able to quickly provide

00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:55,920
that sort of access

00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:59,839
both to your network within your network

00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:59,839
and as a reminder of your network

00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:05,920
um i love that example of the take home

00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:08,800
um mobile it kind of and then um

00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:09,200
like being able to send tangible objects

00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:11,680
uh

00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:12,880
you know to families or being able to

00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:15,680
participate

00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:18,079
in um maintaining something like in

00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:20,559
public through a tangible

00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:22,000
medium is like really interesting to me

00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:24,240
um that sounds really

00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,440
abstract but very specifically what i'm

00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:28,800
talking about is

00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:31,280
um in the spring the city planted

00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:33,040
these new trees like around my block and

00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:34,720
each of them had a little tag on them

00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:37,440
that was like new tree

00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:38,640
um number like 51 like this is how you

00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:40,640
take care of me

00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:42,720
um and it was like i think a laminated

00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:44,480
piece of plastic and i was thinking

00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:45,839
like how would it be like if there were

00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:48,720
these sort of little

00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:50,400
like community sign up sheets or just

00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:52,000
like did you do your shift today and

00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:54,559
then all you need to do is like mark

00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,040
a little spot on this like laminated

00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:57,200
sheet

00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:58,319
um like you know like did you pick up

00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:00,240
the trash today

00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:01,359
on your street did you help with the

00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:04,240
litter problem

00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:05,520
um you know as like a totally analog way

00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:06,960
to

00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:09,040
let people know that other people are

00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:12,079
also participating and also to

00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:14,400
to uh basically like mark

00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:15,920
um for yourself that that you had you

00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:18,720
know um

00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:20,240
like i i wonder if there will be more of

00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:23,440
these kinds of

00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:25,680
uh i guess community engagement

00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:27,760
tactics because they're they're very

00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:30,800
interesting to me

00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:35,839
as a way to keep um like a community

00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:35,839
accountable too

00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:41,200
yeah i love that one thing that sort of

00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:44,240
came out in the tool kit that

00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:46,960
um inspired this this

00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:48,559
um this talk that i think a lot of y'all

00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:50,559
were interviewed for was

00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:51,920
recognizing some of the processes groups

00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:53,680
are engaging with and

00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:55,920
some of which also coming directly from

00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:57,760
my bed stay strong interviews of

00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:59,920
what i call the digital duct taping so

00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:02,640
like using a variety of tools

00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:04,319
together to accomplish a goal without

00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:05,520
necessarily needing or wanting all of

00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:08,640
those tools

00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:09,599
in the same thing so like a dashboard

00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:11,280
could be helpful

00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:13,200
for a teacher if there was a way to be

00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:14,800
like can i see that someone has updated

00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:16,480
like github and arena

00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:17,839
but like for something like bedside

00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:21,680
strong it was like

00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:24,000
using slack having air table

00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:25,200
having um i think like onboarding docks

00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,240
that people could see and sort of

00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:28,400
recognizing that

00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:29,599
that actually works perfectly for that

00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,720
group in that moment

00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:33,200
of that like there are these different

00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:35,520
points of interface but like people

00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:37,119
by working remotely have to touch

00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:38,319
different things at different times

00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:41,119
right and like there isn't

00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:41,920
one tool to rule them all and even like

00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:43,359
that could be

00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:45,280
problematic but rather that like we

00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:47,040
naturally use different tools anyway and

00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:48,480
so like leaning into that of like well

00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:50,160
slack is this great place

00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:52,160
to do things that only certain slack

00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:55,119
channels are open to

00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:56,720
certain um members at certain times that

00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:58,559
like yes we're using this other thing to

00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:00,319
do this thing and then also

00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:02,400
we're keeping our own notes somewhere

00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:05,599
else that that actually is like a great

00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:06,960
workflow um whereas i feel like a

00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:09,040
technologist would hear that and be like

00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:11,760
let me build you something that like

00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:14,240
brings all of them together it's like

00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:17,920
maybe we don't need that

00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:22,240
um just keeping mindful of time

00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:24,880
i am going to jump to our last question

00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:25,520
so one thing i'm curious about for all

00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:29,040
of y'all

00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:32,160
is is there anything from i guess this

00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:33,760
moment to describe pandemic life

00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:35,440
life spread across many different

00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:37,520
interfaces

00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:38,640
more online perhaps than we'd like than

00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:40,000
offline

00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:42,079
is there anything that you're hoping we

00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:44,319
can like learn from this

00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:45,839
or that we have started doing to carry

00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:47,760
on into the future

00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:50,640
um are there any things we hope to

00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:52,559
better inform a post-pandemic society

00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:54,240
for me i'm hoping we actually continue

00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:54,960
to do more zoom meetings that there

00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:57,200
isn't

00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:58,640
this push to fly all of us in person

00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:01,280
somewhere

00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:03,520
but that like some things can be online

00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:06,800
and they are what they are

00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:08,240
that's that's my own um selfish takeaway

00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,839
makes me feel better being over here in

00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:13,280
europe that i can talk to my

00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:13,280
american friends online

00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:24,240
i guess yeah i mean there's something

00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:27,200
i've been thinking about too

00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:29,520
um and for for me these thoughts are

00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:32,400
still a work in progress i think that

00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:33,119
um if i had like sort of one central

00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:36,319
desire

00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:39,680
it is i think that um

00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:42,880
the pandemic has forced upon us um

00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:42,880
you know a lens of

00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:48,400
a mix of safe like personal safety and

00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:50,160
care

00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:52,240
too you know i mean i think that that's

00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:52,720
like when i think about masking off

00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:56,240
right

00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:57,599
is but um the mask primarily protects

00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:58,800
the people around you

00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:00,720
and i think that there's something very

00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:01,520
significant about that um and i hope

00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:05,200
that

00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:08,000
that sort of thinking um

00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:09,280
persists um versus for a long time

00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,400
because i think that

00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:15,359
that kind of protective thinking

00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:16,559
really really matters um and this idea

00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:18,559
that you're not just this like

00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:19,280
individual automaton moving out in the

00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:22,079
world

00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:23,760
but that every action of yours creates

00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:26,960
ripples outward

00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:32,240
um i think the other thing like for me i

00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:35,440
um i think that the pandemic

00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:36,880
and has has afforded um

00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:38,960
a lot of things like i think that the

00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:41,599
fact that 26 million people

00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:42,400
participated in the uprising this summer

00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:45,599
um

00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:48,800
had something to do with the fact that

00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:50,160
people were not a large subset of these

00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:52,640
people were not working

00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:53,599
and you know shackled to a desk in a

00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:55,760
particular way

00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:58,559
the way they might have been last year

00:52:55,760 --> 00:53:00,640
and so i guess i hope that we see

00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:01,680
the affordances that like different

00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:04,960
relationships with

00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:08,400
um with labor can give us

00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:10,160
um um and affordances that can be sort

00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:12,319
of used towards like

00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:13,200
collective good and like collective

00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:15,839
liberation

00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,839
i guess

00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:23,280
um i feel like something right now that

00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:25,839
i've been thinking about too

00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:27,119
is like what is the role of like a

00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:31,119
central

00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:34,480
governmental figure in our lives and in

00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:38,079
um aid so i think you know

00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:39,200
all of us here obviously have started

00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:42,000
our own projects

00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:43,599
you know to fill the gap of what the

00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,400
government could have done in a timely

00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:47,440
matter

00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:49,839
um but i wonder sometimes

00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:50,800
if if it's the case that you know we

00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:54,240
take on a lot

00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:57,040
on our our own individual um desire

00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:57,520
you know and and that's sort of um not

00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:00,000
ex

00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:02,240
um i don't know like gives an almost

00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,400
like an escape hatch you know for

00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:05,839
for um what the government could be

00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:09,280
doing and so

00:54:05,839 --> 00:54:11,440
i wonder about the

00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:12,559
the roles that we all play in this

00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:15,920
larger picture

00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:17,760
um and i it's like i both hope to be

00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:19,040
doing what i'm doing now but also hope

00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:22,319
to be questioning

00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:26,000
um that relationship as

00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:30,480
um as the next year and the years uh

00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:32,720
unfold about um the ethics like

00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:34,240
building a more ethical web um and when

00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:36,160
i just like yelled about this

00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:38,240
basically for 15 minutes i was like it

00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:40,880
doesn't have to be this way

00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:42,720
nothing has to be this way and this was

00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:43,680
like in regards to the web but i think

00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:46,400
it was because

00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:46,799
you know part of the awakening on the

00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:49,200
web

00:54:46,799 --> 00:54:50,720
is like people are like oh we have

00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:52,000
to fix this

00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:53,920
and like now we're realizing all of

00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,119
these holes uh right or all of these

00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:57,440
design flaws and

00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:59,119
i was like putting forth this kind of

00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:00,400
suggestion of like we gotta refactor

00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:01,839
this and for those of you who don't

00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,559
maybe know what refractoring is it's a

00:55:01,839 --> 00:55:06,240
method of

00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:07,040
kind of um retroactively like fixing

00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:08,720
code

00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:11,200
either to make it more sustainable or

00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:13,839
perhaps to

00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:15,119
retrofit it for different um what's it

00:55:13,839 --> 00:55:17,119
called technologies or

00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:18,400
to help it become more understandable

00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:20,480
for other programmers

00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:21,680
and so i'm like we have to refactor this

00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:23,440
but you know one of the things that i

00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:24,400
was also saying is that we have to come

00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:26,480
to a collective

00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:27,920
consensus of how and what we are

00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:29,839
refactoring it for

00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:32,000
and i think now folks are sort of

00:55:29,839 --> 00:55:33,599
listening in on this conversation

00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,359
whether or not we're actually finding

00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:38,880
that consensus i think that

00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:40,799
question of like the intentionality of

00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:43,040
of our meeting places whether that's

00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:44,079
outside or somewhere else like we have

00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:47,200
to kind of

00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:50,000
um center this around a purpose now

00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:51,599
you know and we have to risk assess um

00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,799
and i think risk assessment is something

00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:55,200
that i would really love to

00:55:52,799 --> 00:55:56,640
sort of take out of this pandemic world

00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:59,280
because i keep saying like

00:55:56,640 --> 00:56:00,880
you know the rhona is like the converona

00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:03,040
conversation is the same thing about our

00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:05,280
std conversations like who'd you see

00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:06,960
did you drink out of the same cup do you

00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:08,799
rub you know like what you do

00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:10,960
and so this risk assessment and this

00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:12,799
collective sort of consensus of like

00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:14,799
this yeah this doesn't have to be this

00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:16,319
way and let's co-create to be able to

00:56:14,799 --> 00:56:18,240
make it the way that we want it to be

00:56:16,319 --> 00:56:20,319
whether that's in the bedroom

00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:22,240
out for tea or in our internet it's the

00:56:20,319 --> 00:56:22,720
same conversation and as soon as we

00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:24,400
realize

00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:26,000
that we need to be having this across

00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:28,240
culture i think the sooner

00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:30,319
that we can kind of in the sort of other

00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:32,640
world that we used to live in

00:56:30,319 --> 00:56:34,319
if and when we have that again um it'll

00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:36,400
be it'll be an easier

00:56:34,319 --> 00:56:37,970
sort of time but also next week could

00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:42,240
ruin everything so we'll see

00:56:37,970 --> 00:56:45,839
[Laughter]

00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:45,839
i guess on that note

00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:50,880
um well i i've i've been glad to just

00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:51,520
have been in conversation with all of

00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:54,160
you and

00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:54,640
um it's been delightful to get to know

00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:58,079
you all

00:56:54,640 --> 00:57:01,520

00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:04,480
next week is in a trash fire

00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:04,799
fingers crossed um i hope all of you

00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:07,119
take

00:57:04,799 --> 00:57:08,400
time off next week for sure regardless

00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:12,160
of what happens i think

00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:13,839
we'll all need a small break um but

00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:16,319
thank you all so much for

00:57:13,839 --> 00:57:17,200

using and how companies can do to better

00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:09,370
