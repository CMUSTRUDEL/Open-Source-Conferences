today

00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:13,940
George Floyd a black man in Minneapolis

00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:16,490
was killed the hands of a cop actually

00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:17,380
by his knee 19 that his hands and it's

00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:19,700
not the first time this has happened

00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:21,110
it's happened before with Eric Garner's

00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:23,620
just happened before with Trayvon Martin

00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:27,710
Tamir Rice Michael Brown Sandra bland

00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:30,140
Emmitt seal back in 1955 we're gonna

00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:31,580
tell our motto every the list there's

00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:33,830
constantly names being added to add Eric

00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:35,600
Scott it's not the first time this

00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:39,610
happened but it is one of the first

00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:43,760
times where it's marked this kind of

00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:47,420
action and introspection from society on

00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:49,430
how it treats black people and it's not

00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:50,600
introspection by black people because

00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:53,360
not this is not the first time we're

00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:55,010
thinking about this every time this

00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,830
happens I think you know will I be next

00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:59,240
you know I think of my mom seeing my

00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:01,220
name is a hashtag on Twitter where she

00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:03,320
lives in one day black people have been

00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:05,870
thinking about this but now we're at a

00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:08,810
moment where society is not thinking

00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:12,950
about this so you're wondering why is

00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:17,600
Mozilla talking about this today the

00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:19,580
role technology in this is huge and and

00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,280
to clarify the role technology this is

00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:24,200
not the main part of the story the main

00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:27,650
part of stories a man has died because

00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:30,050
of a white racist cop but you can't

00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:32,690
ignore also the role that smartphone

00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:36,710
cameras and and social media platforms

00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:38,300
play in these types of things there's

00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:40,420
there's more George George Floyd's out

00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:44,470
there that we'll never know because

00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:45,580
there was no video of it so

00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:48,340
that's what I want to talk about today

00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:51,940
with the panel I've assembled before you

00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:55,030
we have Megan rose Dickey senior

00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:57,220
reporter at TechCrunch we've got avid se

00:13:55,030 --> 00:14:01,240
who's the founder of hustle crew and

00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:03,430
host of the text podcast and Sydney

00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:05,710
Festival senior writer at Wired

00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:10,940
so welcome everybody I'm glad you guys

00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:15,740
could be here with me today thank you

00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:18,860
thank you that first I think yeah for

00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:20,120
sure I want to start off that's a kind

00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:23,120
of a heavy intro but I want to start

00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:24,560
with a like a lighter question how are

00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:28,780
you guys doing because I feel like this

00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:31,220
week this month had just been like a lot

00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:34,640
yeah I'm not sure if that's that's like

00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:37,220
a lighter question but yeah I mean that

00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:38,750
yeah it's been I don't know I was

00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:41,500
talking to my therapist about this like

00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:47,500
well for like the last several weeks

00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:53,330
like it's I think when when George Floyd

00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:54,560
was first killed like I I feel like I

00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:55,790
was kind of late to it I was like

00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,590
actually going through something else

00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:59,540
I'm like my personal life a friend had

00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:01,610
passed away and so like I think I was

00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:04,010
like first processing that and then I

00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:05,420
had like a late reaction to George Floyd

00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:08,060
and then of course there was like all

00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:11,420
this unbound from like white people like

00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:14,060
asking me if I was okay and like I don't

00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:17,030
know it's definitely been emotional but

00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:20,600
I mean I know as as you said Xavier like

00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:24,620
this is something that's happened many

00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:28,970
many times before and I think I've I

00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:30,980
don't know I wasn't I wasn't shocked

00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:32,510
that it happened which is unfortunate

00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:33,920
like I don't I don't want to be numb to

00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:36,200
these things but I think at the same

00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:39,710
time I've almost kind of like developed

00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:41,420
my own like internal practices of like

00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:43,580
not I'll allow these things to really

00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:45,260
like bring me down to like a deep dark

00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:47,510
level because like I still know that I

00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:49,970
need to ultimately like survive and

00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:54,480
hopefully like fry va's as a black

00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:57,260
person in America today the

00:15:54,480 --> 00:16:00,480
how about you guys avid Sen Sydney yeah

00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:03,149
definitely echoing some of Megan's

00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:06,420
sentiments there I think for me what

00:16:03,149 --> 00:16:07,949
really hit home this time versus the

00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:09,899
last time black lives matter was in the

00:16:07,949 --> 00:16:12,560
headlines was just the fact that every

00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:15,839
time this happens we as black people

00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:19,160
professionals entrepreneurs summon the

00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:20,910
energy to pick ourselves up show up

00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,980
compartmentalize the pain and the trauma

00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:25,470
so this time around it's a reminder of

00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:28,230
just how anti black and racist society

00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:30,060
is because I feel like it's a super

00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:32,070
power to be able to compartmentalize

00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:34,350
this pain and trauma and still show up

00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:36,420
and do the work and do the jobs and

00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:38,579
despite this amazing super power we so

00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:40,410
clearly have we continue to be

00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:42,149
underrepresented through our society so

00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:43,589
that to me is like the evidence of the

00:16:42,149 --> 00:16:45,750
superpowers here because we're showing

00:16:43,589 --> 00:16:47,760
up the fact we're not represented to me

00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:49,560
as a reminder of how this system is not

00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:52,370
designed for our success so you know

00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,370
it's it's difficult

00:16:52,929 --> 00:17:01,220
Sidney Ryoga um no but if I'm trying to

00:16:59,569 --> 00:17:03,230
remind myself that that is an empathetic

00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:06,529
question and not an invasive questioning

00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:09,140
because it is so frustrating and echoing

00:17:06,529 --> 00:17:12,529
what Megan was saying I was numb when I

00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:15,439
first saw the George Floyd video because

00:17:12,529 --> 00:17:18,740
I didn't watch the Ahmad video because I

00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:21,409
was I knew the narrative already and I

00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:23,149
was like I know what it's like I've seen

00:17:21,409 --> 00:17:24,709
that we've seen that meeting before so I

00:17:23,149 --> 00:17:26,709
was like I want to take a break from

00:17:24,709 --> 00:17:30,200
that one and then a few days later was

00:17:26,709 --> 00:17:32,179
Central Park Amy Cooper Christian Cooper

00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:34,070
and I watched that and I only watched it

00:17:32,179 --> 00:17:36,080
because I knew he was still alive and

00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:37,700
that looks okay like this is getting you

00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,679
know like sad just happened and I felt

00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:41,299
like I feel like I have to engage this

00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,559
because I didn't get going before and

00:17:41,299 --> 00:17:44,990
then George what happened then put okay

00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:45,889
like I'm putting all this psychic

00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:49,250
pressure on my cell phone

00:17:45,889 --> 00:17:51,169
like selectively engage with rampant you

00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:53,809
know like racism and murder like it's

00:17:51,169 --> 00:17:55,340
all so cyclical and it's like being we

00:17:53,809 --> 00:17:57,409
traumatized over and over again but at

00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:58,669
the same time one of things I found was

00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:01,309
very frustrating about being asked how I

00:17:58,669 --> 00:18:03,139
am is that for so many of my you know

00:18:01,309 --> 00:18:05,630
white friends what colleagues whatever

00:18:03,139 --> 00:18:07,880
there is just of like first-time

00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:10,190
freshness or had no idea oh there's a

00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:12,610
sort of anti racism so I'm over here

00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:14,809
like you know like youtuber saying

00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:15,950
barely able to keep my head up because

00:18:14,809 --> 00:18:17,630
this keeps happening over and over and

00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:20,210
over again and I'm doing people saying

00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:22,039
to me oh how are you doing well if this

00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:23,779
is the first time dealing with it it's

00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:25,580
like I feel like I'm like breaking from

00:18:23,779 --> 00:18:27,440
reality it's like this is happening all

00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:29,690
the time so much I can barely process it

00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:32,090
and this is so fresh and you and how are

00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:33,769
we doing and like then it's like I'm

00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:35,029
having a hard time connecting with the

00:18:33,769 --> 00:18:36,799
people asking me that because I'm just

00:18:35,029 --> 00:18:39,830
like where have you been you know what's

00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:42,200
going on yeah I really feel like you

00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:43,700
mentioned Christian Cooper like it was

00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,950
interesting me seeing that because it

00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:49,639
almost felt like the Disney movie

00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:51,649
version of these types of events like we

00:18:49,639 --> 00:18:54,559
saw on video the villain and then we saw

00:18:51,649 --> 00:18:56,299
you know how she acted how she used her

00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:58,490
privilege to kind of threaten his life

00:18:56,299 --> 00:19:01,370
basically he got to walk away with his

00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:03,240
life and we got to see like the evils

00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:05,700
that are really out there

00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,660
but then what stuff is like and I always

00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:08,070
kind of like you said like I don't

00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:10,470
really watch the videos I know it's out

00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:13,080
there for me like what stuff is like you

00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:15,660
know that Disney movie version can't

00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:17,580
happen without three more of those

00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:18,720
happening that don't end that way with a

00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:21,540
Matar burry with brown it's Yeller

00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,620
Majora's Floyd so I feel like you know

00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:24,840
for black people it's like we'd have

00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:26,010
seen this but I think white people like

00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:28,350
now see like oh wow this is like

00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:31,980
actually a threat but kind of hid me

00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:33,660
from that you know me and the you know

00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:35,190
the black the black folks in Mozilla

00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:37,380
that I fazil a chat room we were talking

00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:39,750
about that tweet that you probably saw

00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:41,100
from next door where they tweeted about

00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:43,800
like you know you're not alone black

00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:45,870
lives matter like you matter but you

00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:48,990
know we all kind of know what kind of

00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:51,240
app next door is and Megan you recently

00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:54,140
wrote about this kind of stuff what did

00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:57,420
you think when you first saw that tweet

00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:59,580
well I will get to be honest I actually

00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:01,679
did not see that tweet I've heard about

00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:04,410
it I mean like just about every tech

00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:05,730
company has been making statements I

00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:07,200
even got a statement from imperfect

00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:08,550
produce and I'm like I don't really need

00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,670
you to be making a statement about this

00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:13,500
but but like sure like like good job and

00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:16,080
but but with next door just like based

00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:19,350
on how you described it I mean yeah next

00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:22,679
door is just like a hotbed of racism

00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:24,480
like I've it's I've actually gone on to

00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:26,970
the next door like I recently moved to

00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,559
Russian Hill which like it's like a

00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:31,320
relatively like white neighborhood in

00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:33,150
San Francisco and I actually check it

00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:35,070
just to see if anyone is saying anything

00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:37,679
about me because you know I'm super

00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:39,420
self-centered but look I'm like I wonder

00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:41,880
if they because we have a very barking

00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:43,650
dog and sometimes people have like

00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:45,179
yelled at us out their window for a dog

00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:46,710
to shut up so like I've got onto the

00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:48,540
next door to see like okay like are

00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:50,550
people like talking are people talking

00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:52,679
badly about me aren't there like oh like

00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:54,450
there was that that black lady again

00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:57,630
with her like little white dog like

00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:59,280
yappin about thankfully and nothing has

00:20:57,630 --> 00:21:01,470
been said about me but like I have seen

00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,360
other comments about like other black

00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:05,370
people in the neighborhood and just like

00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:07,290
oh like there's a black person like

00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:09,120
walking slowly around this car like they

00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:11,040
must have been casing and it's like no

00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,990
like they were just what they were just

00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:14,550
walking what if they're just like walk

00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:16,470
into the grocery store like could that

00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:17,160
could that be a possibility yes I mean

00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:18,630
like

00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:20,549
when we see these things from next door

00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:22,110
which has done like so little to

00:21:20,549 --> 00:21:24,390
actually address these issues on their

00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:26,970
platform like it's it's hard to feel

00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:29,520
like it's genuine and there has been so

00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:31,020
many other examples of companies doing

00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,210
this like whether it's like Facebook

00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:34,799
saying black lives matter but then you

00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:36,840
know like not doing anything about

00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:38,669
Trump's tweet saying like you know like

00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:41,160
when the looting starts the shooting

00:21:38,669 --> 00:21:44,460
starts like even Twitter did something

00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:46,080
about that like I I was thinking like I

00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:47,760
almost thought it would have been the

00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,620
road first like I almost thought oh well

00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,610
it almost felt like Facebook would have

00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:52,200
done something in Twitter what

00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:56,909
industries of Twitter's history there

00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:58,260
but um yeah I mean I think I think a lot

00:21:56,909 --> 00:22:01,080
of what's happening right now is just a

00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:04,140
lot of talking and granted like I think

00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:07,409
there has been some some positive action

00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:09,299
that has happened so like Alexis Ohanian

00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:11,549
actually like stepping down from rabbits

00:22:09,299 --> 00:22:14,429
board of directors to to make room for

00:22:11,549 --> 00:22:16,409
for a black person like have a black

00:22:14,429 --> 00:22:19,020
person get a seat at the table and like

00:22:16,409 --> 00:22:20,610
the board of directors table is just so

00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:22,530
predominantly white and there are so few

00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:24,419
black people on tech company board of

00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:27,360
directors so I think that was definitely

00:22:24,419 --> 00:22:29,460
a positive move but then we see you know

00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,900
like Twitter saying okay well Twitter

00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:34,620
and square say no cable like Juneteenth

00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:36,539
can be like a holiday for employees

00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:39,120
which like I think it's cool it's like

00:22:36,539 --> 00:22:41,220
not like the most impactful thing but

00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:43,230
like it's an acknowledgment I would be

00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:44,549
here curious to hear how how you all

00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:47,370
feel about that because then I've gotten

00:22:44,549 --> 00:22:48,809
press releases from like very small tech

00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:50,370
companies it's like we're making

00:22:48,809 --> 00:22:51,720
Juneteenth the holiday and it's like

00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:53,010
I've never even heard of this company

00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:55,409
and clearly you just want press at this

00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:56,850
point so I don't know but yeah I'd be

00:22:55,409 --> 00:22:59,580
curious to hear what you guys kind of

00:22:56,850 --> 00:23:01,350
think about text response Sydney avid se

00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:03,000
do you feel like gin teen how do you

00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:06,300
guys feel about that

00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,460
I mean I'll just dive in here um Tech is

00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:10,380
very anti black and anti other

00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:11,730
underrepresented minorities and I just

00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:13,320
feel like if we really want to create

00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:15,240
lasting change on this front and we need

00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:17,280
to examine ourselves and we need to

00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:19,320
think about the cultures we have created

00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,970
in our companies I mean both Safina the

00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:23,130
other day shared a tweet that went viral

00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:24,660
about the fact that women of color when

00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:26,400
the accepting offers at Facebook we're

00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:28,650
told they were non-negotiable their

00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,540
white peers were not thus when folks

00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:33,390
started sharing salaries people were

00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:35,880
paid 20% more if they were white than

00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:37,410
BOE Safina and her peers and you know we

00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:39,210
as individuals in tech industry are

00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:40,680
perpetuating a system which has shown to

00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:43,410
be structurally oppressive white

00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:45,030
supremacist and he black and he's so

00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:48,210
many other marginalized groups in our

00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:50,070
society so I'm saying fine post a black

00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:51,810
square if you want but what else are you

00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:55,230
going to do to dismantle a system that

00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:57,120
has shown to murder us and kill us in

00:23:55,230 --> 00:24:00,240
the worst case scenario so you know we

00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:02,580
play a huge role as individuals and I

00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,930
just think as leaders of companies to I

00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:05,550
want to know what are you doing to close

00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:07,260
the ethnicity pay gap what are you doing

00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:09,180
to diversify your cap table what are you

00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:11,070
doing to diversify your board that's

00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:12,720
we're lasting changes we don't need

00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:14,430
actions if we want to change the world

00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:17,220
right now we need habits habits are

00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:18,480
what's gonna change it and so for me

00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:20,130
it's like there's a lot of talk about

00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,140
actions but there's not a lot of talk

00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:23,790
about actions sorry there's not a lot of

00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:25,530
talk about habits like what will

00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:27,390
actually change in terms of incentives

00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:29,730
in a company what will change in terms

00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:31,140
of the culture and so you know I love

00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:32,850
that Megan brought up Alexis Ohanian

00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,680
stepping down from the board who else

00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:37,170
has stepped down

00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:39,210
who else has quit no one no one else has

00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:41,880
been like okay I have white male

00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:43,590
privilege I'm stepping aside so someone

00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:45,690
from a less privileged background ie a

00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:47,490
black person can now step in we know

00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:49,860
that our lived experiences determine our

00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:52,080
reality and also our capacity to create

00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:54,060
solutions so if the people creating

00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,950
solutions are still a homogenous group

00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:57,600
of people I'm just not convinced

00:24:55,950 --> 00:25:00,990
anything will change so that's my

00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:02,370
perspective yeah it feels like from what

00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:04,380
we've seen from the examples we have

00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:05,820
unless you have a black wife who Serena

00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:08,640
Williams and a black daughter you

00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:09,720
clearly don't care about this stuff see

00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,980
now when I get you in here cuz I I know

00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:13,440
used to write a lot about facial

00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:16,500
recognition tech back from yoga's moto

00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:18,720
you probably open a like I you know I

00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:20,250
Amazon Prime TV the other day and said I

00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,030
was on cares about black lives black

00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:23,220
lives matter

00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:24,660
yada yada but at the same time they're

00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:28,410
Amazon like what goes through your head

00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:30,890
when you see that um honestly following

00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:33,750
I would at this point I think it's

00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:35,130
farcical I think it's made to joke the

00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:38,010
other day that a lot of these cycles

00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:40,470
live matter sort of like messaging just

00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:42,510
it's just so farcical and it's I think

00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:45,420
that tech companies have these giant

00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:48,090
media teams PR teams audience teens so

00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:50,390
obviously with any type of activism or

00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:52,890
any type of social justice work you

00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:54,780
symbols are important hashtags are parts

00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:56,040
important the videos all that stuff but

00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:57,450
I think that that's tech companies are

00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:59,940
willing best in making sure that's where

00:25:57,450 --> 00:26:02,070
it stays and so we think about during

00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:03,900
cove 819 they love to stay at home

00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:04,950
branding because yeah they could make it

00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:06,570
something we're doing something that

00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:08,610
same time stay at home and stream at

00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:10,050
home an order feels like you have to

00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:11,130
they were really invested be symbols

00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:13,110
well of course in making the money

00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:15,300
underneath it so that I was matter

00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:17,610
especially in this moment feels very

00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:19,860
material there's very specific material

00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:22,410
demands being made quit your job is a

00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:24,150
material demand like it's not just post

00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:26,190
a bunch of videos you know like so I

00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:28,040
think the pressure that's being put up

00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:30,300
right now in tech companies to actually

00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:31,740
material do things like posting their

00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:33,780
donation to different organizations

00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:35,640
beyond it in double-a-c-p don't just

00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:38,250
took one that everyone's looking I was

00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:39,750
there like diversify this a lot they're

00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:42,030
different ways to spend that money if

00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:44,430
it's a very important and I think too

00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:45,720
obvious point and even though Megan is

00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:47,400
we're talking about like Twitter or

00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:49,260
excuse me Facebook and Trump Suites the

00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,490
way these companies are structured

00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:53,070
they're structured around

00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:55,500
very few people making huge decisions

00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:57,870
Mark Zuckerberg decided that shooters

00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:59,490
looter whatever was okay on the site

00:26:57,870 --> 00:27:00,870
that was his decision and now all

00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:02,490
billions of people who are on the

00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:04,140
platform to do that but we think about

00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:06,000
material change we have to think about

00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:07,920
leadership and decision-making and it

00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,380
needs more collective than just like one

00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:12,420
white guy decides that this is okay we

00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:13,860
already do that it's called America tech

00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:15,740
companies on this ability to do that

00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:18,120
exactly

00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:19,410
yeah you're right I mean going back to

00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:22,500
you saying before about like material

00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:24,210
change I think this week alone we see in

00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:26,520
companies like IBM we've seen companies

00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:29,880
like Microsoft kind of put their facial

00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:31,650
recognition efforts on pause

00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,820
I would have liked to see it put like

00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:35,039
you know IBM canceled indefinitely

00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:35,970
Microsoft said just for a year I would

00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:36,419
like to see it from more than your

00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:40,140
daughter

00:27:36,419 --> 00:27:43,620
stop all right hey don't stop don't play

00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:45,150
dumb exactly like don't temporarily

00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:47,610
pause anything like just this is just

00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:49,830
stop you know my question to you guys

00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:54,539
and anybody could take this is what

00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:56,070
other areas do we want to see also need

00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:57,330
to be addressed where there's a kind of

00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:58,950
like a racial imbalance because they

00:27:57,330 --> 00:28:00,480
should rescue recognition tech you know

00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:02,580
doesn't operate the same way for me it

00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,500
as it does for you know Chad and Brad so

00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:07,590
like what other areas do you guys think

00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:09,919
we need to be addressed yeah I mean I

00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:13,140
think also just in in Labor's

00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:15,539
specifically like like whether it's like

00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:18,030
Amazon's warehouses where people are

00:28:15,539 --> 00:28:20,190
just like begging for more like personal

00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:23,610
protective equipment among among coven

00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:26,940
19 or if you think of like like gig

00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:29,100
workers for platforms like instant or -

00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:31,260
and ubereats an uber and lyft and all of

00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:34,500
them I mean I know in San Francisco at

00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:36,929
least like the the workforce is

00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:38,370
predominantly like people of color and

00:28:36,929 --> 00:28:40,830
like people of color are also

00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:43,380
disproportionately impacted by co19 in

00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:44,700
addition to systemic racism and so if

00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:46,650
with all these companies coming out

00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:48,539
these statements it's like oh like we

00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:50,250
care about black lives but like what are

00:28:48,539 --> 00:28:52,260
you doing for your actual like work

00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:54,960
force right now that needs help that

00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:57,059
like I think a little later today there

00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:59,460
there's like a mutual aid action among

00:28:57,059 --> 00:29:01,080
super drivers in the Bay Area because

00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:03,900
they're like well like we still haven't

00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:05,909
really received masks from uber so we're

00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:08,429
taking it upon ourselves to protect each

00:29:05,909 --> 00:29:09,990
other because this company that has very

00:29:08,429 --> 00:29:11,610
recently claimed they care about black

00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:13,710
lives it's not doing anything for the

00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:14,299
the black workers that they have right

00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:18,659
now

00:29:14,299 --> 00:29:21,299
black lives they employ right yeah I

00:29:18,659 --> 00:29:24,900
would just echo what Megan saying I mean

00:29:21,299 --> 00:29:27,210
definitely AI and the lack of

00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:29,400
representation that comes out in AI is

00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:30,630
terrifying not only what you've

00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,429
mentioned there but the fact that that

00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:33,809
Georgia State University studies showed

00:29:32,429 --> 00:29:35,789
that autonomous vehicles can't recognize

00:29:33,809 --> 00:29:38,190
dark skin another studies showed that

00:29:35,789 --> 00:29:39,659
when a white hand is holding a tool is

00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:41,100
recognized as a tool when a black hand

00:29:39,659 --> 00:29:42,330
is floating it was recognized as a gun

00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,470
is terrifying

00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:44,460
I don't want facial recognition

00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:45,659
technology because I don't want to end

00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:47,730
up in jail just cause of the color of my

00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:49,679
skin but the building off of what Megan

00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:51,330
said you know let's look at where

00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:52,650
representation of black people are in

00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:54,570
tech companies right now

00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:56,429
first of all overall as an industry we

00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:57,960
form a very very small minority and then

00:29:56,429 --> 00:30:00,419
when we think of positions of influence

00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:01,559
and power positions that can truly

00:30:00,419 --> 00:30:03,360
change the industry

00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:05,130
we're underrepresented again you don't

00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,780
see many black people on cap tables you

00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:08,640
don't see many black people on board you

00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:10,710
don't see many black lp's you don't see

00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,780
many black GPS I mean you don't even see

00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:14,929
I'm a black investors right and when we

00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:17,429
think about how technology has

00:30:14,929 --> 00:30:19,320
progressed over the last few years it's

00:30:17,429 --> 00:30:21,870
of course where the money is that real

00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:24,270
change has happened so if we really want

00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:25,710
to see pro-black movements within our

00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:28,289
industry we have to think about how we

00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:29,539
get people into those positions of power

00:30:28,289 --> 00:30:32,039
and I think in a lot of organizations

00:30:29,539 --> 00:30:33,270
they're not really thinking about how

00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:34,650
they can accelerate the progress of

00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:36,030
black professionals I mean to be honest

00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:37,770
anointment thinking about how to retain

00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:39,270
black professionals but we need black

00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:40,740
people in the c-suite and we need black

00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:41,610
people on boards and that should be

00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:43,320
something that companies should be

00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:45,120
really thinking about doing what is an

00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:47,039
accelerated management program I can put

00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,990
in place how can we diversify our cap

00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:50,460
table how can we diversify our board if

00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:53,390
founders aren't asking these questions

00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:56,039
nothing's gonna change

00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:57,600
nice try completely I completely agree

00:30:56,039 --> 00:30:59,460
with what avid SEO is saying and I think

00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,720
that just a sort of a correction point

00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:02,190
is to add to it I think it's really

00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,320
important that these initiatives going

00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:05,520
forward when we pick up these

00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:07,140
prioritized autonomy like obviously

00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:08,429
diversity if he's important and as we

00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:11,220
would love to see more Brown people he's

00:31:08,429 --> 00:31:13,169
not me but I don't like I don't like the

00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:15,690
idea of telling you know these like

00:31:13,169 --> 00:31:17,130
beautiful talented you know overcoming

00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:19,770
so much black people in Silicon Valley

00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:22,919
and elsewhere that the goal of life is

00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:24,270
to get a job at Google or an Amazon or

00:31:22,919 --> 00:31:26,970
you should wear whatever like you should

00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:28,830
also Billy be prioritizing you becoming

00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:31,440
the next whatever or doing the next

00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:33,059
great streaming platform communication

00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,650
platform whatever it is so prioritize

00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:37,140
not I mean just really stop sending the

00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:38,549
message that you you can create things

00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:39,870
for yourself if you don't if they're not

00:31:38,549 --> 00:31:41,580
out there for you and I think the main

00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:44,549
way to do that is investing in things

00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:46,110
like startups black hole businesses just

00:31:44,549 --> 00:31:47,640
you know people pulling money together

00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:49,049
and just like maybe creating your own

00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:51,330
little like real estate venture with

00:31:49,049 --> 00:31:53,520
whatever like I think this is like this

00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:55,590
sort of like Silicon Valley so tight cuz

00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:56,880
I did like adventurism and going down

00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:59,820
and working hard and all that

00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:01,230
but it's always you know a white 21 year

00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:02,580
old with the backpack I would love to

00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:04,230
see more people call them or women of

00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:06,750
color specifically more number Abid

00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:08,550
non-binary people getting that same

00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:10,170
message like go out and risk an

00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:12,570
experiment and if you don't work at

00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:14,070
these top five combinations okay there's

00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:15,570
other great ways to be successful in

00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:17,430
other ways to give back or than just you

00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:19,980
know they weren't defying as these big

00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:21,030
company although that have been corn you

00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:22,380
know I look at that point of like just

00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:25,080
like investing in the black people

00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:27,150
around you you guys are worried kind of

00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:30,240
to that point like right now has a lot

00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:31,560
of attention on black things you guys

00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:34,020
worry this is gonna dry up and like a

00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:37,560
week or two I'm worried about that

00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:40,230
person short answer is yes like it's

00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:42,480
because I mean we've seen we've

00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:44,730
definitely seen energy around black

00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:48,150
lives matter before it like an intact

00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:50,760
like following killings of Trayvon

00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:54,060
Martin and like Eric garner and others

00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:56,070
and but then it's always kind of gone

00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:59,730
back to like on the on the back burner

00:32:56,070 --> 00:33:02,910
so I mean I was talking to to Arlen

00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:06,240
Hamilton of back state's capital last

00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:08,730
last week and she was saying that like I

00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:10,710
think because of like because of kovat

00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:12,600
like people are kind of like just had

00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:13,920
this really like front row seat into

00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:15,000
like what's really happening in our

00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:17,910
world because there have just been like

00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,920
fewer distractions and so in one hand

00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:21,690
like perhaps this moment could be

00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:24,770
different but it's also but I also just

00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:26,760
feel I'm cautiously optimistic but

00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:29,160
honestly maybe even a little bit more

00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:34,260
pessimistic but like I I still love to

00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:36,510
hear about optimism so yeah you guys I

00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:38,070
mean sorry I'm too dressy but like well

00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:39,300
why is it this video that suddenly

00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:41,550
sparked all this because there's been so

00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:42,810
many of these videos it feels like but

00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:45,030
and you add this and then I thought you

00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:46,590
know I was like I do not know the answer

00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:49,740
to that I think to Megan's point you

00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:51,330
know we're all on the same level at the

00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:52,800
moment there's been this like global

00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:54,450
leveling because we're all at home and

00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:56,040
we're all here and there are fewer

00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:58,380
distractions to her point there's less

00:33:56,040 --> 00:34:00,360
stuff to report about and I am also

00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:01,770
worried that inevitably the hashtag will

00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:03,600
stop trending in the news cycle will

00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:05,100
move on I mean look here in the UK last

00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,200
Wednesday while protests were still

00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:08,090
alive and well across the globe I opened

00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,740
my Apple news

00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:11,750
and saw that the top trending story was

00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:13,760
new evidence in the Madeleine McCann

00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:15,200
case if her folks outside the UK she's a

00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,450
young British girl that went missing on

00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:20,390
holiday in Portugal about 13 years ago

00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:22,430
the evidence was not news a year old but

00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:23,900
that is how desperate the establishment

00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:26,570
were to talk about anything other than

00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:29,120
the black movement and I think what I

00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:31,340
have realized is we are living in times

00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:33,350
where reality is not reality anymore and

00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:34,880
truth is no longer the truth and that is

00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:37,160
the thing that's scary is for me it's

00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:38,780
like I go to a protest for black lives

00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:40,460
matter and it is peaceful and it is fine

00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:41,750
and when I check the news the next day

00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:44,630
the only stories I read are up the

00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:46,700
violence and the thuggery so what I am

00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:48,980
concerned about as an individual is like

00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:51,890
how do I keep my critical thinking in

00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:53,720
check in every decision I make to remind

00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:55,070
myself that systems of oppression exist

00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:56,450
because of the narratives that we read

00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:58,430
and because of the stories that we

00:34:56,450 --> 00:34:59,630
consume and sometimes the stories I

00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:00,860
consume that I was supposed to be the

00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:02,390
truth are not actually going to be the

00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:04,400
truth or the reality that I experience

00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:05,990
so that that's what this is exposed to

00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:08,600
me and I have this fear now or it's just

00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:10,490
like it's gonna take so much work for me

00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:11,750
to know what is truly really happening

00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:13,900
in the world and I don't know if I have

00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:16,400
the energy or the tools for that

00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:19,160
so journalists in the room Sydney Megan

00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:24,050
it's on you alone to keep this narrative

00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:25,880
the lies all on you yeah that's it sorry

00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:28,520
I go in Sydney though I'll chime in

00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:30,440
after you I mean I just had made a

00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:31,850
little bit of like a rough metaphor but

00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,870
going off what you were saying about you

00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:34,250
know you go to the protest and it's

00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:35,930
peaceful when I like half of the psyche

00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:37,430
will you see all this media coverage of

00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:40,580
how violent it is there are might of you

00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:42,800
so much of like next door because um

00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:45,290
someone in Megan like I look for my cell

00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:47,210
phone next door and it's like one of the

00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:49,220
things that I would invite the white

00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:50,750
people listening to really think about

00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:53,810
empathize with is when you're black

00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:55,640
you're constantly aware of how parts of

00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:58,550
your personality your appearance read as

00:35:55,640 --> 00:36:00,650
violent or as not fitting in and so when

00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:02,450
I go on next door I'm looking for black

00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:04,130
guy with headphones like I would dyed

00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:05,660
hair you know things like that so it's

00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:07,040
like even when I'm just coming home from

00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:09,290
the grocery store coming home from being

00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,010
out at night I'm thinking about how do I

00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:12,200
look

00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:13,730
how would people perceive me and I think

00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:15,440
similarly when you go to these protests

00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:17,180
you're at you have this you still have

00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:19,220
to maintain the witness awareness of

00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:20,780
like this is going to be perceived as

00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:21,940
violent all I'm doing is thing I don't

00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:24,280
want to be murdered

00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:27,220
christine is violent and it's so if it's

00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:29,680
a double dissonance to go to a protest

00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:32,079
which is an expression of that rage and

00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:34,000
still have that rage against how unfair

00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:35,619
it is to do that and still have to deal

00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,900
with this is when we cover it this way

00:36:35,619 --> 00:36:39,400
or like 99% of code s is going to be

00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:41,829
nonviolent but what's going to go viral

00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:43,930
on the news in front of me the one guy

00:36:41,829 --> 00:36:45,849
that threw a pop OH and then that was

00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:48,220
all going to be about and so it's like

00:36:45,849 --> 00:36:50,579
even and like yes this moment is

00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:53,800
different but even when we're genuinely

00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:55,210
expressing how unfair and frustrating

00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:57,160
this experience is we still have to be

00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:58,900
aware of like my one eye too much flag

00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:00,609
because my mask like you look this way

00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:01,720
how will my neighbors see it and things

00:37:00,609 --> 00:37:03,970
like that and like that

00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:06,640
psychic pressure has not been alleviated

00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:09,460
at all it's only worse and even though

00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:10,839
we're having a conversation about the

00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:12,400
emotional paranoia of white people and

00:37:10,839 --> 00:37:13,420
the violence of the causes like even

00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,819
while it was happening we're still

00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:17,890
dealing with it at the same time and

00:37:15,819 --> 00:37:20,109
it's like again so we asked about doing

00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:20,920
like more or less okay now I don't think

00:37:20,109 --> 00:37:26,200
if there a lot of different a different

00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:28,390
thing yeah I mean everything you say

00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:30,819
like resonates like I I wonder like I

00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:33,040
think about a lot how just to be black

00:37:30,819 --> 00:37:34,660
and just to be burdened like there's so

00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,010
many burdens you got to carry day to day

00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:38,260
life like I wonder if white people go

00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:39,069
home and look for themselves a next door

00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:41,980
I don't think that's a something that

00:37:39,069 --> 00:37:43,660
can relate to like in a weird way I feel

00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:45,220
like I judge about this yesterday with

00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:47,500
some of you guys would like with uh

00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:49,720
people on the call yes they were like

00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:51,670
every employed black person right now is

00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:53,319
doing like double work like I've been

00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:55,030
going into meetings I've never been part

00:37:53,319 --> 00:37:56,619
of many people I've never been just

00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:58,690
because we're in his moment right now of

00:37:56,619 --> 00:37:59,710
like black lives matter and it's good

00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:01,270
you know you always want that seat at

00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:03,280
the table that's like you know now we're

00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:06,069
really getting to see the table which is

00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:08,380
good but just like even when we're not

00:38:06,069 --> 00:38:09,790
going through this moment like you're

00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:11,319
you're always to people you have to be

00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:12,910
yourself you have to be the version of

00:38:11,319 --> 00:38:15,510
you that white people are comfortable

00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:17,920
there Bush it is wild and I don't think

00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:19,990
why do you understand that I think

00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:23,200
anyway I think what you're touching on

00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:25,510
is the fact that identity dictates our

00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:27,880
experience of life right we have no

00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:29,530
choice over it but you're born into this

00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:31,900
world and then your identity is there

00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:33,640
right and then it's like it's like the

00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:35,920
difficulty setting of the video game of

00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:37,810
life has been chosen for you right so if

00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:39,490
you're a white male you're on easy and

00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:41,290
if you're a black woman you're on hard

00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:43,359
and again we have no choice over this

00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:44,890
but again where you have privileges

00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:45,849
where you're in the dominant group and

00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:47,170
we're in you're in the dominant group

00:38:45,849 --> 00:38:49,060
you're in the default and what are we

00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:50,470
realizing in this time is that people in

00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:52,450
the default dominant group I hate white

00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:54,160
people they've never had to engage with

00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:55,930
their identity I asked my white husband

00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:59,260
yesterday when did you realize you were

00:38:55,930 --> 00:39:01,810
white he had no answer for this every

00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:03,190
black person knows when they realized

00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:04,869
they were black right this is what John

00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:07,089
boyega was saying at the London protest

00:39:04,869 --> 00:39:09,220
and so there is a discomfort that comes

00:39:07,089 --> 00:39:11,319
with engaging with your identity when

00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:13,030
it's new to you but we went through that

00:39:11,319 --> 00:39:14,650
discomfort when we joined kindergarten

00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:16,390
or preschool and someone pointed out we

00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:18,460
were different and I think what I'm

00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:20,349
asking white folks is get through that

00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:22,150
discomfort okay because when we get

00:39:20,349 --> 00:39:27,040
through the discomfort is where the

00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:29,319
action starts yeah like I won't yeah I

00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:33,060
won't I'll never forget it was second

00:39:29,319 --> 00:39:34,960
grade I can name the guy but I was

00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:36,549
nicknamed him

00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:40,359
no one's watching us no one's watching

00:39:36,549 --> 00:39:43,210
this like to only it's only us here it's

00:39:40,359 --> 00:39:46,420
alright but like I this to this was

00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:49,089
second grade and so we were talking

00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:51,160
about : Powell and I I didn't know who

00:39:49,089 --> 00:39:53,549
he was at the time at the time and like

00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:56,200
you know I was a second grader but I

00:39:53,549 --> 00:39:58,150
could give myself a bit of a benefit of

00:39:56,200 --> 00:40:00,430
the doubt but like this white kid he was

00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:02,109
just like oh my god like you don't even

00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:04,150
know about your own people and I'm like

00:40:02,109 --> 00:40:06,400
oh like oh my god I need to know about

00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:09,250
every black person that has ever existed

00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:11,890
it exists right now and like but I just

00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:13,510
remember feeling so much shame around

00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:15,099
that and I think like that's like one of

00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:18,220
the first memories I have realizing like

00:40:15,099 --> 00:40:19,990
oh like I am different people see me as

00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:23,020
being different and therefore expect

00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:24,579
different things from me and and even

00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:27,039
just like I don't know in this moment

00:40:24,579 --> 00:40:29,890
I've kind of been grappling with like

00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:34,000
yeah the my different identity is like

00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:36,700
okay like being a black woman being a

00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,770
black journalist like being a black

00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:40,930
journalist who has decided to cover

00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:43,619
diversity and inclusion in tech but like

00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:45,880
well also feeling like I feel

00:40:43,619 --> 00:40:48,579
emotionally exhausted right now and like

00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:51,089
that like Xavier that the PC reference

00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:53,529
that I published earlier this week like

00:40:51,089 --> 00:40:55,839
that was that was very hard for me to

00:40:53,529 --> 00:40:58,420
write it was just I really had to force

00:40:55,839 --> 00:41:00,520
myself to write anything because I felt

00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:05,529
like well I can't just not say anything

00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:07,299
and and because I'm one of the one of

00:41:05,529 --> 00:41:09,069
the few black reporters at TechCrunch I

00:41:07,299 --> 00:41:11,799
felt like okay well like I have this

00:41:09,069 --> 00:41:14,349
responsibility to say something while

00:41:11,799 --> 00:41:15,880
also feeling like well also thinking

00:41:14,349 --> 00:41:18,130
like but I don't really feel like saying

00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:21,099
anything and like can that just be okay

00:41:18,130 --> 00:41:23,319
and I ended up writing something and

00:41:21,099 --> 00:41:25,569
like I the second I published it I just

00:41:23,319 --> 00:41:28,869
felt like some relief I was like okay

00:41:25,569 --> 00:41:31,000
like I've said something like hopefully

00:41:28,869 --> 00:41:32,950
that that counts for something and I can

00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,829
kind of just like go back into my little

00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:37,510
hole but yeah I know it's been yeah it's

00:41:35,829 --> 00:41:39,339
been complicated times for me for sure

00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:41,410
yeah feel like like I said like to be

00:41:39,339 --> 00:41:43,390
blackest to be burdened like I feel like

00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:46,770
this is a problem we didn't cause but

00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:48,310
it's weirdly on us to solve it

00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:50,830
this is Strang

00:41:48,310 --> 00:41:52,330
like like when you guys said before like

00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:54,010
you know I've had millions of my white

00:41:52,330 --> 00:41:55,900
friends hit me up like hey are you okay

00:41:54,010 --> 00:41:58,720
like I'm literally as black little as

00:41:55,900 --> 00:42:00,820
yesterday I'm I'm the same but like I

00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:02,500
feel like what I tell them is just

00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:05,020
donating money and just call out racism

00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:06,300
when you see it and I feel like to kind

00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:09,610
of read back to tech and tech companies

00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:10,630
you know I keep bringing up Amazon but I

00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:12,310
was not the big one when it comes to

00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:16,630
this stuff you know they all say they

00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:17,980
donated ten million dollars and for me

00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:19,300
it doesn't feel good enough who how what

00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:21,370
do you guys think when you see that like

00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:22,590
are they good now like this they solve

00:42:21,370 --> 00:42:24,910
racism that's not good

00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:27,810
Amazon will never be good it's gonna

00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:30,720
take a lot for them to be good I think

00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:33,790
but but even yeah just kind of using

00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:37,330
like Softbank as an as an example which

00:42:33,790 --> 00:42:39,670
like yeah they have they're like like

00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:40,780
100 billion dollar vision fund I keep I

00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:42,070
keep like getting that number may be

00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:44,650
mildly wrong but it's in the billions

00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:47,110
and then but to to black lives they

00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:49,300
committed like 100 million which is just

00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:51,160
like given like we know how much money

00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:53,020
they have and are willing to put behind

00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:55,360
things if they like actually care about

00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:58,090
like 100 million in the context of like

00:42:55,360 --> 00:43:00,250
billions doesn't feel like a lot and

00:42:58,090 --> 00:43:01,450
like and we're just seeing and then we

00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:04,750
get we're just seeing companies just

00:43:01,450 --> 00:43:06,100
like put like pennies behind like behind

00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:07,480
the black lives matter movement when

00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:10,450
they've put like millions or billions

00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:12,460
Tory toward other things yeah and I

00:43:10,450 --> 00:43:14,260
think to Megan's plain other ring

00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:16,060
doesn't solve the problem right

00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:17,980
of the ring is how we got here like

00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:20,080
we're not we're not saying like hey

00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:22,180
because of like structural reasons and

00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:24,010
the fact that you have not checked the

00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:25,960
bias in your own mind in your

00:43:24,010 --> 00:43:27,640
decision-making and how you allocate

00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:28,990
funding and who you choose to hire to

00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:31,030
make decisions about who gets funded

00:43:28,990 --> 00:43:33,130
because you haven't done the work to

00:43:31,030 --> 00:43:34,810
check the bias and mitigate impact of

00:43:33,130 --> 00:43:35,590
bias and structural oppression your

00:43:34,810 --> 00:43:37,510
decision-making

00:43:35,590 --> 00:43:39,340
you haven't invested in black founders

00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:41,530
but what you're basically saying is I

00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:43,210
don't want to do the work of unpacking

00:43:41,530 --> 00:43:45,760
that and improving this is like

00:43:43,210 --> 00:43:47,350
improving the way I go about things and

00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:49,690
and dismantling this system of

00:43:47,350 --> 00:43:51,190
oppression so I'm gonna keep on doing

00:43:49,690 --> 00:43:53,110
the thing in the system of oppression

00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:55,240
keep on perpetuating it but I'll make a

00:43:53,110 --> 00:43:58,000
little side thing here so we don't

00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:59,650
forget about you black people and I just

00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,109
think do we want to create lasting

00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:03,970
change or do we want to put a

00:44:02,109 --> 00:44:06,220
landed on a wound that is going to

00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:07,779
explode eventually right I think a lot

00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:10,420
of people like Jeff base also like I got

00:44:07,779 --> 00:44:12,099
my bunker so it's good whatever happens

00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:14,680
I'll just hide out under there and it's

00:44:12,099 --> 00:44:17,380
fine no like that's not how the world

00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:19,299
changes like you either get involved in

00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:22,829
helping change or you're on the on the

00:44:19,299 --> 00:44:22,829
wrong side of a very ugly fight

00:44:23,290 --> 00:44:29,510
yeah yeah yesterday my colleague and I

00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:32,780
we had a conversation with Sidney Sikes

00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:33,920
of a black VC and and yeah in Sydney was

00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:36,650
talking about this is kind of to your

00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:38,960
point of an se but like she was talking

00:44:36,650 --> 00:44:41,630
about how some people are like creating

00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:43,760
like separate funds to to fund like

00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:45,530
black founders but it's like you know

00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:48,410
like that should just be part of your

00:44:45,530 --> 00:44:50,150
regular job of your regular fund and and

00:44:48,410 --> 00:44:51,800
like and like you're saying nah but I

00:44:50,150 --> 00:44:53,720
see about like habits it's like okay

00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:56,180
well like that fund is only gonna last

00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:57,200
so launch like once once you've invested

00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:59,599
all the money in that fund you're gonna

00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:01,880
create a new fund or will you say like

00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:03,470
well like we've done it and I were just

00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:05,240
going to go back to her like regular

00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:07,040
fund and keep investing in white people

00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:10,430
and so like I think yeah there needs to

00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:12,440
be more of an effort to really like yeah

00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:13,849
it's there needs to be more integration

00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:15,109
and like not this like other and it's

00:45:13,849 --> 00:45:17,359
like okay well like here's our fun for

00:45:15,109 --> 00:45:19,040
black people like over there and like

00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:21,290
here's our here's our white fund with

00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:22,940
like most of the capital and like most

00:45:21,290 --> 00:45:26,599
of the the assets and energy that we're

00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:28,040
putting behind all this you said I mean

00:45:26,599 --> 00:45:30,349
that's one of my biggest fears and all

00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:31,369
this is like all right when it's no is

00:45:30,349 --> 00:45:33,109
when it's no longer cool to be talking

00:45:31,369 --> 00:45:36,200
about black lives matter is that fun

00:45:33,109 --> 00:45:37,640
still gonna be there yeah so you know

00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,900
we're talking about second type that we

00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:40,940
talked a lot about tech that harms us

00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:45,099
the part of this talk also the tech that

00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:48,200
helps us and you know the George Floyd

00:45:45,099 --> 00:45:49,640
killing we almost didn't see that we

00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:51,650
didn't have to see that that would

00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:55,010
happen 20 years ago we would never have

00:45:51,650 --> 00:45:56,750
even heard about it I wanted to talk to

00:45:55,010 --> 00:45:59,330
you guys about say like the role the

00:45:56,750 --> 00:46:01,280
smartphone camera when it comes to this

00:45:59,330 --> 00:46:03,050
you know to me sometimes it feels like

00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:05,570
the next version of civil rights

00:46:03,050 --> 00:46:06,800
movement black lives matter does I just

00:46:05,570 --> 00:46:09,020
was like civil rights move up with like

00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:10,000
smartphones and social media so I want

00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:13,250
to talk about like the role of

00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:15,170
smartphone cameras and like you know how

00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:17,720
it's been meaningful to black lives

00:46:15,170 --> 00:46:20,750
matter movement

00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:23,330
um yeah if I can just jump in I will say

00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:27,650
I used to cover body cameras a lot and

00:46:23,330 --> 00:46:29,420
it's it was 2015 and 2016 the Obama

00:46:27,650 --> 00:46:30,950
administration's own ADA I mean no I

00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:32,750
might give you some results I'm working

00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:34,610
forty to fifty million dollars in grants

00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:36,380
to the Department of Justice to body

00:46:34,610 --> 00:46:38,510
cameras going to all these front state

00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:40,550
departments and you know shockingly we

00:46:38,510 --> 00:46:42,920
had all these issues of camera fell off

00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:45,050
the battery ran out the footage was

00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:47,210
corrupted the camera wasn't turned on it

00:46:45,050 --> 00:46:48,710
was supposed to be and a lot of the

00:46:47,210 --> 00:46:50,840
police officers that were involved in

00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:52,250
these issues didn't get in trouble or

00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:53,870
they were reassigned or things like that

00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:56,330
so I think what's so shocking to me

00:46:53,870 --> 00:46:58,610
isn't that people are recording and live

00:46:56,330 --> 00:47:00,890
streaming these incidents and said we

00:46:58,610 --> 00:47:02,870
had an entire industry like this was

00:47:00,890 --> 00:47:05,480
supposed to be a problem that Obama saw

00:47:02,870 --> 00:47:07,010
what he put or his administration fees

00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:08,900
and put 50 million dollars into the

00:47:07,010 --> 00:47:10,280
future of body cameras essentially doing

00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:11,480
the same thing right like the body

00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:13,220
cameras were on camera you're supposed

00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:14,920
to like reports incident and so it's

00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:17,230
like wiser that we're seeing so much

00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:20,030
activity and justice and activism

00:47:17,230 --> 00:47:23,930
movements and just emotional connection

00:47:20,030 --> 00:47:25,520
from these iPhone you mean Facebook

00:47:23,930 --> 00:47:26,870
posted to Facebook you know and these

00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:28,670
other things and we're not seeing this

00:47:26,870 --> 00:47:30,440
from idk my footage I'm not saying body

00:47:28,670 --> 00:47:33,230
camera footage didn't you know hasn't

00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:35,690
ever been you know a big part of a case

00:47:33,230 --> 00:47:37,370
in propagating a cop and that they have

00:47:35,690 --> 00:47:39,050
but it's like why did he put fifty

00:47:37,370 --> 00:47:40,580
million dollars in the days when all the

00:47:39,050 --> 00:47:42,320
body cameras are a big part of the

00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:44,030
justice of policing Act which is

00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:46,190
introduced it weeks ago it was like we

00:47:44,030 --> 00:47:47,990
put all this money in for like this this

00:47:46,190 --> 00:47:50,780
thing but this is this thing that's

00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:53,390
working can we just like you know so

00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:56,300
it's like I just feel like it just sort

00:47:53,390 --> 00:47:59,840
of speaks for how little trust there is

00:47:56,300 --> 00:48:01,850
in the idea that this will be solved in

00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:03,110
an institutional manner or in a policy

00:48:01,850 --> 00:48:05,060
matter because it's like what actually

00:48:03,110 --> 00:48:07,190
you know is getting people out of their

00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:09,200
seats and into the streets is just what

00:48:07,190 --> 00:48:10,760
going out by yourself on courses where

00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:12,560
you're with your phone and not to think

00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:14,360
that we the institutional response would

00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:16,520
put fifty million dollars fifty million

00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:18,800
taxpayer dollars you me all these people

00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:20,750
here are money into that they didn't it

00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:22,850
didn't do what see the other things

00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:24,980
we're doing now like it's not just the

00:48:22,850 --> 00:48:28,190
technology it's who holds the technology

00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:30,710
it matters that it's in you know a 1700

00:48:28,190 --> 00:48:31,520
block open and not just you know on the

00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:33,290
chest willfully

00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:35,090
but there may or may not turn it on and

00:48:33,290 --> 00:48:40,280
the footage may or may not get loved the

00:48:35,090 --> 00:48:42,140
battery may or may not and yeah screams

00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:44,570
in the media like that's on us to do

00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:45,800
like it feels like maybe not in the

00:48:44,570 --> 00:48:47,360
police should be recording this footage

00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:48,710
but like a separate entity who like

00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:51,680
records it so that the footage doesn't

00:48:48,710 --> 00:48:53,660
get eventually a lost or doesn't surface

00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:56,210
like if once again like they're not

00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:58,820
probably creative it's weirdly feels

00:48:56,210 --> 00:49:01,340
like it's on us to like handle it which

00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:02,930
is weird and another thing I want to

00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:04,760
talk about I don't you I was going to

00:49:02,930 --> 00:49:07,400
add to that last point but the other

00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:09,290
thing I would say next is like I think

00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:10,520
about the role of Twitter and all this

00:49:09,290 --> 00:49:11,720
and I'd only give Twitter so much credit

00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:14,750
because Twitter is still the place that

00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:16,520
lets Trump flourish he'll I guess the

00:49:14,750 --> 00:49:19,369
tweet whatever he wants and only just

00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:20,780
now we're seeing Twitter kind of put the

00:49:19,369 --> 00:49:24,500
reins on him with the looting shooting

00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:26,600
truck tweet but at the same time you

00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:27,770
know just in day to day when we're not

00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:30,050
you know thinking about the fact wearing

00:49:27,770 --> 00:49:31,760
a shot dead like blacks Twitter is just

00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:33,500
such a great source of relief just in

00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:36,140
your day to day life

00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:38,630
and Twitter in these unfortunate

00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:40,820
situations are a great way to get the

00:49:38,630 --> 00:49:42,380
word out so I'm afraid to give too much

00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:45,590
credit but like I do want to talk about

00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:48,800
all you know Twitter's effectiveness and

00:49:45,590 --> 00:49:51,080
also how do we make these platforms make

00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:52,730
products that are more beneficial to us

00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:55,600
in the ways that Twitter black Twitter

00:49:52,730 --> 00:49:55,600
can be

00:49:56,270 --> 00:50:02,960
I mean one opinion I have on this is

00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:05,750
like um apps like block party which help

00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:07,730
you you know stop yourself from being

00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:09,320
exposed to abuse and trolling are really

00:50:07,730 --> 00:50:13,330
important I mean a lot of us probably

00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:16,790
have great racism and racially motivated

00:50:13,330 --> 00:50:18,830
conversations on Twitter and we know how

00:50:16,790 --> 00:50:20,630
the trolls becoming on us like you know

00:50:18,830 --> 00:50:22,700
as soon as you post anything about black

00:50:20,630 --> 00:50:25,280
people suffering there's like 15 people

00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:29,060
telling you that they've suffered racism

00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:31,339
to reverse racism you know um and it's

00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:33,349
it's ridiculous so I think it's great

00:50:31,339 --> 00:50:35,180
that apps like Tracy Trost block-party

00:50:33,349 --> 00:50:36,290
exist I think it's bad that they have -

00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:38,000
I feel like Twitter should have thought

00:50:36,290 --> 00:50:39,500
of this if they really cared about us if

00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,060
black people are making decisions up

00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:42,440
there where it really matters I feel

00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:44,960
like this would have been on the product

00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:46,490
roadmap and that's great um the one

00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:48,170
thing I just wanted to say well you were

00:50:46,490 --> 00:50:50,690
talking about this is you know one of

00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:52,070
the reasons why the president gets to

00:50:50,690 --> 00:50:53,839
say the things that he does is because

00:50:52,070 --> 00:50:56,000
everyone kind of says that free speech

00:50:53,839 --> 00:50:57,890
it's free speech and what really

00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:01,430
frustrates me is that the people who get

00:50:57,890 --> 00:51:03,050
to say things that incite murder and get

00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:06,680
away with free speech are always white

00:51:03,050 --> 00:51:10,339
and when jihadists say things that

00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:12,349
incite murder they're terrorists and I

00:51:10,339 --> 00:51:14,920
think technology's relationship with

00:51:12,349 --> 00:51:17,660
free speech has to be critically

00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:19,880
examined because it seems like you get a

00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:22,099
license to free speech when you have

00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:24,349
white and male privilege and when you

00:51:22,099 --> 00:51:24,980
don't have that it's not free speech

00:51:24,349 --> 00:51:26,990
anymore

00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:28,250
so I feel like that's something worth

00:51:26,990 --> 00:51:31,099
mentioning cuz we need to do a lot of

00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:34,040
work there yeah yeah like there's been

00:51:31,099 --> 00:51:36,830
yes several instances on like on

00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:39,440
Facebook like over the years of black

00:51:36,830 --> 00:51:42,530
activists just saying just talking about

00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:44,300
racism generally and like and then

00:51:42,530 --> 00:51:45,890
they've been banned or blocked from

00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:47,480
Facebook and they've really had to go

00:51:45,890 --> 00:51:49,339
through a lot and originally get their

00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:50,810
accounts reactivated but then like you

00:51:49,339 --> 00:51:52,310
know you have Trump like literally

00:51:50,810 --> 00:51:53,990
inciting violence and it's like no I

00:51:52,310 --> 00:51:55,550
thought that's okay but it's like yeah

00:51:53,990 --> 00:51:57,020
he has the the privilege of being white

00:51:55,550 --> 00:51:59,900
he has a privilege of being male of

00:51:57,020 --> 00:52:03,050
being the president somehow and like so

00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:04,430
there's yeah the same the same there

00:52:03,050 --> 00:52:07,190
they're like yeah their standards and

00:52:04,430 --> 00:52:10,220
their policies are not applied like

00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:12,290
equally like across the board

00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:13,430
yes and I like what you said yesterday

00:52:12,290 --> 00:52:16,520
when we were talking about something

00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:18,050
similar about how like one company can

00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:20,180
kind of dictate what free speech looks

00:52:18,050 --> 00:52:22,210
like and then how other everyone else

00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:25,220
follows and how they can be so dangerous

00:52:22,210 --> 00:52:27,890
yeah there's this weird thing that's

00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:31,130
been happening some 2014 that I've

00:52:27,890 --> 00:52:33,790
noticed where I remember there was a

00:52:31,130 --> 00:52:35,690
whole like Facebook is censoring

00:52:33,790 --> 00:52:37,460
conservatives because of the trending

00:52:35,690 --> 00:52:40,010
topics product and then after that there

00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:41,510
was no push to hire more conservatives

00:52:40,010 --> 00:52:44,030
and so the policy discussions and then

00:52:41,510 --> 00:52:45,500
two years ago there was you know me two

00:52:44,030 --> 00:52:47,240
happens there was a huge push to hire

00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:48,590
women and now like you were saying

00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:50,150
earlier all of a sudden invites all

00:52:48,590 --> 00:52:51,770
these meaning from now we're really so

00:52:50,150 --> 00:52:53,390
like right so it's like you would think

00:52:51,770 --> 00:52:55,250
that tech companies are sort of like

00:52:53,390 --> 00:52:56,960
take a second female to be like all

00:52:55,250 --> 00:53:00,470
right we have to stop with this sort of

00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:02,570
like hyper reactive responsive sort of

00:53:00,470 --> 00:53:04,370
led whenever something goes wrong all we

00:53:02,570 --> 00:53:05,930
start to take a minority or we pick a

00:53:04,370 --> 00:53:07,850
group and we like uplift them

00:53:05,930 --> 00:53:10,160
temporarily and then we just move on on

00:53:07,850 --> 00:53:11,570
to the other group sorry but it was you

00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:13,550
know women people color whatever

00:53:11,570 --> 00:53:15,950
whatever whatever and it's I don't know

00:53:13,550 --> 00:53:18,050
why they wouldn't take the time just be

00:53:15,950 --> 00:53:19,820
like we are constantly we're so behind

00:53:18,050 --> 00:53:21,670
the Contras or there's behind the

00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:24,110
culture we're so behind the pace of

00:53:21,670 --> 00:53:25,970
society and it's like if they took the

00:53:24,110 --> 00:53:28,370
time to realize every two years you have

00:53:25,970 --> 00:53:29,630
to Christ is higher in you know obvious

00:53:28,370 --> 00:53:31,340
people of color all these women all

00:53:29,630 --> 00:53:33,050
these people with disabilities whatever

00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:34,430
they would they would make things that

00:53:33,050 --> 00:53:36,590
change and you guys are talking about in

00:53:34,430 --> 00:53:37,730
terms of like maybe we can set it up so

00:53:36,590 --> 00:53:39,770
that there's a structural shift so that

00:53:37,730 --> 00:53:41,510
every four hours we don't have to

00:53:39,770 --> 00:53:44,330
drastically re

00:53:41,510 --> 00:53:46,130
hire we do whatever but in order to do

00:53:44,330 --> 00:53:48,230
that you would frankly have to stand for

00:53:46,130 --> 00:53:50,450
something that they have like values

00:53:48,230 --> 00:53:52,070
that don't shift with the waves of

00:53:50,450 --> 00:53:54,020
political opinion and I think that's

00:53:52,070 --> 00:53:56,360
what is lacking because the thing that

00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:58,520
we really emphasize in Silicon Valley is

00:53:56,360 --> 00:54:00,800
scale and growth grow these companies as

00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:02,660
big as you can as fast and can and value

00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:05,360
something you come up with later so that

00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:07,460
lack of a foundation of like actually

00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:08,960
believing in something actually having

00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:11,030
fun the same time like how your parts

00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:12,650
relate to society I think is missing and

00:54:11,030 --> 00:54:14,750
so that's where their concrete flapping

00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:18,580
and new values every two years with some

00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:19,760
new political you know Christ

00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:23,000
yeah

00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:24,880
Oh God oh yeah no just gonna say yeah

00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,450
like like thumbtack for example um

00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:27,650
they're they're kind of like a

00:54:26,450 --> 00:54:29,720
TaskRabbit thing where they like you

00:54:27,650 --> 00:54:32,600
know icky like hire contractors and you

00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:34,760
like have them do like tasks but um they

00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:37,190
like they laid off their head of DNI

00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:40,700
like amid like all the covert stuff and

00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:42,410
April I believe and then like then like

00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:44,690
about a week ago they're like all right

00:54:42,410 --> 00:54:47,210
like we're hiring ahead of DNI like in

00:54:44,690 --> 00:54:48,590
response to you know George Lloyd's

00:54:47,210 --> 00:54:51,290
killing and like all the other killings

00:54:48,590 --> 00:54:53,240
of black people as of late and it's just

00:54:51,290 --> 00:54:54,410
like okay well they're now they're

00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:56,180
saying like oh like this is a big

00:54:54,410 --> 00:54:58,070
priority but like but apparently it

00:54:56,180 --> 00:55:00,350
wasn't just like a couple of months ago

00:54:58,070 --> 00:55:02,840
and maybe you hired that head of DNI in

00:55:00,350 --> 00:55:04,460
response to some other thing and you're

00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:05,840
like okay well I can kind of we've done

00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:07,670
that thing it's no owner of priority and

00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:09,619
then oh woops like it's it's still

00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:12,950
priority and we need to like save face

00:55:09,619 --> 00:55:15,350
by hiring a new head of DNI and and yeah

00:55:12,950 --> 00:55:17,330
and like the DNI the head of D&I who was

00:55:15,350 --> 00:55:18,530
laid off I guess like he said that they

00:55:17,330 --> 00:55:20,930
let him know that they were like

00:55:18,530 --> 00:55:23,210
rehiring and he was just kind of like no

00:55:20,930 --> 00:55:25,640
like you clearly don't take this

00:55:23,210 --> 00:55:29,060
seriously so why why should I work for

00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:30,200
you again and that's exactly why I am

00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:32,560
worried about people just forgetting

00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:34,940
about all this in two weeks because like

00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:37,280
right now it's very cool to you know be

00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:39,260
it's a black lives matter but we people

00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:42,020
have kind of showed us who they are just

00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:43,550
by their actions every day so I mean

00:55:42,020 --> 00:55:45,350
maybe I'll be maybe I'm I'll be

00:55:43,550 --> 00:55:46,490
surprised and people will prove me wrong

00:55:45,350 --> 00:55:48,320
and two weeks when I was still talking

00:55:46,490 --> 00:55:50,300
about it but I don't know

00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:51,470
so this panel's must be 40 minutes and

00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:53,600
we're over time but I think we're still

00:55:51,470 --> 00:55:55,460
good but I'll go to my last question

00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:58,880
I'll skip to it I want to get an answer

00:55:55,460 --> 00:56:00,800
from each of you I was my girlfriend was

00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:02,330
watching the other day The Oprah special

00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:04,970
about this called where do we go from

00:56:02,330 --> 00:56:07,130
here and I'm watching it and you know

00:56:04,970 --> 00:56:09,020
she has on like a Stacey Abrams and Ava

00:56:07,130 --> 00:56:11,690
Duvernay and he surely has bottoms

00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:12,830
basically you know the UN have black

00:56:11,690 --> 00:56:14,570
people the United Nations the black

00:56:12,830 --> 00:56:16,160
people but you know it's called where do

00:56:14,570 --> 00:56:18,980
we go from here and then as I'm watching

00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:20,420
I'm thinking like why once again is it

00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:22,190
on us to fix this like it why is it

00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:24,109
where do we go from the other why aren't

00:56:22,190 --> 00:56:25,369
white people having the where do we go

00:56:24,109 --> 00:56:28,970
from your conversation it's not a

00:56:25,369 --> 00:56:31,190
problem that we brought on ourselves

00:56:28,970 --> 00:56:32,240
like why why isn't it why is the actual

00:56:31,190 --> 00:56:34,200
United Nations not having this

00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:37,599
conversation

00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:40,900
so my question to you guys is like what

00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:43,180
do you guys want to see white people do

00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:45,220
like you know right friends like larger

00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:46,839
society like everyone like what do you

00:56:45,220 --> 00:56:48,099
want to see others like we should not do

00:56:46,839 --> 00:56:50,470
anything like what do you want to see

00:56:48,099 --> 00:56:52,210
other people do I think for me it's like

00:56:50,470 --> 00:56:53,740
going back to what I was saying earlier

00:56:52,210 --> 00:56:55,000
like what are the habits we want to

00:56:53,740 --> 00:56:57,550
develop like we are what we repeatedly

00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:59,109
do so one of the anti-racist pro-black

00:56:57,550 --> 00:57:00,640
habits you're gonna develop I think

00:56:59,109 --> 00:57:02,050
white people are realizing now that they

00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:03,940
have the privilege and the benefit of

00:57:02,050 --> 00:57:06,130
being in the default group you know the

00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:08,349
main group the privileged group and so

00:57:06,130 --> 00:57:09,970
that means that we know everything about

00:57:08,349 --> 00:57:11,950
white culture and what it is to be white

00:57:09,970 --> 00:57:13,180
as well as what it is to be black white

00:57:11,950 --> 00:57:14,800
people don't know what it's like to be

00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:16,540
anything but white and they've not

00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:18,220
really done the work to try and

00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:19,599
understand so I want you to read the

00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:21,880
books that are written by black people

00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:23,770
watch the shows that I written by black

00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:25,960
people you know you're soon gonna run

00:57:23,770 --> 00:57:27,790
out of stuff cuz we don't get a lot of

00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:31,480
chances to be published or create

00:57:27,790 --> 00:57:34,300
content you know by black as well but

00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:37,750
what I'm trying to say is like let us

00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:40,780
play a role in society let us play an

00:57:37,750 --> 00:57:41,369
active and equal role in society stop

00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:45,520
other

00:57:41,369 --> 00:57:47,890
stop defaulting to the assumptions that

00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:49,599
we've you know consumed like I've been

00:57:47,890 --> 00:57:51,040
watching a lot of bell hooks but I think

00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:54,160
everything she says is so true you know

00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:55,690
like resist representations when you

00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:58,660
when you read something about a black

00:57:55,690 --> 00:58:01,150
person on next door or in the news

00:57:58,660 --> 00:58:03,579
challenge that narrative don't take it

00:58:01,150 --> 00:58:05,710
at face value and just consume content

00:58:03,579 --> 00:58:09,579
created by us and and give us

00:58:05,710 --> 00:58:11,400
opportunities to create content Megan

00:58:09,579 --> 00:58:14,710
get angry to white people go from here

00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:16,059
yeah well yeah I really like of audacity

00:58:14,710 --> 00:58:18,420
the the things you've been talking about

00:58:16,059 --> 00:58:21,130
about like you know like habits not act

00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:24,190
more than actions but like actual actual

00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:26,410
habits and so definitely that but also I

00:58:24,190 --> 00:58:29,349
saw this tweet earlier today that was

00:58:26,410 --> 00:58:31,540
just like don't just buy the books read

00:58:29,349 --> 00:58:34,089

00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:35,319
so good and i retweeted it and then my

00:58:34,089 --> 00:58:37,210
girlfriend was just like are you

00:58:35,319 --> 00:58:38,920

00:58:37,210 --> 00:58:40,270
girlfriend and she's been she's been

00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:41,500
ordering a lot of books playing but

00:58:40,270 --> 00:58:43,089
she's also been reading them I was like

00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:44,930
you know like this is not about you like

00:58:43,089 --> 00:58:46,730
I see you reading the new

00:58:44,930 --> 00:58:48,520
crow very actively right now and then

00:58:46,730 --> 00:58:51,500
willing to talk to me about it them like

00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:54,230
just like Doc tacky or other my friends

00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:56,000
about this but um but yeah so like

00:58:54,230 --> 00:58:57,859
actually actually reading the books like

00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:01,460
doing doing the homework like educating

00:58:57,859 --> 00:59:05,000
yourself and I mean and also like yeah

00:59:01,460 --> 00:59:06,829
like I like Alexis Ohanian did like step

00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:08,809
down like step down from your role I

00:59:06,829 --> 00:59:10,849
give someone else a chance and like

00:59:08,809 --> 00:59:12,319
actually like advocate for that for that

00:59:10,849 --> 00:59:14,359
black person to get a seat at the table

00:59:12,319 --> 00:59:17,300
and like make actually like make space

00:59:14,359 --> 00:59:19,880
for us and also when when you're reading

00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:21,800
these books like read a book by a black

00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:23,030
person like yeah like there's been a lot

00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:25,369
of talk about that book like white

00:59:23,030 --> 00:59:27,530
fragility and like you you don't need to

00:59:25,369 --> 00:59:29,809
read that book by a white person to like

00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:32,960
understand racism like support a black

00:59:29,809 --> 00:59:36,500
author and like and hear it hear their

00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:38,329
experience Sydney I'm not I'm not doing

00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:40,309
that anything so where do white people

00:59:38,329 --> 00:59:43,099
go from here what can they do

00:59:40,309 --> 00:59:45,530
I'm not doing anything either I would

00:59:43,099 --> 00:59:47,480
love to be able to take a couple of days

00:59:45,530 --> 00:59:48,380
off from thinking about this but then I

00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:49,910
would be able to gauge with my own

00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:54,140
reality so I think number one just

00:59:49,910 --> 00:59:55,250
understanding the psychic plays a lot of

00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:56,720
white people in right now where it's

00:59:55,250 --> 00:59:58,430
like we don't necessarily want to be

00:59:56,720 --> 01:00:01,430
thinking and talking steering ourselves

00:59:58,430 --> 01:00:03,079
we would love to take time for this but

01:00:01,430 --> 01:00:05,569
hey you have less space and whatever

01:00:03,079 --> 01:00:07,640
like space or energy or whatever you're

01:00:05,569 --> 01:00:10,609
trying to do donations donations

01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:12,680
donations donations donations and to

01:00:10,609 --> 01:00:14,780
Megan's point about trying to create

01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:16,700
space within your life for black people

01:00:14,780 --> 01:00:17,930
so we're at a workplace are there any

01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:20,000
people who cover that are at your level

01:00:17,930 --> 01:00:21,319
or they underpaid is you know I've been

01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,760
a lot of places where the only white

01:00:21,319 --> 01:00:24,290
person you see of that reception and

01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:25,790
then as you go up through the building

01:00:24,290 --> 01:00:28,250
you don't see another person for at all

01:00:25,790 --> 01:00:29,329
does that like notice that like open

01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:31,730
your eyes to the world that you're in

01:00:29,329 --> 01:00:34,040
and like ask questions you know I mean

01:00:31,730 --> 01:00:35,869
like make that make that part of how you

01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:37,910
engage with the world is the idea of

01:00:35,869 --> 01:00:40,520
space and why what would you go into

01:00:37,910 --> 01:00:42,290
these all white spaces say let's open up

01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:44,599
some space for you know a person call it

01:00:42,290 --> 01:00:46,400
maybe - I don't know like try to like

01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:50,720
create that space for people color in

01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:52,430
your own life maybe - what a crazy idea

01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:54,349
alright so I think we can cop it there

01:00:52,430 --> 01:00:58,040
