it's with great pleasure that we

00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:06,450
introduce our first speaker this is mich

00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:08,700
Mich each Audrey she works in both New

00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:11,280
York and in New Delhi

00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:21,000
she's a technology lawyer so I was Hume

00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:24,420
is she well a very good morning and I

00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,670
can't see anything but just perhaps good

00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:34,440
so I get paid to rain on many people's

00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:35,540
parade I am a lawyer I also get paid to

00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,510
help free and open source software

00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:43,559
developers in the legal work this is

00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:45,210
just balancing the Karma equation what

00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:48,149
you do as a lawyer you need to redeem

00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:51,600
yourself so that's what I do when I talk

00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:56,210
about my work as a lawyer the response

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:59,579
is usually a snoozefest or it's

00:00:56,210 --> 00:01:02,070
enquiries about the hourly rate or the

00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:06,420
total damage that I'm going to cost if

00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:09,049
lawyers are in the audience then there

00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:12,570
is polite court

00:01:09,049 --> 00:01:15,869
scrambling to poach clients that's much

00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:20,250
easier to deal with it's when people ask

00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:23,130
me to talk about my work as an activist

00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:26,729
that I begin to weigh my words a little

00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:28,619
more carefully not because that there

00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:30,810
isn't going to be an hourly rate or any

00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:35,430
billables which are far more attractive

00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:40,579
economically but now I have just issued

00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:43,070
an invitation to be called a traitor

00:01:40,579 --> 00:01:48,270
someone who should be booked under

00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:50,030
sedition unpatriotic showing the country

00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:53,060
in a bad light

00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:56,960
challenging the other power technology

00:01:53,060 --> 00:02:01,700
Allah diked an anti innovation person

00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:04,560
indulging in fake news a particularly

00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:07,649
classy tweet which was hurled at someone

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:11,730
I once worked with said you need to be

00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:14,230
put in a burka raped and dragged around

00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:18,010
Saudi Arabia

00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:21,530
very classy keep it up but what the what

00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:23,440
let's talk about a larger question today

00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:32,150
to feed the hunger of the trolls

00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:36,800
worldwide now if you can see that's the

00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:40,840
title of my talk whatever happened to

00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:44,360
the internet that's what we all do right

00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:49,130
that whatever happened we just don't

00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:53,720
know and what I want to say there was a

00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:57,230
dream of the Internet we failed in that

00:02:53,720 --> 00:03:09,410
dream I'm also asking people to move on

00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:16,130
in on to the next one there used to be a

00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:26,019
promise of the net this one and now this

00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:26,019
one that promise has failed

00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:43,069
this is what we want in this is what we

00:03:34,189 --> 00:03:46,120
got Internet which was supposed to be

00:03:43,069 --> 00:03:50,000
this interconnection a social condition

00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:52,370
where people with very little ingenuity

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,099
were supposed to be able to make

00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:57,260
businesses out of nothing

00:03:55,099 --> 00:03:59,540
Internet which was going to be these

00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:02,480
technical connections where everybody

00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:05,930
could reach everyone that's what we were

00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:08,930
all aiming for and as Max Ehrmann told

00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:13,939
me basically what I'm saying is we're

00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:21,229
 and now we are all exporting this

00:04:13,939 --> 00:04:25,150
 everywhere within a 10 year

00:04:21,229 --> 00:04:28,009
period we rapidly turned the world's

00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:30,949
telecommunications network into behavior

00:04:28,009 --> 00:04:34,550
collection platforms and that behavior

00:04:30,949 --> 00:04:38,300
collection was supercharged by

00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:41,419
advertising sales you all know that we

00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:44,570
are trick ponies right we behave for the

00:04:41,419 --> 00:04:47,690
machine the internet and that we are

00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:50,990
given things then the experience of

00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:54,800
being given those things is captured

00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:56,300
surveilled and surveyed and then we are

00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:00,380
given more things in return of that

00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:04,490
feedback and that's the way it works so

00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:07,430
instead of becoming self-governing

00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:10,639
citizens we are becoming behavior

00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:13,250
correct creators content creators for

00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,080
the net which is measuring us all the

00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:18,469
time

00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:22,070
over here we behave for the Chinese

00:05:18,469 --> 00:05:28,250
Communist Party that will have let us

00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:33,500
have the smoothest life in the Internet

00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:36,440
as they ensure that they are first in

00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:39,860
the race in turning all of the black

00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:42,469
mirror episodes into reality good show

00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:46,279
UK what is your favorite episode

00:05:42,469 --> 00:05:49,369
we can talk about that later but over

00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:54,919
here as I said we behaved for the

00:05:49,369 --> 00:06:08,349
Chinese Communist Party and over here we

00:05:54,919 --> 00:06:08,349
behaved for Facebook now we think that

00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:15,079
Facebook is going to let us have this

00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:17,389
smooth ride whatever is the life it will

00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:20,419
offer us and Communist Party will let us

00:06:17,389 --> 00:06:24,639
live in the net in this way all in all

00:06:20,419 --> 00:06:28,189
an anti humanist idea our choice is

00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:31,759
between behaving for the advertisers or

00:06:28,189 --> 00:06:34,699
behaving for the Communist Party we may

00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:37,389
feel we are being given a choice but in

00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:40,819
truth the choice has been removed

00:06:37,389 --> 00:06:45,439
facebook wants to make money party wants

00:06:40,819 --> 00:06:48,789
to make power but in the end you we

00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:52,879
human beings the self-governing

00:06:48,789 --> 00:06:57,519
self-learning self-equilibrating human

00:06:52,879 --> 00:07:00,229
being has ceased to exist in both places

00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:03,800
the conference is about health after

00:07:00,229 --> 00:07:07,009
Network the health of the network is

00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:09,860
threatened by tying advertising

00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:15,050
platforms to the political economy of

00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:18,229
connection it's now so profitable for

00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:21,800
the platform companies to watch you

00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:24,800
watch perform for the internet that

00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:27,459
they're willing to pay to move packets

00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:30,439
for everybody that was the big

00:07:27,459 --> 00:07:37,449
charitable idea of free basics by

00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:43,099
Facebook then this fun stuff happens

00:07:37,449 --> 00:07:45,379
this net which we currently have it has

00:07:43,099 --> 00:07:49,369
defeated one of our greatest social

00:07:45,379 --> 00:07:53,599
hopes which was that making everything

00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:55,120
more open and connected would begin to

00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:58,750
undermine the

00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:03,370
primary sources of injustice in the

00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:06,419
human race ignorant misogyny etc all of

00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:10,180
that was supposed to disappear remember

00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:12,130
Internet the great leveler Internet

00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:14,470
which is going to bring women

00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:18,220
empowerment internet which is going to

00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:21,100
educate every brain on earth whatever

00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:25,199
happened to that so what has happened is

00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:28,030
that this beep at human injustice --is

00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:30,130
ignorant misogyny etc we're going to

00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:31,930
come down because we were going to learn

00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:35,020
and all these great things were going to

00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:38,380
happen what has actually happened in the

00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:41,890
net is that it has reinforced those in

00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:45,279
justices rather than attacking them this

00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:48,700
is a regular affair on our greatest

00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:50,560
platform right now individuals these

00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:52,810
days are drawn into these digital

00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:55,960
environments because they're

00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:59,080
increasingly felt as necessary to

00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:01,360
ordinary social existence there used to

00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:03,400
be a time when we wanted to ask each

00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,529
other so what's here we can plan now we

00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:07,000
want to ask so which interesting place

00:09:05,529 --> 00:09:11,440
are you going to be staring your phone

00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,390
ad from next weekend now individuals

00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,250
because what happens is because they

00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:17,529
think that's the way we want to exist

00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:20,980
when they get into the digital

00:09:17,529 --> 00:09:25,500
environment they find themselves treated

00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:29,170
as objects in the social theater of

00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:32,260
aggression and denigration they often

00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:35,760
find themselves at the receiving end of

00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:39,690
sustained abuse threats debasement

00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:41,830
either on their actual or perceived

00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:44,440
characteristics pick up any ground it

00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:46,510
doesn't matter now or over the

00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:49,570
expression of their particular ideas and

00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:51,870
convictions that are at odds with each

00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:51,870
other

00:09:52,320 --> 00:10:00,220
democracy it's no longer pretty crazy to

00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:04,920
see the cows attracts with our political

00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:08,020
system where it is the Internet in India

00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,760
trade associations of which facebook was

00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:12,090
a part in

00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:15,150
20:14 were proclaiming that hundred and

00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:18,510
sixty seats in the general elections

00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:21,060
will be impacted by social media nobody

00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:25,260
paid attention India's only 1.25 billion

00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:28,670
people small country somewhere allegedly

00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:32,490
the most reliable democracy in the world

00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:34,620
was completely subverted in a way that

00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:37,950
only Facebook and Twitter could have

00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:40,470
made possible if you reading the news

00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:42,840
these days special counsel Robert

00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:45,840
Mueller's team of prosecutors are

00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:49,800
investigating how Russia manipulated

00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:52,440
social media to post propaganda Facebook

00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:55,230
just turned over information to

00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:58,050
congressional investigators showing that

00:10:55,230 --> 00:11:01,350
it sold about a hundred thousand dollars

00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:04,590
worth of ads to a pro-kremlin Russian

00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:08,370
propaganda company seeking to target US

00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:10,380
waters that's a relatively small ad

00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:13,460
spend right it's only a hundred thousand

00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:19,230
dollars but one that could have reached

00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:22,260
70 million Facebook users now without

00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:24,540
this advertising platform stuff who

00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:27,770
actually believes that the British

00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:30,210
people could have been convinced that

00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:33,420
350 million pounds was going to the

00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:35,610
European Union every week you put it at

00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:39,390
the side of the red bus and everyone

00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:42,600
knows it's a lie but if you put it up on

00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:45,570
thousands of Facebook pages in addition

00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:49,620
to putting it on the red bus then people

00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:52,920
think if there must be some fire if

00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:55,500
there's so much smoke around there the

00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:59,460
gullibility of the human race is

00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:01,590
increasing our gullibility is increasing

00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:04,470
and why is it increasing because the

00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:07,920
most important business on earth is now

00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:10,740
gulling people learn more and more about

00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:15,330
us so that you can gull them effectively

00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:18,480
and that's what is happening now the

00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:21,630
opinion climate that is the Twitter

00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,769
machine is a little different not

00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:24,959
because in the end

00:12:22,769 --> 00:12:28,259
it's not about advertising because it's

00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:31,679
always about advertising but in the end

00:12:28,259 --> 00:12:34,579
the government's hand is a little

00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:37,579
heavier heavier ver twitter is concerned

00:12:34,579 --> 00:12:41,850
because there is moment-to-moment

00:12:37,579 --> 00:12:43,920
control of the climate of opinion now

00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:48,029
this moment of Marmon climate of a peak

00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:50,970
of control of opinion draws politics to

00:12:48,029 --> 00:12:53,970
it more straightforwardly and the rise

00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:57,689
of the troll armies around the world is

00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:59,489
a sign of that how does the US

00:12:57,689 --> 00:13:02,459
government presently control the new

00:12:59,489 --> 00:13:06,269
cycle it has this one big internet troll

00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:10,079
with 41 million people it controls the

00:13:06,269 --> 00:13:14,999
new cycle in only one way cows that's

00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:16,799
how it controls one tweet goes out you

00:13:14,999 --> 00:13:19,110
do not know that the perk of becoming a

00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:21,239
president as you can get to watch TV for

00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:23,610
six hours right but that is also the

00:13:21,239 --> 00:13:25,799
perk but once somebody watches

00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:28,079
television a tweet goes out everybody

00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:30,540
else reacts then we all behave then the

00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:32,309
platform loves it because the more you

00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:33,240
talk the more you behave the better it

00:13:32,309 --> 00:13:35,069
is for the platform

00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:37,529
the more you are watched doing what you

00:13:35,069 --> 00:13:39,689
are doing that time elsewhere in the

00:13:37,529 --> 00:13:44,610
world governments control the news cycle

00:13:39,689 --> 00:13:49,670
not with one big troll but armies of

00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:54,660
trolls the small ones and also censors

00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:57,829
we already talked about the Chinese so

00:13:54,660 --> 00:14:01,649
this this is Ravi Kumar

00:13:57,829 --> 00:14:05,999
he's very prominent Indian journalist he

00:14:01,649 --> 00:14:07,589
has a huge fan following something of

00:14:05,999 --> 00:14:09,480
the size of many countries in the

00:14:07,589 --> 00:14:12,720
European Union but obviously you don't

00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:16,259
know about him he his prime time Daily

00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:18,989
Show is not in English it's in Hindi

00:14:16,259 --> 00:14:24,179
which is the largest language in India

00:14:18,989 --> 00:14:27,480
right now so on September 29th of this

00:14:24,179 --> 00:14:29,279
year he wrote a letter to the prime

00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:33,540
minister of the largest democracy in the

00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:35,139
world the letter is titled is my life in

00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:38,259
danger

00:14:35,139 --> 00:14:41,049
this is after a prominent editor has

00:14:38,259 --> 00:14:43,839
been shot outside her house in Bangalore

00:14:41,049 --> 00:14:46,389
on September 5th what is this to do with

00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:49,119
Internet it has got nothing to do with

00:14:46,389 --> 00:14:52,720
Internet but with social media it has

00:14:49,119 --> 00:14:54,160
got everything I'm gonna just quote a

00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,999
little bit of what he wrote in that

00:14:54,160 --> 00:15:01,899
letter he says since I have read on alt

00:14:57,999 --> 00:15:04,779
news dot a.m. in the morning that few

00:15:01,899 --> 00:15:08,829
people on Twitter who are abusing me

00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:11,499
badly threatening me talking communally

00:15:08,829 --> 00:15:14,999
claiming that a few other journalists

00:15:11,499 --> 00:15:18,609
and I who are highly patriotic are

00:15:14,999 --> 00:15:21,879
terrorists on a whatsapp group named X Y

00:15:18,609 --> 00:15:24,519
Z and really frightened he says mr.

00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:27,220
Prime Minister if I read the derogatory

00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:29,410
language used in this whatsapp group

00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:32,470
about me and other journalists many

00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:34,559
people will close their ears the

00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:37,600
language used about women journalism is

00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:39,879
really shameful why am I telling you the

00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:43,600
story all I'm giving you is a little bit

00:15:39,879 --> 00:15:46,689
of an example of how now politics uses

00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:49,329
these tools which we think are just for

00:15:46,689 --> 00:15:51,699
our communication what happens from the

00:15:49,329 --> 00:15:54,660
point of view of states is that they

00:15:51,699 --> 00:15:57,279
think we there is a climate of opinion

00:15:54,660 --> 00:16:00,549
we add to the climate of opinion

00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:02,290
something over here and we subtract from

00:16:00,549 --> 00:16:05,919
the climate of opinion something over

00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:07,809
here by censoring and by with our own

00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:12,249
troll armies we add something here and

00:16:07,809 --> 00:16:14,919
then the result is what we want then we

00:16:12,249 --> 00:16:17,499
can't get what we want and the cows

00:16:14,919 --> 00:16:25,019
reckons us then we just shut the

00:16:17,499 --> 00:16:25,019
internet down see that's the reason

00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:31,199
when I talk about internet shutdowns we

00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:34,320
have government's actually turning the

00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:36,750
net off and on and holding hostage

00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,610
everybody's economy learning and daily

00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:41,820
lives for their concerns with public

00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:44,100
order or national security there is an

00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:46,529
over balancing which is going on right

00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:50,370
now in the direction of having curfew

00:16:46,529 --> 00:16:55,290
all the time there were 55 shutdowns in

00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:57,029
India in 2017 61 in the world in total

00:16:55,290 --> 00:17:00,209
in this year we're not over the year

00:16:57,029 --> 00:17:02,449
isn't over yet 25 times Internet was

00:17:00,209 --> 00:17:06,870
killed in the state of Jammu and Kashmir

00:17:02,449 --> 00:17:10,049
for three months from June 18th to

00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:12,360
September 18th in the eastern part of

00:17:10,049 --> 00:17:13,679
the country in Darjeeling it was totally

00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:17,400
covered in darkness there was no

00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:20,549
internet at all now a businessman said

00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:23,390
that time that many people in that area

00:17:20,549 --> 00:17:26,520
had bought things on loans and

00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:28,410
installments and due to the Internet

00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:31,020
shutdowns they had not been able to use

00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:33,659
net banking and failed to make the

00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:35,460
payments on time the banks were closed

00:17:33,659 --> 00:17:39,419
and online transactions could not be

00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:40,980
facilitated like high school students

00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:42,900
who wanted to apply to universities

00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:45,480
could not apply and fill up their forms

00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:48,299
because there's no internet internet

00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:50,790
shutdown had also severely disturbed

00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:53,190
other lives a businessmen said that I'm

00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:56,010
the sole breadwinner of my family and my

00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:58,159
entire business has collapsed because

00:17:56,010 --> 00:18:02,190
I'm majorly dependent on online

00:17:58,159 --> 00:18:05,070
transactions that I make or receive but

00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:08,040
in the past 60 days I haven't been able

00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:11,309
to do that and the entire family is

00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:13,140
suffering these are real stories these

00:18:11,309 --> 00:18:16,710
are real people they don't live in the

00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:19,650
same places as metropolitan cities etc

00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:22,860
but this is a reality which is happening

00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:25,919
nowadays internet gets shut down and

00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:28,590
there are initiatives like digital India

00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:31,169
or everybody the next 2 billion 3

00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:32,970
billion everybody comes online and then

00:18:31,169 --> 00:18:36,690
the government pulls the switch whenever

00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:38,340
it feels like both of things seem like a

00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:39,750
little crass purpose at each other right

00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:41,580
you want to bring everybody online

00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:44,370
but you also want to shut it down as

00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:50,360
there as and when you feel like what

00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:50,360
really gives here and this what happens

00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:59,190
the reaction in democratic countries is

00:18:56,490 --> 00:19:01,620
also that we've wrecked it all up we

00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:04,230
don't have a good example why don't we

00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:09,510
actually follow the example of complete

00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:10,800
total control now health of the Internet

00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:14,790
this is what the conference is about

00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:17,850
right the concentration of hatred and

00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:18,980
aggression so is it going up or going

00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:21,570
down

00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:23,520
let's have just a very simple measure if

00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:24,210
the health if the internet is really

00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,520
healthy

00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:29,700
then aggression and hatred should be

00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:32,820
going down who here wishes to claim it

00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:35,160
otherwise you think it's going up you

00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:37,980
think it's going down don't worry I'm

00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:41,250
not gonna grade you on this but why did

00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:44,760
they why did this all happen why did we

00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:47,550
land up here mostly because we love the

00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:49,860
shrug a right somebody says all this

00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:53,160
I'll stop playing all this dystopian

00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:55,080
stuff I don't like it you play you're

00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:57,570
raining on my parade I'm here to have a

00:19:55,080 --> 00:20:00,150
good conference just put it on the side

00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:03,390
and of course it's so convenient and

00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:05,070
then we go whatever then we move on our

00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:07,890
lives are busy we have to do other

00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:10,590
things we did not take any of the

00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:14,040
measures that we should have to reduce

00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:17,970
the ability of the states and the market

00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:21,330
to push us all around we didn't protect

00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:24,930
anonymity we threw people's identities

00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:27,570
into a cauldron we put people out there

00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:29,790
we told children live your lives in this

00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:32,880
Network then we expose them to rape

00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:35,040
murder threats and bullying and all

00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:38,610
other ways and then we called it free

00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:41,190
speech as though we had suddenly

00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:45,360
abandoned all the jeffersonian or

00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:47,820
Gambian ideas and hopes that an educated

00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:50,610
population would be more capable of

00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:51,570
self-governance that we only needed

00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:53,899
information

00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:57,929
and no real knowledge about any of this

00:20:53,899 --> 00:21:00,869
who in this room who in this room wishes

00:20:57,929 --> 00:21:03,929
to stand up now and say that the current

00:21:00,869 --> 00:21:07,109
internet is increasing the human

00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:09,090
capacity for self-governance who you

00:21:07,109 --> 00:21:11,340
want to say that the President of the

00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:15,029
United States is a better president

00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:17,460
because of tweeting you want to stand up

00:21:15,029 --> 00:21:20,970
and now and say that Facebook is

00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:24,119
improving democracy around the world who

00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:26,729
here actually believes that any of this

00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:30,960
enormous promise of technology is being

00:21:26,729 --> 00:21:35,399
realized the potential of technology to

00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:37,799
change our world remains immense the

00:21:35,399 --> 00:21:40,919
only limitations being our over

00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:45,690
dependence on the current advertising

00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:49,340
based political economy and belief that

00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:53,159
we have no control over any of this and

00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:58,080
our dear shrubby whatever I have to move

00:21:53,159 --> 00:22:01,739
on with my life so here are a few

00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:03,809
thoughts you can dismiss them this is a

00:22:01,739 --> 00:22:08,609
talk it's going to end very soon you can

00:22:03,809 --> 00:22:11,399
move on or you can pay a little bit more

00:22:08,609 --> 00:22:13,710
attention what I'm asking for is a

00:22:11,399 --> 00:22:17,279
little bit of quiet remember they used

00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:20,279
to rely appraised and places where we

00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:23,359
actually just read and part and

00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:25,710
processed information which we learned

00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:27,809
but now there is a device which is

00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:30,840
constantly demanding my attention it

00:22:27,809 --> 00:22:33,179
bleep beeps and bleeps and then tells me

00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:34,950
talk to me talk to me this person is

00:22:33,179 --> 00:22:37,080
asking for your attention Facebook

00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:39,599
Twitter Instagram why aren't you talking

00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:42,509
to me it's been so long two thousand six

00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:46,679
hundred times is how many times we touch

00:22:42,509 --> 00:22:48,809
our smartphones every single day what

00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:51,779
I'm asking is I need a little bit of

00:22:48,809 --> 00:22:54,749
quiet not these machines which are

00:22:51,779 --> 00:22:57,509
constantly demanding our attention what

00:22:54,749 --> 00:23:01,440
we mean are companies that are not

00:22:57,509 --> 00:23:04,799
advertising platforms to make browsers

00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:09,130
the basic tech of the net

00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:12,669
we need more federated services and

00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:17,230
fewer centralized services to conduct

00:23:12,669 --> 00:23:21,250
our online social lives we need to pay

00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:25,720
up and stop eating the cheese on the

00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:28,299
mousetrap we need to dissociate the

00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:31,960
social sharing amongst groups of people

00:23:28,299 --> 00:23:35,950
who wish to retain their autonomy and

00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:38,620
privacy from advertising platforms we

00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:41,320
need to recognize that we were not

00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:44,260
building media for advertising to do

00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:47,860
haters somebody else did that in fact

00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:51,309
who juiced it bad we need freedom from

00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:53,950
in tolerable efforts to take over our

00:23:51,309 --> 00:23:57,070
minds whether that consists of

00:23:53,950 --> 00:24:00,610
misogynist harassment or clutter of

00:23:57,070 --> 00:24:05,039
active advertising what we need again is

00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:10,240
the rights and freedoms of the users and

00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:12,940
above all more of cute videos there's

00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,780
evidence to back this up what is

00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:17,300
happiness

00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:21,860
can we find it in a new pair of shoes a

00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:23,750
fast car or a bigger house or does real

00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:27,650
happiness lie somewhere else

00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:29,870
[Music]

00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:32,000
hundreds of studies have proved that

00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:34,730
spending time in nature can make us feel

00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,780
better both in mind and body in a way

00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:37,780
that nothing else can

00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:41,860
we wanted to find out whether simply

00:24:40,059 --> 00:24:45,090
watching footage of the natural world

00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:45,090
could have the same effect

00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:50,890
last year we partnered with Professor

00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:53,170
Dhaka Keltner an expert in human

00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:57,010
psychology and emotion at the University

00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:59,500
of California Berkeley for this project

00:24:57,010 --> 00:25:01,900
he has reviewed over 150 scientific

00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:05,670
studies that explore the positive effect

00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:08,860
of nature on humans we also asked over

00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:11,050
7500 people in six countries to tell us

00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:13,870
how they were feeling before and after

00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:16,360
watching planet Earth two clips

00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:20,370
this data showed significant increases

00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:23,980
in joy contentment curiosity or

00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:25,900
amazement and wonder and clear

00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:29,260
reductions in tiredness and low energy

00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:32,710
it even reduced stress especially among

00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:34,870
younger viewers these findings revealed

00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:39,340
that wildlife programs can cause viewers

00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:40,870
to experience positive emotions my study

00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:44,800
of human happiness has revealed that

00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:47,920
these emotions amazement Wonder and awe

00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:51,970
are the foundations of a powerful form

00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:54,760
of real human happiness real happiness

00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:56,830
is a deeper less transient form of

00:25:54,760 --> 00:26:00,429
happiness that can positively affect our

00:25:56,830 --> 00:26:02,950
health so by simply watching incredible

00:26:00,429 --> 00:26:04,870
footage of our natural world you too can

00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:07,000
experience these uplifting emotions

00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:10,740
helping you to be more connected with

00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,740
this amazing place we call home

00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:18,149
[Music]

00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:26,880
[Music]

00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:36,059
yeah I'm just asking for all of this and

00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:38,279
nothing more thank you that's great what

00:26:36,059 --> 00:26:39,990
a great way to kick it off and we have

00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:42,179
time for one question so whoever has the

00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:43,889
most broken wrist then make yourself

00:26:42,179 --> 00:26:46,399
known and don't be shy because I know

00:26:43,889 --> 00:26:49,799
it's a I know it's a Saturday morning

00:26:46,399 --> 00:26:52,590
okay I'll let the microphone with a

00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:54,299
microphone pick hi thank you for your

00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:56,340
speech very interesting I want to ask

00:26:54,299 --> 00:26:58,679
you is there any way of recovering or

00:26:56,340 --> 00:27:00,570
redeeming certain platforms like there

00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:02,940
steps that YouTube took with regards to

00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:05,370
removing advertising from a lot of like

00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:07,470
hateful video or do you believe that we

00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:10,350
have to move to different services that

00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:14,750
are federated or can these platforms be

00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:18,149
nudged into getting better in any way I

00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:20,610
have been hoping that we could have

00:27:18,149 --> 00:27:23,600
nudged them into a direction where

00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:26,129
things would actually solve or move and

00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:28,409
give us a semblance that something was

00:27:26,129 --> 00:27:30,240
being done but the error is being

00:27:28,409 --> 00:27:32,070
enacted pretty well we always get a

00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,309
semblance that something is being done

00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:37,049
new policies are in Act enacted

00:27:34,309 --> 00:27:38,879
something new comes up every day we are

00:27:37,049 --> 00:27:42,480
doing this for hate speech this for

00:27:38,879 --> 00:27:45,269
harassment but honestly I really want to

00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:48,509
understand that if the political economy

00:27:45,269 --> 00:27:51,090
of the net is going to be tight so close

00:27:48,509 --> 00:27:52,139
to advertising then how far can you

00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:55,799
actually go

00:27:52,139 --> 00:27:58,529
if each behavior of ours is going to

00:27:55,799 --> 00:28:00,450
feed into the Machine and that gives

00:27:58,529 --> 00:28:03,470
them more information to sell us

00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:06,480
something then how much are our

00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:08,820
expectations very realistic to say these

00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:11,220
minor little adjustment here and there

00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:13,080
I'm going to do something about it I'm

00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:15,210
not asking for an abolishment but I'm

00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:18,330
also asking for more reliance on

00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:20,850
federated services I'm also saying that

00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:23,220
this this thing which we've told people

00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:25,549
it was only 10 years ago that we got the

00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:28,740
smartphone but we've said that oh you

00:28:25,549 --> 00:28:31,230
computing is really difficult you can do

00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:32,600
it let us do it all for you and we can

00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:34,550
give you these shiny thing

00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:37,100
where you can just touch and do it we

00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:39,920
can actually run the computers ourselves

00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:42,670
so if if the economy of the net is going

00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:45,470
to continue to be so closely tied with

00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:48,920
advertising how realistic it is to

00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:51,590
expect minor changes to do what we

00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:54,440
expect it to do is a question which I'm

00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:57,110
putting it out to yourself you didn't

00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:58,010
pay me so I couldn't answer that

00:28:57,110 --> 00:29:00,460
question

00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:03,260
that's how I actually answer questions

00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:07,460
jokes aside but I don't have easy

00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:10,750
answers it's not a very easy solution

00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:14,570
for this but I really want people to

00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:17,000
think about that that's the reality we

00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:19,970
can have cognitive dissonance about it

00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:23,090
but if that's where my money comes in

00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:25,550
what prerogatives or what priorities do

00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:28,880
I have to reduce any of it

00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:31,970
why is it that Twitter and Facebook find

00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:34,940
it's so difficult to take down content

00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:37,910
to actually control or shut down one

00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:39,590
particular account the world would be

00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:42,770
better off if that one particular

00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:46,400
account was shut down why because that

00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:49,630
account generates so much behavior for

00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:53,090
the machine that it's worth everything

00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:54,940
okay so let's let's give me another

00:29:53,090 --> 00:30:01,640
round of applause for not being here

00:29:54,940 --> 00:30:01,640
