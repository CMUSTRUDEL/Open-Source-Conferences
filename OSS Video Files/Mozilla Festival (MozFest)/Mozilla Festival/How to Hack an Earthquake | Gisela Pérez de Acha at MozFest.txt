a great title for this next talk is how to hack an earthquake and Gisela Pérez

00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:17,570
de Acha is in from Mexico to talk about that. Have you ever been in an earthquake?

00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:22,859
but I mean like a true big one where you feel like all the laws of physics

00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:29,580
suddenly are suspended and stability either a literal or metaphorical just

00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:34,649
gets tossed into the air if you have been in an earthquake you probably know

00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:38,790
what I'm talking about I was going to talk about autonomous feminists

00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:43,829
infrastructure in Latin America when the 19th of September a deadly earthquake

00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:50,190
hit Mexico City. I was in my office suddenly the books started falling out

00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:54,629
of the shelves glass was shattering I was trying to run out of the building

00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:59,280
but I was so dizzy I couldn't even get out. Out on the streets the neighbors

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,870
were crying holding each other yelling for help

00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:07,619
the building right across the street was collapsing and we were just petrified

00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:15,990
and had nowhere to run to it lasted for three horrifying minutes and that day 30

00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:22,080
buildings did collapse in Mexico City and hundreds of people were trapped

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:27,540
under the rubble one of the first things I did after making sure my family and

00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:31,560
loved ones we're okay was gone Twitter hashtag millennial over

00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:38,340
here and tweet used voice over IP so we don't Jam the phone lines then my mom

00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:43,409
asked me how on earth did you think that after truly believing you were going to

00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:48,360
be crushed by a building well I am an activist I'm a human rights lawyer I

00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,500
have been defending privacy and freedom of speech in the digital environment for

00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:58,409
the past years I think in terms of information and information was chaos

00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:07,469
and mess after this earthquake I think the fake news conversation has been very

00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:11,160
monopolized by the Tarleton Trump elections lately but let's face it

00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:15,220
during disasters since the beginning of my kind rumors

00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:18,069
exist there's malicious people that start them

00:02:18,069 --> 00:02:22,780
sure but there's thousands of hundreds of people that retweet them repost them

00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:26,800
forward them on whatsapp on Facebook and they become viral and suddenly they

00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,090
become truths I put this picture up because my grandmother yes she's uses

00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:35,080
what's up she sent me this picture telling me do not go through there this

00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:38,830
bridge is falling down and you know what it was a fake and it was not only my

00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:42,220
grandmother it was my lawyer colleagues and my friends that were sending it to

00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:47,769
me as well another big problem who has Facebook's algorithms because

00:02:47,769 --> 00:02:54,010
somebody posted help urgent help needed in this at this time in this place we

00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:59,950
need coffee and doctors so the way Facebook's algorithms work that post had

00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:04,290
so many interactions that 72 hours later it was still at the top of our newsfeed

00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:10,200
so people went out on the streets and in coordinated fashion blocking traffic

00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,989
taking resources where they were no longer needed and actually impeding

00:03:13,989 --> 00:03:20,859
rescue Labor's some people had hundreds of coffee while in southern Ural areas

00:03:20,859 --> 00:03:27,489
there was no water you also have to take into consideration that it's nice you

00:03:27,489 --> 00:03:31,870
live in London and in Europe but in Mexico we cannot count on our government

00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:36,070
the authorities are so deeply colluded with organized crime that we do not

00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:39,459
trust them there's four disappearances and it's one of the most dangerous

00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:44,470
countries to be a journalist in the world so if you watch have you watched

00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:49,630
the narcos on Netflix ok if you have pictured both people coordinating the

00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:54,579
earthquake relief efforts so a friend and a couple of friends and colleagues

00:03:54,579 --> 00:03:58,510
came together at the recent Isle the cultural center where I managed art and

00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:02,560
literature events we were literally in the middle of Ground Zero we had so much

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,470
information but we still felt this informed and we were wondering what to

00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:10,750
do and that's how we came up with verification 19's which means verified

00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:17,320
19's our goal was to manage data and fact-check information so we could make

00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:24,220
citizen help more efficient during a time of chaos of course the first thing

00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:27,500
we did was this map the first thing you want to do after a

00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,730
catastrophe is just visualize collapse buildings donation centers where you can

00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:38,360
go help and shelters for people that are aware homeless but this map has a couple

00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:42,140
of problems first of all we were a small team we were 30 people maybe the first

00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:45,890
day maybe less we were biking around the city verifying

00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:50,330
information ourselves but when we opened it and we started with crowd-sourced it

00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:54,230
and we had so many data points that we couldn't verify them anymore so that's

00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:59,620
where this holy reflection about fake data comes up and then it's Google Maps

00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:06,110
it's closed source we couldn't edit the coach really we had a data cap we

00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:10,520
couldn't process more than certain data points Google kindly gave us a grant to

00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:16,610
top that but we had access to both because we have privileged and then we

00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:21,470
had to manually be refreshing the database our Excel spreadsheets were a

00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:29,140
mess I wish I knew how to do that better but I hope I know now here at Moss fest

00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:33,230
so you're probably wondering this point why wouldn't didn't we use to Shahidi

00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:39,340
it's cooler it's open source it's made by African developers and not Silicon

00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:46,970
Valley white men we didn't know we Shahid existed and then in the middle of

00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:50,750
the emergency my friend said you who started the map said like oh wait

00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:56,630
there's such a heating and we're like dude now it's too late and they said

00:05:56,630 --> 00:06:00,170
it's pros we had it on our iPhones Google adopted it so it was on everybody

00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:05,300
saw a smart phones and this gave us legitimacy very quickly but three days

00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,750
after that the informational needs were very different we did not need to

00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:13,370
visualize things anymore we needed real-time information about what was

00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:19,130
needed and by that point we had made so many databases that Google gave us

00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:24,800
another really can grant and we went to use crisis maps the crisis maps Google

00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,030
platform we had all these layers with verified on verified information crowd

00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:33,560
source information MIT and Harvard even open streets Maps merge their databases

00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:38,990
with us and you know what at the end we were aiming for user friendly day

00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:43,040
interface but this was so not user friendly because Google didn't have

00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,220
enough icons for all the different layers that we were using

00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:50,419
so the crowd-sourced information and their internet hotspots was exactly the

00:06:50,419 --> 00:06:56,960
same point so I wish we used to Shahidi but we didn't so maybe next time by the

00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,160
way you Shahidi has a plugin that has different that can allow for different

00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,490
verification layers and management of layers it took us five days to figure

00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:09,320
that out coding in the middle of an emergency but too late that's what

00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:14,360
happens in parallel a group of organizations an NGO developed a true

00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:19,669
verification methodology this is a database that shows the most important

00:07:19,669 --> 00:07:23,660
networks and notes that used our Twitter hashtag in 12 hours

00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:29,720
during the night of Saturday night to Sunday morning it was over 14,000 tweets

00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:34,520
and more than 300 notes of different information all the organizations are

00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:39,380
armed up here I will tweet it later so you can see the details this is our

00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:43,490
verification methodology I unfortunately do not have time to go through all of it

00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:47,110
this could be a workshop itself but I just want to show you how complex it is

00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:52,729
verification it's not a black-and-white process it's not a verified I'm verified

00:07:52,729 --> 00:07:58,180
this goes this doesn't it's a process and we're not in the newsroom

00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:03,110
information it's not worthy because it's newsworthy all information has to be put

00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:09,470
out there not publishing something actually impedes rescue Labor's so just

00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:15,440
very quickly the most important things to be a verifier in our team meant

00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,870
essentially two things that you were a monitor on-site at the disaster zones

00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:25,340
coordinating effort reliefs instead in verifying exactly what tools were needed

00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:32,539
and then a note behind the computer reacted a sort of call center so what

00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:35,750
happened after the earthquake was that a lot of whatsapp groups were formed

00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:40,940
organically by neighbors by a network of donation centers so we monitor social

00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:45,500
networks and these whatsapp groups they were self regulated and if they

00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:49,040
couldn't get a research by themselves then one of her notes flag bed and

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:56,699
started verifying it putting it in very messy spreadsheets once our firm

00:08:56,699 --> 00:09:01,380
ation was verified our designers made these flyers that we posted on Twitter

00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:04,500
Twitter was one of the only social networks that allowed us to post

00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:09,779
real-time information during the emergency Facebook was pretty much we

00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:15,089
couldn't use it at all here I have it's 2:00 a.m. volunteers

00:09:15,089 --> 00:09:19,620
are not needed we have the address and we needed tree plays carpentry nails

00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:26,220
iron clamps breakers screwdrivers weaving a electric saws at some point we

00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:31,410
got every single thing even little boots for rescue dogs I kid you not we flow

00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:41,430
this in from Atlanta and then by Sunday night we put this flyer up because it

00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:48,149
was very important to say to verify means two things to see something with

00:09:48,149 --> 00:09:54,690
your own eyes or to talk to somebody that has to talk to at least two people

00:09:54,690 --> 00:10:01,800
that have seen it with their own eyes anything else is fake news so we started

00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:06,720
putting these fliers out because we wanted to foster digital literacy in

00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:12,269
critical thinking and it was very cool because to verify started becoming a

00:10:12,269 --> 00:10:17,550
trend so social network users were self-regulating themselves after we were

00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:20,990
verifying information and posting this and making campaigns about this and

00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:26,100
asking it between each other have you verified this can you please put a time

00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:29,850
stamp on your tweet another thing was data protection because people were

00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:34,800
asking us why are you not publishing the phone numbers in the flyer so that

00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,550
people can directly contact them piece of data protection and privacy standards

00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:44,010
right we had to take them into consideration and at the end our

00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:50,930
methodology worked NASA took our map as a starting point for their analysis

00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:56,149
Greenpeace they had a huge donation center along with the biggest team of

00:10:56,149 --> 00:11:02,010
volunteer and medical volunteers and they said that our Twitter feed was the

00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:05,430
most important resource so that they could mobilize the things that they had

00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:11,520
their own donation centers I got a call at one eight a.m. one day from the

00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:16,290
Israeli army asking me if I could please tell them where to go because the

00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:21,210
government didn't know and the best part was that we were literally deploying the

00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:25,560
Israeli army for the next day's effectively saving more than a couple of

00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:32,220
lives it was amazing but what was i doing telling them that it should have

00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:39,959
been the government in the end this is not a story about technology we couldn't

00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:45,120
use any map we could have used any spreadsheet format we got in touch with

00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,720
OSHA Headey the digital humanitarians stand by task force a little bit too

00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:54,899
late but this is a story about solidarity and strength because that's

00:11:54,899 --> 00:12:01,050
what saved lives technology was shit to be honest it was their networks of trust

00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:06,810
that could actually accomplish something this picture is the symbol of unity in

00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:12,600
Mexico the rescuers put their fists up when they were digging victims from

00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:18,230
underneath the rubble so they could hear their voices the fist is the symbol of

00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:26,640
Mexican strength and the abandonment of the government in the end we were over

00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:33,900
500 volunteers processing over 30 databases we didn't have we didn't know

00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:37,620
about it we didn't even know what a Haiti we had no idea about how to do

00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:42,570
this but I want to thank each and every one of these volunteers because we all

00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:47,760
left our hearts and souls on the lines especially the on-site monitors and the

00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:52,620
notes they didn't sleep for days they didn't eat for days nothing mattered but

00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:56,339
actually getting the resources where they were necessary to be able to help

00:12:56,339 --> 00:13:01,290
and save lives I want to thank them because with them I learned that

00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:08,370
horizontal and organic structures make information flow so much better than in

00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:14,579
hierarchy and bureaucracy like the model the government has we did the physicals

00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:19,200
we love our city we love our people technology did not

00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:27,390
matter it was only that we put all our hard are there out there support our

00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:31,880
costs is the earthquake is over because but this is only the beginning

00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:37,380
but if acardo's job is done but I am on the board of these two amazing

00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:45,510
organizations that are doing post earthquake advocacy strategies we are

00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:51,900
not going to have our governments support our cities are devastated or

00:13:51,900 --> 00:14:00,330
people are destroyed we still have to go on with rescue Labor's and hurry up

00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:05,940
because you know what we live in a system and as dreading as it sounds and

00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:12,780
as scared as I am we don't know when the next earthquake is going to hit and we

00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:31,260
have to be prepared this time thank you very much Ella so what would you have

00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:38,310
done differently what would you well were the lessons I think well first of

00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:45,570
all there was a great workshop here yesterday at Moss fest on what where to

00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:52,800
put your data in rows and columns if I had known that before that would have

00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,910
been a complete lifesaver and definitely I think if we would have used the

00:14:56,910 --> 00:15:01,470
Shahidi would have saved us quite some time for sure there's a question over

00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:05,580
here thank you very much that was amazing I sadly didn't catch the

00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:09,870
beginning of us a please I apologize if you covered this already I was wondering

00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:12,960
in terms of so there are lots of other places around the world that are asked

00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:18,600
quake zones and things like that how if people wanted to replicate this

00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,600
models which is written in particular language into like different languages

00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:27,000
and and how to what's the best way to join up rather than doing things

00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,270
complete separate ly yeah for sure

00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:36,160
the work of the digital humanitarians it's very good regarding it and stunned

00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,089
by toss words they are a worldwide group of volunteers that come together using

00:15:40,089 --> 00:15:44,110
technology for humanitarian relief around the world what we are working on

00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:48,700
you can look look them up and they are great they're amazing I wish I knew them

00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:52,690
before but I don't know this these things happen I cannot know anything

00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:56,080
everything at the same time especially in the middle of an earthquake what we

00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,920
are working on is actually opening our code because one of the advantages of

00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,730
not working with the Shahidi was that we actually did develop and innovate new

00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:08,800
things so we're opening your code cleaning up our github a bit because

00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:14,620
it's really messy we hired over 50 coders working at once and as for me the

00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:19,589
real goldmine is the verification methodology so we're going to have that

00:16:19,589 --> 00:16:24,670
explained and printed in English and Spanish because also most information

00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:28,810
out there is in English so the language barrier was also a challenge for us at

00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:33,459
some point we want this to be available in Spanish for all of Latin America but

00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:38,230
it will be available in English as well this is the goldmine it doesn't matter

00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:40,690
what platform you use for mapping disasters

00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:45,339
I think verification technologies are really what when it comes to the end -

00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:53,640
at the end thank you very much for your question we can repeat the question

00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:09,090
that's a very good question so she's asking if would I say that the

00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:13,950
technology itself was bad or the lack of education around technology that our

00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:22,770
volunteers had I think in the middle of a disaster the technological solution is

00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:27,870
emerge doesn't work there were so many people saying hey let's do apps to save

00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:32,310
it to wear it let's do an app where you where you ping you're safe in the middle

00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:37,230
of a crisis what's gonna be how is that gonna be useful and I also think we

00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:41,100
didn't know about Russia Headey and it's also it's has to do with the network

00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:45,750
effect right because the more people use a platform the more you will be likely

00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:51,240
to get used more so I don't think the program is that were with us they are

00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:54,900
amazing at the end it was not even about programmers but it was about data

00:17:54,900 --> 00:18:00,720
analysts because we had a lot of data so rather than technology I would say it

00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:06,540
was about the methodology technology is just a tool it's just it's just one more

00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:11,490
tool so what we needed was a really good methodology and processing of data and

00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:16,680
we could have used anything to speed up the process it did speed up the process

00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:21,540
but our general feeling at the end was we did everything manually sure

00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:26,840
technology is a very broad category we use Twitter we use Google Docs

00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:32,490
spreadsheets we used but what I mean is that the software development itself did

00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:36,660
not make a difference at the end because we were doing everything manually to a

00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:42,510
call center verifying things when he came to the most complicated at the time

00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:52,940
and the most complicated moments I don't know if that answers the question the

00:18:52,940 --> 00:19:00,240
issues of you know the white men in Silicon Valley who seem to be hindering

00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,950
your process right I wonder if there's a way that you could have brought them in

00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:09,780
a little bit differently so that there are resources of knowledge that they

00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:13,200
have you could have helped you know when it

00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,919
did help the Google did help a lot we were working with deer with their

00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:20,429
engineers and I like this question I like this questioning

00:19:20,429 --> 00:19:25,260
we were working hand in hand with their engineers but their crisis their Google

00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:31,260
crisis map platform was not optimal at the end and what I also have a strong

00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:35,880
political position Pro up and software so it has to do more about my political

00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:40,620
position Pro up in software and against Pro Puteri software than it actually has

00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:44,130
with to do with the use of one technology or the other but I do believe

00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:47,130
which I he would have been better because they also had this plugin that

00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:50,610
allows for different verification layers and that took us a while to figure out

00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:56,070
but it only tells you how we wanted a user-friendly interface and everybody

00:19:56,070 --> 00:20:00,720
was used to using Google Maps anyways but when you have different needs you

00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,720
have to change your platform and technology and our needs changed

00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:07,710
everyday if any of you do any software development you know that the first

00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:10,980
thing you have to ask yourself is what is it going to be the use of this

00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:15,929
technology what is going to be the actual use and the use was different day

00:20:15,929 --> 00:20:20,549
today so they need four different date today what I want to highlight by saying

00:20:20,549 --> 00:20:26,190
that technology was shit I know it's a very broad concept but it's just hands

00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:32,190
and people that save lives we shouldn't make technology this big it's gonna save

00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:36,409
the world and revolutionize earthquakes its people and how we use it

00:20:36,409 --> 00:20:42,679
marlyn likely we have actually one more question

00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:50,270
hello I've never heard of it before and I can't find it could you spell it

00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:58,850
for me yeah I'm sorry sir you mean sorry I just jumped in mentioning Shahidi so

00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:10,940
OSHA he is us eh eh eh I di thank you very much I hope so hmm and it's an open

00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:17,059
source platform that is used for mapping disasters so they already have a

00:21:17,059 --> 00:21:23,030
methodology in place and they have a different sorts of maps in place and it

00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:30,530
was made by African developers so this is also supporting different platforms

00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:37,250
and decentralizing platforms as well as I said Google was also very supportive

00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:41,750
it's not that they were not but they don't quite work out either that's great

00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:50,960
