Title: Protests, the Pandemic, and Misinformation - June 30, 2020 - Dialogues and Debates
Publication date: 2020-09-29
Playlist: Mozilla Festival
Description: 
	The latest installment of Mozilla’s Dialogues & Debates series will explore mis- and disinformation related to COVID-19 and racial justice protests

As millions of people around the world continue to shelter from the pandemic, internet platforms can keep us connected. These same platforms can also help people organize the ongoing protests for racial justice, sparked by George Floyd's killing.

But these platforms and the content that they amplify can also harm us. Fake cures, conspiracy theories about the pandemic’s origins, and fast-spreading, racist disinformation have become the status quo.

Why can’t we trust online platforms when we need them most? What are platforms doing to address the spread of mis- and disinformation? And which communities are most impacted by this problem?

On Tuesday, June 30, Mozilla will host a virtual Dialogues & Debates to answer these questions and a host of others. The conversation is slated for 11 a.m. ET, and you can submit questions ahead of time by tweeting @mozilla with the hashtag #DialoguesAndDebates.

00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:37,309
been canceled canceled or postponed

00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:41,059
that's why Mozilla's made its dialogues

00:00:37,309 --> 00:00:43,609
and debates the speaker series of best

00:00:41,059 --> 00:00:45,079
virtual it's a chance to continue the

00:00:43,609 --> 00:00:47,989
important conversations about online

00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:51,199
privacy trustworthy AI big tech and

00:00:47,989 --> 00:00:53,449
similar topics so today's virtual

00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:56,300
debates Dalton debates will be about the

00:00:53,449 --> 00:00:58,519
protests the pandemic and misinformation

00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:00,679
will be discussing the way his fake news

00:00:58,519 --> 00:01:02,899
spreads across platforms especially

00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:04,610
against the backdrop of Koba 19 and the

00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:06,830
black lives matter movement protests

00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:08,930
we've seen this problem all around the

00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:11,960
web we've seen Facebook posts about

00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:14,540
secret cures we've seen viral videos on

00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:17,690
YouTube claiming the pandemic is a giant

00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:19,760
conspiracy we've seen tweets resurfacing

00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:22,850
old videos of violent protests

00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:24,740
pretending that they're newer videos so

00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:27,140
over the next 40 minutes I'm going to

00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:28,550
talk to three experts about this what's

00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:31,370
causing it what the consequences are and

00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:34,100
how we might fix it so joining me today

00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:13,030
in mind we're also taking questions on

to tweet Mozilla and use the hashtag

00:02:17,209 --> 00:02:25,610
dialogues and debates so let's get

00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:29,060
started how you guys feeling pretty good

00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:31,880
all right that's good do I want to start

00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:34,940
with you before we go any further I want

00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:38,000
to clarify some of the real world impact

00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:39,260
state news pieces have been having on

00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,060
the real world

00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:46,850
can you go standing like an example of

00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:48,739
that yeah so I'll give you one really

00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:51,769
clear example and one somewhat less

00:02:48,739 --> 00:02:54,019
clear example you know just a preface it

00:02:51,769 --> 00:02:56,239
of course sometimes the link between

00:02:54,019 --> 00:02:58,519
content online and what's happening

00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,459
offline is a little bit less clear

00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:03,620
sometimes it's more clear and

00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:05,720
unfortunately in recent years as we've

00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:07,430
seen people get more and more skilled at

00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:10,790
deploying this and disinformation that

00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:12,500
link has become more clear so one really

00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:15,620
disturbing example that I want to talk

00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:17,450
about is the hashtag corona jihad and

00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:21,049
the kind of content that has been going

00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:24,410
out under that hashtag and with with

00:03:21,049 --> 00:03:25,730
that sort of content and anybody who's

00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:27,109
interested when I'm talking about I

00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:30,680
strongly urge you to check out a quality

00:03:27,109 --> 00:03:31,459
lab report on corona jihad as well as

00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,140
all the work that they've been doing

00:03:31,459 --> 00:03:35,570
about it and the examples that I've seen

00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:37,910
have come from them for people who

00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:41,269
haven't heard of this this is a campaign

00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:45,489
saying that Muslims are purposefully

00:03:41,269 --> 00:03:47,870
spreading Korona it's pointed to a

00:03:45,489 --> 00:03:50,000
religious gathering that happened in

00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:51,590
India and it's happening around a time

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,510
when we've already seen a lot of myths

00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:56,570
and disinformation being used to target

00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:58,310
that community so claims that for

00:03:56,570 --> 00:04:01,700
example Muslims are handing out birth

00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:04,819
control before corona jihad there was

00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:08,090
the love jihad hashtag saying that

00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:11,030
Muslims are perfect belief concerting

00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:12,829
Hindus and getting them marry as a way

00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:15,590
to get rid of the Jews in the country

00:04:12,829 --> 00:04:18,380
and all of these things are leading very

00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:22,870
directly to violence they're leading to

00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:26,470
lynchings but people being being either

00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:28,070
beaten or actually killed by angry mobs

00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:32,390
people's homes and

00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:34,970
being burnt down all sorts of very real

00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:37,010
violence so that's one where the link is

00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:39,830
quite clear unfortunately there's been a

00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:41,840
lot of research done around it and and

00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:43,940
we can see the link between that content

00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:47,660
and where so-called communal violence

00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:50,350
brings up another somewhat more

00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:54,320
attenuated example but it's very timely

00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:56,360
so I believe it was this month or late

00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:59,390
last month there was a family that was

00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:01,490
camping in Washington State and they

00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:05,450
were surrounded by a group of people who

00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:07,070
said you're Antipas and get out here

00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:10,880
they were actually followed by people

00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:12,710
with semi-automatic weapons and this is

00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,540
a rumor that's been going around in

00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:17,270
conservative circles it's been supported

00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:19,520
by contents on Twitter on Facebook about

00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:20,990
how first of all about what an PIPA is

00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,910
but more importantly that they're

00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:27,710
actually going to small towns to try to

00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:29,060
perpetuate their their work right so I

00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:30,860
just wanted to give that example because

00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:33,170
I want to make it really clear that it's

00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:36,200
not just about places outside of the US

00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:37,700
not happening in just one place this

00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:40,220
content does have very real-world

00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:41,780
effects and in this case it was people

00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:43,580
being chased out of their camping trip

00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:46,970
and and followed by people with guns

00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:48,470
drawn that's absolutely crazy I was

00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:51,590
hopefully hoping to kind of go around

00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:53,120
the table the proverbial table where

00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:55,910
everyone could kind of surface one piece

00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,620
of misinformation disinformation and

00:05:55,910 --> 00:06:00,290
faking is that they seen during this

00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:02,540
pandemic during these protests that I've

00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:04,760
just been kind of absolutely wild I know

00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:06,680
for myself I saw the news that there are

00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:08,810
five G that people thought five G towers

00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,340
were causing coronavirus and it's kind

00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:11,630
of crazy that that caught on where are

00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:15,220
some of the things you all have been

00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:15,220
seeing and I'll start with that Camille

00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:21,950
Julie you wanted to say something I saw

00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:23,720
Rachel hand well I'll link that to the

00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:26,120
content that I've seen to see that

00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,650
applying violence that could come out of

00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,750
it okay

00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:32,300
then I'll leave my comments with what

00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:34,070
dia was just discussing which is with

00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:38,720
what's interesting from my perspective

00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:41,840
is not so much new content from scratch

00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:46,070
that's suddenly talking about coab in 19

00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:47,990
a lot of conspiracy theories or hate

00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:49,820
movements that were previously focused

00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:52,940
on other targets and other narratives

00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:56,450
that suddenly get a fresh you know coat

00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:58,580
of paint to become coded 19 conspiracy

00:06:56,450 --> 00:07:00,560
theories or a covenant in hate movement

00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:02,600
so Koren and she had is a great example

00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,000
of that other examples that are more

00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:06,710
conspiratorial for instance include the

00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,800
conspiracy theories that Gates

00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:10,940
Foundation is working towards

00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,880
depopulating the earth and this is why

00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:16,250
they had invented climate change now we

00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:19,040
see that conspiracy theory you become

00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:20,330
this is why they have created coded

00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:22,490
nineteen all of this of course is

00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:24,110
inaccurate but it's for me what the

00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:26,860
dynamic that's interesting here is sort

00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:30,650
of the you know the the recycling of

00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:34,520
previous movements narratives to to make

00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:38,750
them cool the nineteen relevant nice and

00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:41,900
then I Julie's you want to go next yes I

00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:46,520
completely agree with what Camille just

00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:48,350
said how you know conspiracies which are

00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:50,450
concisely networks which had

00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:53,479
pre-existence to the pandemic are also

00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:55,910
trying to take advantage of this of this

00:07:53,479 --> 00:07:58,669
moment and I'm I would like to jump on

00:07:55,910 --> 00:08:04,130
on what Camille just just shared

00:07:58,669 --> 00:08:06,650
I had one fake knew that I really really

00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:08,810
often came came across on the web and

00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:11,150
particularly on whatsapp and I'm sure

00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:13,580
you will be familiar to many people like

00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:17,000
me who remember family groups especially

00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:18,830
in Africa Cameroon and wait I mean that

00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,979
the family groups were flooded with

00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:25,220
disinformation and it was it became our

00:08:21,979 --> 00:08:28,060
job to try to to you know debunk that so

00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:30,169
it was a huge test but one

00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:33,320
disinformation that I came across and I

00:08:30,169 --> 00:08:36,260
think is a good example of you know how

00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:38,570
serious this is is the this idea that so

00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:40,909
there was an info going around saying

00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:44,630
that Melinda Gates was divorcing Bill

00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:47,959
Gates because she was disagreeing on how

00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:51,650
he was he was using the their foundation

00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:53,330
to spread the disease and there and

00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:55,760
there and later

00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:58,820
you know fund of VAX

00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,860
that would affect African populations

00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:03,530
and basically reduce the populations in

00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:06,470
Africa that was particularly disgusting

00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:09,380
and absolutely absolutely untrue and it

00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:12,620
was actually debunked by many media

00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:16,700
including hesita which is a network of

00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:19,100
fact checkers and also by newspapers in

00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:22,700
the french-speaking sphere particularly

00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:27,470
done nerds so the daily you know free

00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:29,150
newspaper but why that comparison is was

00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:31,610
particularly interesting and had

00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:34,100
actually will were the real world effect

00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:36,710
is that it came at a moment where there

00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:38,440
was another controversy so I don't I

00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:41,150
don't know if you remember that but on a

00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:43,190
their famous French TV show there were

00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:44,870
doctors who were discussing the response

00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:47,420
to the cocaine and one of the doctors

00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:50,210
made their unfortunate comments on

00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:53,630
whether or not we should test vaccines

00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:55,340
on populations in Africa and obviously

00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:57,590
people reacted against that and word

00:09:55,340 --> 00:10:00,440
games that but the fact that it came at

00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:03,650
the same time as this as these

00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:06,800
comparisons were going around it gave

00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:10,130
April definitely to that and it was even

00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:12,230
more difficult to to debunk any did have

00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:16,180
real-world consequences I remember for

00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:19,700
instance being so about a center of

00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:22,850
testing which was destroyed in the

00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:25,520
suburb of Abidjan côte d'ivoire and it

00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:27,380
reminds of other episodes of

00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:30,230
disinformation and epidemic and this

00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:32,630
time Ebola how disinformation has made

00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:35,080
it very difficult at the beginning for

00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:38,480
doctors and public health officials to

00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:40,700
brain responses to the Ebola crisis

00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,980
because doctors were chains and there

00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:44,900
was a distrust against them so yeah it's

00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:47,510
it does have real world comes against it

00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:51,470
yeah that's a good point

00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:53,810
nema yeah I'd like to talk about fake

00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:55,880
news or ridiculous base fake news that

00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:57,230
is spread by actual members of

00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,550
government because you know these are

00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:59,600
your leaders and you expected to trust

00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:00,800
them and then what do you do in the

00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,200
situations where they are

00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,390
ones who are spreading this kind of fake

00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,970
news and taking the example of East

00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:10,490
Africa we saw president Mark Foley of

00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:12,680
Tanzania suggested that steam inhalation

00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:16,190
could either cure you or you know

00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:20,860
prevent you from getting mono virus the

00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:24,790
governor of Nairobi had actually Missy

00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:27,560
packages for people because he said that

00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:28,700
consuming alcohol would you know prevent

00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:31,100
you from getting corona virus that would

00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:32,240
help you to recover and so you know what

00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,890
that can do in terms of alcohol

00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,320
consumption you know that's a real-world

00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:39,589
danger about people going and suffering

00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:41,029
from alcohol intoxication and I think

00:11:39,589 --> 00:11:43,160
the biggest story that really stood out

00:11:41,029 --> 00:11:46,250
for me when this first happened was the

00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:47,450
Speaker of Parliament in Uganda she had

00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:49,490
posted this video along with the

00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:53,540
president and the scientist and his

00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:55,100
company saying that they had the cure to

00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:57,410
corona virus and and it was always

00:11:55,100 --> 00:12:01,640
fluctuating between cure or vaccine and

00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:04,790
that this man from the US had given the

00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:06,709
patent to Uganda to stop production in

00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:09,410
two weeks so Uganda was gonna have this

00:12:06,709 --> 00:12:11,750
vaccine cure in two weeks and people

00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:13,459
across social media really lost it like

00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:15,529
half the camp was like this is nonsense

00:12:13,459 --> 00:12:17,959
like you know there's a process to have

00:12:15,529 --> 00:12:19,430
a vaccine you have to test it even the

00:12:17,959 --> 00:12:21,350
Ministry of Health was like what's going

00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:23,510
on and then the other camp was like no

00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:26,420
this is our time to shine we finally

00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:29,089
were done in we have a vaccine there of

00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:34,450
course later on it was it turned out to

00:12:29,089 --> 00:12:37,339
be a sanitizer not a cure so but I mean

00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:38,870
this misinformation I get was everywhere

00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:41,360
and it was it was giving people a lot of

00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:43,339
hope this was in early March that we had

00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,870
the cure for carnivores in Uganda and

00:12:43,339 --> 00:12:48,890
this is all from our leaders from across

00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:50,779
these countries and I think that's a big

00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:53,240
problem when your leaders are giving you

00:12:50,779 --> 00:12:55,250
wrong information and how do you start

00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:58,160
to dispel that from from from this

00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:59,449
starting point so yeah I I know this is

00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,589
a very serious topic but it's gonna

00:12:59,449 --> 00:13:02,690
cause and say you guys have the best

00:13:00,589 --> 00:13:05,570
virtual backgrounds I think of any

00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:07,630
dialogue debates panel you know starship

00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:10,060
right now that's fantastic

00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:11,300
yeah these these examples feel

00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:14,550
high-stakes

00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:16,769
my question is will any of this finally

00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:24,690
because this can keep on going away

00:13:16,769 --> 00:13:26,700
that's kind of so I'll jump in all right

00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:28,860
I don't know if it was addressed to

00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:31,380
someone but of course this can go on

00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:33,390
forever and obviously I think we're

00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:36,870
talking about the responsibilities in

00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:39,029
that in the in those in the spread or at

00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:41,519
least in the the visibility of these of

00:13:39,029 --> 00:13:45,300
these theories and obviously platforms

00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:50,370
are in my opinion the primary

00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:53,070
responsibles I'm working particularly in

00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:56,220
places of the world where all these

00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:59,490
platforms are eager to scale that's a

00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:01,950
new that's a new thing obviously trying

00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:03,600
to tap into potentially especially for

00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:05,310
the African continent potentially 1

00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,589
billion consumers that's how they

00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:10,680
proceed I consider them citizens and

00:14:07,589 --> 00:14:12,480
users first but for some their consumers

00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,850
but you can do and most of these

00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,890
bathrooms do that without the necessary

00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:21,300
Nate safeguards they just they don't

00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:24,510
they don't ask themselves about what are

00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:26,339
the that does it do these countries have

00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:28,399
a functioning judiciary first of all or

00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:31,079
did these countries have a functioning

00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,910
public force that's not used primarily

00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:35,250
against citizens but that's used

00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:37,980
actually to do its work which is to make

00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:41,040
sure that you know security it's a

00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:43,740
reality for everyone so um right yeah I

00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:45,750
feel like this these platforms do have a

00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:47,399
responsibility not only to scale but

00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:49,200
also just ask themselves about the

00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:52,380
political responsibility they have when

00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:54,720
they put their fit in in places where

00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:57,300
all the safeguards do not exist like

00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:00,120
they do in other nations let's say the

00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:02,640
US or or Europe where even if the

00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:04,140
political the political power won't do

00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,579
anything at least there is a very strong

00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:07,680
civil society and there are all other

00:15:05,579 --> 00:15:12,750
come to powers that they that can jump

00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:16,350
in so but beyond that obviously beyond

00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:18,720
the the platform's governments do have a

00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:22,199
responsibility to a responsibility as

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,640
well and I fear that the less we try to

00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:26,040
deal with these issues of this

00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:28,260
information and which can therefore

00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:31,040
become hate speech can be used

00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:36,390
foster hate speech and and so you know

00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:38,040
distrust among populations they some

00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:40,890
governments are using that to say hey

00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:45,570
you see Twitter and Facebook and what's

00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:47,310
up there sowing hatred in our country so

00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:48,990
we need to shut them down and that's

00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:51,900
what increasingly governments are doing

00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:55,310
and they're doing yet I would say almost

00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:58,290
increasingly with impunity because

00:15:55,310 --> 00:16:00,510
obviously nobody agrees with having a

00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:03,750
kind of art your country or your online

00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:07,200
space being filled with disinformation

00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:08,790
in all this but yeah I I think it can't

00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:11,100
go on because it's dangerous for free

00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:12,810
expression ultimately for security of

00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:15,480
course but ultimately for free

00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:17,790
expression yeah yeah you mentioned

00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:19,980
Africa earlier in your answer and it

00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:23,610
made me think about you know we have

00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:25,350
seen many examples of many prominent

00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:28,440
examples of fake news and misinformation

00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:31,110
regarding coronavirus but the examples

00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:32,490
of fake news regarding George flow and

00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:34,530
the black lives matter movement may not

00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:37,920
be as prominent

00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:39,450
so for NEMA for Julie how are people in

00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,280
other places kind of perceiving the

00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:44,010
black lives matter movement perceiving

00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:47,430
the George Floyd news over seeing fake

00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:51,270
news around those things as well yeah

00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:53,010
I'd like to just jump in and you know of

00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:54,150
course Africa is not a country but you

00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:56,100
know speaking from the point of view of

00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:57,990
the African Union did put out a

00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:00,120
statement strongly condemning the murder

00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:01,770
of George void and they affirmed the

00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:04,410
rejection of him discriminatory

00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:06,510
practices in the US and coincidentally

00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:08,490
toward Florida was killed on Africa day

00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:10,200
and Africa Day is an annual

00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:13,050
commemoration of what would eventually

00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:14,630
become the African Union and it's so

00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:17,390
ironic because it's a day to celebrate

00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:20,960
progress to celebrate freedom from

00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:23,220
colonization from segregation and so

00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:25,650
people who across the continent watched

00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:29,250
all of this happening in real time and

00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:31,230
it was absolutely horrific like I felt

00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:33,000
like I couldn't sleep for two weeks you

00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:35,190
know seeing this military response

00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:39,270
seeing how journalists were being

00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:40,430
treated and it it was it was horrific it

00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:41,540
was were if ik to see that this

00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:43,100
the way that people were being treated

00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:46,940
in the US because there's different

00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:48,920
layers to this you know Western nations

00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:51,770
especially the US they play this

00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:53,480
paternalistic role in African countries

00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:55,010
through their diplomacy and through

00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:57,530
their aid programs and now we're

00:17:55,010 --> 00:18:00,380
watching in real time as these countries

00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:02,030
unravel and show us all these things

00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:03,620
that they came to preach to us for all

00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:05,870
these years and you know when it comes

00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:07,310
to their own country they take a totally

00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:10,610
different response and they have this

00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:12,170
really really violent response and but

00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:13,640
at the same time African countries have

00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:16,190
been doing these atrocities against

00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:17,990
their own citizens and the AU has

00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:20,750
remained silent you know whatever

00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:24,890
country doctor my BRC nigeria cameroon

00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:26,300
and yes no society is perfect but you

00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:28,970
know all in this trumpets up in a

00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:31,630
struggle for you know safety freedom

00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:33,950
dignity of black people of Africans and

00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:36,080
this raises really important questions

00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:39,920
because firstly what moral authority

00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:42,440
does the u.s. have as a world leader you

00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:44,840
know but the other scary part is does

00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:48,410
this embolden African leaders to justify

00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:50,590
their own violence at home or does this

00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:52,820
become a turning point for us to look at

00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:55,040
justice in a different lens and to look

00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:58,940
at reconciliation you know for citizens

00:18:55,040 --> 00:19:01,490
across Africa so I think for me this has

00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:03,170
been a big turning point and it was it

00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:05,840
was absolutely terrifying watching all

00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:08,450
this and it's still happening and seeing

00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,780
what the response is it's just a slap in

00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:13,940
the face

00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:18,860
I feel yeah if I could just rapidly I

00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:22,790
totally share Nina's feeling and I would

00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:25,220
like to add a layer to that we saw how

00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:28,370
the black lives matter movement is

00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:30,890
occurring beyond the US borders in Latin

00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:34,990
America in in Europe and Beyond and

00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:38,240
particularly in the case of Europe I was

00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:40,610
very interested in how it has impacted

00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,810
even debate on police violence in

00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:44,530
another country that I know very well

00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:47,930
which is friends and particularly a case

00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:51,020
the case of a young man named who's that

00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:53,990
now named Adam as how hey who was who

00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:59,870
was killed who died while being an

00:19:53,990 --> 00:20:02,600
police custody and it has resonated and

00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:04,820
he has given another it has given

00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:08,120
visibility to that struggle which was

00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:12,289
and until very simply you know kept at

00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:14,120
the margins and perceived by some in the

00:20:12,289 --> 00:20:18,350
in the in the opinions and particularly

00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:20,990
the far-right opinion as you know a an

00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:24,559
argument made by people who want to

00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:26,390
launch a race war in France or stuff

00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:28,429
like that which are absolutely not true

00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:30,679
it's really about you know justice it's

00:20:28,429 --> 00:20:32,809
a sisterhood let's just heard this man

00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:36,740
I said holidays now asking for justice

00:20:32,809 --> 00:20:39,549
in the name of their family so I I felt

00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:41,450
like there was an interesting

00:20:39,549 --> 00:20:42,820
transnational that's a concept that one

00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:45,649
of my colleagues here at the Berkman

00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:48,679
introduced me to Leonardo tena he's

00:20:45,649 --> 00:20:50,080
really about we are on the Internet

00:20:48,679 --> 00:20:52,730
so it's an infrastructure that

00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:55,399
interdependent we're all on the same

00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:58,640
network in one action somewhere impacts

00:20:55,399 --> 00:21:01,909
some an action elsewhere and yeah the

00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:04,130
George Floyd protest movement really

00:21:01,909 --> 00:21:08,120
showed that that one thing can happen in

00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:10,460
monopolies and a week later the case of

00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:12,289
Adam a holiday is reopened and you know

00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:16,010
looked at with another legs that that

00:21:12,289 --> 00:21:17,539
was very powerful I think yeah you know

00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:19,220
it's great I mean sometimes it's hard to

00:21:17,539 --> 00:21:23,270
think about the fake news when the real

00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:25,220
news is just so like bad and tragic but

00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:27,260
one thing I think about or one thing

00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:29,570
that I want to ask you guys

00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:31,789
you know Internet users in low resource

00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:35,000
environments can be more vulnerable to

00:21:31,789 --> 00:21:36,440
misinformation are there tools or

00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:47,539
resources were developing to kind of

00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:49,460
combat that yeah I I'm always felt that

00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:53,090
you know knowledge is power access to

00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:54,350
information is the key to education but

00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:56,390
you know from what we're seeing about

00:21:54,350 --> 00:22:00,980
the spread of conspiracy theories it

00:21:56,390 --> 00:22:02,720
seems to really not be the case and you

00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:04,980
know countries across Africa have

00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:07,290
internet subscription rates anyway

00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:09,360
10% if we're looking at for example Chad

00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:12,540
you know all the way up to 80% so

00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:14,340
there's a large like millions of people

00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:16,260
who are going to come onto the internet

00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:19,890
for the first time Africa has about 1.5

00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:21,570
billion people and you know we think

00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:22,830
that if you've never been on the

00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:25,290
internet you're more likely to be

00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:26,910
susceptible to believing fake

00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:29,160
information I could have the example of

00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:32,100
a friend this is actually in a podcast

00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:34,770
where she was talking to one of her

00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:36,690
staff about YouTube and her staff

00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:39,090
basically thought that you know YouTube

00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:41,370
was like traditional media you have to

00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:43,110
be someone invented to make a YouTube

00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:45,420
video you have to be someone serious and

00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:47,010
my friend explained like no you can make

00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:51,810
a youtube video anyone can upload on

00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:53,940
YouTube any one of the street talking on

00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:57,150
YouTube and so this basic digital

00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:59,160
literacy is you know really important in

00:22:57,150 --> 00:23:02,130
helping people to understand miss and

00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:03,570
disinformation and in turn and answering

00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:07,020
your question you know what's being done

00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:10,080
just to talk about our creative award

00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:12,030
with Mozilla we launched a game called

00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,320
choose your own fate news and we're

00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:15,450
trying to use a different approach to

00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:17,670
get people to scrutinize the information

00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:19,320
that they receive by you know very much

00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:20,550
related to this conversation by showing

00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:22,830
that fake news has real-world

00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:24,990
implications every time you send that

00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:26,970
forward and every time you you know

00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:28,440
spread this information what is actually

00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:31,110
happening how does that actually effect

00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:32,880
your society and we wanted to use this

00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:35,490
game aspect so that we're not being

00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,720
preachy or without writing long reports

00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:39,000
and no one's going to read and we really

00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:41,010
wanted it to reach people who are coming

00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,270
on the internet for the first time but

00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:44,010
trying to really answer your question

00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:46,080
what has been done I think too little is

00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:50,070
being done I'm just not seeing enough

00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:52,080
you know this fact-checking but you

00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:54,660
check after the matter has happened and

00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:56,730
you know often all the buzz is gone and

00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:58,590
no one really cares anymore or the other

00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:59,850
issue is even if you want to fact check

00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:01,650
how are you fact-checking local

00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:03,570
languages in Uganda we have over 100

00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:05,010
languages we do not have that kind of

00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:07,500
funding to go and see what every

00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:09,870
community radio is speaking or what are

00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:11,760
they saying and then of course on that

00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:13,810
topic is very thin line between freedom

00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:16,510
of expression and repression

00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:20,080
voices and we have to really know that

00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:21,760
line delicately so overall I think we

00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,260
have so so so much work to do in

00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,870
educating people about this information

00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:27,250
and coming back to the original question

00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:29,800
what do you do when the misinformation

00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:32,140
is by your leaders who are the ones who

00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:35,170
would have programs to teach you about

00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:38,440
misinformation so lots and lots and lots

00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:39,760
of work to be done yeah I want to switch

00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:42,190
gears a little bit because I think we

00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:44,380
have to talk about what happened

00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:47,140
yesterday it's it's a little tangential

00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:52,090
to fake news it has to do with you know

00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:55,630
what we see online so Trump had a bad

00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:58,870
day yesterday we saw twitch take him

00:24:55,630 --> 00:25:01,180
down we saw his subreddit his section of

00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:04,840
the reddit's sections the reddit kind of

00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:05,830
taking down we saw YouTube and some of

00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,580
the supporters like David Duke and

00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:09,340
Richard Spencer

00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:10,390
I feel like Camille you definitely have

00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:13,750
thoughts do you you definitely have

00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:16,240
thoughts my question is why is this

00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:17,740
happening like in the eleventh hour of

00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,640
his presidency it feels like he's going

00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:20,440
to be out tomorrow

00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:25,870
why do they wait until now to start

00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:28,030
doing this yeah um I think it's related

00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:29,850
to what Julian you know we're just

00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:32,470
talking about right like in some ways

00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:34,600
we're at a really interesting and

00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:37,570
important pivotal moment in how we

00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:39,220
navigate Compton moderation on the

00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:42,430
internet because on one hand we're

00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:46,090
exposed to sort of how nefarious how bad

00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:49,060
how how violent disinformation can be

00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:52,450
but we're also reminded that online

00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:54,910
activism is sometimes a wonderful force

00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:57,490
for progress right we're reminded that

00:25:54,910 --> 00:26:00,250
you can create moments for peace and

00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:01,630
justice and I think so via the actual

00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:03,670
answer to your question like why are we

00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:06,040
seeing this now I think it's because

00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:08,470
largely of well-organized campaigns

00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:11,530
there's been a successful stuff hate

00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:14,260
for-profit campaign and so we see this

00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:16,800
pressure sort of get organized and have

00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:20,560
this conversation with Silicon Valley I

00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:23,710
think what we have to ask is right now

00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:26,260
is a moment of intense experimentation

00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:27,179
we have a lot of like scattershot rules

00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:30,059
and ad

00:26:27,179 --> 00:26:31,710
you know policies being applied and a

00:26:30,059 --> 00:26:34,200
lot of like oh we have this problem so

00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:36,119
we're gonna fix it that way and we

00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:38,369
should be asking the questions that

00:26:36,119 --> 00:26:41,460
Julie put on the table right like how

00:26:38,369 --> 00:26:44,279
how does that scale how consistently are

00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:45,809
we going to apply those new policies the

00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:47,940
reddit statement is really interesting

00:26:45,809 --> 00:26:49,710
because it talks about the growing gap

00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:52,049
between their values and their hate

00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:54,119
speech policies are we going to apply

00:26:52,049 --> 00:26:55,710
this consistently you know across the

00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:57,899
entire political spectrum but also

00:26:55,710 --> 00:27:00,179
across all the context across the globe

00:26:57,899 --> 00:27:02,399
how are we going to create transparency

00:27:00,179 --> 00:27:04,979
and accountability for people to be able

00:27:02,399 --> 00:27:07,799
to measure the impact of all these new

00:27:04,979 --> 00:27:09,809
scattershot sort of ad hoc rules that

00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:11,580
are being created very rapidly so I

00:27:09,809 --> 00:27:13,830
think that we're really at a pivotal

00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:15,509
moment where we have to sort of like

00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:17,489
keep our focus and make sure we

00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:19,710
understand all these new rules their

00:27:17,489 --> 00:27:21,059
implications and we have the

00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:24,629
transparency and accountability it's

00:27:21,059 --> 00:27:29,879
necessary to track them and you know

00:27:24,629 --> 00:27:33,149
properly evaluate them yeah did you have

00:27:29,879 --> 00:27:35,820
any thoughts honest yeah actually this

00:27:33,149 --> 00:27:39,539
also relates to the question the

00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:41,820
numerous wanted to as well in terms of

00:27:39,539 --> 00:27:44,789
sort of how why this is happening now

00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:48,389
and also how we're solving this problem

00:27:44,789 --> 00:27:49,889
I mean just a second Camille I think the

00:27:48,389 --> 00:27:51,960
reason this is happening now

00:27:49,889 --> 00:27:53,940
Point Blank period it's because of

00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:55,950
organizing and it's because of work that

00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:58,769
people have done and I have to say that

00:27:55,950 --> 00:28:01,799
someone who has done many various types

00:27:58,769 --> 00:28:03,899
of organizing over the years and sort of

00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:07,289
started off with actually currently

00:28:03,899 --> 00:28:10,499
going door-to-door talking to people

00:28:07,289 --> 00:28:12,419
about surveillance it's really hard to

00:28:10,499 --> 00:28:16,649
organize around these types of issues

00:28:12,419 --> 00:28:19,739
especially when people are facing murder

00:28:16,649 --> 00:28:23,940
by the police or lynchings by

00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:25,109
Islamophobe or you know genocide or all

00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:27,029
of the things that people are facing

00:28:25,109 --> 00:28:30,149
it's really hard for the people who are

00:28:27,029 --> 00:28:32,820
most affected by this to organize and it

00:28:30,149 --> 00:28:34,739
takes bad press and it takes a lot of

00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:37,019
attention and it takes sometimes

00:28:34,739 --> 00:28:40,270
unfortunately these obvious sad results

00:28:37,019 --> 00:28:42,310
of platforms not doing the right thing

00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:45,550
but I still think there's also this real

00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:47,500
big issue of where the resources are

00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:51,250
going in our own world in the nonprofit

00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:53,380
world and in the world of activists who

00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:55,330
are who are working on this and also

00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:57,400
some of the companies themselves you

00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:59,410
know how much how many resources our

00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:02,140
company is going to put into

00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:05,460
understanding very dangerous myths and

00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:08,800
disinformation that is in a language in

00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:11,770
non-latin characters that maybe not that

00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:12,970
many people speak not that many you know

00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:15,760
I think the quotation marks are very

00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:17,980
important because we have to think about

00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:20,380
how much money these platforms actually

00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:22,390
have at their disposal so you know if we

00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:24,310
have to force them what their resources

00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:25,960
in the same in the right place in the

00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:28,810
same way that the environmental movement

00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:30,550
had to show that that companies that

00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:32,650
were polluting it had to take that into

00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:35,740
account in their business model but also

00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:37,660
those of us in the nonprofit world or

00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:40,060
those of us that are working on fighting

00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:42,070
this we need to think about how we're

00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:43,660
making sure that examples those of us

00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:45,970
who might not always be affected

00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:47,980
directly by myths and disinformation are

00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:50,020
making sure that the focus is on the

00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:51,190
people who are most effective people who

00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:54,300
are doing research in their own

00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:57,310
communities like I would really strongly

00:29:54,300 --> 00:30:00,220
urge people if you're in an institution

00:29:57,310 --> 00:30:02,520
in the EU or in the u.s. maybe you're

00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:07,090
not a person to be doing the research on

00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:08,980
misinformation in a country in Africa or

00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:10,630
misinformation in South Asia or South

00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:12,400
East Asia you know maybe you're not the

00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:15,430
person actually to be speaking on a

00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:17,740
panel about it or interview for a book

00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:19,030
you know I would really suggest also in

00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:20,380
the spirit of the conversation that's

00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:22,810
happening in the US right now about

00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:24,820
structural inequality I mean it's about

00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:26,830
anti-blackness also about a lot of other

00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:29,920
things just ask yourselves like how can

00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:31,660
I personally maybe help make this a

00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:33,730
conversation where the most effective

00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:35,890
people who understand the problem set

00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:38,890
are the voices that are being heard and

00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:40,180
funded so sorry I know that's a little

00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:42,910
bit tangential but I think it really

00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:44,950
does tie into the how we've gotten to

00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:47,230
this point in the problem even if that

00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:49,570
makes no I'm down pretenders I like the

00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:51,280
thumbs-up from Nima earlier everyone

00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:53,200
thought that yes you given like

00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:54,670
nonprofits I wanted to talk about

00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,440
and just like organizations in general I

00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:58,240
want to talk about witness because I was

00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:00,550
on the site yesterday that's so cool

00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:02,110
what you got to do is like wanting you

00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:04,750
know to get people good with like video

00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:05,830
and like recording things and just it's

00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:08,200
very important than the world we live in

00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:10,210
I feel like I'll be scrolling on

00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:12,460
Instagram once in a while and amongst

00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:14,500
the George Floyd protests footage and

00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:16,420
amongst the black lives matter protest

00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:19,600
footage every once in a while I'll see a

00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:21,370
brand a share a video of a cop throwing

00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:25,030
a football to a kid or like handing some

00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:26,290
little girl ice cream and I I guess it's

00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:29,980
cool that they did that at the same time

00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:31,000
I think they I am biased obviously but

00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:33,190
it almost feels like they're trying to

00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,620
detract from a larger message so I want

00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:37,300
to talk about where does that fit in in

00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:39,040
the in the realm of fake news because

00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:40,930
I'm sure that happened I'm sure that's

00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:42,940
actually happened but I've seen people

00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:44,590
call it cop Buganda like where does

00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:49,060
propaganda fit in the whole fake news

00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:51,760
this discussion yeah really quickly

00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:54,970
because I know I just spoke so you know

00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:56,890
propaganda is one of the form one form

00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:58,330
of fake news you know I think those of

00:31:56,890 --> 00:32:00,520
us in this field like when we hear fake

00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:02,020
news were like what do you mean I'm

00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:03,460
talking about are you talking about this

00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:04,990
information they talking about this

00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:08,320
information are you talking about

00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:10,450
propaganda so propaganda is is on the

00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,590
spectrum of what we're talking about

00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:13,110
when we're talking about myths and

00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:15,720
disinformation and that's the

00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:18,460
straight-up point-blank it's propaganda

00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:21,370
and I think you know one of the reasons

00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:22,570
why witness exists not too much but one

00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:24,190
of the reasons we exist is so that

00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:25,930
people can tell their own stories and

00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:28,030
and and working on thinking about

00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:29,920
effective storytelling and if this is

00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:32,320
the whole situation the u.s. is such a

00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:34,000
good example where people are telling

00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:36,340
their own stories and there's they're

00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,400
saying what they experience of course

00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:41,770
the response is propaganda right and I

00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:43,810
think that the solutions propaganda are

00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:47,130
different but we do need to think of it

00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:53,410
as part of the spectrum of fake news

00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:56,320
yeah yeah I just wanted to jump in

00:32:53,410 --> 00:33:00,640
rapidly and to completely agree with

00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:04,360
what diya just said and saying that like

00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:06,909
Camille just introduced her her her

00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:08,739
speech by she said this is

00:33:06,909 --> 00:33:12,399
result of campaigns that have been

00:33:08,739 --> 00:33:14,859
organizing themselves for years and I

00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:17,679
feel that on the other side so those who

00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:20,619
are trying to really stupid back against

00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:24,149
this manipulations there needs to be as

00:33:20,619 --> 00:33:26,679
much organizing you know as much

00:33:24,149 --> 00:33:29,109
awareness around these issues and

00:33:26,679 --> 00:33:31,179
obviously there is a competitive

00:33:29,109 --> 00:33:33,279
disadvantage there because obviously we

00:33:31,179 --> 00:33:36,840
have less means I mean get the good

00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:39,639
people which is less means we have less

00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:41,950
so we have we have to catch up and I

00:33:39,639 --> 00:33:46,419
completely agree one way to go around

00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:48,909
this is to work with especially in

00:33:46,419 --> 00:33:51,309
communities even in the Western world in

00:33:48,909 --> 00:33:54,039
communities which are mostly affected by

00:33:51,309 --> 00:33:56,409
these problems work with them because

00:33:54,039 --> 00:33:58,779
when you work with them when you respect

00:33:56,409 --> 00:34:01,029
their work you empower them and you make

00:33:58,779 --> 00:34:05,229
them agents of free information that's

00:34:01,029 --> 00:34:07,840
what we did in we had a project and we

00:34:05,229 --> 00:34:11,049
have a project it's 2018 where we work

00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:15,460
with human rights defenders during the

00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:18,460
journalists and bloggers in in West and

00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:20,109
Central Africa first of all - because

00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:21,669
when you talk about disinformation it's

00:34:20,109 --> 00:34:23,440
not you know something obvious for

00:34:21,669 --> 00:34:25,119
everyone you know fake news is not a

00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,980
thing the same thinking is for everyone

00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:29,799
some fake news will be perceived well if

00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:31,599
it's information obviously so if there

00:34:29,799 --> 00:34:35,710
is there is an importance there - first

00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:37,389
of all help give people the tools to the

00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:40,329
conceptual tools I'm not talking about

00:34:37,389 --> 00:34:42,129
you know looking on Google image and all

00:34:40,329 --> 00:34:44,589
this but the conceptual tools you

00:34:42,129 --> 00:34:47,200
understand this is not normal when you

00:34:44,589 --> 00:34:49,720
see a publication which is I don't know

00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:52,240
incendiary or whatever there there's but

00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:54,819
there's some things that you have to to

00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:57,880
catch out there and to to make your own

00:34:54,819 --> 00:35:00,039
opinion and once you give people the

00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:02,109
tools they become they are empowered and

00:35:00,039 --> 00:35:03,849
they become agents against that and they

00:35:02,109 --> 00:35:06,339
understand the importance of doing that

00:35:03,849 --> 00:35:08,349
word and they themselves to some experts

00:35:06,339 --> 00:35:11,829
who can then be hired by you know local

00:35:08,349 --> 00:35:14,940
other other organizations so yes it's

00:35:11,829 --> 00:35:18,520
important to build alliances and to

00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:20,740
definitely empower just to finish on

00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:23,859
that I remember a report that was saying

00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:27,490
that in Germany for instance the the

00:35:23,859 --> 00:35:30,099
content by far-right movements were

00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:32,740
amplified I think I don't have to start

00:35:30,099 --> 00:35:35,770
sorry I forget that that won't be 100

00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:41,530
times more than content from you know

00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:43,390
set like more moderate sorry moderate

00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:45,609
parties political parties in Germany and

00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:48,070
the the the research showed that it's

00:35:45,609 --> 00:35:49,930
because thyroid components are

00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:52,060
organizing even beyond the borders of

00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:54,070
Germany so you have people from Hungary

00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:56,109
amplifying content from German

00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:58,150
politicians so yes there isn't that

00:35:56,109 --> 00:36:04,570
symmetry there that has to be worked on

00:35:58,150 --> 00:36:06,670
sorry we're going by the way because I

00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:09,700
think I made a really really important

00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:15,490
point and and I I just want to stress

00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:18,130
like how like to put it bluntly like our

00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:21,310
ability to fully understand the scope

00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:24,180
and complexity of disinformation it's

00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:26,940
the people who are publicly routinely

00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:32,490
researching it and exposing it are

00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:35,410
majority like white and US base is

00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:38,109
shocked like we will not we will not

00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:40,869
understand this problem properly if we

00:36:38,109 --> 00:36:43,780
don't discuss these structural issues of

00:36:40,869 --> 00:36:45,820
the fields and this isn't a new concept

00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:46,690
right like that's something that comes

00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:49,450
up all the time

00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:51,760
in other areas of security for instance

00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:53,770
if you look at cybersecurity reckonings

00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:55,630
the first time with the fact that most

00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:57,970
of these cyber security incidents that

00:36:55,630 --> 00:37:01,089
are being exposed are those that target

00:36:57,970 --> 00:37:03,369
the few people who are funded to be you

00:37:01,089 --> 00:37:05,800
know to be defendant right like here if

00:37:03,369 --> 00:37:09,099
we consider this information also as a

00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:10,750
security issue we have to consider the

00:37:09,099 --> 00:37:13,630
implication of how the field and

00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:16,359
structure and therefore how warped our

00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:19,810
own picture of the issue is going to be

00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:22,300
as results um it just wanted to amplify

00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:24,700
that message that I think them D Angele

00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:27,760
made it super clearly no I mean yeah

00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:28,839
definitely yeah Julie I like how you

00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:32,050
were talking before it about kind of

00:37:28,839 --> 00:37:33,490
actionable solutions that we could do so

00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:34,140
I want to talk kind of more about that

00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:36,749
because a fortune

00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:38,160
you know a lot of the reason this even

00:37:36,749 --> 00:37:40,019
happens it's kind of human this user

00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,910
error human error like it's on us the

00:37:40,019 --> 00:37:44,220
people sharing this stuff why the stuff

00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:46,640
like this catches on so like what are

00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:49,079
some things maybe like best practices

00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:50,809
individuals can do to maybe identify and

00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:56,970
mitigate the spread of misinformation

00:37:50,809 --> 00:37:59,299
and anyone can take that and I don't

00:37:56,970 --> 00:38:02,369
even have the cheesier on fake news

00:37:59,299 --> 00:38:09,239
Creative Media Award winning app settle

00:38:02,369 --> 00:38:11,400
maybe name and I was the answer sorry

00:38:09,239 --> 00:38:13,619
what was the last bit you said doesn't

00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:15,180
like some actionable solutions we can do

00:38:13,619 --> 00:38:17,970
this you know stop the spread of

00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:25,529
misinformation kind of spot faking these

00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:28,140
stories yeah yeah basically what the

00:38:25,529 --> 00:38:29,999
game was trying to say was to just

00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:32,039
scrutinize and use a bit better like you

00:38:29,999 --> 00:38:32,700
know who sent this message what's the

00:38:32,039 --> 00:38:34,470
source

00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:37,349
do I need to share it you know the very

00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:39,059
very basic things but actually chameleon

00:38:37,349 --> 00:38:41,730
something way more interesting to say

00:38:39,059 --> 00:38:43,859
earlier about you know what the actors

00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:46,200
and you know but it's you know putting

00:38:43,859 --> 00:38:48,630
the onus always on the person who shares

00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:50,099
but not really looking at like who are

00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:52,140
the content creators what do they have

00:38:50,099 --> 00:38:53,999
to benefit because it's a whole machine

00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:57,210
right like people benefit financially

00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:59,630
and socially and in every other way from

00:38:57,210 --> 00:39:02,579
this fake news and so only focusing on

00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:04,019
the individual who shares I feel is like

00:39:02,579 --> 00:39:06,599
looking through a very tiny lens and

00:39:04,019 --> 00:39:07,829
it's not a holistic approach to the

00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:09,089
whole fake they Camille I don't know if

00:39:07,829 --> 00:39:10,470
you want to jump back and I thought that

00:39:09,089 --> 00:39:11,759
was really interested and I realize it's

00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:15,869
a very tough question I'm asking you

00:39:11,759 --> 00:39:19,079
right now to solve fake news all fake

00:39:15,869 --> 00:39:21,019
news on the spot Camille no I think I

00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:26,819
really relate to what you just said like

00:39:21,019 --> 00:39:31,319
we have sometimes tendency to put it

00:39:26,819 --> 00:39:33,059
back on people right and at least in you

00:39:31,319 --> 00:39:35,509
know in my work I tend to focus more

00:39:33,059 --> 00:39:38,430
like what are the other structural

00:39:35,509 --> 00:39:40,710
responses like what part of this is not

00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:42,480
on people and I think it you know it

00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:44,130
comes from having spent a lot of time

00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,499
working on foreign interference for

00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:47,620
instance where specific people specific

00:39:46,499 --> 00:39:51,190
communities are target

00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:53,110
with really sophisticated campaigns and

00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:54,670
then you know when you work with people

00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:56,440
who've been targeted to eat they always

00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:58,810
ask you like what should I have done

00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:01,060
differently when should I have caught

00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:02,920
this and in reality most of the time

00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:04,900
like this is not on them right like this

00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:06,970
is a this is a full of society

00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:09,130
responsibility as Julie said there are a

00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:10,480
lot of government implications and

00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:13,540
responsibilities there there's a lot of

00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:15,820
platform responsibilities there so I'm

00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:17,560
not at all discounting the you know the

00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:19,390
important work that's being done on best

00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:20,740
practices what people can do the type of

00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:22,780
question they can ask Mike and this

00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:25,270
great work on those first drafts or I

00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:28,210
have great guides on you know on like

00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:30,070
how to talk to people around you clear

00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:32,680
fair Wordle has this great sentence

00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:34,390
about like stop muting your uncle engage

00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:36,580
right like here's the things that you

00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:39,900
should engagement but you know at the

00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:42,580
same time a lot of this isn't on

00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:45,610
individuals and communities online a lot

00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:47,260
of this is on on more powerful

00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:50,500
structures including governments and

00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:53,950
platforms to to tackle and handle if I

00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:56,560
can just jump back in personally I am so

00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:59,080
annoyed with YouTube ads like I don't

00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:01,000
know why the last week I've been driving

00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:04,540
me mad like the double ads at the start

00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,740
of every video is I'm so infuriated but

00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:07,180
I think that this comes back to the

00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:09,550
whole structure of the internet based on

00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:11,800
ads all of this like at least in Uganda

00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:13,900
a high proportion of the nonsense I see

00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:15,760
is click babes they just want you to go

00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:17,680
and click on it's too late the one that

00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:19,780
always gets me is like Uganda is no

00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:22,060
longer need pieces for the US that

00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:23,470
always pops up I'm like why would that

00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:25,750
happen why would that be the case

00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:27,400
anyways is this whole structure of the

00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:31,420
internet based on ads and can we just

00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:33,700
please have another model of like this

00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:35,920
is the quiet worth I plug Firefox is

00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:37,750
like ad blocking or something no I mean

00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:40,000
you're definitely right you're

00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:41,800
definitely right dear how do we stop how

00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:46,870
does the government stop racist uncle's

00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:51,220
from their crazy racist uncle posts the

00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:53,140
government it was not designed us I mean

00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:57,340
who how do we stop how do we how do we

00:41:53,140 --> 00:42:01,339
how do we period it how do we I mean I

00:41:57,340 --> 00:42:02,479
think if you look at for example like

00:42:01,339 --> 00:42:05,809
rate of a house reports from the last

00:42:02,479 --> 00:42:08,210
few years fake news laws are being used

00:42:05,809 --> 00:42:10,339
to silence people I I don't think I

00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:13,099
would be as clearly curious if any of my

00:42:10,339 --> 00:42:15,410
panelists have an example where they've

00:42:13,099 --> 00:42:18,619
heard of a fake news or misinformation

00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:21,890
law actually being used to stop really

00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:23,420
really dangerous virulent content that

00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:25,190
is results like you know throwing an

00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:27,319
election or resulting in the spread of

00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:30,140
coronavirus or encouraging violence

00:42:27,319 --> 00:42:30,589
against people that is that example may

00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:34,489
exist

00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:36,849
but I have not heard it I mean I think

00:42:34,489 --> 00:42:40,130
in the structure that we're in right now

00:42:36,849 --> 00:42:42,140
I think it's you know one of the things

00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:43,819
that I continue to keep trying to do is

00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:45,019
really get companies to talk to the

00:42:43,819 --> 00:42:47,319
right people but they actually

00:42:45,019 --> 00:42:50,180
understand what they're talking about

00:42:47,319 --> 00:42:52,519
who it's affecting and what they need to

00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:55,779
do and and so that we can see ultimately

00:42:52,519 --> 00:42:58,460
if like the faceless think it's okay if

00:42:55,779 --> 00:43:00,829
violence happens because of the post if

00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:02,989
they're doing it in in service of free

00:43:00,829 --> 00:43:05,059
expression you know great then show us

00:43:02,989 --> 00:43:07,759
that so that we can know I mean it's not

00:43:05,059 --> 00:43:09,259
great but but phones are being pushed

00:43:07,759 --> 00:43:12,460
right now to sort of show their colors

00:43:09,259 --> 00:43:13,999
and you know I don't think that

00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:16,009
unfortunately I don't think the

00:43:13,999 --> 00:43:17,299
government are going to have the

00:43:16,009 --> 00:43:18,920
solutions to this problem they might

00:43:17,299 --> 00:43:21,499
have solutions to companies and how

00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:23,269
companies operate but that's a different

00:43:21,499 --> 00:43:24,469
with a whole different panel especially

00:43:23,269 --> 00:43:26,150
and I want to reiterate they know that

00:43:24,469 --> 00:43:27,769
people have said this government or some

00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:29,029
of the biggest purveyors of some of the

00:43:27,769 --> 00:43:33,499
most dangerous myths and misinformation

00:43:29,029 --> 00:43:36,619
out there oh yeah I mean going off of

00:43:33,499 --> 00:43:40,519
that I think back to yesterday's big day

00:43:36,619 --> 00:43:43,880
and you know the Trump you know not play

00:43:40,519 --> 00:43:45,769
nice with like online services like how

00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:47,299
do we next time when there's someone in

00:43:45,769 --> 00:43:50,749
the office like Trump how do we make

00:43:47,299 --> 00:43:52,700
sure he isn't you know change doesn't

00:43:50,749 --> 00:43:54,049
come in the in the 11th hour to last

00:43:52,700 --> 00:44:01,009
minute is there anything we can do for

00:43:54,049 --> 00:44:03,380
that I can jump in I think it's Rebecca

00:44:01,009 --> 00:44:08,599
McKeon who is one of the first who said

00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:11,599
we need to we need a Democratic base a

00:44:08,599 --> 00:44:14,240
democracy base Internet in an Internet

00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:17,150
based on democratic principles you know

00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:20,330
we checks and balances included so even

00:44:17,150 --> 00:44:22,490
if because I understand of course

00:44:20,330 --> 00:44:24,680
platforms have to do something but whose

00:44:22,490 --> 00:44:27,310
checks to make sure the platform are

00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:30,050
doing the right thing in the right way

00:44:27,310 --> 00:44:31,609
I'm probably not the best person place

00:44:30,050 --> 00:44:33,980
to talk about how this checks and

00:44:31,609 --> 00:44:37,130
balances should work but I hope I hope

00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:39,230
this is one way one of what one one

00:44:37,130 --> 00:44:41,900
aspect that is part of the conversation

00:44:39,230 --> 00:44:45,920
how could we make sure that anybody who

00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:48,530
is you know considered as part of the

00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:50,390
answer can be checked by other oversight

00:44:48,530 --> 00:44:52,970
and other you know techs and balance

00:44:50,390 --> 00:44:55,310
assistants and including governments

00:44:52,970 --> 00:44:58,970
when we when you were discussing earlier

00:44:55,310 --> 00:45:01,040
the the wealth solutions and mentioning

00:44:58,970 --> 00:45:03,500
regulatory solutions that have been

00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:06,170
adopted recently by government of course

00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:09,260
all of them are I call them lane laws

00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:11,720
because they just come like too late and

00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:14,599
you know they want to fix rapidly things

00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:16,670
like magical you had Facebook to take

00:45:14,599 --> 00:45:19,130
down content 24 hours and it's gonna

00:45:16,670 --> 00:45:21,890
solve the problem absolutely not

00:45:19,130 --> 00:45:24,500
and that's not even me saying that that

00:45:21,890 --> 00:45:29,180
there was a Accord the Constitutional

00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:31,910
Court of a friend recently declared that

00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:33,980
the law the newly adopted law a hate

00:45:31,910 --> 00:45:37,580
speech law which was proposed by the

00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:41,109
government was unconstitutional at least

00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:43,640
in the in in the provisions that act for

00:45:41,109 --> 00:45:46,119
platforms to take down containing 24

00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:49,280
hours without the oversight of a judge

00:45:46,119 --> 00:45:53,240
and threatening them with two hundred

00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:55,310
and fifty thousand dollar fine every

00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:56,900
time they don't comply but that's

00:45:55,310 --> 00:45:58,640
absolutely named it doesn't solve the

00:45:56,900 --> 00:46:00,859
problem and what's even more lame with

00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:02,420
this legislation is that they don't they

00:46:00,859 --> 00:46:06,589
don't work with civil society

00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:08,420
organizations which are the ones we are

00:46:06,589 --> 00:46:11,210
the ones who have been seeing all these

00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:14,300
problems for years even before it became

00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:17,540
a thing after Trump was elected so I

00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:19,520
think we have a clue on what are what

00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:22,550
what does hate and disinformation look

00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:24,080
like in the different you know settings

00:46:22,550 --> 00:46:25,220
where we work and that's something

00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:27,020
that's missing from the conversation

00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:27,780
usually what governments will do that

00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:29,280
they will wake up

00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:31,050
they will say we need to regulate so

00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:33,840
we're gonna Simone Facebook Twitter and

00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:36,690
yeah we're gonna decide a bit like I was

00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:38,700
part of that and that's why I think I

00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:40,890
can criticize a bit like what happened

00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:44,280
with the Christ to Christ Church call

00:46:40,890 --> 00:46:46,470
which was convened by the French and the

00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:48,690
New Zealand government and there was a

00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:50,820
lot of frustration on the place that was

00:46:48,690 --> 00:46:52,740
given at least at the beginning to civil

00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:56,310
society organizations who were just I

00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:57,810
felt like I was just for you know to say

00:46:56,310 --> 00:46:59,940
that we consulted at some point with

00:46:57,810 --> 00:47:02,100
them so that was very frustrating and I

00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:04,710
hope governments I want to regulate on

00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:07,620
that will give more place and give more

00:47:04,710 --> 00:47:09,240
credit to what organizations and not

00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:12,090
only organization citizens and experts

00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:15,330
have to say on these matters the other

00:47:12,090 --> 00:47:20,520
thing that could be one way to go about

00:47:15,330 --> 00:47:24,060
this as a solution is so platforms rely

00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:26,970
on automated content moderation and

00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:29,130
we've seen that very strikingly with Co

00:47:26,970 --> 00:47:33,270
big crisis since all the human

00:47:29,130 --> 00:47:37,590
moderators were to stay home like

00:47:33,270 --> 00:47:40,620
everybody else and the problem with

00:47:37,590 --> 00:47:42,180
moderation other major moderation is of

00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:44,940
course other moderation automated

00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:46,920
moderation itself but also that this

00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:48,930
automated moderation doesn't understand

00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:51,540
a lot of things including of course

00:47:48,930 --> 00:47:54,450
context but beyond context languages and

00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:57,960
one thing that we we hope to be able and

00:47:54,450 --> 00:48:00,300
that but I'm working on at the Berkman

00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:03,030
Klein and also at the digital to the

00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:05,460
site's lab at Stanford is how can we

00:48:03,030 --> 00:48:07,650
make sure that these automated system

00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:10,980
automated moderation system understand

00:48:07,650 --> 00:48:12,570
all the language as possible at least in

00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:13,890
our case you're focusing on Western

00:48:12,570 --> 00:48:15,630
Central Africa

00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:17,280
how can we make sure that they

00:48:15,630 --> 00:48:18,900
understand not only the languages but

00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:20,580
that they understand the context that

00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:23,550
they understand that if for instance in

00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:25,500
XYZ country this person which has two

00:48:23,550 --> 00:48:28,140
million people followers saying this

00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:30,240
type say this type of things in this

00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:32,940
type of event this should trigger your

00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:36,510
attention not ten days after but before

00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:38,640
so that's a it exists elsewhere I

00:48:36,510 --> 00:48:39,810
remember when I when I was in Paris

00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:42,390
during the attacks

00:48:39,810 --> 00:48:44,130
I barely remember seeing a horrible

00:48:42,390 --> 00:48:45,960
images and I'm thankful for that because

00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:47,790
it would have been very traumatizing it

00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:49,860
was already of traumatizing event would

00:48:47,790 --> 00:48:51,770
have been even more if we were to see

00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:55,260
horrible images of what was happening

00:48:51,770 --> 00:48:57,540
but this happens every day in Cameroon

00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:59,730
there is a war I cannot name a single

00:48:57,540 --> 00:49:01,890
day when I haven't seen a corpse the MA

00:48:59,730 --> 00:49:05,070
image of a corpse that's traumatizing

00:49:01,890 --> 00:49:08,700
it's a red it's on top of a Troma that's

00:49:05,070 --> 00:49:11,370
already existing so classrooms have to

00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:13,230
be more proactive but to do that they

00:49:11,370 --> 00:49:15,510
have to where they cannot you know say

00:49:13,230 --> 00:49:17,970
we will do it on ourselves you cannot do

00:49:15,510 --> 00:49:20,640
it on yourself from London or you know

00:49:17,970 --> 00:49:22,320
San Francisco elsewhere you need to work

00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:23,970
with people who are 10,000 kilometres

00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:26,760
from where you are because there they

00:49:23,970 --> 00:49:29,940
know and you have to do it not when the

00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:33,750
crisis happens but before it becomes a

00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:35,220
crisis that's true anyone else want to

00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:37,050
chime in on that I want to take one last

00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:42,600
question but I want to make room for

00:49:37,050 --> 00:49:44,760
anyone who want to speak on that yeah

00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:46,050
well we're almost out of time I didn't

00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:48,600
want to end the panel without taking at

00:49:46,050 --> 00:49:50,550
least one viewer question so this one

00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:53,160
comes from YouTube from Christopher

00:49:50,550 --> 00:49:54,930
Lawrence yes which will be a final

00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:57,120
question what is the role of web media

00:49:54,930 --> 00:49:58,680
literacy here it feels like these skills

00:49:57,120 --> 00:50:01,380
need to be worked on with young minds to

00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:04,130
grow critical consumers what do you guys

00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:04,130
think about that

00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:12,660
that's when Christopher Lawrence on

00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:15,210
YouTube yeah I think it's I think it's

00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:17,820
very vital I think a lot of these mmm

00:50:15,210 --> 00:50:19,920
these skills like like media literacy

00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:22,410
digital literacy digital security I

00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:26,150
would love to see this you know being a

00:50:22,410 --> 00:50:30,300
part of primary school curricula across

00:50:26,150 --> 00:50:32,460
the continent you know so you know even

00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:35,100
as young as we've done some research for

00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:36,930
example on gender-based violence and

00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:38,640
we're seeing this happening at younger

00:50:36,930 --> 00:50:40,110
and younger ages and so that's why I'm

00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:42,180
advocating that this has to happen as

00:50:40,110 --> 00:50:43,920
young as formal school you know even

00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:46,050
just when you're 10 and I think that's

00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:48,420
so vital for countries to put that into

00:50:46,050 --> 00:50:50,190
the education system but from what I've

00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:51,730
seen so far that would make very little

00:50:50,190 --> 00:50:53,650
headway and I do

00:50:51,730 --> 00:50:57,390
examples where this is actually

00:50:53,650 --> 00:51:02,170
happening where this is in place I

00:50:57,390 --> 00:51:04,030
remember an example in in France

00:51:02,170 --> 00:51:07,089
actually where the government had a

00:51:04,030 --> 00:51:12,130
program in high schools in which

00:51:07,089 --> 00:51:14,950
teachers would dedicate some time every

00:51:12,130 --> 00:51:17,200
week to debunking how to how to how to

00:51:14,950 --> 00:51:20,290
receive information from the internet

00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:22,240
and I think that was I don't have the

00:51:20,290 --> 00:51:23,740
stats so I don't know if that was a big

00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:33,609
success but I thought it was an

00:51:23,740 --> 00:51:44,140
interesting example Duke milli last

00:51:33,609 --> 00:51:47,859
thoughts well I guess more media

00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:50,200
literacy and even I think these even

00:51:47,859 --> 00:51:55,109
before that maybe just like critical

00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:57,310
thinking you see on the Internet and

00:51:55,109 --> 00:51:58,990
actually this is not too bad of a note

00:51:57,310 --> 00:52:00,190
that end done because I think I've been

00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:02,710
sort of plugging the point the whole

00:52:00,190 --> 00:52:04,420
channel that the Internet is the real

00:52:02,710 --> 00:52:06,640
world like because almost doesn't make

00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:08,380
sense to say real world online offline

00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:10,270
anymore because it is the real world and

00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:13,869
so I think critical thinking skills that

00:52:10,270 --> 00:52:16,420
are taught in general what content

00:52:13,869 --> 00:52:20,800
you're consuming and you probably help

00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:25,119
with with this more broadly oh I'll make

00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:26,950
an unpopular point and I think and it

00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:29,109
started making it earlier like of course

00:52:26,950 --> 00:52:30,970
I think media literacy is great and I

00:52:29,109 --> 00:52:32,560
think that there are parts of media

00:52:30,970 --> 00:52:36,369
literacy that should be widely taught

00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:39,880
and much more but I but I also do

00:52:36,369 --> 00:52:42,910
sincerely think that if we overemphasize

00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:45,790
this as a response to the complexity of

00:52:42,910 --> 00:52:48,160
what's happening we're not doing the job

00:52:45,790 --> 00:52:49,780
of protecting the people who are in the

00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:52,420
receiving end of something that you

00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:54,160
don't get out of with more training

00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:57,069
knowledge right so if you think France

00:52:54,160 --> 00:53:00,590
is about targeted online harassment and

00:52:57,069 --> 00:53:04,190
mobs in campaigns no amount of you

00:53:00,590 --> 00:53:07,850
Media literacy alleviates the pain and

00:53:04,190 --> 00:53:10,700
violence that the targets of online hate

00:53:07,850 --> 00:53:12,350
bombs are experiencing and and here we

00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:15,010
kind of you know need the more

00:53:12,350 --> 00:53:19,910
enforcement centric or regulatory

00:53:15,010 --> 00:53:21,590
responses so I say I think media

00:53:19,910 --> 00:53:25,250
literacy almost has to come hand-in-hand

00:53:21,590 --> 00:53:26,650
with parts of the solution that yeah

00:53:25,250 --> 00:53:32,270

00:53:26,650 --> 00:53:34,760

00:53:32,270 --> 00:53:37,520
