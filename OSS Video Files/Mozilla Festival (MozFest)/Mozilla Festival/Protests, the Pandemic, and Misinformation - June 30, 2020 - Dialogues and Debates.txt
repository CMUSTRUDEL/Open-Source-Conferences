Title: Protests, the Pandemic, and Misinformation - June 30, 2020 - Dialogues and Debates
Publication date: 2020-09-29
Playlist: Mozilla Festival
Description: 
	The latest installment of Mozilla’s Dialogues & Debates series will explore mis- and disinformation related to COVID-19 and racial justice protests

As millions of people around the world continue to shelter from the pandemic, internet platforms can keep us connected. These same platforms can also help people organize the ongoing protests for racial justice, sparked by George Floyd's killing.

But these platforms and the content that they amplify can also harm us. Fake cures, conspiracy theories about the pandemic’s origins, and fast-spreading, racist disinformation have become the status quo.

Why can’t we trust online platforms when we need them most? What are platforms doing to address the spread of mis- and disinformation? And which communities are most impacted by this problem?

On Tuesday, June 30, Mozilla will host a virtual Dialogues & Debates to answer these questions and a host of others. The conversation is slated for 11 a.m. ET, and you can submit questions ahead of time by tweeting @mozilla with the hashtag #DialoguesAndDebates.
