okay next up you've already seen him on

00:00:02,429 --> 00:00:05,819
Ashley's video we have Matt Mitchell who

00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:20,699
needs little introduction after that

00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:22,560
video on August 27 2015 I got a phone

00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:27,599
call that woke me up in the mill the

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:31,369
night it was at 3:30 in the morning on

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:34,770
the other line was a frantic panicked

00:00:31,369 --> 00:00:38,250
activist who I had met in events like

00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:41,670
this they said Matt did you get the

00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:47,239
email I looked at my phone as a million

00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:52,550
messages in signal and it said emergency

00:00:47,239 --> 00:00:54,480
really need help what had happened was

00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:57,480
someone had taken over their Twitter

00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:00,930
account and at the same time their

00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:04,409
organization's website went down and at

00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:06,479
the same time I looked at a 4chan and

00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:11,670
reddit and I'm seeing information about

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:15,390
this person it's a digital attack they

00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:18,689
didn't know what to do how many people

00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:19,950
here have a plan what would you do if

00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:21,330
you have an organization that's trying

00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:23,880
to do some social good or something

00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:26,640
aggressive and hoping the Internet who

00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:30,500
was a plan show of hands they didn't

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:35,390
know what they would do anyone no one I

00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:35,390
can't see you know the bright light okay

00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:41,400
I'm going to talk to you about what you

00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:44,159
need to do when this happens I'm gonna

00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,810
give you six things that when you leave

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,590
here you won't be that person you have a

00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:52,049
line but let me rewind a little bit let

00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:54,899
me answer like why I would even get that

00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:57,780
call why would they call me you know I'm

00:01:54,899 --> 00:02:02,100
a hacker but it takes a hacker to catch

00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:05,159
a hacker and unlike my brethren I work

00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:06,869
with NGOs and nonprofits and people who

00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:09,060
are part of civil society trying to make

00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:11,580
this world a better place you know

00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,540
through crypto parties and events like

00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,879
that and

00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:17,250
training's and cities and countries all

00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:19,049
over this world I go where activists are

00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:22,409
to help them dealing with situations

00:02:19,049 --> 00:02:24,569
that happen right and through that

00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:26,790
experience I see a lot you know I was

00:02:24,569 --> 00:02:30,000
given a fellowship open web fellowship

00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:32,310
by Mozilla and Ford Foundation and they

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,650
put me at this civil rights organization

00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:36,870
I was my host organization called Color

00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:39,599
of Change in the United States and in

00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:40,790
that time I worked to kind of like

00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,780
strengthen their digital security

00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:44,370
strengthen their digital safety and

00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,569
that's where I came up with like these

00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:48,599
kind of six tenants that I'm sharing

00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:50,939
with you this is a the thing that can

00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:52,859
protect you from losing everything you

00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:54,900
know all the work that you try to do is

00:02:52,859 --> 00:02:57,359
gone when someone takes all your emails

00:02:54,900 --> 00:03:02,790
takes all your data and harasses your

00:02:57,359 --> 00:03:09,500
staff okay so the first thing number one

00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:12,780
on the list is to really think about

00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:15,389
what are we what are we doing for safety

00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:17,519
of our our team you know like are some

00:03:15,389 --> 00:03:19,590
people out to a new place so they could

00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,799
feel safe so you can um so you can begin

00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:31,260
you know then you can kind of start with

00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:33,569
the more digital stuff it'll have a

00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:35,970
security policy what is a security

00:03:33,569 --> 00:03:37,530
policy you know you can think of it kind

00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:39,569
of like to begin with as the things that

00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:40,650
you're already doing to to be kind of

00:03:39,569 --> 00:03:42,359
digitally safe you know you might have

00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:44,099
an organization and you know everyone

00:03:42,359 --> 00:03:46,079
has a password on their laptop maybe

00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:47,099
that's what the policy begins write down

00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:48,870
those things that you think that

00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:51,180
everyone's doing and find out if

00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:52,829
everyone really is by working with

00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:54,989
people and your organization might be a

00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:56,669
huge you know nonprofit that has an

00:03:54,989 --> 00:03:57,810
office or it might just be a group

00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:58,379
people who meet in the living room every

00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:01,109
couple of weeks

00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:03,060
right but you you you do have something

00:04:01,109 --> 00:04:05,159
that you already do and kind of like

00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,540
institutionalize that and broadcast that

00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:08,099
you'll realize that like not everyone

00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:09,930
actually does these things you know Oh

00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:11,579
everyone has a password on there but you

00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:15,359
know the computer like I don't but now

00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:16,949
you do once you do that you can build up

00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:18,239
on that you know you can add things to

00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:20,220
it like we're all gonna secure our

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:22,469
communications with a encrypted

00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:24,779
messaging app like signal or a three

00:04:22,469 --> 00:04:25,750
month you know or telegram but if you

00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:27,520
don't have that list there's

00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:29,890
thing for you sometimes I get called to

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,820
help an organization and I'm like what

00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:32,380
are you doing right now

00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:34,120
so let me like try to like rule out some

00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:35,740
things and no one knows what everyone's

00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,140
doing and it takes a lot of time and

00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:39,880
money to get to that place okay so get

00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:41,290
that kind of policy there write down

00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,720
those things the things that you know

00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:45,850
that everyone is like complying 95 or

00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:48,970
100 percent in doing and then add things

00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:51,430
slowly to it okay the second thing I

00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:54,790
would say is you know to be digitally

00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:58,240
safe as an organization you need to

00:04:54,790 --> 00:05:00,730
think about a checklist you know a list

00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:03,280
of like what would I do if an incident

00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:05,230
happened it's a matter of time before

00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,490
something happens it might be small but

00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:08,560
you should have exactly what you would

00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:09,970
do you decide on it if our Twitter

00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,560
account gets like taking over we're

00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:14,020
gonna do these steps in this order you

00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:16,120
know if it appears that someone else is

00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:17,680
writing an email you know acting like

00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,320
they're us we would do these things in

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,669
this order and that checklist is given

00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,280
out to everyone who works with the

00:05:21,669 --> 00:05:26,320
organization you know this way when they

00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:28,000
notice something they feel empowered to

00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,680
just pull it out and just do the things

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,030
they don't have to worry like well

00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,200
should I really be talking to this

00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:34,060
person who's higher up in the

00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,680
organization or Who am I to say that we

00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:38,710
should like stop doing these things you

00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:41,979
know that checklist is what really saves

00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:43,300
people you know I've had clients who

00:05:41,979 --> 00:05:44,710
come to me and they have that list and

00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:46,750
I'm like okay great did you follow

00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:49,840
they're like yes what we do not have to

00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:51,340
worry about a lot of things you know so

00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,320
you can think of that as kind of like an

00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:55,030
incident response plan if this incident

00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:58,419
happens this is what our always our

00:05:55,030 --> 00:06:02,830
response will be right the third thing

00:05:58,419 --> 00:06:04,660
on this list of of six things is have a

00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:06,850
data retention policy so I can email

00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:09,310
retention policy what is that exactly

00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:11,140
you can think of it as you know you

00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:13,960
don't keep all your money in your home

00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:15,310
you don't keep all your cash right there

00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,840
laying on a counter table right you put

00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:18,850
some here you put some there same thing

00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:20,320
for your data if I'm telling you that

00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:22,090
it's inevitable someone's gonna get into

00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,530
your inbox the first email they see

00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:27,250
shouldn't be welcome to this email

00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:28,990
account right they'll be able to take

00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:31,450
everything from you if everything's in

00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:32,860
one place so those older things that are

00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:34,180
falling out of fancy and they're just

00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:36,820
there you do a search and they're kind

00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:38,470
of in the way archive them move them off

00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,990
you know you don't need to delete them

00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:40,700
get

00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:42,710
out of the way whether that's email

00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:44,570
whether it's a database nature of

00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:46,100
keeping of people you work with you know

00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:48,110
I remember I was working with an

00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:50,600
organization that work with undocumented

00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:53,500
people refugees and immigrants people

00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:55,640
whose very identity or is at risk

00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:57,590
keeping a database of those people's

00:06:55,640 --> 00:07:00,290
names every person you've ever worked

00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:01,880
with forever is not a good idea so again

00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:05,840
this data retention is retiring some

00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:08,870
things moving them away the fourth thing

00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,700
you can think of is you know there's a

00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:11,990
weakest link policy kind of like you

00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:13,670
know some weakest link thing going on

00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:16,610
when it comes to digital safety and

00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:18,620
security if you are you know a

00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:20,510
journalist and you're working on a very

00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:22,910
dangerous beat or you know you're

00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:24,590
working on investigations you probably

00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:27,080
have all this stuff taken care of you

00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:29,660
know you do all the things so a hacker

00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:31,460
is not gonna target you you know you're

00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:32,240
getting paid for getting the job done

00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:34,850
fast

00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,260
you're gonna target the intern you know

00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:38,750
you're going to target someone who's

00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:41,210
just there as a volunteer you know so

00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:42,950
those people all people need to be

00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:44,890
protected just not just like you know

00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:47,600
these five people are the most at risk

00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:49,370
it's like a herd immunity you know one

00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,080
person in the office is sick everyone

00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:54,110
gets sick same thing happens in this

00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:55,970
case so understand this weakest link you

00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:57,890
know the actual security of your

00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:59,480
organization is equal to the person that

00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:06,760
does the least that's what you really

00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:10,910
are another thing you can think about is

00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:12,320
changing the onboarding right you bring

00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:13,730
someone into the organization they get

00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,920
interviewed they're super excited they

00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:17,420
want to do a great job for you at this

00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:20,000
point you introduce things that no one

00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:22,040
else is doing you know we do this for

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,960
security you know we make sure that

00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:26,240
everyone has their password set up this

00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:27,440
way they use a password manager everyone

00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,450
has to use this app or their messaging

00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,680
each other the new person wants to do a

00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:32,000
good job and that person is going to

00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:34,400
actually do this stuff and then you

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,980
begin organizational change one person

00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:38,570
at a time from these new people you

00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:40,550
change your off-boarding when someone

00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:43,220
leaves the organization you know you say

00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:45,680
hey what do you have the keys to what

00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:47,000
what do the Twitter password do you do

00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,530
we have a share that we shared out to

00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,180
you you know was there a day in an

00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:51,920
emergency that we kind of like quickly

00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,880
here's the document get it to this

00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,340
person while they're at the

00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,560
report did you know that better than any

00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:59,780
one person who's leaving ask that person

00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:01,520
right ask them and then you'll be able

00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:03,830
to mitigate a lot of harm

00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:05,780
sometimes I go up to a place and they'll

00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:08,390
get we've been sharing tons of documents

00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:10,400
on this you know third party like Google

00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:11,480
service or something like that and I'm

00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,980
like well who are these people

00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:15,440
oh I didn't realize they're still there

00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:20,660
you know it's important to you to kind

00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:24,050
of stop this and I think he's trying to

00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:25,970
make sure another thing that I tell

00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:28,820
people is to come a last thing right to

00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:30,830
be digitally safe is you know when

00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:33,110
you're running from a disaster like that

00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:34,310
you know a nuclear bomb goes off you're

00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:37,130
gonna go to their like bunker and just

00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:40,010
hint just hang out there right Iger

00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:41,180
can't good and wait it out right you

00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:42,590
need to do the same thing in your

00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:45,740
organization because a nuclear bomb

00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:47,540
could be you know you're the people who

00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:49,850
directly fund you they get hacked and or

00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:50,990
your financial data gets broadcasted all

00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:53,810
across the internet cuz these things

00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:56,390
have happened right so test out this

00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:58,010
bunker practice you know I literally

00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:59,600
tell people take a shoebox and write

00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:01,430
down some incidents of things that have

00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,110
happened or could happen maybe there's

00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:04,160
an internet shutdown where you are maybe

00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:06,650
you all of a sudden this app that you

00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,540
use you know goes offline for three days

00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:11,570
right what would we do in this scenario

00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:12,560
you spend an hour a month just talking

00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:14,150
about these inch you know these

00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,730
incidents these issues how would you

00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:18,710
deal with them you institutionalize this

00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:21,200
thing so the time when you have to do it

00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:22,790
you have a sense of being there and you

00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,650
kind of know what you would do the

00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:27,830
anxiety has been lowered and you have

00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:30,110
some hope these are the secrets these

00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:32,630
are the the key is that through years

00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:35,180
and years of helping people I found and

00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:37,310
I think it's so important for for people

00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:39,850
to kind of instill that and use it in

00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:42,530
their organization to be digitally safe

00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:44,270
and I think yeah that's that I would

00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:45,770
like to kind of open up for questions I

00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:48,260
think questions are really important you

00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:49,340
know so whether it's about the things I

00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:53,260
spoke about or anything about your

00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:53,260
digital safety and security thank you

00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:04,110
don't have a question for Matt on the

00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:05,010
front row here front row on a shout and

00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:09,840
he'll repeat the question

00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:12,360
no gold shirt today sorry thanks thanks

00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:14,130
for the tips very very useful so one of

00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,900
them was to develop checklists for what

00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:17,460
you do in different situations

00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,900
I mean how should you figure out what

00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:21,210
the items on your checklist should be

00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:23,040
exactly I would not tell you to talk to

00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:25,260
someone like myself because it has to be

00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:28,590
something that you actually do right so

00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:29,520
you just pretend pretend the Twitter

00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:31,500
account has taken over

00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:35,400
what would you do maybe you just like

00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:36,930
freaked that you know FL right so after

00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,760
that there's someone you would call

00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:40,530
maybe you would contact Twitter you'll

00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:43,410
realize that that's not really a good

00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:45,300
option right but in that time you'll

00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:48,000
come up with things that will actually

00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:49,260
end up on this list and then maybe

00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,400
you'll have someone like myself or

00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,780
someone who's like you know the nerd in

00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:54,240
your world to give them some you know

00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:55,950
caffeine or human contact right and then

00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,530
let them know like take a look at this

00:11:55,950 --> 00:12:00,240
does this look sound to you that is my

00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:01,560
best advice because if you go to a

00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,360
website and you're like this is what you

00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:05,070
should do I guarantee you that is not

00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,200
what you will do when it really happens

00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:14,910
it's outside of your your normal logic

00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:15,840
okay so thank you next question thanks

00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:18,450
very much so it's really useful

00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:20,610
wondering if you're not necessarily in

00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:22,200
that I can ngo yeah as in it's not like

00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:23,180
a formal structure but it's like

00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,620
volunteer-led

00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:27,060
that kind of thing yeah how'd you get

00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,800
people on board because you don't really

00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:30,270
have onboarding and off-boarding like

00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,820
that yeah yeah yeah I know I mean so

00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:34,500
how'd you how'd you get people to get

00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:36,210
involved with all of these like secure

00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:38,580
messaging all of that yeah totally you

00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:40,590
know I come from a coda hip hop kind of

00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:41,580
punk rock tradition you know like 500

00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:44,490
people trying to have a consensus

00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:46,110
meeting right you know there's no

00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:47,400
onboarding you know this person wants to

00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:48,450
work you know everyone in this room

00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:52,140
probably knows someone who cares about

00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:53,850
an issue so you tell them you know this

00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:55,890
thing that we care about so we're

00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:58,530
donating our time and our energy to try

00:12:55,890 --> 00:13:00,510
to do it we're putting that at risk by

00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:03,000
not being safe because there's a tug of

00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:04,710
war we do this stuff that it's right we

00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,420
do this stuff because it's good but

00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:08,430
every time we have a little win some

00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:09,720
a little loss and every time we have a

00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:12,240
huge win we did it

00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:14,639
someone has a huge loss and that person

00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,860
is not used to losing and they would use

00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,600
everything in their power to make that

00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:20,279
not happen again you might not even

00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:23,459
realize that you are a thorn in the side

00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:25,260
of someone very powerful you are so

00:13:23,459 --> 00:13:27,810
close to and you know in making real

00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:30,690
change happen let them know that that's

00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:32,550
at risk and I you know in those spaces

00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:33,839
trust me that becomes super serious

00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:35,490
they're like I'm looking out for the

00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:46,440
person to my left and right and for this

00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:49,290
huge mission hi there I work for an

00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,760
organization where security and sort of

00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:51,990
these conversations and policies are

00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:56,130
very separate from our day-to-day

00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:58,110
operations and instead of a general like

00:13:56,130 --> 00:14:00,449
so that type of lack of knowledge can

00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:01,949
sometimes generate paranoia but on the

00:14:00,449 --> 00:14:03,389
other end of the spectrum there's sort

00:14:01,949 --> 00:14:05,579
of like your head in the sand like

00:14:03,389 --> 00:14:07,380
complete denial yeah yeah yeah so how do

00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:09,329
you introduce this type of conversation

00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:13,560
not to spark paranoia but to sort of

00:14:09,329 --> 00:14:16,050
spark at that type of curiosity force of

00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:17,370
conversations with folks who are like I

00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:20,550
haven't really thought about that that

00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:22,410
could never happen to us okay well the

00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:23,940
first thing you want to do is anyone

00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:25,019
anyone no matter who you are no matter

00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:26,959
what that were you are in that

00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:32,070
organization right long as you care

00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:33,990
you'll just say look sometimes there's a

00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:35,730
security person or there's a nerd you

00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:37,769
know that's the Nerds the Nerds problem

00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:39,779
right they do our security stuff and

00:14:37,769 --> 00:14:42,089
they handle that thing but that's not

00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:44,430
how this stuff should be you know when

00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:46,110
you have a sexual harassment issue when

00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:47,610
you have a diversity issue you know

00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:49,350
that's something that you just have to

00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:50,459
know in the organization these are just

00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:52,829
rules there's nothing to do with your

00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:54,300
job but everyone in the org accepts that

00:14:52,829 --> 00:14:55,740
these are things that could happen and

00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:57,240
this is what we do to make sure that it

00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:58,829
doesn't we have a code of conduct we

00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:02,160
have a certain policy we've norms that

00:14:58,829 --> 00:15:04,380
we enforce the digital stuff needs to be

00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,850
there it just needs to be a norm you

00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:07,560
just make some digital norms you know

00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:08,880
maybe you introduce it by saying you

00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,470
know we're gonna have a little Brown Bag

00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,880
session and we're just gonna talk about

00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:13,800
what would we do if this happened

00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:15,600
because it happened to someone or an

00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,130
organization or group of people who do

00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,529
something like what we do but in another

00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:20,999
place maybe another country

00:15:19,529 --> 00:15:22,709
because trust me I live the United

00:15:20,999 --> 00:15:25,980
States I know that in four years

00:15:22,709 --> 00:15:28,680
everything can change you know you know

00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:30,959
I was born here in the UK and you know

00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:32,249
whether you were all-in for staying in

00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,709
or all about getting out

00:15:32,249 --> 00:15:36,029
you know brexit is a real thing today

00:15:34,709 --> 00:15:37,139
you're living one place in tomorrow

00:15:36,029 --> 00:15:39,689
you're living in a totally different

00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:42,050
country you know people in Catalonia

00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:44,339
will tell you that all right all right
