and also explain because your program

00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:07,830
says there's meant to be a panel with

00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:11,120
two people the other participant Rory

00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:13,759
couldn't get a visa these things happen

00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,020
so we're going to have a talk instead

00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:18,510
one of the things that Natalie's going

00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,039
to talk about is we kind of touched upon

00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:22,080
this in the previous session as well

00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:23,940
it's about

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,890
how much people understand the tools

00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:27,360
that they're engaging with and as

00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,240
Alondra mentioned a lot of our

00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:32,099
conversation tends to be around

00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:36,809
middle-class educated white collar

00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:38,190
people in the West what we and those of

00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:39,930
you who were here yesterday you might

00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:41,550
remember that we when we talk about

00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:44,580
people in the poor world we talk about

00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:45,989
farmers and grain prices when actually

00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:48,900
people get online they wouldn't get on

00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:51,350
Facebook and whatsapp um and to the what

00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:53,699
I want to say to this set set the scene

00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:55,110
said a few years ago he wrote face into

00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:57,960
the survey Self Indulgence give me were

00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:00,780
a few years ago I wrote a piece using

00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,309
both survey and anecdotal data showing

00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:04,080
that there were millions of users across

00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:06,840
the poor world who had no idea that

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,820
Facebook was the internet because you

00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,619
you take out your phone there's an app

00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,909
there one takes you to the internet

00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:15,150
which is your browser and the other one

00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:17,820
takes you to Facebook um and kind of the

00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:20,100
point of that piece was to explain that

00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,840
it's very easy to be patronizing or

00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:24,000
condescending towards these attitudes

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,500
but these attitudes exist and not simply

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,390
a matter of Education there are a matter

00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:30,060
of the way businesses and technology

00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:32,780
frame their devices and the way people

00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:36,350
are forced to engage them um until

00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:36,350
Nucky's going to

00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:41,370
a bit about that and then move on

00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:41,370
education in the UK

00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:50,979
hi so yes Napoli Richards CEO and

00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:52,719
co-founder of educate and I thought a

00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:54,340
good place to start would actually be to

00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:56,619
tell you a little bit about what it is

00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:59,170
that we do at our company and my journey

00:01:56,619 --> 00:02:00,909
in in starting the company and then also

00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:03,069
kind of looking at some of my thoughts

00:02:00,909 --> 00:02:05,590
on the inclusion problem that we have in

00:02:03,069 --> 00:02:07,270
tech but as I said or others Leo is

00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:09,940
saying hi my name is going to be far

00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:12,099
more optimistic presentation I'm sure

00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:16,480
you'll be very relieved to hear I think

00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:18,250
that Tech has so much opportunity to be

00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,410
able to transform outcomes for those in

00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:23,379
our communities who are most in need so

00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:25,120
I come from a consulting background I've

00:02:23,379 --> 00:02:28,569
worked a lot as a project manager within

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:31,840
an IT context and wanted to strike out

00:02:28,569 --> 00:02:35,200
on my own and and found an online and

00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:37,120
Internet focus company but in doing so

00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,769
wanted to do something that I was

00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,780
passionate about and I've always been

00:02:38,769 --> 00:02:42,940
incredibly passionate about helping

00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:44,440
young people to achieve their potential

00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:47,109
so I thought that was a good place to

00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:49,510
start we're an EdTech or a social tech

00:02:47,109 --> 00:02:52,299
company by doing the work that we do

00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:54,639
with our schools we're enabling students

00:02:52,299 --> 00:02:57,010
to achieve their potential and

00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:59,889
essentially we're all about giving rules

00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:01,599
to schools to educators but help to

00:02:59,889 --> 00:03:04,060
transform outcomes for students and

00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,769
that's particularly around student

00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:07,389
well-being and understanding the

00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:09,430
Pascrell side of education because all

00:03:07,389 --> 00:03:12,430
too often we focus on academic

00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:15,340
attainment and in practice if a student

00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:16,690
is suffering from so low self-esteem or

00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:18,519
they have issues at home or they're

00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:20,980
being bullied whether that's online or

00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:23,380
in the real world they just aren't

00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:24,819
attained so educate provides schools

00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:26,919
with the tools to be able to better

00:03:24,819 --> 00:03:28,810
understand the needs of their students

00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:30,880
and how to respond to those and we also

00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:33,250
have a directory a kind of an advisors

00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,900
direct you have support that schools can

00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:37,150
use both inside and outside of the

00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:40,230
classroom in order to support students

00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:44,010
in doing better and I also sit on the

00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:46,269
border of Virgin Unite which is the

00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:48,129
charity or the foundation of the Virgin

00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:50,410
brand in the Branson family and that's

00:03:48,129 --> 00:03:51,940
where I came to me Roya who

00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:53,889
unfortunately couldn't be here today

00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:56,440
which is a huge name because she's doing

00:03:53,889 --> 00:03:58,489
some amazing work in Afghanistan and the

00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:01,580
Middle East and provide

00:03:58,489 --> 00:04:03,260
a voice to women online and enabling

00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:06,709
women to be part of the digital economy

00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:08,390
and so what did I want to sir I wanted

00:04:06,709 --> 00:04:10,790
to start in terms of this this this

00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:12,830
phrase around tech having an inclusion

00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:15,950
problem and just give a few thoughts

00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:17,510
about what that conjured up for me and I

00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:20,000
thought when when we start to talk about

00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:22,639
inclusion what we're often talking about

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,090
is who's not included right whose voices

00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:28,669
aren't being heard and if we look at two

00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:29,990
broad groups so the developed world and

00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:33,230
the developing world if we start with

00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:35,690
the developed world

00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:38,750
when when we do work in our schools

00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:40,400
often we find that unsurprisingly it's

00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:42,470
the young people it's the students who

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,920
are most disadvantaged who have less

00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:47,900
access meaningful access to the Internet

00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:50,690
and tools and that's that's unsurprising

00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:52,340
right it's about helping those

00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:54,530
communities to better understand the

00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:57,140
opportunities that exist and be able to

00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:59,480
use the internet more effectively and

00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:02,300
I'll talk a little bit later about how

00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:05,360
vulnerable some of those permissions

00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:07,190
people can be using those schools but

00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,860
then also there the older populations

00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:11,630
right there and the silver surfers we

00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:13,460
have a huge problem certainly in the UK

00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:16,850
when it comes to social isolation of

00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:18,740
older people and digital technology can

00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:21,410
try to tackle that I don't think there's

00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:23,900
a long way to go in order to be able to

00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:26,300
fully utilize the potential and the

00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:29,000
benefit of the Internet in the online

00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:32,330
space but certainly that is an

00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,700
application in that domain I think one

00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:37,400
thing that's often often overlooked our

00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:40,310
prison populations right when we talk

00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:43,280
about the developed world and and having

00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:47,240
I think it's in in North America there's

00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:50,300
over 90% digital access with literacy in

00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:52,250
Europe is over 80% but it's astounding

00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:54,170
that most prison populations don't

00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:56,510
actually have any meaningful access to

00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:58,010
the Internet and that's whether that's

00:05:56,510 --> 00:06:00,530
not just the entertainment side of the

00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:02,600
internet it's also the the knowledge

00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:04,760
side it's the educational opportunities

00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,960
I personally think a lot of work needs

00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,700
to be done there because what we're

00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:10,370
doing is having people who are rejoining

00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:14,630
communities who had this huge disconnect

00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:17,810
5 10 20 more years and and and therefore

00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:19,160
not able to make sophisticated use of

00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:20,870
digital tools so I think that's

00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:23,960
something within the developed world

00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:25,610
that I see that that does concern me

00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:27,590
but with with regards to the developing

00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:29,060
world I can certainly be a far more

00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:31,069
optimistic

00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:34,660
we are only selecting the surface in

00:06:31,069 --> 00:06:38,120
terms of potential I spent some time in

00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:40,699
Uganda a few years back and it was so

00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:42,889
inspiring to see there was a program out

00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:44,840
there that was working with local women

00:06:42,889 --> 00:06:47,990
to get women online and developing their

00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:50,419
own online businesses and it really has

00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:52,250
such a such a huge potential in that

00:06:50,419 --> 00:06:54,410
regard and I think that some of the time

00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:55,940
when we do talk about the negative side

00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:58,490
of the internet we're forgetting that

00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:59,990
there are these huge munities in other

00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:02,690
countries where it's just literally so

00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:05,479
informational and that presents such an

00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:08,650
exciting and exciting opportunity

00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:12,979
I think another element of this

00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:16,849
conversation is around what meaningful

00:07:12,979 --> 00:07:18,409
access to the Internet means and here I

00:07:16,849 --> 00:07:21,289
look at some of the work that we've been

00:07:18,409 --> 00:07:25,520
doing specifically with schools that we

00:07:21,289 --> 00:07:27,229
support and we do see incidents of you

00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:31,099
know the internet and online tools and

00:07:27,229 --> 00:07:33,680
test in a way that is harmful to young

00:07:31,099 --> 00:07:36,889
people there are instances of cyber

00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:40,639
bullying and more and more in examples

00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:42,259
of that there and within cyber bullying

00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:45,110
it's probably interesting to say that I

00:07:42,259 --> 00:07:46,849
think there's a huge part and a little

00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:48,500
bit later about this as well but

00:07:46,849 --> 00:07:50,360
regularly have to play in this space

00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,740
right because it's a little bit

00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,270
sometimes like the world world where

00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:55,280
sometimes it feels like anything goes

00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:56,900
but I think that always happens when you

00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:00,110
get a new technology or a new way of

00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:01,909
doing things if we look at modern forms

00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:05,000
of transformation this time 100 years

00:08:01,909 --> 00:08:08,330
ago when the car was starting to become

00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,860
the mode of all that we were using you

00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:11,599
know there weren't speed limits there

00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:12,979
weren't regulated ways you know they

00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:15,590
weren't restrictions on how much alcohol

00:08:12,979 --> 00:08:19,940
you consume you know it kind of needed

00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:21,979
to evolve over time as our use of cars

00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:24,919
and and modern transportation evolved so

00:08:21,979 --> 00:08:27,949
I think that's really I think there is a

00:08:24,919 --> 00:08:30,949
role to play or regulators really make

00:08:27,949 --> 00:08:32,779
to really understand what the challenges

00:08:30,949 --> 00:08:34,550
are and to make sure that we have the

00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:37,000
right measures in place in order to take

00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:40,850
power how are you

00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:43,360
another aspect is grooming and in the UK

00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:45,890
context online grooming game has had a

00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,500
lot of focus a lot of attention that's

00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:51,230
something that again if we go back to

00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:55,550
the previous conversation AI and those

00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:58,040
types of tools hopefully help those in

00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:59,780
in law enforcement to have a sense of

00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:02,990
where vulnerable young people are online

00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:06,170
and where there are opportunities to be

00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:08,480
able because that's obviously an area

00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:11,720
that our schools feel very very

00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:15,800
concerned about um so what does this

00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:18,050
mean for us at educate so really there

00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:21,350
are challenges there are vulnerabilities

00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:23,150
around seeing people online huge

00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:24,980
opportunities as well there one of the

00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:26,810
things that we spend a lot of time on in

00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:29,060
formulating the online tools that we

00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:32,150
provide to schools is to ensure that

00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:36,050
those rules best respond to the evolving

00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:39,800
needs of students and learners so as an

00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:42,920
example we do monitor how safe students

00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:44,360
feel online we do monitor how how

00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:47,500
students feel in terms of their peer

00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:50,380
relationship we do monitor the way that

00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:52,730
that students are using the internet and

00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:54,230
allow schools to be able to understand

00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:55,520
where their vulnerable learners are and

00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:57,800
therefore to be able to put the best

00:09:55,520 --> 00:10:01,100
supportive measures and in place to do

00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:03,620
that and also from my perspective in

00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:05,740
building the business the inclusiveness

00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:08,060
that I'm seeing in terms of the internet

00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:09,980
outside of the UK certainly in the early

00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:12,590
days when you know it was difficult to

00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:15,560
be able to afford to staff a big team it

00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:17,420
was all about being able to tap into

00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:19,490
great resource internationally and

00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:21,470
listen great online tools where I could

00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:23,180
go and find people all around the globe

00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:26,020
and who could come and contribute to

00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:29,540
areas of how we would build our business

00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:31,850
so I think there's a Q&A portion with

00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:33,950
this presentation so just surround off

00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:35,690
with some you know and final thoughts or

00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:38,050
reflections I think that the

00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:41,660
conversation around Digital Inclusion

00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:43,280
really for me comes down to three key

00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:46,820
points so number one would be better

00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:48,980
access to to the Internet to digital

00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:50,000
tools it's good to see obviously with

00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:51,920
the

00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,830
a smartphone market but in certain

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:57,260
markets that we operate in young people

00:10:54,830 --> 00:11:00,050
who don't have computers and still

00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:03,350
engage meaningfully with with the online

00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:05,660
space it's about better education I

00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:08,630
think there is a role for the school

00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:11,210
system to transform given the huge

00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:13,610
potential that technology presents and

00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:15,950
the internet so that young people are

00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:19,610
able to more meaningfully capitalize on

00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:21,590
that on that potential and and also

00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:25,090
better serve better regulation better

00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:27,800
ways of being able monitor that usage

00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:31,970
and ensure that we are keeping the most

00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:33,410
vulnerable among this say so I think I

00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:36,620
think I'll leave it there I'd love to

00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:39,110
open person questions and and also

00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:41,210
engage with Leo maybe a little bit

00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:42,740
around his thoughts about Facebook usage

00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:45,180
in other countries I found that

00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:49,450
fascinating thank you

00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:51,490
Thank You lovely army there will be so

00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:54,600
there's someone with Mike um if anyone

00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:54,600
has any question

00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:08,920
okay thank you so much for that um so

00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:10,840
you didn't touch on a roll of I guess

00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:12,340
the sort of data surveillance and

00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:14,740
educational tech it seems like a

00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:17,230
particularly swear we haven't thought

00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:19,570
enough about how to protect children and

00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:21,430
students from the data grab that's

00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:24,690
happening in that space what would you

00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:27,430
offer about that problem

00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:30,010
about the need to be able to protect

00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:31,930
young people around educational tools

00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:33,970
yeah exactly I mean a lot of those tools

00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:36,190
are offered for free or low-cost because

00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:38,980
you know the data is being gathered

00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:40,920
about children yeah data usage I mean I

00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:43,600
think it's all about transparency

00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:45,130
personally I think and it was

00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,560
interesting in the previous school there

00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:49,540
was this this comment about young

00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:51,310
Facebook users understanding what data

00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:52,660
was being collected and how that might

00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:54,459
be used and there may be making

00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:55,870
different decisions than other people

00:12:54,459 --> 00:12:57,459
being more comfortable with that so I

00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:59,620
think really is a conversation about

00:12:57,459 --> 00:13:02,200
transparency some of that transparency

00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:04,930
is coming with the introduction of our

00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:06,670
for example with an ask to see the data

00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:08,080
that's being held on them why that's

00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:11,890
being stored where that's being stored

00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:14,649
except I think we have further to go but

00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:17,140
I would say speaking to schools they are

00:13:14,649 --> 00:13:20,350
more excited about the huge

00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:22,360
opportunities that that that this

00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:24,370
presents to them rather than being very

00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:26,440
fearful of the data and you know you

00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:27,760
might say that that's absolutely naive

00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:30,790
but I think that this increased in terms

00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,940
of transparency will will help in that

00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:32,940
regard

00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:38,400
I'm a big believer not only in good

00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:41,070
regulation helping with these things but

00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:45,420
I think I think we run the risk today in

00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:49,680
2018 of being a bit reactionary whereas

00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:51,390
you know good laws good enforcement and

00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,190
keep us from throwing the baby out with

00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:54,600
the bathwater we don't want to not do

00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:57,240
these things because we're worried about

00:13:54,600 --> 00:14:00,510
them I want to do them better

00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:05,940
as any other questions oh yes yeah um so

00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:08,520
I kind of oh sorry um so I've been you

00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:11,670
know really considering the midst of a

00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:13,170
global product how it can be dual and ed

00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:15,360
tech to make product that reaches

00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:20,190
different communities and you mentioned

00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:21,420
um various is that could use better

00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:23,880
access better education better

00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:25,140
regulation and I wonder in in New York

00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:28,260
from your perspective do you see

00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:31,529
overlaps in the needs of these different

00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:33,120
entities so do you mean is it is it is

00:14:31,529 --> 00:14:36,000
that like a bespoke solution that's

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:39,570
available the different communities more

00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:42,810
you yeah kind of so um not so much about

00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:47,310
a product available but more so like

00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:49,290
what their particular needs in terms of

00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:53,250
I don't know or maybe I should say

00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:55,230
instead of like gaps in their in their

00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:59,399
knowledge or some areas that they're

00:14:55,230 --> 00:15:02,940
overlapping with in the youth older

00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:05,040
users and you had also mentioned women

00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:08,790
in the global South for example I just

00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:11,610
wonder if these are really each very

00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:15,240
unique Avenue or if you see that there

00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:18,450
are things that that we can do in ed

00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:19,920
tech to to reach all of them all at once

00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:21,899
right right right

00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,570
so there were definitely commonalities

00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:27,839
right I mean we definitely focus on you

00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:29,880
so under 25 so I can't tell you some of

00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,350
the evolutions in terms of adults but if

00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:33,060
we look at the developed world in the

00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:35,360
developing world now I mean we're

00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:37,589
working with over 500 tools globally

00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,660
predominantly in the UK but expanding

00:15:37,589 --> 00:15:41,550
quite likely outside of you play as well

00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:45,270
and we are seeing a lot of press over

00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:48,120
right because the components to good

00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:50,370
healthy well-being and great self-esteem

00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:54,209
resilience aspirations for the future

00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:56,850
the relationship those things exist in

00:15:54,209 --> 00:15:59,130
in every geography but it's the nature

00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:01,260
of the challenges that are faced that

00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:02,880
are slightly different so I think there

00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:04,320
is there is scope certainly with the

00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,540
work that we're doing to create common

00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,610
framework around what we understand of

00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:10,620
well-being as well as being able to make

00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:14,250
sure that the support is tailored

00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:16,290
to meet the needs of a you know the the

00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:19,280
different geographies what I would say

00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:22,620
is that this whole conversation around

00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:25,350
well-being mental health hospital care

00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:27,960
safeguarding is a relatively new one in

00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:29,790
what we're hearing more recently in the

00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:31,320
past there has been a lot of complacency

00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:33,300
right we just want to improve academic

00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:34,650
performance or we want to get you know

00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:36,450
we want to get better grades for a

00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:38,910
school and I think what we're realizing

00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:41,370
now which i think is more than about

00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:42,870
time is that you can't do those things

00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:44,370
if haven't tackled the underlying

00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:46,500
challenges that young people are facing

00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:48,420
and particularly in today's world where

00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:51,990
there's an increasing amount of pressure

00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:54,000
and on the younger population I think

00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:56,010
that's that's an essential and a

00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,660
conversation to have and particularly

00:16:56,010 --> 00:17:00,390
with those young people who are most

00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:02,160
disadvantaged if far more likely be held

00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:03,960
back by things that are experiencing

00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,940
outside of school and things that are

00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:08,460
happening in the classroom so I think

00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:09,690
those are commonalities again but

00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:12,000
whether you're in the development world

00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:14,940
or the developing world things that we

00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:19,010
can learn as we as we try to you know

00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:19,010
create the best online

00:17:19,049 --> 00:17:22,650
one last question

00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:29,940
I was just wondering with so you've

00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:32,309
mentioned 500 skills globally affair I

00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:35,490
thought was state-run or I don't know

00:17:32,309 --> 00:17:37,649
yeah and the financial model to to

00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:40,590
educate yep but then the other part of

00:17:37,649 --> 00:17:45,870
the question was and if there's any way

00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:49,340
to change policy so so you know or any

00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:53,340
government industries so for example

00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:56,010
whether that's to encourage a female

00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:57,809
dissolution or some schools which is you

00:17:56,010 --> 00:18:00,120
with stem or steam they end up getting

00:17:57,809 --> 00:18:02,940
kind of yeah through whichever way

00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:05,549
whether it's bias or racism across the

00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:08,399
whole education system we - later on but

00:18:05,549 --> 00:18:10,649
and yeah okay all right so there was a

00:18:08,399 --> 00:18:12,419
few points there so first of all in

00:18:10,649 --> 00:18:14,399
terms of how we constituted we're a

00:18:12,419 --> 00:18:16,529
company limited by shares but we have a

00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:19,230
social mission that's kind of written

00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:22,740
into our constitutional documents so we

00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:24,630
tackle we help schools and others to

00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:28,559
tackle disadvantaged functions people so

00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:30,210
that's kind of how we set up to your

00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:33,000
second question which is are they

00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:35,010
private or public schools predominantly

00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,590
they state-run schools or public schools

00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:39,600
we are starting to do some work now with

00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:41,610
independent schools or be paying schools

00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:44,639
but where we do there is a cost involved

00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:45,929
whereas if you are a public school this

00:18:44,639 --> 00:18:47,669
and a lot of support that we will

00:18:45,929 --> 00:18:50,610
provide entirely for free as part of our

00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:52,350
social mission and in terms of your

00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:57,500
second part of your question which was

00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:57,500
around policy yes

00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:02,190
yep and I think this huge so we're

00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:04,310
really starting to work with some think

00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:06,000
tanks in this space there's huge

00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:08,940
opportunity to be able to implement

00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,920
policy by virtue of the type of data

00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:13,470
that we collect when we were in schools

00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:15,480
we we pull data from the school's

00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:17,400
information management systems or the

00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,930
databases they use monitor the

00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:22,260
attainment of their students any

00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:24,420
challenges behavioral or challenges Andy

00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:26,340
Andy if the students you know all of

00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:28,620
that isn't is typically held in a in a

00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:30,390
database we access that database and we

00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:32,010
can then tie up the results of the

00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:34,170
well-being survey with the demographics

00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:36,120
of the student learn allows us to have a

00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:38,460
data set that we do anonymize in

00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:41,580
aggregate and when we were talking about

00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:43,290
data in the potential challenges and

00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:45,300
concerns around data because we are

00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:47,190
social tech we always commit to using

00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:49,140
that data solely in order to improve

00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:51,480
outcomes for students so in that regard

00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:53,160
we have a huge and growing data set that

00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:55,500
we can work with policymakers to make

00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:58,620
sense of okay what are the relationships

00:19:55,500 --> 00:20:01,170
between attendance and how somebody

00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:02,640
feels about their home line or the team

00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:04,950
propensity to go into a certain

00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,570
discipline and and levels of aspirations

00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:09,480
so to your question specifically about

00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:12,180
stem or steam or you know as evolving

00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:14,820
different terminology and yes there is

00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:16,710
potential to do specific research within

00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:18,720
the data set and given a relationship

00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:20,580
with schools that can help to form

00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:23,670
policy and we see ourselves very much as

00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:26,010
having having that role because we can

00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:29,930
relate so many stories from different

00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:29,930
schools and insights from the data

00:20:30,909 --> 00:20:38,070
thank you welcome and will be fully back

00:20:35,499 --> 00:20:38,070
in half now

00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:44,940
thank you

00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,940
[Applause]

00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:52,070
