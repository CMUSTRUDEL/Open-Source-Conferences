an honor to follows in a really big fan

00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:10,769
of the work she's doing and I saw Don

00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,150
Marti out there in the audience as well

00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:14,910
he's another interesting person to talk

00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:16,800
to about this topic I want to return us

00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:19,890
to a little bit more of an optimistic

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,020
take of maybe where we've been and maybe

00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:25,470
where we can get to as well

00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:28,410
Mozilla's almost 20 years old at this

00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:30,179
point is about 18 years ago 1998 when

00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:32,940
the Mozilla project was spun out of

00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:35,160
Netscape in fact the code name is Ola

00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:36,989
was used inside of Netscape even before

00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,800
that point so you could argue it's over

00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:42,840
20 years ago but what I wanted to do was

00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:47,700
do a reference check who here was

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:49,260
actually online in 1996 Wow okay so I so

00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,750
you all are probably on the same

00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,460
wavelength then what I wanted to do just

00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:56,190
because I thought it really captured the

00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:58,320
spirit of those of us who were there or

00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:00,000
even earlier than that of really what

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,920
the potential is of this thing that we

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,300
were building oh and as the person who

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,030
put the first ad banner online I'm

00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:07,740
really sorry if I could have rewind the

00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:08,610
clock I would try to done something but

00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,979
if it wasn't me it would have been

00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:12,090
somebody else the next week I swear but

00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:13,950
let me just read this because I think

00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:15,810
it's worth getting into the record and

00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:18,150
worth hearing out loud again so this was

00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:20,610
John Perry Barlow who is a co-founder of

00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:24,720
the Electronic Frontier Foundation he

00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:27,330
was a a poet a rancher in Wyoming he has

00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,930
great stories about Dick Cheney he also

00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:32,909
was a lyricist for the Grateful Dead and

00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:36,299
really a very active voice on the well

00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:38,400
which was an early community online and

00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:40,380
he issued something at the World

00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,049
Economic Forum's gathering in Davos in

00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:45,060
1996 which was in front of an audience

00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:48,659
of a bunch of governments a bunch of

00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:49,979
large industrialists and it was called

00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:52,350
the Declaration of the independence of

00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:54,210
cyberspace governments of the industrial

00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:56,399
world you weary Giants of flesh and

00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:58,799
steel I come from cyberspace the new

00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,399
home of mind on behalf of the future I

00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,750
ask you of the past to leave us alone

00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:06,030
cyberspace consists of transactions

00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:07,560
relationships and thought itself arrayed

00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:09,599
like a standing wave in the web of

00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,790
communications ours is a world that is

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,900
both everywhere and nowhere and it is

00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:15,670
but it is not where bodies live

00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,200
we are creating a world that all may

00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:19,690
enter without privilege or prejudice

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,879
accorded by race economic power military

00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:23,739
force or station of birth we are

00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:25,659
creating a world where anyone anywhere

00:02:23,739 --> 00:02:27,849
may express his or her beliefs no matter

00:02:25,659 --> 00:02:30,549
how singular without fear of being

00:02:27,849 --> 00:02:32,140
coerced into silence or conformity we

00:02:30,549 --> 00:02:34,540
will create a civilization of mind in

00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:37,209
cyberspace there's a lot more to it it's

00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:39,940
it's it's pretty inspirational but also

00:02:37,209 --> 00:02:41,890
pretty didactic and and I think for a

00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:44,650
lot of us you know hopelessly idealistic

00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:46,269
right but but many of the best documents

00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:48,069
are I would argue the actual Declaration

00:02:46,269 --> 00:02:50,319
of Independence and constitution and

00:02:48,069 --> 00:02:53,049
were impossible idealistic at the end of

00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:56,620
the 18th century but the state of the

00:02:53,049 --> 00:02:58,720
Internet in 96 wasn't too far from an

00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:01,780
architecture that actually made those

00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,970
messages sounds inherently reasonable at

00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:05,709
that point in time every workstation

00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:07,359
more or less you know if you were

00:03:05,709 --> 00:03:08,980
connected to the Internet you know and

00:03:07,359 --> 00:03:12,879
you were at least on the on the right

00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:14,859
side of a 2400 baud connection your

00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:17,140
workstation was likely also a mail

00:03:14,859 --> 00:03:19,450
server it was likely also a file server

00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:22,329
for other other computers it was likely

00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:24,010
also a web server in fact I this graphic

00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:25,510
here is of a computer that I had while

00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:28,840
it was at Wired yes it's where the crime

00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:30,790
was committed but I it was my desktop

00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:33,489
machine wired had got it in an ad trade

00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:35,650
with SGI it was a really sweet computer

00:03:33,489 --> 00:03:37,480
it's also the fastest computer that the

00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:39,220
magazine had at the time so when we

00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,810
launched hot-wired actually when we

00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:43,120
launched our first website and then

00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:45,160
hot-wired the ad supported site that was

00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,569
our web server was my desktop sitting

00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,949
there on the machine and in the middle

00:03:46,569 --> 00:03:50,260
of the day would slow down a little bit

00:03:47,949 --> 00:03:52,299
but it was a it had a public IP address

00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:54,040
that was routable right and I shut down

00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:55,690
you know the right set of ports and

00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:58,389
things like that so it was secure at

00:03:55,690 --> 00:04:00,129
least at the time but that was just the

00:03:58,389 --> 00:04:02,079
state of things right and actually we

00:04:00,129 --> 00:04:04,599
had a failover box might my colleagues

00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:06,280
SGI as well there's the two most

00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:07,900
powerful computers but this seemed like

00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,760
an eminently reasonable thing to do

00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:11,079
right yeah you have firewalls in that

00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,109
sort of thing but why not these are

00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:16,209
powerful enough I think there is also

00:04:14,109 --> 00:04:19,000
this principle especially harkening to

00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:20,979
the dumb network principle that all TCP

00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,070
packets going over the Internet are

00:04:20,979 --> 00:04:25,659
created equal all right modulo a couple

00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:27,160
of different things but basically if you

00:04:25,659 --> 00:04:28,600
can send a packet on the network it

00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:31,510
the same right to get to its destination

00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:33,160
as anyone elses packets right no matter

00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:35,140
where was coming from as it was being

00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,820
handed off there wasn't it was too cheap

00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:38,740
to meet her too cheap to charge to

00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:40,930
figure out is this packet going around

00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:42,760
the world or is it going next door both

00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:45,250
cases why don't we just get it from from

00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:47,110
point A to point B and they're not most

00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:48,820
importantly all of the protocols that

00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:50,710
the internet was built upon they were

00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:52,210
built there were open protocols I mean

00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:53,860
the way that you got a new internet

00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:55,690
protocol was getting it through the

00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:58,090
internet Engineering Task Force or

00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:59,350
building an open-source implementation

00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:01,150
and sharing it with people we didn't

00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:04,210
even call it open source till about 1998

00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:05,680
but they were all collaboratively built

00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:09,040
and that was just kind of how you did

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,900
things so if you were to ask us today

00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:12,940
well what does the internet look like as

00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:14,530
a result of a lot of this right you

00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:17,860
could say well it's it's a series of

00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:19,540
tubes right pipes that connect the

00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:21,970
nations of the world and inside of those

00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:25,270
nations as well it's actually really

00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:26,890
really thick to think these days this

00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:28,990
picture might actually look a bit better

00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:31,840
in terms of what it looks like as a

00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:34,780
network right now and in terms of that

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,790
the at the TCP IP layer packets flying

00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:39,520
around and and that sort of thing but

00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:41,500
the problem was I the next layers up

00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,680
from the raw networking layers have

00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:46,570
we've kind of gone backwards so this is

00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:48,700
perhaps arguably a better picture of

00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:51,550
what the internet looks like today this

00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:54,580
is a data center it's an i/o it happens

00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:57,340
to be in Iowa it could be in Oregon it

00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:59,700
could be in India could be in China this

00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:02,110
is a Google Data Center by the way and

00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:04,450
one thing you notice and it's you know

00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:06,640
not just an artifact of how the photo is

00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:09,400
taken there isn't anybody there all

00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:11,020
right in fact communities that warmly

00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:13,540
welcomed many of these companies into

00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:15,010
set of data centers in their midst often

00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,330
found that they weren't quite the jobs

00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:18,070
engine that they thought that they were

00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:20,080
because it doesn't take that many people

00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:22,390
to rack up bunch of new machines and

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,280
keep the keep the lights on we've

00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:27,010
allowed this kind of centralization and

00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:29,400
perhaps this is a bit metaphorical not

00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:33,310
nearly as metaphorical as this perhaps I

00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:35,169
that centralization of our services

00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:36,910
you know everyone using Gmail everyone

00:06:35,169 --> 00:06:39,850
using Twitter everyone using Facebook

00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:40,900
and concentrating that on on small

00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:43,509
clusters of machine

00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,830
has actually made it easy to allow

00:06:43,509 --> 00:06:49,090
ourselves to fall into the surveillance

00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:50,740
trap this is a photo of when the e FF

00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:52,630
and a couple of other organizations I'm

00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:54,030
sure somebody can shout him out partner

00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:56,169
to get sorry

00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:58,330
Greenpeace right exactly partner

00:06:56,169 --> 00:07:01,840
together to send a balloon up over the

00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:02,979
NSA's data center in Utah this the the

00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,310
large data center that they're

00:07:02,979 --> 00:07:08,289
collecting all the data from right and I

00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:09,880
we've allowed ourselves I think to slip

00:07:08,289 --> 00:07:12,699
into this state where because of the

00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:15,910
concentration of services it's become

00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:17,520
easier to surveil and if you want to

00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:20,590
think of it as like a series of

00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:22,810
progressions right I on the left hand

00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:24,400
side is kind of the most the easiest way

00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:26,560
to build a network or build a service as

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:29,110
a kind of a hub-and-spoke kind of

00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,900
architecture arguably that's what a BBS

00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:34,030
was or what AOL or CompuServe was and

00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:35,289
when we got to the Internet we were able

00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:38,349
to start to connect these networks

00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:40,720
together and and be much more kind of

00:07:38,349 --> 00:07:42,400
rich and and and use open protocols and

00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,500
that sort of thing and that's that's the

00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,389
middle graph and we were fairly well on

00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:48,669
our way to actually getting to a nice

00:07:46,389 --> 00:07:50,620
distributed architecture as something

00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:52,510
that that you know could actually be

00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:55,360
resilient against attacks resilient

00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:58,180
against a single companies coming in or

00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,710
choke points but we kind of you know

00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:02,020
even if we solved that problem at the

00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:03,520
the raw networking layer we reintroduced

00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:05,949
that problem I think we went backwards

00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,900
in time at the layers above and I'll

00:08:05,949 --> 00:08:09,940
argue that this is partly the original

00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:12,159
sin of the web was that we designed it

00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:15,159
as a client-server thing we designed the

00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:18,159
clients to be dumb and the servers to be

00:08:15,159 --> 00:08:20,889
really smart and it was kind of easier

00:08:18,159 --> 00:08:23,440
to scale a big service like like Gmail

00:08:20,889 --> 00:08:25,060
or Twitter than it was to think about

00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,889
how do we actually push some

00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:28,720
intelligence to the edge and keep these

00:08:26,889 --> 00:08:31,240
things decentralized as we went further

00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,070
up the stack now there's a whole bunch

00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:35,589
of problems that arise from this right I

00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:38,500
the first problem is one of resiliency

00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:39,940
last week there was a major denial of

00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:42,550
service attack distributed denial

00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:45,040
service attack against a DNS provider

00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:48,339
called Dyne and it had the ramifications

00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:50,920
of bringing down parts of Twitter for

00:08:48,339 --> 00:08:52,480
parts of the world Spotify reddit I

00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:56,380
think was attacked

00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,790
and this is not a once in a while fluke

00:08:56,380 --> 00:09:00,400
this is something where it looks like

00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:01,690
this may this kind of activity may

00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:04,330
become more and more common especially

00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:07,000
if we don't figure out how to secure the

00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:09,190
end points and stop putting IP cameras

00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,380
on the net that can swap are these

00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:13,510
servers but the inherent centralization

00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:16,210
that has gone on has introduced this

00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:18,160
level of unreliability I'd argue into

00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:20,500
into the internet that we're building

00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,690
and it I don't see us coming out of the

00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:25,840
as long as we stay on the on the same

00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:28,000
course it's also led to a lot of the

00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:30,610
stuff that Zanna pointed at which I

00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,650
think it even goes deeper I you know

00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:36,760
different services have different Terms

00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:38,440
of Use that end up being I not just not

00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:41,320
not just harmful in some circumstances

00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:44,560
but I you know actually things that

00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:45,910
might violate our conceptions of human

00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,670
rights and what the right thing to do is

00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:51,700
so for example on on a Facebook they

00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:53,380
have a real names policy and I know

00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:55,000
actually a number of people whose real

00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:57,100
names Facebook do not believe was their

00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,020
real name which meant that they had to

00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:01,060
show ID and prove who they are and it

00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:02,230
was kind of crazy but beyond that there

00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:04,660
are a lot of people out there for whom

00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:06,910
revealing their real name online is an

00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:12,120
invitation to abuse is an invitation to

00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:14,530
stalkers ex-spouses to you know

00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:17,500
situations where it increases the danger

00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:19,510
of them being online and and an entire

00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:21,610
movement has sprung up to try to counter

00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:24,130
Facebook's policy in this two-minute

00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:25,810
space but but we see echoes of this

00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:27,340
elsewhere with YouTube for example they

00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:30,250
change the terms of service with their

00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:32,380
creators on a fairly regular basis and

00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:35,080
rarely is it in favor of the creators on

00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:36,850
those services and then finally when we

00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:38,860
have platforms that end up being owned

00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:41,410
by one entity or by a small number of

00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:43,090
entities then often the benefits to that

00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:45,460
platform accrue either

00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:47,470
mostly to the platform provider or to a

00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:50,680
small number of providers on top of that

00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:52,960
platform so most of you probably know in

00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:55,960
the Apple App Store the vast vast

00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:58,600
majority of builders of apps of authors

00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:00,610
of apps see very little revenue from

00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:03,220
from that really the top 1% of

00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:04,510
developers commands the majority of the

00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:10,420
revenue and

00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:11,890
I only sorry about 94% of the revenue

00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:14,740
goes to the top 1%

00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:17,800
which is I mean even if you assume that

00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:19,870
a lot of society is kind of a curve is

00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:22,870
just it's just outrageous it's not a

00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:24,820
great place to build a thriving

00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:27,370
long-term business on unless you're able

00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:29,560
to give the app away for free right and

00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:30,880
and then and then monetize it some other

00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:33,730
way

00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,530
and this gets has gotten us away from an

00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:38,410
Internet where flat permissionless

00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:41,800
innovation ends up being a generator of

00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:43,030
a lot of good for us the neutral and

00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,530
level playing field provided by

00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:46,120
permissionless innovation has empowered

00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:48,100
all of us with the freedom to express

00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:49,330
ourselves and innovate online without

00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:51,550
having to seek the permission of a

00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:53,830
remote telecom executive and I might add

00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:57,670
to that you know a remote a remote

00:11:53,830 --> 00:12:01,270
government right a remote politician a

00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:03,100
remote I you know other type of industry

00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:04,780
executive right we need to get figure

00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:06,760
out how to get back to an internet that

00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:10,090
is sufficiently decentralized so who's

00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:11,950
going to fix this last June a couple of

00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:14,680
months ago Brewster Kahle and the

00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:17,560
Internet Archive hosted a decentralized

00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:19,120
web summit and this was a gathering of a

00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:21,580
bunch of the technologists in this space

00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,210
people who had been been there for quite

00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:24,430
a while

00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:26,410
on the bottom left you see Brewster and

00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:28,360
the left and Vince Cerf and Tim

00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:30,250
berners-lee you see our own Mitchell

00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,840
Baker there attending as well talking

00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,700
about Mozilla's efforts in this space

00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:35,380
people like Cory Doctorow who've done a

00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:38,170
lot to kind of raise the profile of the

00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:40,840
importance of the decentralized web and

00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:42,730
as well as Primavera de filippi who has

00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:44,020
studied a lot about the both the

00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:46,540
technology and the social ramifications

00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:48,040
of building the decentralized web but

00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:49,900
the vast majority of people in that

00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,760
picture up above our builders are

00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:53,950
technologists and they're building a

00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:56,080
really interesting set of technologies

00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:58,000
many of them competing but overall

00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:59,620
building at what is really I think the

00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,870
next generation platform for the

00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:02,770
Internet so a couple of the projects

00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:04,900
that I just want to quickly highlight

00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:06,640
and and I hope that you spend more time

00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:09,310
learning about because there are far too

00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:10,410
many to get into in any depth here the

00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:13,780
first I'd point out is something called

00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:17,620
ipfs an IP F S stands for interplanetary

00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:18,400
file system it's one of its lead

00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:20,410
developers

00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,970
Bennet has described it as you know

00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:23,500
we're going to Mars and we need to

00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:25,480
figure out how do we have an internet

00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:27,550
that works when some people are on Mars

00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:31,140
and some people are here all right and

00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:34,120
and their focus initially is how do we

00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:36,430
have a file distribution network that

00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:37,810
works even if you know you've got

00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:40,030
networks that are disconnected or a

00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:41,680
really long time right so instead of

00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:43,690
thinking on the left here about a

00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:46,210
central server dishing out files and

00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:48,220
content think about being able to find

00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:50,770
that content wherever it might sit on a

00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:52,870
network and being able to address it and

00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:54,430
this is for the geeks as a hash of the

00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:56,530
content of the file so you know exactly

00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:59,680
that you're getting the right file and

00:13:56,530 --> 00:14:02,080
using a distributed hash to the net to

00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:04,810
find the local the closest copy and once

00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:06,520
you find it pull it closer and then make

00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:08,320
it cacheable so the next one can find it

00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:10,660
so you know that money that goes into a

00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,700
companies like Akamai and and you know

00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:14,230
CloudFlare and everyone else to like

00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:16,630
build these super distributed networks

00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:18,880
well with technologies like ipfs we have

00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:20,410
a fighting chance of being able to cut

00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:24,550
the cost of doing that and provide that

00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:26,350
as a true cloud right not as what we

00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:28,120
know today is the cloud which is using

00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:30,520
other people's computers right but

00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:32,470
actually decentralizing where the

00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:34,600
content lives on the net

00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:36,370
the next project I really encourage

00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,320
people to check out is aetherium I'm

00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:40,720
sure many of you have heard of it it's

00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:43,210
not that coin to dot o it is a

00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,320
cryptocurrency driven project but what

00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:47,890
they're really trying to build is the

00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:49,840
global computer right the system for

00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:52,060
being able to deploy applications across

00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:55,930
a grid across a blockchain and I'll go

00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:57,700
into that in a little bit.i where those

00:14:55,930 --> 00:15:00,010
programs can run autonomously where they

00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:03,970
can implement decentralized versions of

00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:06,280
everything from Airbnb or uber or most

00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:08,590
infamously recently an attempt to do is

00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:10,360
decentralized a venture capital fund and

00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:11,950
I'll get into that in a bit

00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,480
the project that I'm most directly

00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:15,760
involved in is something called hyper

00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:18,130
ledger it's a collaborative project at

00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:20,110
the Linux Foundation we're working with

00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:23,650
a whole bunch of banks and IT companies

00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:26,830
and and and kind of old school kind of

00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:28,690
companies but trying to get them to and

00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:30,700
work with them to build a common

00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:31,790
technology platform for blockchain

00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:33,440
technology

00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:35,780
the time we have here there's no time to

00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:38,450
really go into what a blockchain is but

00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:41,330
think of it as a common database and a

00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:43,280
common transaction layer that instead of

00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:45,890
going through a central server like that

00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:48,020
star configuration you saw before allows

00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:50,420
us to decentralize a transaction record

00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:52,700
a ledger a distributed ledger and then

00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:55,610
push scripts that run on that network

00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:57,890
and work in a very cooperative way so

00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:59,270
kind of like aetherium also working

00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:00,830
inside of companies and between

00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:02,690
companies but between all these

00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:05,720
different services we could start to

00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:08,420
build things applications in a way that

00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:10,400
that pushed the boundaries of how we'd

00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:13,220
understand it today rather than talking

00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:14,510
about you know a you know this is

00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:17,270
actually what might be a very boring

00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:19,610
example but you could take the way that

00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:21,830
car leases work online and rather than

00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:24,770
implementing it as like one big you know

00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:26,270
automobile website right like with that

00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:28,670
everyone feeds into and pulls out of

00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:30,050
instead decentralize it with the

00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:32,240
different participants in that network

00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:34,460
everybody from the manufacturer to the

00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,990
dealer to a scrap merchants running

00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:38,180
their own nodes on a decentralized

00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:40,220
network and exchanging data and

00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:41,960
conducting business and transactions but

00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:43,280
without any of them having to be the

00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:45,380
center of that universe none of them

00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:48,110
having to be the eBay or the Amazon or

00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:49,370
the Gmail of that industry there are

00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:50,420
people trying to do this for medical

00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:53,450
records too

00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:55,250
trying to say can we take information

00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:57,530
that about you know people's

00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:59,030
immunizations for example or the the

00:16:57,530 --> 00:17:02,480
prescriptions that they that they take

00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:04,490
or records about them or brackets about

00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,079
population health and store that in a

00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:07,940
way that preserves privacy that is

00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:09,589
encrypted in the right way but actually

00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:11,839
makes that data more portable between

00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:13,280
organizations and ideally puts the

00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:16,280
patient back at the center of health

00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:18,620
information exchange and and when you do

00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:21,110
that the idea of reinventing how these

00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:22,790
systems talk to end-users is is

00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:25,459
hopefully that's one of the big outcomes

00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:27,230
right so instead of thinking about you

00:17:25,459 --> 00:17:29,990
know going to an insurance website or

00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:32,180
going to a hospital website and logging

00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:34,100
in and checking your records there think

00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:36,050
about bringing that data closer right if

00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,970
it's if it's in the medical space what

00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:40,370
about it like a health wallet something

00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:42,500
that brings those records in that that

00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:44,630
is something that you keep no matter

00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,260
what providers you change what job you

00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:48,710
change and the

00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:49,640
insurance everyone in the UK in Canada

00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:50,990
they have the perfect system we

00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:53,030
understand but in the u.s. it's very

00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:54,800
complicated but being able to take your

00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:56,390
data with you and show it to the next

00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:58,040
person that's something that's novel

00:17:56,390 --> 00:18:00,080
that's something that we don't have in

00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:01,460
the healthcare space and has never been

00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,470
fully implemented and there's a chance

00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:05,030
that a blockchain gets us there and this

00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:08,080
is how it'll end up looking to end users

00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:10,910
so how do we get there from here

00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:13,850
I've got message to the geeks which I

00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:15,590
think many of you here are pursue

00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:17,300
decentralization right

00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:18,920
look at these technologies spend time

00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:21,410
understanding their architectures

00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:25,010
they're all pre Wando it is very much

00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:28,100
1994 in the web or maybe Joey Ito likes

00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:29,510
to say it's 1989 in the web you know two

00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:32,930
years before Tim berners-lee published

00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:34,730
his paper we're still pre TLS if you

00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:38,270
want to think of it that way right it's

00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:39,770
still early days but a lot of the hard

00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:41,930
work is being done right now under a lot

00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:44,510
of interesting services and do you think

00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:46,670
about if you can't design a service that

00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:48,470
is all the way decentralize pursuing

00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:51,020
what I've called minimum viable

00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:52,490
centralization the DNS system the domain

00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:55,550
name system out there is something I'd

00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:57,410
say is minimally centrally managed

00:18:55,550 --> 00:19:00,740
there's there's you know we can go into

00:18:57,410 --> 00:19:03,530
that and the dine hack recently was

00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:05,030
perhaps a counterexample but it's

00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:06,740
certainly a case where there isn't one

00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:09,770
big DNS server in the cloud that we all

00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:11,450
talked to it's fairly decentralized I'd

00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:13,370
also encourage the geeks let's talk more

00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:14,870
about end device security and how do we

00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:18,560
make that a priority let's talk about

00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:19,820
governance - I this is essential when

00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:21,980
we're talking about blockchain based

00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:24,140
apps and distributed apps who is it that

00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:25,730
kind of can update those apps who is it

00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:28,300
that has to agree before an action can

00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:30,350
be taken and what is the role for

00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:32,360
nonprofits in this space to actually

00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:34,040
make it work and there's some hard

00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:36,500
architectural choices we'll have to make

00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:38,750
- and then finally message to everyone

00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:41,300
learn more about these technologies as

00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:42,650
end-users and when when people want to

00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:48,400
sit you down and talk about it

00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:48,400
hear them out that's it any questions

00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:56,690
let's take one question over here please

00:19:57,350 --> 00:20:04,170
much as a question with all these

00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:06,390
decentralized technologies and

00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:09,120
particularly the blockchain current

00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:16,080
blockchain technologies they just have

00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:19,980
based on translating we have something

00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:21,540
that's a bit green right so in so repeat

00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:23,760
the question a little bit but debris

00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:26,460
frame and frame it a bit so in 2009 when

00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,990
Satoshi first published the the his

00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:30,900
paper which kind of laid the groundwork

00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:32,430
for Bitcoin I ignored it and I'm sure

00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:38,610
many of you did as well because it

00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:40,500
seemed like the most ungroup' hour just

00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:42,360
to run a lottery to figure out who gets

00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:44,790
to put the next link in a chain so

00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:47,310
Bitcoin is famous for consuming a lot of

00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:49,260
CPU power perhaps needlessly so all

00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:50,520
right if there iam and that's that's

00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:52,620
partly because it's based on something

00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:54,180
called proof of work as the core

00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:56,130
mechanism for building this global

00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:59,310
ledger a lot more detail in it I can't

00:20:56,130 --> 00:21:01,980
go into right now but proof of work is

00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:05,060
is the only way we know today how to run

00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:07,710
a large public consensus mechanism I

00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:09,960
that that you could argue as fair that

00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:11,610
is really really hard to game the

00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:13,920
etherium community uses proof of work

00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:15,690
but is trying to move beyond that to

00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:17,760
something called proof of stake right

00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:20,250
there's some really good research going

00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:22,320
on there this is still really at the

00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:23,790
cutting edge though and they're making a

00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,130
tremendous gamble as they move from one

00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:28,890
to the next I'm very optimistic we'll

00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:32,060
find alternative consensus mechanisms

00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:34,560
that allow us to retire proof of work I

00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:36,750
but that's that's something that still

00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:39,120
requires a lot of really hard crypto

00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:40,440
work at this point in time so and

00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,660
there's a lot of applications for block

00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:44,520
chains that don't require proof of work

00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:46,410
don't require a public anonymous system

00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:48,030
either and I think that's where we're

00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:50,100
gonna see a lot of deployment of

00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:51,660
blockchain tech if you just have 20

00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:53,700
banks or you've got a government and

00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:55,170
real estate agents and title insurance

00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:57,630
companies who all just need a

00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:59,610
distributed ledger you can use a quorum

00:21:57,630 --> 00:22:01,149
based consensus mechanism rather than a

00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:04,509
proof-of-work based one

00:22:01,149 --> 00:22:06,309
to accomplish that so if we focus less

00:22:04,509 --> 00:22:08,159
on Bitcoin and much more in blockchain I

00:22:06,309 --> 00:22:10,020
think we'll make a lot more progress

00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:17,470
