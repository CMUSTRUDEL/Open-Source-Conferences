and a big round of applause again for my

00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:08,130
Stiggy I think you broke my sticky at

00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:10,410
least two world records in the last 10

00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:12,480
minutes the world record for the most

00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:14,759
uses of the word innovation in a hip-hop

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,010
song so we should make sure we check

00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:19,230
that as probably the first-ever hip-hop

00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:23,850
song with the word decentralization in

00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:28,109
it so what a great way to open my eyes

00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:30,720
thank you this is as I I probably say

00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:34,200
every year at this moment the best

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:37,020
moment of the year for me to be starting

00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,300
a weekend with 1,800 people who are all

00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,190
dedicating their lives and making the

00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,379
digital world a better place it was

00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:44,850
really an exciting and a wonderful two

00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:47,340
days we get together it brings me

00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:51,000
through the year and gives me energy and

00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:54,000
inspiration and often when I get to this

00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,289
moment and certainly last night I get a

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,280
little reflective on Serb Maz fest past

00:00:57,289 --> 00:01:00,570
and this is the ninth

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,969
Maz fest so I was thinking back like

00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:04,769
what was it we were talking about nine

00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:06,869
years ago what were some of the themes

00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:08,430
and you know what was the festival about

00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:11,820
when we did our first festival in

00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:13,320
Barcelona and so I went last night and I

00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:17,280
looked back at the wiki which you can go

00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:19,680
and see the incredibly Wankel e-coated

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,990
scheduled for mars fest 2010 which was

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,369
called the drumbeat festival but I also

00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:25,290
kind of looked around in the news and I

00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:26,970
looked at the tech news and you know I

00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:29,460
thought what were the big tech stories

00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:32,220
what was going on in the world as we did

00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:34,890
that first more as fast the number one

00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:37,409
tech story of the year was very exciting

00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:39,090
very thrilling and I checked like a lot

00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:40,650
of sources this was consistently the

00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:44,210
number one tech store the year the

00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:46,799
release of the iPad how boring is that

00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:49,950
and and so it's very different than the

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,509
tech headlines of today of course and I

00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,619
think it was also time where people you

00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:55,740
know what's kind of boring there was

00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:56,909
just tech news people liked a lot of

00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,579
what was coming out of Silicon Valley

00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:01,920
without much question it certainly was

00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:03,960
the beginning of the erosion of the web

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,729
by the app economy starting to

00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:08,670
accelerate but it wasn't you know tech

00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:10,619
news wasn't really news but there were a

00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:13,470
number of us many of us in the room

00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:14,700
whether we were at Moz fest or not

00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:16,860
who felt like there's a bigger

00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:18,360
conversation that was needed to think

00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:20,370
about where we wanted to take the

00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,200
digital world that might be different

00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:24,600
than the iPad or different than what was

00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:28,110
emerging with Facebook which was rapidly

00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:30,420
accelerating that year and think about

00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:32,550
you know what is it that's the digital

00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:35,310
world we want I think a little bit

00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:38,100
harder about that think about the link

00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:39,420
between technology and humanity and

00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,750
think about what we wanted to do about

00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,600
it

00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:44,850
and that's really the genesis of the

00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,920
Mozilla festival a lot of where we have

00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:49,760
all come from a lot of where Mozilla has

00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:53,070
focused in that last almost a decade and

00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,540
so that first Mozilla festival happened

00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:57,300
really with that question about the link

00:02:54,540 --> 00:03:01,500
between technology and happen humanity

00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:04,290
and happiness how do we build from sort

00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:07,320
of the the roots of the spirit of open

00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:11,010
source but into bigger and other efforts

00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:13,230
of human endeavor and how do we make

00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:15,540
that link between technology and

00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:16,920
humanity and so we got together in a set

00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:19,110
of art galleries and in a square in

00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:21,239
Barcelona we picked a theme called

00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:22,800
learning freedom in the web and we just

00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:26,250
started to collaborate and make things

00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:28,650
and hatch plans and that has been the

00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:30,209
spirit amaz fest ever since people who

00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:32,489
are passionate about these issues who

00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:35,790
want to see a better digital world and a

00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:38,370
better world getting together to ask

00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:41,430
questions about what's wrong what's

00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:42,959
right and what can we do about it and so

00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:47,730
that's certainly the spirit I invite you

00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:49,620
to bring here this weekend and in that

00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:53,070
intervening nine years one of the things

00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:55,860
that experience has told us is there is

00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:57,360
a link between technology and humanity

00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:00,690
the Internet and humanity and how we

00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,220
want things to work out and you know

00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:03,480
that's not only just been our experience

00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:05,160
but in Mozilla we have started to

00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,709
reflect on that and I want to call that

00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:10,110
one thing as we go into this year's Moz

00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:13,560
Fest is gonna be some chances to engage

00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:15,450
with this is that Mozilla we've done a

00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:18,830
bunch of reflection in the last year's

00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:21,150
and about how it's not just technology

00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:23,099
that we need to be focused on but also

00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:26,010
the human experience of the Internet and

00:04:23,099 --> 00:04:27,240
so this year in March we released an

00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:28,830
addendum to the tenure

00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:32,910
old Mozilla manifesto on the 10th

00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:36,569
anniversary of Mozilla or of the

00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:40,680
manifesto and I guess the story the 15th

00:04:36,569 --> 00:04:42,660
anniversary of Mozilla org and it not

00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:46,380
only reaffirmed our commitment to things

00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:48,090
like openness privacy and security that

00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:50,340
either the Internet should a rich all

00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:52,169
human life and the life of all human

00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:55,080
beings which have always been what the

00:04:52,169 --> 00:04:57,270
manifesto is about but it expanded the

00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:59,880
scope of where Mozilla is focused to

00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:01,500
commit to the idea that the internet

00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:04,380
needs to be one that is inclusive and

00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:06,360
welcoming of all people of the earth no

00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:09,419
matter how they identify or who who they

00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:11,569
are aware they're from that the Internet

00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:15,020
needs to be a place that actually

00:05:11,569 --> 00:05:17,130
uplifts facts and critical thinking and

00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:21,060
importantly and very much in the spirit

00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:23,159
of Moz fast that we as Mozilla really

00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:25,710
want to focus on commits collaboration

00:05:23,159 --> 00:05:28,110
between diverse communities working for

00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:30,599
the common good and that isn't what we

00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:32,669
feel on the Internet today fully the

00:05:30,599 --> 00:05:35,699
internet certainly is still full of many

00:05:32,669 --> 00:05:40,590
wonderful things but we've also seen it

00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:42,320
divide exclude and a fuel hate and so I

00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:44,729
really want to call that out because

00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:47,099
what's changed in that nine years since

00:05:44,729 --> 00:05:49,199
the first Maz fast certainly is not what

00:05:47,099 --> 00:05:52,199
I think many of us have wanted to work

00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:55,259
on that but the Mozilla has grown to say

00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:58,530
that scope of making technology better

00:05:55,259 --> 00:06:00,990
for Humanity and that how technology

00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:03,150
fuses into our world is a part of what

00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:05,099
Mozilla really cares about and a part of

00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:06,840
what Mars Fest is about today and you'll

00:06:05,099 --> 00:06:09,210
see that in many aspects of Mars fest

00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:11,610
but just one thing to call out the query

00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:14,159
Moz fest track which has been added this

00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:17,219
year and it's focused on how technology

00:06:14,159 --> 00:06:19,169
connects in to normalization and

00:06:17,219 --> 00:06:20,759
marginalization it really is exciting to

00:06:19,169 --> 00:06:22,710
see the added and it's something you

00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:24,690
should check out and that staff is gonna

00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:28,050
come up here and talk about in a few

00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:29,460
minutes so that is an important change

00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:31,800
and mitchell's going to talk about the

00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:34,620
addendum and the manifesto changes

00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:37,830
tomorrow we hope so go and check out her

00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:39,350
talk around in the middle of the day or

00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,610
later in the afternoon actually I think

00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:45,050
probably one of the last talks

00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:49,940
downstairs so the other thing that has

00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:52,340
changed since since 2018 is the

00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:55,310
headlines tech headlines are different

00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:59,000
it is not the release of the iPad xxx

00:06:55,310 --> 00:07:01,190
said well it may be very exciting and is

00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,640
just around the corner there is going to

00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:06,290
be the top tech headline of 2018 we all

00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:08,000
know what those headlines are going to

00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:09,920
be unless it gets worse which is hard to

00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,880
imagine we all know that it's going to

00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:17,380
be Cambridge analytic or the fast end of

00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:20,240
net neutrality in the US or the horrible

00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:23,930
role that Facebook played in the

00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:26,000
genocide in Burma technology is in a

00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:29,510
very different spot in the headlines and

00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,190
in reality and it means that the work we

00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:33,110
all need to do is that much more

00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:37,160
important the world needs us more and

00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:39,230
the world needs more of us yeah of

00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:43,040
course there actually have been some

00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:46,100
good tech headlines rarely in 2018

00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:48,640
rarely have four letters the letter G

00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:53,750
the letter D the letter P and letter are

00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:55,430
made such you know such headlines you

00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:58,400
know as we have seen in 2019 and that is

00:07:55,430 --> 00:08:00,440
actually a silver lining in terms of the

00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:03,170
work we have all done for 10 or 20 or 30

00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:05,000
years on some of these issues and it's

00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:06,650
not just that the GD P R is in headlines

00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,610
and it's something we can leverage here

00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:12,650
in Europe but that that idea of data

00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:14,720
protection laws is gaining steam in

00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:17,720
places like India and Amba will come up

00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,490
and talk about that in a moment but also

00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:22,760
that the public and governments are

00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:25,400
looking at these topics and so we have a

00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:27,710
real foothold right now as well as a

00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:29,920
real set of pressures and crises and

00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:32,780
that's the reason we picked up this data

00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:35,390
theme this year is to look at how do we

00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:36,860
grab that foothold and you saw some of

00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:39,169
that last night at the science fair

00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:43,190
whether it was the very cool data detox

00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:44,870
kit or the privacy not included buyer's

00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:47,630
guide which is a fun way to kind of

00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:49,550
connect to the idea of data and toys and

00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:52,130
making better choices and by the way you

00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:53,070
can win prizes if you fill in the buyers

00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:56,010
guide so

00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:58,440
plug that as well as the incredible

00:08:56,010 --> 00:09:00,150
great tract game which we saw a

00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,190
previewed last night and you can go plug

00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:05,520
into up there which is about choosing to

00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:07,830
be a tracker or be tracked as you move

00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:09,750
across the Internet so that's a theme

00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:11,850
that we had because it's interesting

00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:14,340
because it's topical but really because

00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:15,960
we have a foothold right now as we look

00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:18,360
at the connection of data to whatever

00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:20,400
work we are all doing here as something

00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:22,770
that structures power structures our

00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:24,840
relationship structures our lives we

00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:27,600
have an opportunity really to make a

00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:28,950
leap forward that we didn't 10 years ago

00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,440
but that we have been building the

00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:33,810
foundations of and so I really invite

00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,780
you to use Moz fast as a chance to

00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:39,330
together grab that foothold certainly

00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:41,130
have some fun as we always do but really

00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:43,770
get out there and rock it and plan

00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:45,450
things as we have always in the spirit

00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:47,250
of monsterous from the beginning that we

00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:49,800
can do together through the year and

00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:51,630
come back next year and show a much

00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:56,030
better set of headlines than the ones

00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:56,030
we've seen in 2018 thank you very much

00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:08,410

Amba I'm amber and I won't tell you what

00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:05,020
I do yet because that's the last bit of

00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:07,450
the talk so this is actually last year

00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:11,050
was my first Moz Fest it was also my

00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:13,540
first month as a Mozilla fellow and well

00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:16,150
as some background I what I do as my day

00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:18,970
job so to speak is that I think about

00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:20,740
and I advocate for the laws that we need

00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:23,110
or we might need for the web that we

00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:25,930
want and what that means is that I spend

00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:28,390
a lot of my time looking at what you

00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:31,030
might think are very dry legal texts in

00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:33,490
gov in and out of government offices and

00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:36,550
often at conferences on panels with

00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:38,830
dudes in suits so when I came to Moz

00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:40,900
first I was like whoa this is kind of

00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:43,480
intimidating but it's also really

00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:45,640
inspiring it was inspiring because in

00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:47,680
some ways I've been I think I've been

00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:49,420
part of this sort of broader movement

00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,970
for Internet health for some years now

00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:54,130
but I didn't really have a sense of what

00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:56,260
people meant when they said the Mozilla

00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:58,150
community and it was only last year that

00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:01,630
I actually had a feel for it and I also

00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:03,010
started to feel a part of it yeah

00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:05,140
so let me and and it's interesting

00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:06,850
because at that time there was just just

00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:08,500
last year last October there was a lot

00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:11,080
of things that were going on back home

00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:13,150
on the issues that I care about so I'll

00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,980
start with Adha which hopefully many of

00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:16,970
you have already heard about but that's

00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:19,670
the Indian government's national ID

00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:21,680
project it was an ID project that kind

00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:24,350
of assigned every Indian resident with a

00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:26,629
12 digit number and that 12 digit number

00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:28,910
was connected to your biometrics your

00:12:26,629 --> 00:12:31,040
fingerprints your iris scans that kind

00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:33,529
of thing but what other I did was that

00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,810
it really started a broader conversation

00:12:33,529 --> 00:12:37,910
about privacy in India because people

00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:40,040
started asking we have this one

00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:42,079
identifier that's kind of following us

00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:43,850
through public services more and more

00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:46,160
private companies are demanding it is

00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:48,110
this not going to create tracking

00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,060
profiling that's accessible to the

00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:52,699
government there was also a separate

00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:54,379
question which was is our data all our

00:12:52,699 --> 00:12:56,689
sensitive information in this one

00:12:54,379 --> 00:12:59,509
centralized database actually safe and

00:12:56,689 --> 00:13:01,339
so with a high what we saw in India was

00:12:59,509 --> 00:13:03,829
that the conversation about data

00:13:01,339 --> 00:13:05,720
protection was not about protecting data

00:13:03,829 --> 00:13:08,269
but it was really about protecting

00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:10,759
people and from that realization

00:13:08,269 --> 00:13:13,339
actually we finally saw the government

00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:15,110
almost forced to act and to realize that

00:13:13,339 --> 00:13:17,209
we didn't actually have any legal

00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:20,089
protections for privacy in India and

00:13:17,209 --> 00:13:21,910
they had to do something not during the

00:13:20,089 --> 00:13:24,110
course of my fellowship I was actually

00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:25,790
privileged to have the support to

00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:28,459
continue the kind of work that had been

00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:30,920
doing for the years before but I also

00:13:28,459 --> 00:13:33,290
had the privilege of being able to step

00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:35,449
out of this comfort zone so specifically

00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:37,699
I got to work with Mozilla's amazing

00:13:35,449 --> 00:13:39,860
consumer democracy team and also with

00:13:37,699 --> 00:13:41,899
their Community Engagement Team so

00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:43,879
sometime early into my fellowship we did

00:13:41,899 --> 00:13:46,309
these set of meetings with community

00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:48,199
members in India and I mean I already

00:13:46,309 --> 00:13:50,000
see some of you here but India is

00:13:48,199 --> 00:13:51,649
definitely one of Mozilla's largest

00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,319
communities and it I think it might be

00:13:51,649 --> 00:13:55,699
one of the most vocal for sure and so it

00:13:54,319 --> 00:13:57,199
was really cool because we did these

00:13:55,699 --> 00:13:59,480
meetings and we were trying to get a

00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:02,029
sense of does the community in India

00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:03,439
care about privacy do they want to what

00:14:02,029 --> 00:14:05,509
do they you know what do they feel about

00:14:03,439 --> 00:14:07,790
it and what we heard from them is that

00:14:05,509 --> 00:14:09,470
they not only cared about privacy in

00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:11,660
India they actually wanted to be more

00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:14,540
involved in this policy fight and they

00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:16,129
wanted to act and so pretty soon after

00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:18,740
that from one of these meetings we had

00:14:16,129 --> 00:14:20,689
this idea to write an open letter from

00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:23,839
Mozilla to the Indian government about

00:14:20,689 --> 00:14:26,029
what was the law that we wanted and a

00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,889
letter that we all worked together to

00:14:26,029 --> 00:14:29,050
prepare was eventually published as a

00:14:27,889 --> 00:14:31,000
full-page ad

00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:32,980
in one of India's largest leading

00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,960
newspapers it was signed by Mitchell

00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:37,210
Baker and thousands of Mozilla community

00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:39,580
members and nothing like this have

00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:40,720
really been tried before and I know from

00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:44,290
my meetings with government officials

00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:46,750
that they definitely did take notice so

00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:48,730
around the same time there was also like

00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:50,470
I mentioned as I was constantly being

00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:52,240
required by all kinds of private

00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:55,780
companies and it wasn't clear why they

00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:58,300
needed that information so we asked so

00:14:55,780 --> 00:15:00,910
Mozilla's advocacy team actually ran a

00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:03,550
campaign where they asked why Amazon for

00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:07,030
example required an ad hire number to

00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:09,070
track a lost package Amazon very quickly

00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:11,020
after that campaign retreated this

00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:12,940
requirement and they kind of removed it

00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:16,150
and said it was no longer mandatory and

00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:18,130
we've had many of these similar kinds of

00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:20,560
incremental victories just in the last

00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:22,060
year so most imp like I think just this

00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,340
month it was that the Indian Supreme

00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:27,370
Court said that look at hi cannot be

00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:29,260
used for unlimited private uses this has

00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:31,570
to be limited this has to be regulated

00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:33,220
and actually that data protection law

00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:35,650
that I talked to you about we have a

00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:37,540
draft law out in the public and it might

00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:40,840
go to the Indian Parliament as soon as

00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:43,780
this winter so in a sense a lot has

00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:45,490
moved and I and again this this law is

00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:49,030
not perfect and we continue to advocate

00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:51,310
for changes in fact I personally am now

00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:53,740
advocating on behalf of Mozilla so I

00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:56,290
recently joined Mozilla's amazing policy

00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:58,330
team and I get to speak up as a tech

00:15:56,290 --> 00:16:00,610
company a tech company that believes

00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:02,650
that privacy and innovation are not at

00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:05,170
odds and is not afraid to advocate for

00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:06,820
strong law and so this is kind of

00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:10,060
amazing in many ways but I think

00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:12,760
personally it's been kind of awesome to

00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:15,310
see this privacy fight on so many fronts

00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:17,440
on in the products that we build in the

00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:19,510
policies that we advocate for in the

00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,830
campaign's that we run and finally in

00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:22,810
this community so I'm really really

00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:24,340
privileged to be here and I will just

00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:28,120
quickly plug before I hand off to

00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:30,220
Stephanie tomorrow at 3:30 if I'm not

00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,750
mistaken 3:30 to 5:00 we're going to run

00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:33,520
two sessions on our hire and data

00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:35,950
protection and if you want to hear me

00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:38,110
talk more about data protection then at

00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:39,490
11:15 in the dialogues and debates room

00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:42,919
thank you so much

00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:42,919
[Applause]

00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:52,780
good morning welcome to mass fest and

00:16:50,130 --> 00:17:01,360
welcome to the queering mass fest

00:16:52,780 --> 00:17:05,560
experience so you all know what a lense

00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:08,680
is right a lense is a piece of glass

00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:11,920
that allows you to look at the world in

00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:14,170
a different way with a querying mass

00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:18,010
fest experience we're presenting you

00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:23,290
with a special kind of lens acquiring

00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:25,630
lamps a queering lens allows you to look

00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:28,390
at the world from the perspective of

00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:30,520
people who have been who have been

00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:33,630
marginalized because they experienced

00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:37,960
gender and sexuality differently

00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:41,230
take a queering lens use a good

00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:44,800
Honus flight and look at ordinary things

00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:48,460
around you look at what you do every day

00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:52,360
look at what people say every day look

00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:55,540
at the way you dress look at the way you

00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:59,080
walk how close to people are sending to

00:17:55,540 --> 00:18:01,720
each other when they're talking listen

00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:04,930
to the first questions you ask when you

00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:07,260
meet a person listen to the first

00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:12,280
question you ask when your baby is born

00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:17,380
now take a step back and pause and ask

00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:21,220
yourself is it ordinary is it normal

00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:26,380
could it be done differently and what

00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:30,610
would that change the trans and feminist

00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:35,020
activist Julia Serano uses the concept

00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:37,660
of being marked she argues that some

00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:41,650
people because they look or behave

00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:44,320
differently look out of the ordinary

00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:48,400
they look exceptional and hence they are

00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:50,230
being marked let's take an example you

00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,540
are at a party and you're meeting a

00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:55,480
person for the first time and you ask

00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:59,430
her what she's doing for a living and

00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:03,040
she tells you well I'm a teacher if

00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:06,430
you've been at school if you used to be

00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:11,020
around teachers then it wants him out of

00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:15,730
the ordinary now she tells you I'm a sex

00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:17,980
worker if she's the first person you

00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:20,320
know who told you who tells you that

00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:22,930
she's a sex worker there are high

00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:25,270
chances that you're going to mark this

00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:30,790
person as being out of the ordinary

00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:33,900
from your perspective queer people in

00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:37,950
our societies are being marked as

00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:42,390
privileged target for discrimination and

00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:46,360
violence and this goes beyond gender and

00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:49,450
sexuality people of color people with

00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:53,920
mental or physical disabilities poor

00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:58,000
people are queer bodies and queer bodies

00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:59,920
can be tracked measures monitored so

00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:05,980
they can be controlled and even

00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:09,790
eliminated in that story technology and

00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:14,200
the internet play a role and it has two

00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:18,700
ages technology can be an ally for us to

00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:21,730
connect to meet to organize together but

00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:26,950
it can also be a tool for normalization

00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:29,650
and repression so this year with the

00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:33,820
queering mass fest experienced queer

00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:36,280
activists technologists designers and

00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:39,070
artists are going to share the

00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:41,950
perspective and challenge the way we

00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:45,640
think about bodies and how technology

00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:48,550
can impact it throughout the weekend

00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:52,060
they will lead sessions on each floor

00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:56,440
and each space and you are very welcome

00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:59,440
to attend in addition to that we have a

00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:02,560
dedicated querying space right up there

00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:04,990
on the sixth floor balcony and if I had

00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:06,820

Mark pointed out this is a time of

00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:15,789
complexity and non positivity in many

00:22:13,659 --> 00:22:18,099
parts of the internet but you are in a

00:22:15,789 --> 00:22:20,679

00:22:50,499 --> 00:22:56,829

00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:26,600
45-minute queue and if you're at the 45

00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:28,520
minute mark in the queue you get to your

00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:30,200

let this be a weekend of listening and

00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,720
learning from one another

00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:41,780
interrupting other folks when they talk

00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,820
is a party foul show respect let others

00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:45,170
finish what they're saying be good to

00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:48,020
those who are sharing thoughts and

00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:49,970
asking questions and finally has anyone

00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:53,090
here ever been trapped in a religious

00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:55,580
debate over open versus free or iOS

00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:57,710
versus Android or something where people

00:23:55,580 --> 00:24:00,170
should not be fighting to the death of

00:23:57,710 --> 00:24:02,300
people been there anybody survivors let

00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:04,880
us agree to disagree let us lay down our

00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:07,160
Linux variants disagreement and just be

00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,890
in solidarity around a healthy Internet

00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:12,710
these are ways to show respect how can

00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:14,690
we keep this inclusive I apologize for

00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:16,550
being an ugly American who speaks the

00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:18,650
English language too quickly

00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:20,960
let us remember how many people here

00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:23,780
speak English as a second or a tenth

00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:27,260
language let us speak slowly and clearly

00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:28,400
and let us not throw jargon shade has

00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:30,710
anyone ever been in a meeting where

00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:33,020
someone used a big word just to take

00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:36,170
over through an acronym out there

00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:38,180
57 word yeah it's like no let us use the

00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:39,950
simplest language that we can use to be

00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:42,680
good to one another and keep things

00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:44,780
inclusive friends someone hears a

00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:47,360
monologue err I'm a recovering monologue

er myself when you speak make one point

00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:53,870
in these groups in a room of n people

00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:55,670
speak 1 n of the time we want equitable

00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:57,110
conversation bandwidth where all voices

00:24:55,670 --> 00:25:00,140
are heard

00:24:57,110 --> 00:25:02,120
overall friends questions are acts of

00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:05,390
heroic leadership if they are not

00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:08,330

00:27:50,049 --> 00:27:54,279
tell you requires memorization and the

00:27:52,659 --> 00:27:56,440
good news is most of us will probably

00:27:54,279 --> 00:27:59,980
know the answer later if you are a

00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:02,470
person who likes hot lunches your lunch

00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:04,960
can be found on floors four and seven

00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:06,970
during the lunchtime hour whereas if

00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,770
you're like me a grab-and-go kind of

00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:10,210
person and it's okay if it's in a box

00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:12,850
and not particularly warm

00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:15,610
Bilby grab-and-go lunch is on zero four

00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:17,919
seven and nine so we've got it both ways

00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:19,390
to sit down and enjoy a hot lunch or

00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:22,630
they have it on your lap somewhere else

00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:25,029
but that's the lunch truth this event

00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:26,950
would not be possible if it was not for

00:28:25,029 --> 00:28:29,919
the generosity of people that are

00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:32,529
