I have to my right for those of you they

00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:09,240
require a little introduction I would

00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:11,010
have thought so we have a Mitchell Brett

00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,679
Baker who's executive chairwoman of

00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:15,660
Mozilla and we have Mark Thurmond who is

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,820
executive director so let me sit down

00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,859
and speak to you both so I don't know

00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:21,420
about you guys out there but certainly

00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:23,100
when I was telling people what I was

00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,570
doing this weekend and I said I was

00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,920
coming to Moss first the first thing I

00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,590
have to do is explain it doesn't involve

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,000
Morrissey and then the second the second

00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,949
thing yeah that's the British thing and

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,410
then the second thing I have to do is

00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:36,630
explain and that you know the Firefox

00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:38,370
the people who you know who who make

00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:40,559
Firefox so does they everybody can

00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:41,730
relate to that I imagine so so that

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,219
leads me to the first question you're

00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:46,020
like why do something that's completely

00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:52,440
different to Firefox or is it completely

00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:53,730
different to Firefox Mitchell well you

00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,469
know I see that everything that Mozilla

00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:57,030
does is related so I don't think it's

00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:59,910
completely different you know Mozilla's

00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:02,280
general goal is a build part of the

00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:04,409
internet that promotes openness and

00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,790
accessibility build our technical

00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:08,220
infrastructure as a global public

00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:11,159
resource and build a community of people

00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:14,010
who care about that want to build that

00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:15,780
and are actually using open open

00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:18,150
Internet open technologies and open

00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:21,229
principles in their own work so for me

00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:25,009
it's all on a spectrum the technical

00:01:21,229 --> 00:01:28,290
product piece gives us huge leverage

00:01:25,009 --> 00:01:31,409
there is a you know a phrase software's

00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:34,650
code meaning software code is legal code

00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:36,360
is social code because technology has so

00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:38,670
much impact on what we do so I'm a

00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,710
subscriber to that but also that the

00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:42,960
power of people of actual individuals to

00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:44,759
make our own lives we're lucky right now

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,740
the Internet is a technology that has a

00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:49,409
lot of possibilities for that and the

00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:53,119
sense of people engaging and practicing

00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:56,549
open and building their own fields with

00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:58,079
some of the principles that we also

00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:00,060
illustrate in the internet and in

00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:02,250
Firefox is a long term legacy that's

00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:09,239
really key so for me it's all it's all

00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:12,510
along a spectrum and I guess you know

00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:13,990
why Mars fast is that people part of it

00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:16,000
and is why I go back to

00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:17,770
ooh a version of our mission that's in

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,240
our kind of charter who talks about us

00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:22,480
guarding the open nature of the Internet

00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:23,770
or keeping it healthy and what Mozilla

00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,410
did in the first era I guess what

00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:29,230
attracted me is really have an impact

00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:30,640
through software and technology I mean

00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:33,280
we would not have the internet we had

00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:36,970
today had Firefox and and other things

00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,440
not emerged but we're also at a moment

00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:40,540
where while it was people in the

00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:42,910
beginning that made Firefox that made it

00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:45,070
popular there's a broader need for that

00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:47,260
movement piece so I often think about us

00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:49,120
in this era needing both to be in the

00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:51,250
market which is what we were good in the

00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,840
beginning at but really fuel the

00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:55,450
movement piece as well and the movement

00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:57,820
in the market together so for me that's

00:02:55,450 --> 00:03:00,100
really what Moz Fest is is about is that

00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:01,870
people and movement part so that we've

00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:03,910
got that voice and sort of pushing

00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:06,550
things ahead and you heard that you know

00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:07,780
this morning as we opened up is there's

00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:10,600
a lot of different stuff this year

00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:12,190
including this speaker series but the

00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,520
art and culture piece and whatever that

00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:16,960
is about taking the movement beyond

00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:19,090
really just being a technology centric

00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:21,130
movement and just let's have a show of

00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:26,110
hands so who for who is this their first

00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:28,450
Moss fest welcome most people Wow let's

00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:30,480
give you a round of applause and for

00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:34,390
those who's been before who's a veteran

00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:36,940
okay yeah great okay I'm pleasantly

00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:39,700
surprised it's always nice to meet our

00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:41,980
friends here but also to meet new people

00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:43,570
of course and it's always evolving so

00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:45,790
let's talk about something that happened

00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:47,560
very recently and kind of you know what

00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:50,890
there's been on a lot of people's minds

00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:52,750
and this kind of did a DDoS attack you

00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:54,520
know a little more than a week ago and

00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:56,560
you know talk to us a little bit about

00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:58,600
how we situate that and how we how we

00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,210
can think about you know what's

00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:07,240
happening right now to online and with

00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:08,450
the web all right well master you know

00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,860
for

00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:12,020
for those of us who've been around

00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:15,350
forever like the nature of the internet

00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:17,480
or the open Internet or the the open

00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:19,840
principles of the internet underlying so

00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:22,010
much of what's possible today is

00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,610
something we've grown up within as

00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:27,560
something obvious but I think for those

00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:30,050
if that's not true of everyone and it's

00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:31,669
really it's it's sometimes it's just so

00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:34,490
easy today since the network is

00:04:31,669 --> 00:04:36,260
everywhere through devices and phones to

00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:37,730
sort of take it for granted and assume

00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:39,890
that the things that were accustomed to

00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:42,919
being able to do are just part of the

00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:48,940
environment and that's partially true I

00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:48,940
think what this DDoS attack means for

00:04:53,680 --> 00:05:00,919
means for all of us is time to actually

00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:02,750
reflect on the nature of the Internet or

00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:05,060
the underlying structure and that it

00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:06,770
actually does require attention like

00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:10,010
this particular attack it's not that a

00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:12,110
general consumer will be able to fix it

00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:14,810
right it requires expertise to fix it

00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:17,930
but it is a call that the the network

00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:20,270
itself the the Internet is like a living

00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:22,580
organism and ecosystem and it requires

00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:26,270
attention from many different levels and

00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:28,340
that both in policy that's going to be

00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:30,590
important and so much of what we rely on

00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:32,660
whether it's openness in education or

00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:35,390
open data or science or the ability to

00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:37,640
access people globally relies on this

00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:39,500
underlying infrastructure and that some

00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:42,919
folks in attention there is really

00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:45,470
important I think you know the building

00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:47,000
on that the the piece and you know I'm

00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:49,340
sure everybody read it but if you didn't

00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,410
this whole DDoS attack that happened was

00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:53,780
using CCTV cameras and other things that

00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:56,510
are taking over a computer per se to

00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:59,270
build a botnet and it also speaks to the

00:05:56,510 --> 00:06:00,800
both the scale of the ecosystem that is

00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:03,200
growing just a scale of the internet our

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,300
lives as we move into this connected

00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:07,850
devices era he's gonna be huge right

00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:09,800
we're talking about moving from however

00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:12,380
many small numbers of millions were

00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,840
online when you know when Firefox first

00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:16,270
came out of the first priscila browser

00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,220
was released tens of millions of hundred

00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:20,550
millions do you know where we're

00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:24,130
probably will be at about five billion

00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:25,540
Internet users including phones over the

00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:28,330
next couple years but will be at twenty

00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:30,729
billion devices and so just the surface

00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:33,310
area of that ecosystem and the areas of

00:06:30,729 --> 00:06:36,070
risk really become huge and we you know

00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:38,560
ups all of our lives so there is a also

00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:40,270
a piece in that of people starting to

00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,190
understand that and to a certain degree

00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:44,199
starting to understand you know like the

00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:46,750
natural environment that often we take

00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:49,660
for granted we all have a role to play

00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:51,850
in it as you know people once that moves

00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:54,030
from being a CCTV camera that may be in

00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:56,410
your office to being your baby monitor

00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:59,530
people might start to think about these

00:06:56,410 --> 00:07:01,270
things a bit different so you that's

00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:03,040
kind of thing we all have a role in this

00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:04,630
that talked to me we sing people of all

00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,340
ages here and you know a seven-year-old

00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:08,470
running a session four on raspberry pi

00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:11,289
for example so talk to me about the

00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:16,360
leadership and and kind of that idea of

00:07:11,289 --> 00:07:18,729
the web Mitchell well you know Mozilla

00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:21,820
Wave is saying we're hopeful that

00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:25,570
everyone is a leader and it can sound a

00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:28,840
little trite but at a deep level we do

00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:30,090
mean that and obviously each one of us

00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,800
has to be leader for our own lives

00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:34,539
really there are people around you but

00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:38,289
but we are each responsible for

00:07:34,539 --> 00:07:40,240
ourselves ultimately and there are this

00:07:38,289 --> 00:07:43,000
range of opportunities that the

00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,669
technology can enhance or or diminish

00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,039
and and we have a core technology that

00:07:45,669 --> 00:07:52,570
that allows enhancing of that and so

00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:54,910
leadership we try to work from that

00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:57,880
general principle meaning like the

00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:59,800
empowerment of individuals is also

00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:01,240
sometimes trite but also really deep

00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,190
like I used to not like the word

00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:05,560
empowerment it seemed too yucky

00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:07,419
but I've given up because it has a

00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:10,570
meaning that's hard to find and in any

00:08:07,419 --> 00:08:13,510
other word and and the core underlying

00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:17,169
architecture of the Internet is actually

00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:19,389
about empowering lots of connections at

00:08:17,169 --> 00:08:24,080
the very edges and so it's a good

00:08:19,389 --> 00:08:26,060
metaphor for individuals having

00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,949
or understanding and ability to affect

00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:31,099
our own lives and so that's the core of

00:08:27,949 --> 00:08:33,320
what we're trying to do and in fact we

00:08:31,099 --> 00:08:35,690
even think that Firefox is a way of

00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:39,110
doing that and that's why we built it we

00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:40,789
think of Firefox as a quote user agent I

00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:42,829
mean it's a browser yes but what is a

00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:46,220
browser it's the thing that represents

00:08:42,829 --> 00:08:48,140
you online and it used to be the only

00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:50,000
thing was the universal client that

00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:52,430
represented you online and so it had

00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,260
protections for you built-in it allowed

00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:56,480
you as an individual to change what the

00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:58,220
website is delivering to you something

00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,410
that's not nearly as possible anymore

00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:06,649
and that ability to work on your behalf

00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:09,589
is everything is simple from the size of

00:09:06,649 --> 00:09:10,730
the the font that appears like you can

00:09:09,589 --> 00:09:13,490
change that across your entire

00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:17,240
experience not app by app to as profound

00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:19,459
as setting the terms on which your

00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:21,620
tracked across the web which Firefox

00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:23,480
allows you to do more than you know more

00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:26,779
than most so it's supposed to represent

00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:29,540
you and be the tool through which by

00:09:26,779 --> 00:09:32,570
default we represent you but you has a

00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:35,120
choice of how much you want to tune and

00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:36,769
get involved yourself and so our view of

00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,720
leadership is to try and do that in all

00:09:36,769 --> 00:09:40,910
areas through the technology through

00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,160
understanding and education through

00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:45,440
practicing open and through every way

00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:49,130
that anybody here can actually think of

00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:52,010
I think it's the the thing I would add

00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:55,970
and connect it back here to to Moz fest

00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:57,440
is you know it's somebody who wasn't

00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:59,209
there as a founder at the beginning I

00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,980
can say really nice things it's not

00:09:59,209 --> 00:10:02,750
about my ego that the early days of

00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:04,519
Mozilla that really through a

00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:07,220
combination of some smart decisions and

00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:08,449
lock in the environment there was an

00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:11,420
ability to take leadership and really

00:10:08,449 --> 00:10:13,820
shift things with Firefox and if I think

00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:16,850
now you know one organization whether

00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:18,470
it's Mozilla or Wikipedia or a start-up

00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:22,250
on Kickstarter that has a radical open

00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:24,019
idea he's not likely on its own gonna

00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:26,480
make that level of a shift there's gonna

00:10:24,019 --> 00:10:28,610
have to be a bunch of fronts in terms of

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,199
how a healthy Internet continues to

00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:31,950
emerge how we tackle everything from

00:10:30,199 --> 00:10:33,900
security to the equity

00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:35,580
is too you know are there ever open

00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:38,040
smartphones in the future what happens

00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:40,920
with the future of IOT and the values we

00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:42,870
have and so I think that what MOSFETs

00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,370
for me represents is something that all

00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:46,890
of us need to do and certainly Mozilla

00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:48,870
needs to do more is find more people

00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:50,970
going after more of the problems in more

00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:53,430
different ways because it won't just be

00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:57,480
one browser that actually makes the

00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:58,530
difference and so to me it is the kind

00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,660
of people here who are trying to take a

00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:02,130
shot at a different kind of Internet or

00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:05,490
protecting the kind of Internet we love

00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:06,900
they're kind of leaders we need and you

00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:08,550
know what's interesting is it's not just

00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:11,040
that we all can take that leadership we

00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:12,630
also need to invest in each other and

00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,940
there's people and that's also but the

00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:17,550
spirit of this place is is we actually

00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:19,380
get better and more likely to succeed by

00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:21,210
doing things like we do here at Moz fest

00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:22,680
and it's why we're looking at this open

00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:26,400
their net leadership network concept as

00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:28,110
well great and one of the themes of

00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:30,600
these talks is Digital Inclusion you'll

00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:32,070
see to my left there are we are being

00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,760
inclusive in the fact that there's a

00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:37,410
live transcription series going on and

00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:39,390
they're also streaming live to Facebook

00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:42,900
so hello to those people who are joining

00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:44,700
who are not in the room now let's see if

00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:48,270
and I'm sure a lot of you have questions

00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:49,500
or comments or call-to-action or or you

00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:52,320
know just want to share something very

00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:54,030
very brief with us so please do raise

00:11:52,320 --> 00:12:00,090
your hand if you'd like to ask a

00:11:54,030 --> 00:12:02,700
question and in the middle here yeah I

00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:04,890
just want to ask what's your opinion on

00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:08,160
the Tor network which is the dark web

00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:12,330
and the tor browser is exclusively run

00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:14,700
off Mozilla Firefox and do you think

00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:17,130
that it's a it's a good thing where

00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:18,810
people have more control of the content

00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:20,340
that I want to look out in their own

00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:23,310
privacy or do you think it's a bad thing

00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:26,040
where peer where people can you know

00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:28,650
just do what they want share you know

00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:33,990
follow images or sell drugs on that

00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:36,140
network well the thing about a powerful

00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:37,350
technology is it's powerful for

00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:39,390
everything

00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:41,910
dynamite is the same way right our

00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:43,660
explosives are the same way and in fact

00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:48,880
this I think we're the Nobel Prize

00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:50,769
was uh was to take the the results of

00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:54,310
some you know if dynamite and also turn

00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:57,819
it into more positive responses so power

00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:59,829
is power and and so when you empower

00:12:57,819 --> 00:13:01,120
people and you empower all of human

00:12:59,829 --> 00:13:03,250
nature and you get some negative things

00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,529
out of it and you know human nature is

00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:07,509
pretty varied you know as a species we

00:13:05,529 --> 00:13:10,029
do some really amazing things and we do

00:13:07,509 --> 00:13:12,069
some unbelievably degraded and awful

00:13:10,029 --> 00:13:14,560
things to each other and to our

00:13:12,069 --> 00:13:16,480
environment and so if you actually

00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:19,240
believe in empowerment as a value it's a

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:22,420
real thing and in mozilla we do and so

00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:25,029
we believe that individuals should be

00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:27,850
safe and secure and should be able to

00:13:25,029 --> 00:13:30,899
secure themselves and so we are an

00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:33,790
organization that believes in encryption

00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:37,750
we believe in the ability of individual

00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:40,569
citizens to be safe and to have a degree

00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:46,149
of privacy that allows for safety and so

00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:48,939
we are supporters of technologies that

00:13:46,149 --> 00:13:52,569
allow individuals to do that right and

00:13:48,939 --> 00:13:54,430
and of course it's it's easy to just

00:13:52,569 --> 00:13:58,509
sweep beside the fact that also allows

00:13:54,430 --> 00:14:01,569
people who are doing things one doesn't

00:13:58,509 --> 00:14:03,339
want to see additional freedoms too and

00:14:01,569 --> 00:14:04,420
so you have to always be trying to build

00:14:03,339 --> 00:14:06,310
healthy communities and healthy

00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:08,800
societies and you know today the world

00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:11,019
is you know really in a phase of

00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,209
disruption and so it is actually takes a

00:14:11,019 --> 00:14:16,389
pretty fundamental value to continue to

00:14:13,209 --> 00:14:19,240
believe in encryption for all of us and

00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:22,660
to believe in the technologies but but

00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:24,430
we we upstream patches from tor like

00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:28,120
intentionally and into the core of

00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:29,800
Firefox so that there are the the things

00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:32,860
that are necessary for the tor browser

00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:34,240
to work are included in the court

00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:37,060
distribution so that the maintenance

00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:39,009
pieces is less you know tor is is not

00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:41,949
just a browser it's a whole system and

00:14:39,009 --> 00:14:44,620
so they offer a complete system but as I

00:14:41,949 --> 00:14:46,240
say this is a I don't actually use the

00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:49,209
word privacy so much I use the word

00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,709
personal security and it's very clear in

00:14:49,209 --> 00:14:54,639
today's environment that sometimes

00:14:50,709 --> 00:14:56,320
personal security of citizens is at

00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,630
least in part and opposite

00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:01,390
to some national security needs for

00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:03,310
surveilling citizens so so your values

00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:06,490
are really important in that case and

00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:08,830
for us this empowerment and security and

00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:12,910
personal security as well for all of us

00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:13,960
is a pretty key Mozilla value they could

00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:25,690
not have said it better

00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:28,930
great who else has a question looking

00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:31,510
into alternatives for Facebook from the

00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:35,430
few points from Mozilla because Firefox

00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:35,430
could be a nice starting point their

00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:39,970
alternatives to face but one of the

00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:41,590
things that was a nap for those of you

00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:43,180
who were here this morning she kind of

00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:45,180
was talking about the the kind of the

00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:47,320
good the bad the ugly of

00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:48,940
decentralization Andry centralization

00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:50,920
within Facebook and one of the things

00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:52,090
she did say was was kind of like we

00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:55,240
needs more competition in the

00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:58,480
marketplace of etcetera well it's a I'll

00:15:55,240 --> 00:16:00,490
leave mark to pick up that thread it's I

00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,920
mean it's a complicated one I would say

00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:05,080
not directly and we're looking at that

00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:06,850
issue of walled gardens and

00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:09,970
centralization and and part of the

00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:12,550
challenges in looking at it is it is

00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:15,610
that centralization and aggregation of

00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:18,250
users and ultimately of a power that

00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:21,310
does kind of tip things in what I think

00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:25,060
is the wrong direction and how you go

00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:26,830
out that at that without becoming it is

00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:28,630
a really tough question much less how

00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:30,250
would you actually have a product that

00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:32,830
goes into the market and others have

00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:35,020
thrived you know to look at alternative

00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:38,620
social networks one of the things that I

00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:41,860
think about personally is are there ways

00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:45,130
to other ways and maybe Firefox can help

00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:46,930
to aggregate people in a kind of a

00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:49,450
bigger way is there some sort of co-op

00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:51,550
or membership or some way that the

00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:53,890
people who do want a different version

00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:55,450
of how we communicate can actually all

00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:57,760
gather around and maybe in a manner

00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:58,480
that's less centralized and we have the

00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,579
answer for that

00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:05,459
I spend a lot of time thinking about

00:17:00,579 --> 00:17:08,140
that the other piece is you know where

00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:11,049
where is technology not the only answer

00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:12,939
and I think you will see as sort of

00:17:11,049 --> 00:17:15,280
monopolies emerge in some of these

00:17:12,939 --> 00:17:16,630
spaces that policy and regulation is a

00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,880
part of the answer you've already seen

00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:21,669
it with Facebook in the context of

00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,230
zero-rating in India where you know the

00:17:21,669 --> 00:17:25,209
citizens and the government said this is

00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:27,189
too much centralization and too much

00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:29,590
power so I think you will actually see

00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:32,140
both the market and the movement as as

00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:33,520
needing to be key levers as we try to

00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:35,860
figure out what does it look like to

00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:42,210
keep the Internet as something open and

00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:44,740
empowering to people yeah you know

00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:46,750
complicated as it is I think Facebook is

00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:50,590
one of the great companies of the

00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:54,850
Internet era and I don't see and don't

00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:58,450
particularly myself like have a goal

00:17:54,850 --> 00:18:00,669
from Mozilla to do a open Facebook kind

00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:02,830
of piece I do believe like that that the

00:18:00,669 --> 00:18:04,179
vision that that duck has about social

00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:05,890
is a real thing and you know I'm from

00:18:04,179 --> 00:18:07,929
the valley so the vision of the founders

00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:10,720
you know in the company like I'm bought

00:18:07,929 --> 00:18:12,580
into that and so I actually don't think

00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,559
anybody could beat Facebook at what

00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:16,390
Facebook does like that vision is very

00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:18,820
real the whole company is built around

00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:20,919
it and I don't like I don't think

00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:23,830
anybody can beat that and I wouldn't try

00:18:20,919 --> 00:18:26,290
and so that then there is a question as

00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:30,940
Mark said of what are the communications

00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:33,669
areas are there places where the social

00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:35,890
vision does not make sense and certainly

00:18:33,669 --> 00:18:37,360
for me there are a lot of places where

00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:42,340
the social vision does not make sense

00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:45,340
and so I see the most productive

00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:47,740
approach for at least me it is to say

00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:49,660
Facebook is there it does a certain

00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:52,299
thing in a way nobody else is ever going

00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:53,830
to do it's their thing and that social

00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:55,299
aspect is really important and it

00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:58,419
provides a lot of value and people like

00:18:55,299 --> 00:18:59,950
it there are also for most of us maybe

00:18:58,419 --> 00:19:01,809
not all I mean you know maybe some

00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:03,340
people are social and everything but for

00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:05,559
most of us there are some things where

00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:09,380
that degree of social slash open slash

00:19:05,559 --> 00:19:11,690
tracked slash monetized approach

00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:13,310
is not what we want what are they where

00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:15,590
are they and how do we aim more

00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:18,620
specifically at providing an alternative

00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:20,420
in those spaces and you know we tried

00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:23,150
with identity we actually had a good

00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:24,320
technical system but we couldn't we

00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:27,200
didn't find the product that people

00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:29,870
wanted we didn't find the thing that

00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,240
caused tens of millions or 100 million

00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:34,010
people to say I want a new identity and

00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,590
I'm gonna bother to create a new

00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:39,290
identity and actually use it and so I

00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:40,910
think over time we will find that if not

00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:42,470
ask somebody will because I've added

00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:43,640
that is a pretty clear need I'm

00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:45,560
certainly not going to sign up for

00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:47,870
government services with my Facebook ID

00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:52,070
and but so I think that there are many

00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:54,590
areas where the vision of social the

00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:56,750
power of that vision doesn't make sense

00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:58,820
and that I think is the space where

00:19:56,750 --> 00:20:01,070
someone I hope Mozilla can lead it or

00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:02,870
spark ador support it or you know give

00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:04,820
some resources to ever figures it out

00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:06,800
but I think there are areas like that

00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:11,110
and and figuring out how to accelerate

00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:11,110
those areas and make them legitimate is

00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:16,100
thanks for that question

00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:17,720
and so I think we're out of time but I

00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:19,910
want to also thank you for doing this in

00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:21,680
London I know that you know some people

00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:22,940
might assume that a lot of these things

00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,860
happen in the US so I'm particularly

00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:26,780
grateful myself and how many of you from

00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:30,530
from overseas have done a flown in for

00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:34,850
for it okay about half half I'm thinking

00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:36,530
yeah so thank you and the other thing I

00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:40,160
want to thank you for is the the fact

00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:41,300
that this is a festival about doing you

00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,950
know we all go to these conferences

00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:45,470
where we kind of sit and listen and

00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:47,630
think and then do nothing afterwards and

00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:49,910
but you know it hands on it always has

00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:52,190
been it's you know I continues to be

00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:55,070
hands on so if you've got any closing

00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:56,960
remarks on the thoughts of doing and

00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:58,580
being being here in London rather than

00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,180
anywhere else and then you know I have

00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:02,660
to you too

00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:05,090
certainly on the theme of building and

00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:07,310
doing it really is that the heart of

00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:08,179
what we started with Mazda seven years

00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:10,850
ago and

00:21:08,179 --> 00:21:13,730
means the heart of it and the idea that

00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:15,619
what we can build I think is is evolving

00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:18,559
and that that's really exciting to use

00:21:15,619 --> 00:21:20,330
really whether it's doing the art piece

00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:22,519
of it doing the code piece of it doing

00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:23,899
the campaign epc of it so many other

00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:26,210
things that people are actually working

00:21:23,899 --> 00:21:28,490
on that are concrete here all of that is

00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:30,019
needed to build the kind of future for

00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:33,049
the web we wanted the future for

00:21:30,019 --> 00:21:35,090
Humanity we want so keeping this as a

00:21:33,049 --> 00:21:35,749
barn raising we're constantly raising

00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:38,899
new barns

00:21:35,749 --> 00:21:40,340
is really really important and hopefully

00:21:38,899 --> 00:21:43,009
we've seen this happen but it's

00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:45,139
certainly an ask of all of you that that

00:21:43,009 --> 00:21:46,490
those barns are you things you continue

00:21:45,139 --> 00:21:48,049
to build throughout the year and that

00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:50,090
these relationships are relationships

00:21:48,049 --> 00:21:52,190
you continue to grow because it is

00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:54,769
really a global network of people who

00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:57,200
want the internet to be positive for the

00:21:54,769 --> 00:21:58,840
world and remain open that's going to

00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,369
make the difference

00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:03,679
I'd add quickly London it's been a great

00:22:01,369 --> 00:22:05,690
home for us Ravensbourne has been a

00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:07,909
phenomenal home for us and many thanks

00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:10,940
for letting us take it over for the

00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:12,980
weekend and that the true sign of

00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:17,450
success is when things run out of

00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:20,119
control and so it is my hope that we

00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:22,039
find Maas was running out of control in

00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:24,499
ways that we don't see and understand

00:22:22,039 --> 00:22:26,450
and that bits our parts are all of us

00:22:24,499 --> 00:22:29,240
faster the idea or the events or the

00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:32,080
happenings pop up all over and it begins

00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:34,850
to look pretty chaotic because it's

00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:37,299
gathering steam Thanks all right okay

00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:37,299
awesome bombs

00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,800
