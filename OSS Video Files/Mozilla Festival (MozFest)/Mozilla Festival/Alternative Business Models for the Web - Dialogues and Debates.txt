Title: Alternative Business Models for the Web - Dialogues and Debates
Publication date: 2020-09-29
Playlist: Mozilla Festival
Description: 
	Right now, the web has a single reigning business model: digital advertising, a $300 billion industry annually.This business model has upsides, like “free” access to content, tools, and platforms. But there are also steep harms — and consumers bear the brunt of them. Today’s AI-powered targeted advertisements can spread misinformation and disinformation. They can reinforce societal biases and discrimination. They can increase surveillance. And they can even harm the environment.It may be possible to reform digital advertising to mitigate these harms, but it is also possible to introduce mainstream alternatives?The latest installment of the MozFest Dialogues & Debates series will interrogate the web’s reigning business model — digital advertising — and explore whether alternatives can become mainstream.

that later

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,599
and one last thing we are taking

00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:24,640
questions for the panel in real time

00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:27,840
tweet them at mozilla with the hashtag

00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,840
dialogues and debates

00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,239
okay let's get started the web

00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,040
celebrated

00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,000
its 27th birthday this year a quarter a

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,480
century ago it

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,560
wasn't necessarily predetermined that

00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,120
the web would be powered by advertising

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,319
but that's sort of how it's evolved i

00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,680
don't want to give the impression in

00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,920
having this conversation that all

00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,360
advertising is harmful it's not

00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,959
advertising has supported everything

00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,879
from local newspapers to network

00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,959
television and has a place

00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,560
but today's digital advertisements have

00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,959
very little in common

00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,519
with traditional advertising so let's

00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:04,159
start with some context

00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:06,080
and i'll ask one of you to kick off with

00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:08,640
an answer to each of these questions but

00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,879
the others please chime in after if you

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,040
have something to add

00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,159
so to get us started with some context

00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,760
how prevalent

00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:21,200
and powerful is digital advertising and

00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,879
what about advertising has changed and

00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,200
how did we get here

00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,959
natalie will you kick us off thanks

00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,799
janice and thank you so much to mozilla

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,040
for organizing this conversation

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,319
i think it's a really important one so

00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,799
the the roots of

00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,080
uh of targeted advertising on the web go

00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:39,280
back to uh to the late

00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,840
90s uh when um a lot of the fashions

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,680
that we

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,440
uh would be seeing today if any of us

00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,319
actually ventured outside uh were

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,840
were cool for the first time and when

00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,959
google search

00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,360
was was first born so google search uh

00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,200
as

00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,799
some of you may remember and others of

00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,920
you may have learned

00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:00,799
since then was really one of the first

00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,680
products to make it easy for people to

00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,159
uh to

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,319
to surf the web to find things without

00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,040
clicking uh from one site to another and

00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,879
kind of

00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,560
just either already knowing where you're

00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,799
going or

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,000
or just serendipitously stumbling onto

00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:17,759
things and

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,639
uh and it did that by using uh um

00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,120
by by scraping uh the web and figuring

00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,000
out

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,400
what's more popular uh or more likely to

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,280
in

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,199
this and inferred to be uh more likely

00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,360
to be authoritative based on how many

00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:35,120
incoming links a specific page

00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:37,520
had to it right and so all of this data

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,960
that that went into making search work

00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:42,160
um

00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:45,280
also gave tremendous insights into

00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:47,199
what what searches tend to lead people

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,919
to click to what sites

00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,520
what searches tend to be performed one

00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:55,680
after the other

00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:58,400
what what what people

00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,320
and what what people and i don't mean at

00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,039
the stage individuals but what people in

00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,880
terms of

00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:04,320
what isps they were connecting from

00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,600
where in the country or the world they

00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,919
were connecting from

00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,240
increasingly um data about who these

00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:12,240
people were and other uh

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,560
information about their uh their their

00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,880
behavior or their demographics

00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,960
led to what kinds of searches and what

00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,440
kind of online behavior

00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,039
and when the dot-com bubble burst uh at

00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,039
the end of the 90s

00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:27,120
google realized that they were sitting

00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:28,639
on uh this trove of information that

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,479
they could use to make money

00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,000
and that was really important because uh

00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:35,280
in the context of the of

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,800
the crash the um or the bubble bursting

00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,320
at least

00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,240
google really really needed a business

00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,919
model uh they couldn't rely just on

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,479
their investors to uh

00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:45,600
to keep them afloat and uh and so they

00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:47,680
started selling ads

00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,000
and it started being uh relatively

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,479
contextual ads you know you search for

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,759
uh plumbers you get ads for plumbers uh

00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,800
and so on uh but

00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:58,960
as uh web tracking technologies became

00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,280
more sophisticated and more and more

00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,000
of uh of commerce and daily life moved

00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,039
online

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,600
uh they were able to um

00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,240
to get to to get increasingly granular

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,759
information

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,440
about people and who they are and what

00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,199
they do online

00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,120
and from there the business models

00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,919
spread like wildfire first across the

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,919
tech industry

00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:20,479
and then into all kinds of other uh

00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:22,160
sectors uh of the economy from health

00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:26,160
care to education

00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,720
to retail uh to um hospitality i mean

00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,039
you

00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,080
you name it there's there's some kind of

00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,479
a connection to

00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,400
what uh harvard scholar shashana zubov

00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,639
calls surveillance capitalism

00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,680
and the next step from there of kind of

00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,720
predicting

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:43,039
um who is likely to click on what or to

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,600
see what or to react in a specific way

00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:48,560
to an advertisement

00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,599
leads companies to help advertisers

00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,560
place bets

00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:53,759
on where where is the best place to to

00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,840
to put my ad

00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,440
so that people who are likely to engage

00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,319
with it in the way that i want them to

00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,000
meaning at the

00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,000
very least click on it and hopefully

00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,360
lead to some kind of a purchase

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,199
or some other change in their behavior

00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,039
how do i figure out what's the best

00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,080
return on investment as far as that's

00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,400
concerned

00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,479
and then from there the industry

00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,759
realized that the best way to ensure

00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:18,880
that you win your bet

00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:21,520
is to actually uh interfere in the

00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,720
in the auction process itself and to uh

00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,440
to nudge people

00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,240
to to take the step that is most likely

00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,759
to lead to

00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,520
uh to the behavior that you want whether

00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:33,199
that's making a purchase changing a vote

00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,120
or or what have you and so now we're in

00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,840
a situation where

00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,199
a huge and growing swath of the economy

00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:42,560
is based not just

00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:45,120
on um on showing untracking people

00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,759
and analyzing their behavior and their

00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,479
data

00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,080
in order to show them ads but on uh

00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,919
changing their behavior

00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,599
in ways that are as financially

00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,800
rewarding as possible for both the

00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:57,520
advertisers

00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,199
and for the advertising networks uh

00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,960
including google and facebook but there

00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:04,080
are many others including a lot of

00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:06,800
um a lot of data brokers that

00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,120
none of us have ever heard of uh in and

00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,360
this

00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:12,800
is i think is is something that is is

00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:16,000
really concerning

00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,280
harriet or sultan did you want to add i

00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,319
i think she covered

00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:22,960
basically everything in my hair

00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,759
yeah from that particular angle but then

00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,759
i think

00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,440
i think i think i'm cool on that for now

00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:29,680
right now

00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,639
harriet i was just gonna add actually

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,360
that also

00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,080
um the internet itself is a common in

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,800
the same way

00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,599
that the atmosphere is a common or you

00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,000
know the

00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,360
or the kind of common ground and

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
traditionally it's very very difficult

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,919
to protect

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,519
commons so when we talk about power in

00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,720
advertising and everything that natalie

00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:50,000
is completely right

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:52,000
advertising is a it drives uh it

00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,200
drives parts of the economy it creates

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,120
jobs and

00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,399
it has trade bodies it has all these

00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,279
power dynamics in

00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,560
place um and when we're talking about

00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,600
how the internet develops it's really

00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,200
important to understand

00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,959
actually you know we've got loads of

00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,519
environmental protection legislation

00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:08,320
that looks

00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,200
at protecting our environmental commons

00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,200
but we don't have

00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,279
uh similar things for the internet so

00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,080
advertising is a very powerful force in

00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:17,279
shaping

00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,279
the development of the internet

00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,760
and how is that changing the web what

00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:25,440
are some of the negative

00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:28,240
consequences um that this kind of

00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,519
targeted advertising this ai powered

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,160
advertising

00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,600
is having both on the individual or the

00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,959
collective

00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:39,120
uh here yet sure i mean when

00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:41,600
we we can see the influences of this

00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,440
kind of uh of this technology

00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,880
in everything from journalism to the

00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,600
content that's actually available on the

00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,959
web

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:51,200
so the first thing to understand is that

00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,640
by funding by essentially kind of

00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,640
funding the internet

00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,160
advertising um kind of sets the

00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,680
precedent that we should be considering

00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,800
our time on the internet as a commercial

00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,360
opportunity

00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:03,120
so for example metrics of success are

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,880
things like are we responding to

00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,399
to the adverts how long are we on the

00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,240
page um you know

00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,760
are we staying on a platform long enough

00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,720
to see the next video or are we

00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,399
commenting or

00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,920
kind of getting upset or excited about

00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,920
what's on there um

00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,360
and so what that does is it it changes

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,000
the measures of

00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,959
for um industries like journalism so for

00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,600
example

00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:25,040
um we've seen journalists journalistic

00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,920
headlines evolved to be

00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:30,000
uh more salacious um to look more like

00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,320
click bait or to kind of gain a response

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,240
from

00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,160
individuals even if to even not reflect

00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,800
the articles that they might uh

00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,079
kind of show we've seen that it's diff

00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,560
it's it's harder

00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:41,600
for um you know quality quality

00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:45,120
journalism and

00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:47,680
and hard news uh to monetize itself

00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,720
because advertising wants to be next to

00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,399
things that are

00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,760
you know kind of nice or you know can

00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,160
promote the brand in a great way it

00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,920
doesn't

00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,279
want to be next to pictures of riots or

00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,000
civil unrest

00:10:55,279 --> 00:11:00,560
and when we look at it also means that

00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,600
it's difficult for diverse content to

00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:06,880
monetize itself so for example 73

00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,880
of um lgbtq plus content is read

00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,000
is and rendered unmonetizable in the

00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,079
current system

00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
and that's also the same if you're if

00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:17,360
you want to read content aimed at

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,680
the muslim community um and so and

00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,399
what this does is it creates um very

00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,279
very

00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:25,200
odd dynamics um and it means that if you

00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,880
speak a language that isn't english

00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,640
or you know isn't one of the languages

00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,160
that is profitable it also means you

00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,680
don't get content made for you

00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,680
so we're seeing lots of different ways

00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:36,640
in the way this is shaping

00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,640
our online experience

00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,279
that's powerful uh natalie

00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,120
yeah i mean i think i i think what i

00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:47,440
what i'd like to underscore here

00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,360
is that the the logic of targeted

00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,480
advertising is a logic that's based on

00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,920
discrimination

00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:57,519
it's based on the idea that um we can

00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:58,480
um track and analyze uh once again data

00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,920
about who people

00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,680
are and what they do about their

00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,279
demographics their traits

00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,120
their behaviors and treat them

00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:07,120
differently on the internet

00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,320
on the basis of that information now

00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,959
some of the time

00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,440
uh it's not a big deal right um you know

00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:14,560
the

00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,399
the the the the

00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,240
the web advertising infrastructure can

00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,240
tell that uh my browser is set to

00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,320
english and show it so it shows me ads

00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,079
in english and not in in a different

00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,079
language that i may not speak

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:28,079
or it knows that you know i'm located in

00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,360
the in the washington dc metro area and

00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:31,839
so it'll show me

00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,560
information well perhaps not now but in

00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:34,000
that in in

00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,160
in the before times they would show me

00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,720
ads for concerts and and sports events

00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,279
and

00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,360
and restaurants in my city and not uh

00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,760
you know in sydney australia for example

00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,240
and that's

00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,440
that sort of thing makes sense and and i

00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,320
don't think pot

00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,720
poses uh you know concern necessarily

00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,800
but it's the exact same technology and

00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,760
market logic that makes it possible for

00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,600
example

00:12:53,760 --> 00:13:00,880
for um for for politicians to

00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:03,600
uh to disseminate facebook ads

00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,160
targeting uh african-american uh and

00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,480
other

00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,279
um in other communities of color in the

00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,839
us

00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:11,839
uh with uh incorrect information about

00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:14,240
how or when to vote uh as happened in

00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:17,600
the 2016 and 2018 elections

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:20,800
and despite uh social media platforms um

00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:24,240
best intentions um is

00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:28,880
is likely to to occur again uh this year

00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:30,800
and um and so far there's no good way to

00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,000
uh to make a to draw a distinction

00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:35,360
between the types

00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,200
of targeting that uh are uh benign or

00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,639
maybe even helpful and the kinds that

00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,560
are really really harmful and that's

00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,240
because here again there's a logic

00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,320
uh that everything should be automated

00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:47,600
that everything should be based on data

00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:50,160
and uh algorithmic systems is are are

00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,920
just not good enough and are unlikely to

00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,480
ever be good enough at scale

00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,440
to draw that distinction uh but because

00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,120
human beings

00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,199
are expensive it turns out you have to

00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,720
pay us a living wage uh it turns out

00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,480
that when you show us

00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,720
lots of uh videos of people being

00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:08,240
beheaded uh we get really bad

00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:10,560
mental illness and uh and ptsd

00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,920
and and require time off from work and

00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,000
so on so there's there's

00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,440
here again a market logic to replace

00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,920
humans with machines

00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,279
to do jobs that machines are just not

00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:22,320
equipped to do

00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:25,199
and until there's either a regulatory or

00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,240
a market force that makes it more

00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:29,279
expensive

00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,399
uh for for companies to to do the right

00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:32,320
thing right

00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,760
uh than it is to do the wrong but

00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,839
lucrative thing uh

00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,680
we're in this in in this really vicious

00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,120
cycle uh that's going to be hard to

00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,440
break again without um

00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:45,120
without either regulatory or or other

00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:48,000
kinds of interventions

00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,199
that's that's very amazing and i think i

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,199
i really really support

00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:53,199
that part of actually creating a system

00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:55,360
that actually monitors and regulates

00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:56,800
the way these datas are because whether

00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,959
i like it or not

00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,920
there is data how to turn a whole lot of

00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,839
data and

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,880
it belongs to a certain set of people

00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:03,839
okay that's a certain set of

00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,839
organizations

00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,120
so that data is not made available for

00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,720
everybody to use

00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,399
so it's like if you have the data you

00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,320
can change the market dynamics with the

00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,720
data that you have so it's i think there

00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:17,120
should be a kind of regulatory system

00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,639
managing the particular data because

00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,199
once enough length is data doesn't go

00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,680
away

00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:23,120
you don't destroy data so it's always

00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,720
going to be there so it's either you use

00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,560
it or not so depending on how you want

00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,639
to use this you can't first put

00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,160
to stop using the data but perhaps if

00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:31,600
you can create a model

00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,519
or your system where they are using it

00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,320
the right way then i think that's the

00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,680
first step of

00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:39,120
how we should actually look at things

00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,120
when it comes to issues like this

00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:43,759
how have these practices changed the web

00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,320
well one thing is uh should i go first

00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,639
on that sure

00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,480
okay so one thing is this is you you

00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:55,040
made mention earlier that

00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,920
it's yeah some somebody mentioned that

00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,160
now you have to be

00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:00,480
for keywords when it comes to ads that

00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,759
means it's the higher your pocket the

00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,160
larger your pocket

00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,600
the better the results you get so it

00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,440
means that it's it's this goes

00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,720
far beyond just ads as the cities

00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,560
because it goes

00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,560
to the bottom feeders of the economy

00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:15,199
also meaning for people in

00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,839
low income areas they have to spend more

00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:18,160
to get

00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,600
something because the producer is

00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,639
actually putting in the cost of

00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,639
advertisement on the product itself you

00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:26,959
understand so the the the market is

00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,320
200 billion dollars per annum market as

00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:29,440
of now which is probably going to still

00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,440
increase next year

00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,720
so meaning that that's close to 38

00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,440
million error per day

00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,360
and heart even probably more than so

00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,120
whatever a product is coming out there

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,120
the manufacturer the producer the

00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,639
marketer they are actually adding the

00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,880
cost of ad because they want to be

00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,240
higher for the particular keyword

00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,600
meaning they have to actually increase

00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,240
the cost so if you should go for two

00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,000
dollars

00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,759
probably had an extra 50 cents to that

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,320
because i mean you're gonna pay for the

00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:54,399
ads

00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,440
that's making us get this product to you

00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:58,000
which means the

00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,680
the oh should i say the competition is

00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,519
float from the beginning

00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,759
so it means the higher the money you

00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,079
have the larger the money you have the

00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:06,640
better

00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:08,400
results you get so that's that's a flood

00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,079
system if you look at it critically

00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,919
it means the old system is actually

00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:14,480
focused on a particular group of people

00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:16,640
or particular set of organizations which

00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:19,120
means individual content creators

00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,400
are probably fighting the losing battle

00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,400
right from the start

00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,000
yeah actually you mentioned content

00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,480
creators and that was something that

00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
um i wanted to get into a little bit um

00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,160
and there there are actually so many

00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
layers we could explore here from you

00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:35,280
know misinformation to

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:38,160
um uh so many things but

00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:40,080
um in addition to the privacy harms that

00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,000
we've talked a little bit about

00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,440
uh you mentioned content creators there

00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,200
are other obstacles that content

00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:48,160
creators that developers that

00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,559
publishers and media outlets are facing

00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,679
in this

00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:52,000
web environment from uh all powerful big

00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:56,080
tech

00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,640
platforms um ai powered recommendation

00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:00,000
engines

00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:02,080
and uh rewarding clicks not quality um

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,360
so let's dig into this a little a little

00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,760
bit uh

00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,799
how are independent artists developers

00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:10,240
and other creators

00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:12,640
impacted particularly in this system

00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,320
uh sultan do you want to kick us off

00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:17,039
yeah definitely let me let me

00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,919
let me do it okay so i think i said

00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:20,080
earlier that

00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,679
for inventor for in the video or

00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,360
independent content creators

00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:25,039
it means you actually have to start with

00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,280
a very high capital totally even

00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:29,120
get noticed in the market that's one the

00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,880
other issue i think again is the data

00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,480
that's out there it's limited

00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,919
the data itself is unlimited but the

00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,320
assessed data is limited

00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:38,240
meaning the top people in the industry

00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,919
don't want to share this data with you

00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,240
so i mean it's your data it's my data

00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:44,640
but it's we don't have access to it

00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,360
so when it comes to target targeted ads

00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,440
and co

00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,640
it's only meant for a certain set of

00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,799
people who have access to that

00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,559
even targets the environment the

00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:55,120
behavior pattern to the

00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:56,240
particular geographical location of the

00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,919
people that they want

00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,360
meaning they can make them do anything

00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,600
if you happen to have a

00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,559
competitive competitor now it's probably

00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,960
a product with

00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:06,720
a very large scale business and they

00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,320
decide that okay but the data we have

00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,960
let's make sure that everybody in this

00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,720
region

00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,240
scissor product only they have the

00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,400
monitor actually back that

00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,080
i mean in that i remember earlier now

00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,640
now we have to pay for keywords when we

00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,240
search

00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,640
so the result that comes means that the

00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,559
higher you beat for a particular keyword

00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,679
the the higher you get ranked for that

00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:26,000
particular keyword

00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,440
so everything has to do with the money

00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
the money is being generated from the

00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,080
hearts

00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,840
the hearts people won't start that hard

00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,240
because of the results and the target

00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,559
that

00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,080
the the data that powers this targeted

00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:38,400
at is owned by

00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,600
a very small group of people which

00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,880
probably control the old market

00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,520
economics itself

00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:45,760
so if you want to do anything for the

00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,080
content creator individual producers and

00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,320
the

00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,440
independent artists i would say they

00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,480
need they need the

00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,320
kind of like the law on their side

00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,840
they need public regulatory bodies on

00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,039
their side because it's affecting them

00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,200
negatively

00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:00,880
yeah i think that's the word negatively

00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,840
earlier on about

00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:06,000
five ten years ago the major definition

00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:08,559
of digital marketing was more like

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,919
something that allows you get access out

00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:12,080
there irrespective of

00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:13,039
how big your brand is i think that was

00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,280
the word google

00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:17,200
do use over there back then like okay

00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,400
even if you guys smurf for me smush your

00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,039
behavior goes like this

00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,400
from a shop from a small shop to a big

00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:23,520
to a big organization you can get your

00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,960
product out there

00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,880
so you don't have to be big that's the

00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,720
notion that we have that oh even if you

00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,080
are independent even if you are

00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,159
just starting up you don't have to be

00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:34,159
actually use the user marketing but then

00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:36,080
now there's not a word for keywords on

00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:37,280
it so even if i'm small and i want to

00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,640
use the user marketing

00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,799
i need to actually start fighting for

00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:43,760
keywords with big organizations

00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:45,919
which i can't possibly win so it's

00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,039
affecting them negatively in various

00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,679
angles and

00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:51,679
and right now it's i think i did mention

00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:54,480
the higher budgeting higher cost

00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:55,679
which i think normally people wouldn't

00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,520
notice

00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,600
but then when it comes to products

00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,039
product placement and product building

00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,200
and manufacturing

00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:04,880
do you have to actually certainly make

00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,919
profit you need to actually

00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:09,840
go over your is the

00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:11,120
product cost something like that so you

00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,919
need to actually go higher than the

00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,320
product cost

00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:16,640
and right now the companies who actually

00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,200
had the marketing costs to the product

00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,799
cost

00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,559
i mean we are not asking them to market

00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:21,039
to us though we're not asking them for

00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:22,559
those

00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:23,919
for those ads but they have to have it

00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:25,600
to you because they feel that's the only

00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:27,280
way to get the product to us

00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,559
meaning we are paying for the adverts we

00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,280
the consumers are not paying for the

00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:31,280
advert

00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,720
i mean nobody wants to run their losing

00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,720
markets so that's

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,240
another angle that's not beneficial it's

00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,320
not going to benefit the

00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,000
the individual creators and independent

00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,360
houses because they don't have the fonts

00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,120
they don't they don't have the fonts

00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,240
they don't have the data i mean those

00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,840
are probably just

00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,520
you need probably just three things to

00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,880
try to push your product out there right

00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,919
now or push your content out there you

00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,600
know the data

00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:52,960
to know where you want to put the

00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,960
product you need

00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,559
the fonts so that is supposed to push

00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,039
for supports the product and you need

00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:59,679
the

00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,960
product itself so we know that of course

00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:02,559
we have the products

00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,880
i'm referring to myself as an

00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:05,679
independent creator right now so i have

00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,360
the product

00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:08,799
but i don't have the data and i don't

00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,120
have the funds to actually push it out

00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,559
here

00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,440
so it means the old system is already

00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:16,480
flowing against me so

00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:18,320
definitely money ranks

00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,520
so which means we know it's a negative

00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,559
impact for the individual content

00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:23,280
creator

00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:24,960
i think that's it for now and what about

00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,400
publishers or media outlets harriet i

00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,320
know you've looked in to

00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,080
to their practices and impact a little

00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,960
bit as well

00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:34,159
definitely so i mean just to build on on

00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,520
what's also said i don't think the

00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:37,679
system's working for anybody

00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,200
like we know that advertisers are losing

00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:40,000
lots of money to fraud through this

00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,480
system and

00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,400
even middle you know and middlemen a

00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,320
recent study found that like 15

00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,679
of of ad spend just disappears no one

00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,159
knows where it goes

00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:52,400
um you know it's not working for the

00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:55,039
content creators themselves because

00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,880
they're struggling to um you know

00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:58,240
they're struggling to kind of make their

00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,159
the kind of money that they need and i

00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,120
know that the way that things are shared

00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:04,080
on the platforms

00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:05,280
plays a role in that so i mean first off

00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,600
i would i would

00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,559
uh you know kind of look at how and

00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,559
advertise this

00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:12,000
this kind of new model's impacting kind

00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:14,080
of quality journalism

00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,679
because essentially when uh you know

00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,720
kind of when an advertiser is working

00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:18,240
out where they they want their

00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,159
advertising to go

00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,600
and kind of inventories are lumped in

00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:23,280
together so you've got

00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,799
your kind of quality quality news

00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,320
outlets um like

00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:29,039
i don't know the new times washington

00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:31,679
post whatever lumped in with cat videos

00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:33,200
and um you know kind of like junk on the

00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:36,320
long tail of the internet

00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:39,039
um and what this does is it creates

00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,960
um you know it creates really um really

00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:42,880
difficult dynamics it means that

00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,159
you know kind of journalism journalism

00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,520
hasn't been able to invest

00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,520
it means that kind of revenues that

00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:50,159
those major publishers come down

00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:52,000
it means it's also done weird things

00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:54,640
like create business models for

00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,360
um hate speech and misinformation online

00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,200
um

00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,880
i don't know everyone knows about the

00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,039
kind of the pizzagate scandal

00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:03,360
um which was kind of driven in in some

00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,600
ways by kind of macedonian teenagers who

00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,760
are

00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,960
kind of making a lot of money by posting

00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,640
misinformation

00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,960
about uh you know kind of in the run-up

00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:13,120
to the 2016 u.s elections

00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,760
and making a lot of money um from doing

00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:17,840
that but the same is true of hate speech

00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,799
so content creators who create hate

00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,240
speech often

00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:21,840
uh you know kind of that is a very

00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,880
reactionary content the language is

00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,360
inflammatory

00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,720
and it gets a lot of reactions online be

00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,919
they positive or negative

00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,480
and so um it actually um you know kind

00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:32,640
of those

00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,760
pages that that kind of host that

00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,840
content

00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:38,000
um you can get a lot of shares a lot of

00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,279
whatever and are not only prioritized by

00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,039
the platforms but also

00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:42,640
kind of find it easy to monetize

00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:44,720
themselves on the open web because they

00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,880
look like they've got a lot of traffic

00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,640
and the un's um kind of picked up on

00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,840
this in its economics of hate

00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:53,679
so we've got that angle um and then

00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,679
we've got the fact that content creators

00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:57,600
even if their native language might be

00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:59,679
i don't know um you know kind of even

00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,640
the native language might be quite quite

00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:03,120
niche it's not

00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,240
actually commercially viable for them to

00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,080
make

00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,760
uh content in that language it's much

00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,559
more converse virtually viable for them

00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,840
to make content

00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:12,080
in english or one of the european

00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:14,559
languages for example

00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:16,159
and so what that creates is uh you know

00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,880
we're not actually providing for a lot

00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:19,840
of people

00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,640
um through you know on the internet in

00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,400
general

00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:25,120
so we've got all of those dynamics going

00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:27,840
on um as well

00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:29,200
henley i see you nodding quite a bit

00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:32,400
yeah absolutely and

00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,760
and uh i you know i completely agree

00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,240
with with the insights that both

00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:38,159
sultan and harriet have shared um what

00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,720
i'll add to that is that um

00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:42,000
a lot of the efforts that platforms uh

00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,720
have have implemented

00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,279
to try to address some of these harms uh

00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,240
end up

00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:48,559
being done in in such a way that it has

00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,880
uh

00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:52,000
even more negative repercussions on on

00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,919
people who are not even

00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,840
part of that dynamic in the first place

00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,480
uh and i'll use the example of racist

00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,799
content

00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,480
to uh to illustrate that so a lot of a

00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:04,000
lot of advertisers and brands

00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:06,799
are um quite um quite wisely

00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,360
um you know do not want to to have uh

00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:12,159
their their ads shown next to uh blatant

00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:13,200
disinformation and propaganda and and

00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:15,919
bigoted uh

00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:18,240
content and uh i think the the stop hate

00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:18,960
for profit campaign is a really uh clear

00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,200
example

00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,320
of that of that desire but so what

00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,000
happens is that

00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:27,120
uh in order to make their advertisers

00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,440
happy uh platforms and ad networks

00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,320
here again try to automate the process

00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:33,520
of screening

00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,799
uh for brand safety for excluding types

00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,360
of

00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:38,799
sites or or content against which they

00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:41,679
will not run certain ads

00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:42,880
uh but again because turns out ai is not

00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:46,000
as smart as people

00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:48,080
um and it never will be they end up

00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,559
catching a whole bunch of uh

00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,600
of of content that is actually exactly

00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:52,960
the opposite

00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,480
of what they're trying to screen out

00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,679
right so they say we don't want to you

00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,840
know a brand says

00:26:55,679 --> 00:27:00,240
i don't want my content uh to be run

00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:03,440
against uh alex jones and and similar

00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:06,720
similar uh racist uh filth and

00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,279
um uh black black lives matter content

00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,559
gets uh

00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:10,640
ends up getting caught in the in the

00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:13,360
same in the same filter because

00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,000
uh a lot of the keywords used uh are

00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,559
similar

00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,559
right and uh that has impact not only

00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:20,320
for uh content creators who rely on that

00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:22,720
for income but also on

00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:24,320
simply the spread and the the diffusion

00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,080
of this information that is in fact

00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:28,159
really important counter speech

00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,520
that is uh advancing human rights and

00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:31,840
civil rights uh

00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:33,120
and and causes that that are pro-social

00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:36,159
and that the advertiser

00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:37,520
uh may very well support right uh and we

00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:39,039
see the same dynamic with

00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:41,440
a lot of different content right like

00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:43,440
some it happens a lot with um

00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,279
with with sexual content that has to do

00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,840
you know this the filter is meant to

00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:50,320
uh not uh to you know from a brand

00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,799
safety perspective to uh to exclude uh

00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,120
either

00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:53,840
uh once again you know bigotry uh but

00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,559
also uh

00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:57,200
adult content uh but ends up excluding

00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:59,440
um

00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,279
sexual health information uh or

00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,000
reproductive health information and so

00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:04,480
on and you you

00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,919
see that uh really across uh across the

00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,159
spectrum of issues

00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:08,960
yeah those are all very good examples

00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:12,399
for

00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:15,440
sort of um showing some of the

00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:18,159
very negative impacts that uh

00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,520
the advertising business model as it's

00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:22,320
currently

00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:23,679
um dominating the web is having on our

00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,960
experience online and harriet i thought

00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:25,760
you said something a little bit earlier

00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:29,120
about

00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:31,279
um you know we should be considering our

00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,640
time on the internet as commercial time

00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:34,320
and and to me that's

00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,399
it's very telling that there's a sort of

00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:39,440
culture shift um

00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:42,000
that needs to happen here um

00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,880
i we could probably spend a long time

00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,960
talking about

00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,480
uh these these harms and these these

00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,600
impacts a lot of the problems that exist

00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,640
within the current

00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:53,360
um dynamic of uh

00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,000
economy on the on the web but i i want

00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:57,440
to

00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:00,799
take us into a new space

00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:03,600
which is alternatives that exist for

00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:05,360
um the current dominant business model

00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:08,399
how could be sustained content

00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:10,960
sustain content online um

00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:12,399
without advertising um are there

00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,640
glimmers of hope

00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:16,000
uh for for decentralizing the economic

00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,720
power of the the web and

00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,080
and what are they um natalie do you want

00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,720
to go first

00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:24,000
sure of course uh so i think the the one

00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,200
really important thing is to

00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,520
differentiate between

00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,640
targeted or behavioral advertising

00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:31,679
specifically

00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:33,360
and advertising more broadly right as

00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:34,640
long as we live in a market-based

00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,799
economy which i

00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,159
you know certainly anticipate will be at

00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:41,200
least my lifetime

00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:43,039
uh and as long as uh people use uh

00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,720
speech and communication to try to

00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:45,919
influence each other's behavior which i

00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,720
anticipate

00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:49,360
will be as long as there are people um

00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,000
we will have

00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:52,399
advertising in some way uh or another

00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,159
and

00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:55,440
i don't see any problem with that the

00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:58,480
problem is when

00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:01,120
uh the advertising is so data-driven uh

00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:02,880
and and inherently discriminatory right

00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,720
because when you hear personalization i

00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:07,440
want you to think discrimination

00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,080
right um that's where the problem is so

00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:11,039
i think

00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:12,000
uh you know two i think the main way to

00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:14,240
uh to

00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,440
look the main place to look for new

00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,720
business models

00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:21,279
is to um is to rely on as little uh

00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,000
personal and behavioral data as possible

00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:25,600
now again there

00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,440
are certain p pieces of data that uh are

00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,840
are really relevant and unlikely to

00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:32,159
cause uh to cause any harm you know

00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:33,360
language uh personalization you know

00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:34,240
show me something i can actually

00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:38,240
understand

00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:40,799
would be one of them a very broad um

00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,799
very broad geographic location uh

00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:43,600
certainly no smaller than a city or

00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:46,000
region

00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,880
may also make sense uh in a lot of

00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
contexts

00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:52,960
um but i think uh most other forms of

00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,440
data should uh simply be excluded from

00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,720
um

00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:59,200
from the from the uh from the equation

00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:00,720
unless the person has uh you know

00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:03,200
voluntarily signed up

00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,559
for something right um and there's a lot

00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,640
of different ways that you could do that

00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:07,919
i could imagine a social media platform

00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,159
saying like you know what in order to

00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:11,600
use our service um since you know we do

00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,720
need to keep the lights on and pay our

00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,880
employees

00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,840
you need to self-identify as being part

00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,399
of let's say

00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,039
10 different audience categories and we

00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:22,000
will show you

00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:22,960
ads targeted at those categories now you

00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,120
can you pick

00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,080
categories that either match who you

00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,919
actually are

00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,519
or you can pick something completely

00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:31,039
different um

00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:32,880
it's really up to you whether or not you

00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:35,919
want to see ads that that are

00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,799
more or less relevant uh to you so to

00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:38,720
speak

00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:40,480
another way to do that would be to move

00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:42,240
towards uh first party

00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,760
advertising based on first party data

00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,760
versus third-party data

00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:47,519
and without going into too nerdy of an

00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:49,760
explanation of what that is

00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:51,919
that's the difference between so

00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:53,360
third-party data is basically the

00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:55,440
everything any data you can get your

00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:58,640
hands on is is is good

00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:00,000
is is up for grabs uh i am simplifying a

00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:03,279
bit here

00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,919
so twitter mobs calm down on the other

00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:05,600
hand you have

00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:08,080
first party data which is what the new

00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:09,760
york times a month to use one example is

00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:11,679
moving towards where only data that

00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:15,039
relates to how people use

00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:17,840
the new york times website and apps

00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:19,200
is relevant to showing advertising or

00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:22,320
and for that matter for

00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,840
recommending news stories so for example

00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:26,000
the new york times would

00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:28,000
correctly pick up on the fact that i

00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,480
read a lot of tech news and absolutely

00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,279
no sports right so it is going to show

00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,600
me both

00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:35,519
news stories and ad content that is

00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:37,360
related to the fact that

00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:38,559
i'm interested in technology and not at

00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,240
all interested in sports

00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:42,720
but it might show my brother the exact

00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:44,480
opposite and i think that's

00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,399
that's a really promising model but

00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,240
again something that is uh

00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:49,919
really complicated and costly to

00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,600
implement so that's something that the

00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:54,000
new york times can do

00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:55,919
but that smaller media outlets uh cannot

00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,720
do and then the third element i'll point

00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:59,919
to before

00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:03,360
uh before i shut up here um

00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:04,880
is um as uh public service uh subsidies

00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:06,320
you know that's something that uh in the

00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,080
us in particular we're

00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:10,240
really shy about for a lot of historical

00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,919
reasons i won't go into

00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,840
but in order to have public service

00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:16,480
media you need to have

00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:17,679
non-commercial sources of revenue and

00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,679
there is absolutely

00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:20,880
a concern to be had about

00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:24,640
state-controlled

00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:27,200
media but uh there is such a thing

00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:29,440
as uh as robust publicly funded uh

00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:31,919
independent public service media

00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,679
and uh and that's a conversation i think

00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:35,600
that that really needs to be

00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:37,200
uh front and center because even in

00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:41,200
places uh like the uk

00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:43,039
that uh have uh uh robust histories and

00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,159
traditions of public service media that

00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:46,399
that funding is is

00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:48,080
is coming under increasing attack every

00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:49,840
year uh and i think we need to reverse

00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:52,399
that

00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:53,679
thank you sultan what models are are you

00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:56,399
seeing for sustaining

00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:57,600
um content online that may not include

00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:00,000
advertising

00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,799
where are your gamers of hope i would i

00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,960
would

00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:04,159
i would want to introduce or should i

00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,600
say

00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:07,279
this is mine this is an interesting

00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:09,040
question because it's it's something i

00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:10,879
actually enjoy for the past couple of

00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:13,679
months i've been experimenting and

00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:16,159
i've been reading about testing and even

00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:16,159
coding

00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:20,639
so then i would say obviously one model

00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:22,399
that covers everything

00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:24,159
that would without we actually need now

00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:25,679
at the solution it's probably the web

00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:28,000
monetization model

00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:29,919
because i mean i've tested what it's

00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,399
this web monetization against

00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:33,359
several other models can you say what

00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:35,040
what that is

00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:36,720
yeah definitely i would get there right

00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:39,760
now so okay so

00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:41,359
before going deep into monetization

00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:43,040
i don't want to say i think i think i

00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:43,359
will not tell you that the reason why i

00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:46,079
think

00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:46,480
new york new york post wouldn't want to

00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:48,560
go

00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:50,560
do that work of actually trying to

00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:51,200
segment their audiences because i think

00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:54,079
they do

00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:55,359
a lot of companies prefer just the stats

00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:56,560
i mean they want to tell they want to

00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:58,560
tell companies that we have we've been

00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,200
able to show your heart to 20 000 people

00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,040
today

00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,560
they don't they don't even even if it's

00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,280
not intense they're actually interested

00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,960
in the hats

00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,240
so i think the numbers would do up

00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,119
really for them so they wouldn't want

00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:09,040
something like that

00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:10,960
so they're dealing the figures figure so

00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,680
even if it's even if it's not hard to

00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,119
implement

00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,880
i doubt they would be interested in

00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:16,960
implementing something like that

00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,480
okay so web monetization recommendation

00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,000
is it's a model

00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:22,640
it's an online model that actually

00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:25,119
allows both the content creator and the

00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:26,000
consumer these are the users that's when

00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:27,599
they have

00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,440
that's the only mode that actually puts

00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:31,359
both parties in place

00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,720
when it comes to any business model

00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:35,839
online in terms of

00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:37,359
products and should i say content

00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:40,480
creation and content

00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:43,520
viewing online so web monetization is

00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:46,079
is is a i don't want to give out

00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,960
the unofficial definition i'm trying to

00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:50,480
make it

00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:52,560
very very as simple as possible as i can

00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:54,079
so okay all the other models online out

00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,599
there the advertising model the

00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:57,359
subscription-based model

00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:58,960
they actually have one thing in common

00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:02,000
and that's they're actually

00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:04,400
the product based meaning the the

00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,839
the company the organization is the

00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,400
major focus when it comes to something

00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:08,240
like that

00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,599
so i mean if if you have a

00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,960
subscription-based model

00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:13,200
you are just you're subscribing to that

00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,320
particular platform if it's on hearts

00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,920
the company is the one

00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,280
in charge here and they're the one that

00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,200
would probably decide what to show

00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,920
you're not so weaponization is the only

00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:23,280
model

00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:25,440
that actually puts both the user

00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,320
in focus and also the creator also in

00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:29,920
focus

00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:33,119
so what what that means simply is if if

00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:35,280
if if me as a user right now if i'm web

00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:37,920
on entice user it means that i have

00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:39,599
i have a certain amount of something

00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:42,640
here which i would want to call

00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:44,960
fonts or money and i'm every time i

00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:47,200
actually access a particular content

00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:48,400
from any creator i take part of that

00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,839
money and

00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,359
use it to actually say okay i've

00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:53,280
accessed your content this is the

00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:56,000
payment for that particular content

00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:57,920
now in between this particular the my

00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,400
bank i'm being using my bank of money

00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,800
here

00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,839
and the content i'm actually consume at

00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,400
a particular time

00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:05,599
there is a service called coil so coil

00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,920
is the one with that means that

00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:10,079
okay if this content you're actually

00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:13,440
viewing right now cause it should cost

00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:15,280
0.2 cents okay so take 0.2 cents from

00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:17,280
sultan's bank to actually pay this

00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,680
particular creator i mean it looks small

00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,200
but

00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:21,040
when one million people look at that

00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:23,119
particular contents in a day that's

00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:24,480
okay for the for the content creator

00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:27,680
that's a source of revenue

00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:31,200
and also the the good part for the user

00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:33,839
also is that if the content creator

00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,640
is i asked you in mind also then you get

00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:37,680
to cut out

00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:38,320
all the issues of clickbait all the

00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,320
issues of

00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:41,599
had all the issues of forced

00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,520
registrations

00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:44,880
i mean that's how the data data that's

00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:47,839
how they gather the data so

00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,400
if the company or the creator also wants

00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:49,599
to

00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,359
ease you up that stress between

00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:53,200
monetization you don't need to go to

00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:55,280
other streams just to have the coil

00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:57,440
extension or just be web monetized as a

00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:59,440
user so web monetization is

00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,880
a simple model that actually supports

00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:04,560
both the content creator

00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:06,640
and the user at once at the same time so

00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:08,240
yeah let me now go into the question now

00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,800
right oh i mean somebody else wants to

00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:11,040
talk

00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,480
well harriet i wanted to see if harriet

00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,160
had an example of

00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,920
um alternatives that she's seeing out

00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:18,960
there in the ecosystem

00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:20,079
um yeah i mean there's definitely

00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,720
appetite for change

00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:24,160
and i think um you know we've on one

00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,720
side we mentioned the stop hate for

00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,720
profit

00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:28,320
campaign which has prompted a load of

00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,839
charities to kind of get together and

00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,640
try and brainstorm actually how they

00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:33,280
might

00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:33,680
reach their supporters um without you

00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,680
know

00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:37,680
uh without kind of funding facebook

00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:39,040
you've got uh organizations like

00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:41,280
brand advance you've been set up

00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:42,800
specifically to make sure that lgbtq

00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:45,280
plus publications can

00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,400
monetize themselves um you know this

00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,320
these are ad-based

00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,760
models but these are really important

00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,599
conversations and i think

00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,200
um you know like what we need what we

00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:55,200
don't have at the moment is like a

00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:57,119
vision for how everything fits together

00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:59,280
we don't have a vision for how um you

00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:00,880
know kind of if advertising can

00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:02,800
well with things like the conscious

00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,560
advertising network we we're trying to

00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:07,359
kind of create roadmaps and

00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:09,920
and kind of an idea of what a respectful

00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:13,119
effective ad funded internet looks like

00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:14,960
um but equally we don't like when we

00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:16,800
look at the legislation

00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:18,079
and the kind of the consultations that

00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,920
come through from

00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:21,680
you know from the eu and things like

00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,560
that i'm just not seeing that kind of

00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:25,680
sense of like

00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:28,000
where we're going um and like so

00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:29,200
i've seen i've seen like real appetite

00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,880
for this i've seen

00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,720
fantastic alternatives that are kind of

00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,640
growing and and are kind of

00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:36,160
um you know kind of being nurtured and i

00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,960
think there's great appetite there but i

00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,400
think

00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,359
like we've kind of got to do both we've

00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,280
got to kind of make sure that the

00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:41,760
alternatives have the funding and kind

00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,520
of have

00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:45,760
it have the space to breathe and kind of

00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:47,359
be developed and also i think we've got

00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,880
to kind of be looking at advertising

00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:50,400
reform at the same time

00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,400
and working out what it is that we want

00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,240
to achieve with that reform

00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:56,320
so that we're kind of creating an online

00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:57,040
space that respects people as complete

00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:59,520
people you know

00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:01,280
citizens and consumers that um you know

00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:04,560
it builds consumer protection back

00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:05,200
in um i think we were talking about and

00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,520
like and

00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:09,359
but it's also kind of you know a

00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:10,240
reasonable way of brands talking to

00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:12,400
consumers

00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:14,000
and that's quite a lot to quite a lot to

00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:16,000
do

00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,280
we're running short on time and you just

00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,960
touched on something that i wanted to

00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,640
make sure we got to so very quickly i'm

00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:23,599
going to ask each of you

00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:24,400
um to respond you know 30 seconds or

00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:27,520
less

00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:29,440
um what needs to happen um

00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:31,599
in order to shift this power dynamic in

00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,040
order to make this cultural shift

00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:34,880
and for there to be alternatives what

00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:38,560
what needs to happen

00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:40,160
um sultan i'll start with you okay

00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:42,000
i would say since i have 10 seconds for

00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:44,480
this i would simulate

00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,319
the data the data that out there already

00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:48,240
needs to be made available

00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:50,319
not just for the people who gathered the

00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:52,960
data but then let's say for the public

00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:54,480
and perhaps we need regulations on how

00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,839
these data are actually being used

00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:58,000
what i want to know for the next 10

00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:59,760
years i believe those data how they

00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,640
are still valid for the next 10 years

00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:04,720
meaning the if if the data was used for

00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:06,319
an election to actually shift the power

00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:08,720
of election or probably

00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:10,480
be of change the behaviors of the people

00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:11,200
who are utterly meant to actually elect

00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,400
a leader

00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,640
it's still going to be valid for the

00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:16,720
next 10 years minimum

00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:18,240
so what i wanted or not the daily data

00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,280
something must be done about the massive

00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,880
data out there

00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:23,280
so probably there should be regulations

00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:25,280
that actually supports and probably

00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,800
an account so that actually manages all

00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:29,440
the data out there is being used

00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:31,920
i think i think that's one for me

00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,920
natalie

00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:37,280
i think i i agree with uh with with uh

00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:39,520
the latter part of what sultan just said

00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,000
we we absolutely need robust privacy

00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:42,720
regis

00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,359
legislation uh that's strictly enforced

00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,680
uh the

00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:47,280
eu has uh has taken a good step forward

00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:49,200
with uh the gdpr

00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:50,400
though enforcement is lacking uh

00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:53,280
meanwhile in the u.s

00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:54,319
it's uh it's a total mess um and so that

00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,920
to my mind is the

00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:58,160
single most important thing that that

00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:00,319
needs to happen until that happens

00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:01,359
no company is going to uh to be the

00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:03,680
first mover to

00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:05,760
uh to respect privacy uh there are just

00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:08,240
too many uh financial risks to

00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:10,160
to to putting your neck out there first

00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,800
um so we need a we need a level playing

00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,960
field that

00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:14,480
that actually respects privacy and data

00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:18,880
protection and that

00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:21,040
that requires regulation and harriet

00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:23,119
because yeah to build on that i yeah i

00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:24,800
agree and i also think that we need

00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:26,880
industry like i work a lot with industry

00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:28,560
so like we need industry

00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:30,240
um to kind of to get ahead of

00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:32,240
legislation and to also

00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:34,160
kind of we need a kind of a collective

00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:37,119
vision for what we're aiming for like

00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:39,119
we advocate and that advertisers change

00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:41,200
their advertisements and strategies

00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:42,400
to um consider the funding of a healthy

00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:44,560
internet

00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:46,160
and we believe that actually that that

00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:47,520
by creating accountability and

00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:50,480
transparency around that

00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:51,680
that advertising supply chain we um you

00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,200
know kind of we

00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:55,280
we kind of like you know kind of our

00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:57,119
member companies are considering a lot

00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:58,800
more where their money goes

00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:00,800
so you know defunding the bad stuff

00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:02,240
trying to fund more of the the internet

00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:04,319
that they want to see

00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:06,800
um and also you know kind of keeping

00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:08,560
ahead of the legislation that we talked

00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,280
about and we hope that through that we

00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,560
can

00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:12,400
you know kind of fund great great

00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:14,160
quality journalism great content all the

00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,960
stuff we want to see and be defunding

00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:17,440
the hate speech

00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:20,480
misinformation and you know the stuff

00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:22,640
that's much less desirable

00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:24,160

00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:26,160
for joining us today

00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:27,760
um that felt like a very short amount of

00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:29,920
time to discuss some very

00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:30,880
deep and weighty issues um so i hope

00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:33,119
this conversation

00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:35,119
continues um but what i'm hearing is

00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:36,240
there are glimmers of hope there are our

00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:39,520
models that are

00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:40,480
possible um and that uh we need to level

00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:42,400
the playing field

00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:44,400
so let's let's go do that thank you
