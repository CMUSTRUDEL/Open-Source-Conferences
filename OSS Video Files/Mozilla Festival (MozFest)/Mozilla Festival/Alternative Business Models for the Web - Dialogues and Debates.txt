Publication date: 2020-09-29
Playlist: Mozilla Festival
Description: 
	Right now, the web has a single reigning business model: digital advertising, a $300 billion industry annually.This business model has upsides, like “free” access to content, tools, and platforms. But there are also steep harms — and consumers bear the brunt of them. Today’s AI-powered targeted advertisements can spread misinformation and disinformation. They can reinforce societal biases and discrimination. They can increase surveillance. And they can even harm the environment.It may be possible to reform digital advertising to mitigate these harms, but it is also possible to introduce mainstream alternatives?The latest installment of the MozFest Dialogues & Debates series will interrogate the web’s reigning business model — digital advertising — and explore whether alternatives can become mainstream.
