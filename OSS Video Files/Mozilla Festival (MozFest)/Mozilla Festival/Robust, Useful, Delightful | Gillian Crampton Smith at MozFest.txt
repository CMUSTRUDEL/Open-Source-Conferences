	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,520
so we have first up Gillian Crampton

00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:07,049
Smith she's going to come over here and

00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,300
then we're done something like a little

00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:12,240
very not what I feel is very mas fest

00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:14,250
and the two speakers the two there Emily

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,020
and Sarah met at mas first and they

00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:18,000
decided hey we're just going to unite

00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:25,260
and speak together so first of all we've

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:27,960
got Julian it's great to be here and

00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:32,870
this is my first moss fest

00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:35,219
have we got a slide yes good okay and

00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:37,559
hello to all of you out in the blue

00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:40,879
yonder who are listening to me

00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:45,149
streaming I'll try and keep you in mind

00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:47,820
it's difficult I know when you can't

00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:50,670
sense people out there but I can't see

00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:58,710
anybody anyway because of the lights so

00:00:50,670 --> 00:01:02,820
it's okay robust useful delightful this

00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:05,880
was what 2,000 years ago they architect

00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:08,490
Vitruvius said building should have and

00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:11,340
it was rediscovered in the Renaissance

00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:14,280
and it's still what we expect from our

00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:17,850
material world so things like our cars

00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:20,700
our clothes our cities we hope that

00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:23,369
that's what we will see but increasingly

00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,689
we live in a parallel environment the

00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:27,960
internet environment

00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:33,720
and though it's robust it's far from

00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:35,369
uniformly convenient or delightful and

00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,560
when I talk about the internet I mean

00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:39,360
not just what we see in our browser but

00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:44,610
all the other things that the Internet

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:48,060
makes possible for us so Mozilla is

00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:50,280
about how we could develop the web for

00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:52,920
the for the common good so I'm not going

00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,770
to talk about design being good for

00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:59,670
business which it is all for the fact

00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:01,560
that for the past five years some of the

00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:04,290
big tech companies have changed their

00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:07,619
ratio developers to designers by an

00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:09,959
order of magnitude but what I want to

00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:13,470
talk about is how artists designers and

00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:15,270
engineer designers come together

00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:18,150
developed the future of the internet and

00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:23,430
make life there more pleasant for all of

00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:25,560
us many tech companies think that design

00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:29,690
is just about making things pretty at

00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:32,790
the end nice to have but not essential

00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:34,950
but actually artist designer knowledge

00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:38,010
and skills and not just about making

00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:41,490
things pretty they also work make

00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:43,830
products work better and when I started

00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:46,140
programming for the Apple to was the

00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:49,410
layout program and there wasn't much you

00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:51,300
could do on a green screen like this and

00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:54,390
I realized though that basic graphic

00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:56,700
design skills and knowledge like the

00:02:54,390 --> 00:03:00,930
structuring of information reflecting it

00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:03,300
in typography and Composition leading

00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:05,490
the eye to the most important thing was

00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:07,980
not being used in the design of software

00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:09,300
and there's though it couldn't probably

00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:11,610
make much difference the beauty of

00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:15,980
things it could definitely make things

00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:19,400
more efficient and easier to use and

00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:21,690
there are lots of different kinds of

00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:25,050
artists designers like there are lots of

00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:28,170
different kinds of engineers and their

00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:30,900
training they're very different from

00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:34,769
engineers can contribute to the design

00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:37,650
of products that fit people well but

00:03:34,769 --> 00:03:42,570
though they understand the technology

00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:45,690
they're designing for they all work with

00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:48,810
technical experts to bring the products

00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:50,910
into the world for example is the

00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:53,220
clothes if you think of the Millennium

00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:55,019
Dome outside here it was the close

00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:57,090
collaboration between the architect

00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:59,400
Richard Rogers and Buro Happold the

00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:06,930
engineer's that made this fantastic

00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:09,769
building come into the world artists

00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:14,250
designers use their brains differently

00:04:09,769 --> 00:04:16,680
the psychologists Aaron Arensberg in his

00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:19,049
book the hidden order of art calls it

00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:23,160
synchronistic thinking rather than

00:04:19,049 --> 00:04:26,920
analytic thinking they synchronize new

00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:29,860
solutions from the memories experiences

00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:31,900
they have deep in their subconscious and

00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:37,270
they don't necessarily know exactly how

00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:39,610
they do it and they need to work in

00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:42,100
Studios like this with other designers

00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:45,070
and they need stimulus a visual stimulus

00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:47,830
audio stimulus in order to generate this

00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:49,930
range of ideas that they need and then

00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:52,630
they switch to the analytic mode of

00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:55,240
thinking to evaluate what they've come

00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:58,690
up with and really to understand better

00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:00,070
and in every iteration what the

00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:03,910
parameters of the problem they're

00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:07,270
confronting are and this process can be

00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:10,120
extremely annoying to people who work in

00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:14,860
other ways so it takes patience on both

00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:18,940
sides and they're trained in the

00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:23,070
techniques of art but for practical ends

00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:27,630
so things like word storytelling poetry

00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:32,950
graphics composition color rhythm form

00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:40,690
feel texture shape sound and movement

00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:42,970
and of course interactivity so they

00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:46,810
focus on the human qualities of a

00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:49,950
product and this is what's dupes

00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:52,660
comeback this is what Steve Jobs said

00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:55,660
it's in Apple's DNA that technology

00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:57,130
alone is not enough its technology

00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:59,440
married with the liberal arts married

00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:02,250
with the humanities that yields us the

00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,990
results that make our heart sing and

00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:07,930
certainly Apple makes a lot of people's

00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:10,930
heart seeing makes my heart sing and

00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:16,690
it's a great pleasure and also of course

00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:17,890
it makes their their tools ring so it

00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:19,840
works both ways

00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:25,810
but it does give us a great deal of

00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:28,390
pleasure but aesthetics is not only

00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:31,980
about look and feel there's an aesthetic

00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:34,600
in something that works really well

00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:37,540
satisfyingly well and I like to call it

00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:40,150
the aesthetics of use I'm sure of you

00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:43,389
can you can think of examples

00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:45,490
I've got lots in my kitchen they give me

00:06:43,389 --> 00:06:52,150
pleasure every time I use them for

00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:54,400
instance this this salad spinner it

00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:57,760
looked it looks quite good but it's

00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:09,820
really horrible to use um can I get

00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:11,470
sound on the videos music okay but so

00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:15,340
you can't you can't hear the horrible

00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:19,750
sound of this one but this is the one I

00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:23,530
have and this is such a lovely feel to

00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:27,190
use and there it's small differences but

00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:32,710
it makes it makes life it's part of life

00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:37,630
small pleasures you might think that

00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:48,729
engineering and emotion and emotion is

00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:52,660
let's go back okay okay you might think

00:07:48,729 --> 00:07:55,210
that engineering but in a model here

00:07:52,660 --> 00:08:03,310
there we go engineering and emotion is a

00:07:55,210 --> 00:08:05,770
contradiction in terms but psychologists

00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:13,570
are just beginning to understand the way

00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:17,260
that emotion the processing of emotion

00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:19,419
in the brain is connected with all kinds

00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:22,510
of other cognition so for instance

00:08:19,419 --> 00:08:25,360
people who in their brain the part of

00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:28,620
their brain which processes emotion has

00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:32,440
been damaged they can't make decisions

00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:35,500
they and to such an extent that they're

00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:36,969
completely incapacitated they can't make

00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:43,349
a decision to cross the road for

00:08:36,969 --> 00:08:43,349
instance right

00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:54,760
and Dom Norman who wrote a book called

00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:57,279
emotional design says everything has a

00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:59,680
personality everything sends an

00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:02,410
emotional signal even where this is not

00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:05,200
the intention of the designer the people

00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:11,670
who view the website infirmities and

00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:17,380
experience emotions an even boring

00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:19,510
productivity software like into it they

00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:25,839
make software for ordinary people to do

00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:28,240
their tax returns and the CEO said he

00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:30,640
said something here we go most tax

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:33,339
payers are owned a refund in this

00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:35,380
context we began to think less about the

00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:37,630
pure functionality of our software and

00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:40,210
more about the emotional payoff of

00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:43,420
reducing drudgery and speeding the way

00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:47,260
towards a big windfall so once you've

00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:49,720
got the function working you can start

00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:52,480
to think about a whole load of other

00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:57,790
things but even better if you think

00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:59,290
about that both in parallel they've also

00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:01,089
discovered psychologists have also

00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:03,580
discovered that beautiful products

00:10:01,089 --> 00:10:06,339
function better and they did experiments

00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:10,600
in Japan that were reproduced in Israel

00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:12,370
that showed that people using ATMs when

00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:15,100
they reported one that they found more

00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:18,490
beautiful they found it easier to use

00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:21,250
even though in the tests the processes

00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:24,310
were exactly the same and Don Norman

00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:27,670
explains it like this attractive things

00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:30,490
make people feel good which in turn

00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:33,040
makes them more creative and so they're

00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:38,800
better able to confront problems when

00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:43,050
they when they find them this is an

00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:45,610
example of the most beautiful phone ever

00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:47,170
it was a lot of the interface was

00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:53,680
designed by a designer called Peter

00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:56,200
Skillman who's now at Microsoft and and

00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,640
it's an example of a phone with a really

00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:00,610
beautiful sim

00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:03,340
poor interface it felt good it had

00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:07,560
beautiful graphics and animation it was

00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:11,110
a triumph of design and engineering

00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:13,960
unfortunately it came out about the

00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:17,710
month when Nokia was sold to Microsoft

00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:20,650
and so the whole thing was cancelled and

00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:23,110
they gave away to some people I was one

00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:25,060
of the lucky ones one of these phones

00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:28,150
which was really lovely and I want to

00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:33,040
show you a little film that's on the

00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:34,240
internet which describes how it works

00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,730
every once in a while

00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:39,370
a product comes along that changes our

00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:42,340
perception of how we use technology and

00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:44,710
how natural it can feel we wanted to

00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:47,440
design a better way to use a phone and

00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:50,220
it comes down to one simple gesture a

00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,220
swipe

00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:54,970
[Music]

00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:57,700
in an application swiping from any edge

00:11:54,970 --> 00:12:00,010
of the screen takes you home with no

00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:01,930
need for a home key this all screen

00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:11,680
phone makes more room for apps to shine

00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:13,480
and is incredibly easy to use we looked

00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,370
at the most important things that people

00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:17,830
need to do with their phone every day

00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:19,750
using apps getting notifications and

00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:22,030
switching between different activities

00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:25,750
for each of these we designed a

00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:27,310
recognizable home view the first is

00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:31,210
where you launch and organize your

00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:33,250
applications the second gathers all your

00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:36,430
notifications and social network feeds

00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:39,700
in one place it's the fast and easy way

00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:41,440
to stay up to date and the third view

00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:44,950
shows everything you've been doing

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,530
recently all your live apps are ready

00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:49,000
for you to pick up where you left off

00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:57,150
this is the best multitasking on

00:12:49,000 --> 00:13:00,880
anything sadly these really beautiful

00:12:57,150 --> 00:13:03,280
examples are a little rare but we're

00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:07,120
getting more of them which I'm very very

00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:10,600
cheered by this is an example of how

00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:14,110
things can go seriously wrong this was

00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:17,440
an app by Withings which is a French

00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:20,680
firm that make scales weighing scales

00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,150
and blood pressure monitors and this was

00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:25,030
the app you had in your your mobile

00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:26,380
phone it was quite jolly I'd get up in

00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:28,960
the morning and have a look and see how

00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:30,580
I was going I could see very clearly the

00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:35,680
different kinds of things that it was

00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:40,120
tracking for me but then one day than

00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:44,050
the rebranding of by Nokia came online

00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:49,030
and suddenly the nice apps disappeared

00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:51,910
and and we got this and in the Nokia

00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:54,580
version the graphic design doesn't allow

00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:58,930
you to see so well the progress you're

00:13:54,580 --> 00:14:00,640
making it's got the colors don't

00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:02,440
differentiate the different kinds of

00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:04,560
things that it's tracking so easy so

00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:06,810
can't see at a glance

00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:09,209
and it's difficult to find things and

00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:13,380
there's not much meaningful or fun

00:14:09,209 --> 00:14:17,519
interactivity and I've given up using it

00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:19,830
because it's just no fun and it's a

00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:22,649
failure of graphic design and the

00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:25,589
interactivity an interaction design and

00:14:22,649 --> 00:14:27,390
it's a failure of design for emotion

00:14:25,589 --> 00:14:30,149
because they're not that they didn't

00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:32,310
think well what do I as a user want

00:14:30,149 --> 00:14:35,459
what's going to keep me trying to lose

00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:42,019
weight it's not a miserable act like

00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:48,000
this I can tell you so form communicates

00:14:42,019 --> 00:14:51,060
and I want to show you approach a couple

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,010
of projects by a firm in Boston called

00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:56,579
design matters and they make medical

00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:59,220
devices for the developing world and

00:14:56,579 --> 00:15:02,610
this was their first product it's a baby

00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:07,200
incubator for premature babies and it

00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:09,930
was very technically advanced it looked

00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:13,410
great it won awards but it never got off

00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:15,209
the ground in the developing world and

00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:20,070
what they realized was that they had to

00:15:15,209 --> 00:15:22,620
design for how people are not how they

00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:24,560
thought they should be and they should

00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:30,300
start from manufacturing and

00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:32,310
distribution not cool technology and the

00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:35,910
company they worked what they they got

00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:37,770
to work with in in Vietnam made products

00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:40,140
like this and they were incredibly

00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:43,589
robust they worked well and they treated

00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:47,370
thousands of babies but the problem is

00:15:43,589 --> 00:15:49,920
that when the designers from design that

00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:51,630
matters talk to people in hospitals they

00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,199
found that some hospitals some people in

00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:59,040
hospitals would rather have no equipment

00:15:54,199 --> 00:16:02,329
than equipment that looks like this they

00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:05,760
know what's available in the West and

00:16:02,329 --> 00:16:07,470
they'd rather have nothing than stuff

00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:11,540
that looks as if it's been thrown

00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:14,399
together and they don't trust it and

00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:17,870
this was the product that design that

00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,870
matters came came up with

00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:23,139
designers and engineers work together to

00:16:21,009 --> 00:16:26,399
make something that was practically that

00:16:23,139 --> 00:16:29,949
worked practically and culturally it's

00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:31,720
manufacturable it's affordable and it's

00:16:29,949 --> 00:16:34,359
trustworthy for the doctors in the

00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:38,049
hospital and the foundations that are

00:16:34,359 --> 00:16:40,329
going to donate it and as Tim postera

00:16:38,049 --> 00:16:44,319
they're they engineer in charge of the

00:16:40,329 --> 00:16:51,339
product said in his TED talk appearances

00:16:44,319 --> 00:16:55,929
matter and I want to finish by talking

00:16:51,339 --> 00:16:58,899
about a BBC series that was coordinated

00:16:55,929 --> 00:17:06,819
by an ex-student of mine from Ivrea I'm

00:16:58,899 --> 00:17:09,939
very proud to say and the idea of the of

00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:12,459
the series was to show how designers and

00:17:09,939 --> 00:17:15,159
engineers work together and how design

00:17:12,459 --> 00:17:18,039
is done and how products come into the

00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:20,709
world but what they thought is ok we're

00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:23,949
going to do this but they they put out a

00:17:20,709 --> 00:17:25,329
call to ordinary people for people who

00:17:23,949 --> 00:17:27,850
have real problems in their life that

00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:32,440
may be designed an engineering could fix

00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:34,960
for them the big life fix and they chose

00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:37,360
six products that they thought they

00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:40,120
could they could make and they were they

00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:44,279
range from preventing sheep stealing in

00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:48,190
Wales to a camera for a disabled boy

00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:51,940
games to help two teenagers with cystic

00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:54,610
fibrosis to get - to keep them doing

00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:58,899
these incredibly boring exercises that

00:17:54,610 --> 00:18:00,669
they have to do to keep healthy and then

00:17:58,899 --> 00:18:02,710
the last one which I'm going to show you

00:18:00,669 --> 00:18:07,269
was an aid for a young sufferer of

00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:09,549
Parkinson's disease and you can find

00:18:07,269 --> 00:18:14,320
this on the website of a BBC stories

00:18:09,549 --> 00:18:16,590
channel if you if you google Emma's

00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,590
watch

00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:25,200
[Music]

00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:31,230
alright I'm gonna try and replicate this

00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:34,440
here rocked a great start

00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:34,440
[Music]

00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:41,279
I tend to kind of just avoid doing

00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:42,960
sketching and writing now because it's

00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:49,440
just it's not really worth it if you get

00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:52,350
something like that anything you could

00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:55,260
do that would just make my hand do what

00:18:52,350 --> 00:19:00,390
I want it to do and that's my name with

00:18:55,260 --> 00:19:03,059
the incredible thing how do we even just

00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:05,010
begin to help her overcome this there's

00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:07,740
a particular symptom of her tremors and

00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:10,679
helping her be able to regain her

00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:12,059
writing ability her drawing ability you

00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:15,740
know I don't think we're ever going to

00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:15,740
get that back 100%

00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:29,759
tremors you get from Parkinson's so the

00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:32,429
spoon actually vibrates in opposition to

00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:44,610
how your hand might be shaking and it's

00:19:32,429 --> 00:19:48,210
therefore it is steady I'm making a very

00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:50,460
rough prototype and what this board does

00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:53,879
is I can connect into it through these

00:19:50,460 --> 00:20:01,169
wires these are tiny coin cell motors so

00:19:53,879 --> 00:20:06,269
these motors will vibrate hello I am

00:20:01,169 --> 00:20:07,889
Allison it's affecting something I don't

00:20:06,269 --> 00:20:10,499
quite know what's happening something is

00:20:07,889 --> 00:20:13,409
going on for them what this is doing is

00:20:10,499 --> 00:20:15,809
it's short-circuiting whatever feedback

00:20:13,409 --> 00:20:17,450
loop there is between the brain and the

00:20:15,809 --> 00:20:20,690
hand that's causing the tremors

00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:20,690
[Music]

00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:26,630
what suffering right I'm on I'm on to

00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,630
something

00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:32,329
[Music]

00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:40,960
[Music]

00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:40,960
Oh

00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,720
Jesus Christ

00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:55,740
[Music]

00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:55,740
Oh God

00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:03,360
it makes me forget that I have a Trevor

00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:16,660
hunter one of them penalty fashion about

00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:19,380
it yeah

00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:21,940
[Music]

00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:24,690
I've actually just written my name for

00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:46,660
like the first time in ages

00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:50,680
mom it's called the Emma so I think my

00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:53,830
message is this Haiyan studied us

00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:55,660
computer scientist but she's also an

00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:58,210
interaction designer and she works with

00:21:55,660 --> 00:22:00,460
designers and the team that they did all

00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:03,640
these projects with were designers and

00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:06,790
engineers and so my message is this

00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:08,800
together engineers and designers can

00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:12,430
achieve great things things that work

00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:13,840
well and work well for people and they

00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:17,980
were going to make our life on the

00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:20,910
internet robust useful and delightful

00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:20,910
thank you

00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:37,520
questions I think I think everybody got

00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:39,750
a bit emotional there you like I've gone

00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:45,960
yeah you know I think the whole front

00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:47,610
row huh well I think yeah not just a

00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:49,680
phone right okay yeah you've got

00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:54,390
everybody emotional I think it's a good

00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:56,670
example of it reminds us that we need to

00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:59,820
make practical things that work that

00:22:56,670 --> 00:23:03,180
thing worked but also our life is is

00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:04,950
full of emotion and we need to recognize

00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:07,710
that in the things that we are we are

00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:13,980
designing okay recovering from the tears

00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:16,830
on the front row Thanks so it's super

00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:18,360
interesting um I was wondering so like

00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:21,230
this this example and a few that you

00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:24,030
mentions absolutely amazing examples of

00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:26,280
tech4good and using the articles for

00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:27,660
good I was wondering whether you're

00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:31,110
aware of anything that is happening

00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:33,630
throughout the training process of like

00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:35,970
for example these like artists designers

00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:37,950
or architects engineers that are going

00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:41,250
through like formal training processes

00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:43,790
about listening to communities that

00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:46,980
aren't themselves or anything like that

00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:49,500
well certainly in teaching I teach

00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:50,880
interaction design and one of the first

00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:53,100
things we say to people is you're

00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:56,460
designing for people who are not like

00:23:53,100 --> 00:24:00,660
you and so I think this is really

00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:02,940
important and there's a lot of I think

00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:05,430
design thinking the whole design

00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:08,190
thinking process has been great but

00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:12,140
there's only half the process you also

00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:15,540
need to generate ideas and generate form

00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:18,540
and I think that that's what the

00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:21,090
designers are good at doing but

00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:27,120
certainly I I worked for a time at Apple

00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:30,270
and a team would go out and video people

00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:33,060
in their homes and it was incredibly

00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:34,950
inspiring inspiring of ideas and you

00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:36,240
think oh we could easy we could do

00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:39,270
something that and though that's a good

00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:42,670
idea and so I think that

00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:46,540
I've found that design students hate

00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:47,920
doing it to begin with they can't bear

00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:51,250
getting out there and talking to people

00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:53,740
or observing them but when they do they

00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:55,540
they get tremendously inspired and and

00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:57,640
so it's really important that it's part

00:24:55,540 --> 00:25:00,580
of their training and they learn how

00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:01,330
exciting it is cuz I don't know if that

00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:03,670
answers your question

00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:04,900
yep there's a question right in the

00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:11,500
middle we might have to repeat the

00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:14,460
question yes yeah it always gets me this

00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:17,530
divide between the arts and the sciences

00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:21,040
do you think we could just eliminate it

00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:22,990
totally by having everyone get a good

00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:25,750
scientific background and a good

00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:29,080
artistic background I think a

00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:35,200
rationalization the specialization yes

00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:36,790
yes well I'm of a generation that my

00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:40,510
science education was Archimedes

00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:43,380
principle and the electric Bell in my

00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:47,170
day it was possible to do no so Hans I

00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:50,890
think education is moving towards making

00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:53,140
sure that to a certain level young

00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:59,530
people get a scientific and an arts

00:25:53,140 --> 00:26:02,080
education but my feeling is that people

00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:04,270
people are different and they gravitate

00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:07,410
to different kinds of things they like

00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:09,940
doing different kinds of things and so I

00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:11,890
think there can be more and more

00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:14,320
overlaps and there are some people who

00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:17,470
do overlap like I an is an example who

00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:21,580
trained as a as an engineer and became a

00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:24,460
designer but that that is quite rare and

00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:28,300
it takes a lot of practice to learn the

00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:30,030
expertise of another of another area so

00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:32,830
that's why I think that it's good that

00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:35,440
designers and engineers work together in

00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:40,030
every area which is a school in northern

00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:43,590
Italy that Iran we had terrific

00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:47,020
engineers as students and designers and

00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:50,500
the engineers came to understand how

00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:51,730
designers work and the designers began

00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:54,640
to understand the tech

00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:56,920
and understand what amazing things the

00:26:54,640 --> 00:27:00,910
engineers were doing and so I think

00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:03,310
that's probably more realistic now maybe

00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:06,460
in the future it will change and the and

00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:10,520
the the gap between science and the arts

00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:19,940
will disappear us thank Gillian
