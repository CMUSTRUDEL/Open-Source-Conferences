so our next speaker we were going to do

00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:05,879
a one-on-one but looking at the size of

00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:09,269
its crowd I suspect most people who have

00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:10,559
lots of questions so our next speaker is

00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:13,500
going to speak for about 10 minutes and

00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:15,929
we'll open it up it's Sir Tim

00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:19,020
berners-lee perhaps best known for his

00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:22,010
starring role in the 2012 London

00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,010
Olympics Opening Ceremony

00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:30,279
to the web and he founded the World Wide

00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:34,000
Web foundation he's a professor at MIT

00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:35,890
and today he's going to talk about how

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,190
to fix some of the things that Rene was

00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:44,190
talking about Thanks

00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:44,190
Wow

00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:48,790
particle oh really coming up and then

00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:51,550
just explaining what it is so he's

00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:56,050
basically living and I have just gotten

00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:58,000
conflicts of all but a lot of people who

00:00:56,050 --> 00:01:01,200
moment the private most of things of

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,780
serious issues with this a lot of people

00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:07,300
in and end up worrying about the bottom

00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:12,580
ones here on this prefers privacy and in

00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:15,400
a way that is a has been hook for the

00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:17,710
solid project huh hands up how many

00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,910
people in this room have come across

00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:20,950
this whole project didn't know what it

00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:23,920
is

00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:25,960
how many people what

00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,670
right majority majority vote okay so we

00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:30,940
got this project called solid it was

00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:32,800
solid that mit.edu and now it's sir and

00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:34,750
just to the reason why you haven't heard

00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:36,790
about it partly that it's only have

00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:41,950
broken the surface of the water and

00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:44,830
those solids are the the new website

00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:46,990
just been live weeks ago and so you're

00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:50,860
forgiven so hand not having coming and

00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:55,150
of course it but solid as a project to

00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:58,340
that in a way is just too

00:01:55,150 --> 00:02:01,159
all the same web protocols but it's to

00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:04,070
complete in a way to revolutionize the

00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:07,759
well the way it works so socially that

00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:09,890
the privacy thing is solid thinks that

00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:12,020
you should have complete control of all

00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:13,420
your data you should control all your

00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:16,750
data

00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:18,670
so that's there that is difficult to go

00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:20,440
to achieve you think what might Allah on

00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:22,900
Facebook controls it okay well it

00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:24,310
matters never mind about Facebook okay

00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,930
let's look at the imagine we build it

00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:27,850
never mind how many millions of people

00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:29,380
on billions of people on Facebook that's

00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:31,090
irrelevant we can build a small

00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:32,620
community in which we believe that

00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:34,690
people should completely on their data

00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:36,250
and so so to be able to control your

00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:38,230
data that means you've got to be able to

00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:39,520
choose where it's stored so that means

00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:41,230
you've got to be able to have several

00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:44,140
places but at least one place is storage

00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:46,390
if you go to solid community or in lapse

00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:47,680
dotnet then you'll be able to go and get

00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:48,880
yourself an account there and that will

00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,700
give you the place to saw some data

00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:53,769
that'll be in in a cloud that moment is

00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:55,300
run by interrupts down the road carrots

00:02:53,769 --> 00:02:56,739
will be run by all kinds of people you

00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,090
will have personal contact hours and

00:02:56,739 --> 00:03:01,320
hopefully you'll be able to find people

00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:05,050
who run them that you really really

00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:07,090
trust and sometimes you may decide that

00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:09,970
rather than just using free stuff I will

00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:11,470
pay some money for or a piece of

00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:13,330
personal cloud piece of personal storage

00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:15,370
these things we call them pods by the

00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:16,600
way now I have a lot or you may be if

00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:19,900
you're a geek in quite a lot of you were

00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:23,860
in this room are geeks so you may go

00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:26,049
straight back by a by a nineties rack

00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:27,400
fit for the service and that is your

00:03:26,049 --> 00:03:29,350
solid pod and sort of things from the

00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,870
posterior and your friend so I've got a

00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:33,489
solid product at home in the u.s. that

00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:36,070
means that an American law rather than

00:03:33,489 --> 00:03:38,410
subpoenaing you know Dropbox to get to

00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:40,450
my data then the the American police

00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:42,220
would have together search warrant go

00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:44,760
through my my house so some people

00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:49,230
really take a group of people who were

00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:52,350
render the of the of the spectrums

00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:55,570
whatever they are these are even better

00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:57,640
so these are solid stickers and if you

00:03:55,570 --> 00:04:04,049
can't get them from here you can get

00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:06,400
them from pining our table when you are

00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:10,349
the rest of the day but

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:14,140
top stairs and so so sorry

00:04:10,349 --> 00:04:17,049
So Solid started off being about

00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:19,750
practice about driven by privacy feeling

00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:22,000
that I don't want I want to be able to

00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:23,889
just arrange to meet somebody discuss

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,490
the topic I want to have a chat without

00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:29,410
it contributing to all that stuff I

00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:31,750
don't want to contribute to the

00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:33,669
monetization data stream I don't review

00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:36,039
seen to people knowing or understanding

00:04:33,669 --> 00:04:37,600
more about me targeting more and more

00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:39,400
effectively and advertising I don't want

00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,650
it contributed to be repeated people

00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,780
being manipulated politically I just

00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:47,560
wanted to to sit there under my control

00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:49,270
and so but then so this the solid

00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:52,060
architecture then is that the apps and

00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:55,479
the data are completely separate that

00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:57,940
means that is a big chain if you're

00:04:55,479 --> 00:04:59,320
developer then this is in a way really

00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:00,910
really cool it means that instead of

00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,320
building you normally if you're

00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:03,760
developing you build a front-end which

00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,740
is the bit in the javascript in the

00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:08,080
browser which talks the user and you've

00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:11,560
built back end which is runs on the

00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:14,440
server it has bits of PHP and node and

00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:16,360
stuff and databases and every time you

00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,710
add a new feature to the front to a

00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,690
front-end you want to add a new feature

00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:21,300
in the new concept you and then you have

00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:24,760
to change the backend and the front-end

00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:26,770
but solid is sort of evolutionary in the

00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:28,659
sense that we have a common back-end

00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:31,000
there is no more back-end programming

00:05:28,659 --> 00:05:32,650
when you can develop solid apps you

00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,050
don't do in it you don't do any back-end

00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:37,599
developer all your side apps will run on

00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:39,520
any platform they just run it your app

00:05:37,599 --> 00:05:42,490
runs it RC users so where you want the

00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:46,330
stored and the user points you at their

00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:48,159
storage and when they and they you get

00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:50,199
the write read write stuff from storage

00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:52,690
but also because this is all linked beta

00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:55,540
so in fact when you start using you

00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:58,000
or not just you're not in fact living in

00:05:55,540 --> 00:06:00,310
a world where I'm just just having this

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,410
chat and I'm just sharing my only with

00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:04,330
myself they're really cool the powerful

00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:06,450
thing about it is you can share anything

00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:09,460
we don't have anything so you can choose

00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:11,980
where you store data you can choose who

00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:14,080
you share stuff with and the idea is

00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:15,640
that because this is you know it's a

00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,080
general platform where everybody and

00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:19,480
have ID you can have more than one ID

00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:21,250
but different personas that you can have

00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:23,530
but you can anybody who gives you a

00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:25,420
business card with a college ID on it

00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:27,490
you can take that business back home and

00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:31,420
you can go to that address and then you

00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:33,580
can drag there do well into your access

00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:35,080
control panel though you're for the

00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:36,460
photograph of the whatever it is you

00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:40,090
want to share with them and you can get

00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:41,750
them access so you can give the moment

00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:44,480
for example your

00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:47,770
in reality if you want you can go to the

00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:50,900
hospital website and you can there your

00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:54,860
medical stuff with your doctor and you

00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:56,840
dare set up to do to share things so on

00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:58,010
this they are medical tests and results

00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,810
of diagnosis and things

00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:01,850
okay meanwhile and a completely

00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:04,190
different site you can search things

00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:06,020
that you can share your photos with your

00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:08,690
family and friends who are on some

00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:10,640
social network but you can't share if

00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:12,980
you take a picture of your knee you

00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:14,480
can't share it with your doctor and in

00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:17,720
fact you want to share your medical

00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:20,150
stuff with your cousin and the but all

00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:22,450
this stuff is in silos the solid is

00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:25,780
about breaking down the silo

00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:27,160
solid tops of each one into

00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:29,140
if you want to build you can take your

00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:31,690
your silo of your existing tire it may

00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:33,310
be a wonderful app and you can go away

00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:35,320
after you've heard this talk and chop it

00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:38,680
into and take all the user interface

00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:40,450
stuff which is wonderful mix and allows

00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,220
people to do wonderful things elaborate

00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:45,490
and just make it run on top of a server

00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:47,140
and when it started making money make it

00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:50,230
right on top of a solid pop when the

00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:53,770
solid one is a generic API okay so how

00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:57,100
it is it's a standard mostly you know

00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:59,650
it's just HTTP and it's based HTTP and

00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:01,690
it's also access control standards so

00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:03,100
it's not just a GP we have to add things

00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:05,230
to it it's also we've got things like

00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:08,260
standards for doing contact so that

00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:11,770
every path can access your contact

00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:16,000
information and things like that so it's

00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:17,800
a it's a standard we've got company what

00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,750
society from my point of view is the

00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,820
first time in a gazillion years like

00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:25,210
since the 80s oh no working with a

00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:28,480
start-up and yeah it's called enrapt

00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:32,020
intercom an interrupt has also there

00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:34,900
what's been nice is been able to watch

00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:38,700
this for several years we had nice

00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:40,780
research funding for who is MIT now it's

00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:42,820
appropriate now to just be a put more

00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:45,339
energy into it who you never got we have

00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:49,630
commercial funding from Gosling ventures

00:08:45,339 --> 00:08:51,080
my others and to make this thing having

00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:53,899
so we can put we can

00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:55,430
but people on getting my making

00:08:53,899 --> 00:08:57,290
documentation we still have we have a

00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:59,930
finite number of people so in fact what

00:08:57,290 --> 00:09:01,490
interruptus done also is benefited

00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:03,410
enough just in the few days that it's

00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:06,800
been running we've had this tremendous

00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:09,050
surge of people arriving online people

00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,279
arriving here as well when we're in the

00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:12,680
science we have as people in science

00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:14,510
fair I'm sorry if I heard from somebody

00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:16,720
today who couldn't get to it because it

00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:18,490
was because he couldn't

00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,850
because there are too many people but

00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:25,379
but you can go there we'll have whatever

00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:28,930
stairs you can get stickers there but uh

00:09:25,379 --> 00:09:33,220
there's still sort of what's amazing

00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:35,079
about it has been the the amount of

00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:37,540
enthusiasm out there I suppose people

00:09:35,079 --> 00:09:38,970
some people say your documentation is

00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:42,910
non-existent

00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:44,379
I've blogged this is this is I tried it

00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:46,389
I put all the buttons I figured out how

00:09:44,379 --> 00:09:47,379
it worked and this is my blog and we had

00:09:46,389 --> 00:09:50,319
a couple of people doing that which is

00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:52,750
totally wonderful other people and so

00:09:50,319 --> 00:09:54,129
now we have got we got a guest channel

00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:56,490
but discussing the documentation

00:09:54,129 --> 00:09:58,629
problems and actually and creating

00:09:56,490 --> 00:10:00,100
groups of people to pay documentation

00:09:58,629 --> 00:10:02,860
we've got people working on defleshed

00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:05,350
this is the software of the server the

00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:07,569
server is something which basically is

00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:08,800
pretty that's most developed but so you

00:10:07,569 --> 00:10:12,579
can get the ref you can so you can

00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:15,519
install it it's a new NPM install loader

00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:18,100
solid server and it should run go onto

00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:21,819
Agata channel if you if you need help

00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:23,980
getting your running the apps are really

00:10:21,819 --> 00:10:26,680
early days because the idea is to get a

00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:28,360
server you know the community needs to

00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,800
create the server once it's booting

00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,509
server that everybody can make that

00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:33,639
we've got some apps I've got some apps

00:10:31,509 --> 00:10:35,829
I've got I run all of my life on apps

00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:39,430
most of my life actually runs easy solid

00:10:35,829 --> 00:10:41,680
apps but but the idea is that there will

00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:43,540
be thousands of flowers blooming

00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:46,420
millions of hours blooming when the apps

00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:49,269
but their work that goes into the

00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:51,459
backend into the solid servers will have

00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:52,899
them written in different languages if

00:10:51,459 --> 00:10:58,579
you're interested go programmers see me

00:10:52,899 --> 00:11:00,980
afterwards and so for example but the

00:10:58,579 --> 00:11:03,529
the way the architecture works is work

00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:04,910
on the server is finite we technically

00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:07,339
we have to maintain air what how to make

00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:08,809
new versions and stuff and all the

00:11:07,339 --> 00:11:10,519
energy goes into the app because the

00:11:08,809 --> 00:11:13,759
apps run in the browser or they run on

00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:16,459
the car or now this is computer they run

00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:18,579
under and the spirit of probably deficit

00:11:16,459 --> 00:11:18,579
is

00:11:18,649 --> 00:11:22,579
on behalf of the user when you're

00:11:20,269 --> 00:11:25,339
writing your solid app you are not

00:11:22,579 --> 00:11:28,550
trying to trick them we're going to have

00:11:25,339 --> 00:11:29,240
a concept of a beneficent app and maybe

00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:31,399
a brand

00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:33,860
so maybe benefit in depth so all all

00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:35,420
twist about it where if you put the

00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:38,990
benefits never land on it it means you

00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:41,119
have sworn as a developer to act that

00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:43,999
your software will act on behalf of user

00:11:41,119 --> 00:11:45,709
you will not buy to trick them into

00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:47,059
buying something in the middle of what

00:11:45,709 --> 00:11:49,790
they're doing you will try to help them

00:11:47,059 --> 00:11:51,170
contribute what they're doing

00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:54,769
you will help them collaborate your help

00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:56,629
them communicate well and so though that

00:11:54,769 --> 00:11:57,860
is that is a spirit it's a new spirit

00:11:56,629 --> 00:11:59,839
people say where are you going to get

00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:01,249
who's going to fund it if this is going

00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:04,429
to be advertising well guess what I

00:12:01,249 --> 00:12:07,399
think that we've got a also a lot of

00:12:04,429 --> 00:12:10,279
people who are after the fake news wave

00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:13,670
are saying you know what I realized I

00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:15,619
have to pay I want virginal II need to

00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:19,069
pay for news cuz I want to pay for

00:12:15,619 --> 00:12:20,860
somebody figure out my the things that I

00:12:19,069 --> 00:12:24,079
tell me things that I can trust I

00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:26,779
realized actually I can do and prepares

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:28,939
to pay like you give me free data yet

00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:31,309
but I I might pay just pay for this data

00:12:28,939 --> 00:12:33,199
storage because I respect that this data

00:12:31,309 --> 00:12:35,779
storage that I am using the solid pod

00:12:33,199 --> 00:12:38,120
doesn't abuse me and I'll pay for that

00:12:35,779 --> 00:12:40,639
to keep the whole system going and I

00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:43,100
will pay I'll donate 200 use open source

00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:45,769
apps but I will donate to them to keep

00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:48,559
the developers food on the table because

00:12:45,769 --> 00:12:50,870
I really respect these apps cuz these

00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:53,959
apps that they called user agents you

00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:55,819
know Mozilla the the noble Firefox is a

00:12:53,959 --> 00:12:59,149
is a user agent technically it's called

00:12:55,819 --> 00:13:01,490
user agent that was the term for the

00:12:59,149 --> 00:13:03,199
time and the idea of that was it

00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:05,240
represents the user that's kind of II

00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:07,699
not that's coming back with a solid apps

00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:09,829
are use agents they work on behalf of

00:13:07,699 --> 00:13:12,710
users it's a new revolution it's

00:13:09,829 --> 00:13:15,380
different but

00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:17,800
very exciting you and you join in thank

00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:17,800
you for yours

00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:29,730
and we have a question

00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:38,759
you

00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:42,899
just the practicalities how are we going

00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:45,509
to convince the current sets of siloed

00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:47,170
data they were opener hospitals or

00:13:45,509 --> 00:13:50,050
whatever

00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:52,450
that seems like a long boat well

00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:54,070
spacious say that and in fact that's

00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:55,870
been one of us have concerns is how will

00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:58,300
we get into most people have got all

00:13:55,870 --> 00:14:00,940
their data in a silo but mine mind you

00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:01,240
just recently a few weeks ago did you

00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:03,730
conquer

00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:07,959
data transfer project so the data

00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:11,620
transfer project is Google and Facebook

00:14:07,959 --> 00:14:14,529
and Microsoft and Twitter and and the

00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:17,019
and their partners discern announced

00:14:14,529 --> 00:14:19,389
within the data transfer project by the

00:14:17,019 --> 00:14:21,940
way we will all give you the right the

00:14:19,389 --> 00:14:24,670
ability the technical ability to

00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:27,100
download your data from one silo and

00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:29,889
move it into another silo so that means

00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:31,870
you can download it and so you can go

00:14:29,889 --> 00:14:34,149
and Google already done this you can go

00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:36,459
to Google takeout and in fact Apple

00:14:34,149 --> 00:14:38,889
wasn't in that list but there's a few

00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:40,779
days later Apple now announced they have

00:14:38,889 --> 00:14:43,389
a so now I've just tried it myself so

00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:44,920
you get you say I want for my data and

00:14:43,389 --> 00:14:46,959
they say well when you say all data this

00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:48,940
there are 30 different classifications

00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:51,970
of data what do you want and then we

00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:53,140
will prepare it for you and then you can

00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:54,699
download it and then you come back to

00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:58,390
the site awhile later and they prefer

00:14:54,699 --> 00:14:59,709
prepare a few an archive file and you

00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:01,329
can put it on a computer and you can

00:14:59,709 --> 00:15:03,670
unwrap it and so what we're working on

00:15:01,329 --> 00:15:06,519
now is all the difference and this is

00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:08,890
yes help would be lovely from the open

00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:13,480
source community is writing the code to

00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:16,060
take it from Google format and Apple

00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:17,890
format and so on and converts it into a

00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:19,810
solid format so that you can run your

00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:22,380
apps directly so instead of moving it

00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:25,120
back into another silo to do your photos

00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:30,300
actually you use your favorite open

00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:34,240
source photo editor and photo slideshow

00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:36,250
manager and stuff on your honor

00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,569
you pick your solid apps great thing

00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:39,160
about solid you know is you can use lots

00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:41,260
of different apps and you can at the

00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:43,029
same time on the same day I say and you

00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:45,370
can also if there's any app if you're a

00:15:43,029 --> 00:15:48,540
developer or you can for your any of it

00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:52,440
you don't appreciate you can

00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:55,380
make it better Devore so that's so the

00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:56,790
Google Data transfer project is one

00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:59,220
example

00:15:56,790 --> 00:16:00,420
why did you know you asked in my deserts

00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,800
and they all say out of the goodness of

00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:06,180
their heart and because they believe

00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:09,269
that they feel that they're if you were

00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:12,269
as a user they feel that they should set

00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:13,769
the bar high so that if you say with us

00:16:12,269 --> 00:16:15,510
you haven't eaten because you haven't

00:16:13,769 --> 00:16:19,500
been pleased it's because we've brought

00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:25,730
you with the best experience my mind you

00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:28,329
there is teaching whether the service

00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:28,329
that may work

00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:35,299
happy Oh and so

00:16:33,329 --> 00:16:37,379
although think so that's an so yeah

00:16:35,299 --> 00:16:40,019
banking there's a radio from banking in

00:16:37,379 --> 00:16:42,689
the UK so bit by bit I think given open

00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:44,759
banking given TTP if you're something

00:16:42,689 --> 00:16:47,309
else like if you're a fitness machine

00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:48,660
you know you know if we go if you go to

00:16:47,309 --> 00:16:51,779
fitness machine company and say I want

00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:53,549
my data then okay well then there are

00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:55,799
plenty of you can go to a different gym

00:16:53,549 --> 00:16:57,389
if this one won't give you your data but

00:16:55,799 --> 00:17:00,629
I think they will change this has been

00:16:57,389 --> 00:17:03,679
reached a tipping point and that this

00:17:00,629 --> 00:17:05,669
tipping point is just realizing that

00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:07,789
your data belongs to you and it's your

00:17:05,669 --> 00:17:07,789
right

00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:12,530
we've heard about the

00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:15,130
today's whim you've got the mic where

00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:18,350
I'm here in the middle okay

00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:21,200
github perpetuates this tragedy attracts

00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:24,200
uses an unusal alight it replaces its

00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:27,260
inherently distributed workflow with a

00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,950
centralized one it requires proprietary

00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:30,830
software

00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:33,740
it has vendor lock-in it blots innocent

00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:37,310
users based on their location alone many

00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:41,480
ethical alternatives exist so why do you

00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:44,510
host solid on github good question first

00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:46,970
of all because know what what should we

00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:48,620
vote so what will be better than getup

00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:50,510
well obviously a slight modification

00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:52,220
which I've been suggesting to all my

00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:54,860
friends who code you know every few

00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:56,240
every few weeks is that these can we

00:17:54,860 --> 00:18:00,020
have something which will take all of

00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:02,270
the site use the github API extract all

00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:03,490
of the status of all the push pull

00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:07,550
requests all of the stuff which is

00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:10,370
github but not it and put it into get so

00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:12,050
that you have a repo which has got and

00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:13,400
you know and you have a metal repo which

00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:15,110
has got all the discussion so in fact

00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:17,180
the whole thing is distributed so that

00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:19,700
you can then run it on and then you can

00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:24,570
so the idea is so we'll then what I like

00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:26,990
to do is clearly is yes you could

00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:31,590
you could use an open-source alternative

00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:33,930
silo or help us code a solid app so that

00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:37,430
anybody on any solid pod and just say

00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:40,560
I'm going to be opening a github like

00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:41,010
repository we have I mean what does it

00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:44,160
need

00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:46,830
it needs being of explore files it needs

00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:50,370
some basic UI which isn't rocket science

00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:52,260
it's got chat we got chat code so we've

00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:56,310
got you know quite a lot of pieces of us

00:18:52,260 --> 00:19:00,390
so yeah I think a distributed to to be

00:18:56,310 --> 00:19:03,840
able to say this is my repo on my solid

00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:05,610
pod and every veto and allowing people

00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:08,460
to clone it but and they clean it they

00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:10,860
end up cloning not own only the code but

00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:13,530
also the author all other discussion as

00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:16,250
well so yeah that will be far above

00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:16,250
better

00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:22,600
oh no moon we're on guitar if you talk

00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:25,120
to us we'd love to give you which is

00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:27,600
your wish would you recommend like it's

00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,600
level Oh

00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,980
you

00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:41,730
what we used but yeah this is

00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,360
distributed the problem is the social

00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:44,970
piece of it

00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:45,600
boom crashing off so that's what we want

00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:48,540
to move

00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,610
so yeah the but I think the good step

00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:53,750
for the community to do is to have a

00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:56,919
standard or all of

00:19:53,750 --> 00:20:00,850
or the order also he said

00:19:56,919 --> 00:20:03,220
get up I agree any stereo ironic that

00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:05,320
this wonderful wonderful decent rise the

00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:08,190
web community all our centralized on

00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:09,600
guitar yes

00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:11,230
thank you thank you very much for the

00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,540
over here thank you

00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:17,380
the presentation you've spoken about the

00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:19,990
privacy and went around solid and the

00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:21,429
idea of trust could you speak a little

00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:23,410
bit about the potential for the solid

00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:25,310
platform in terms of truly anonymous

00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:29,790
interaction

00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:36,540
sure so when you interact online

00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:38,190
I think the solid platform the I a lot

00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:39,750
of the apps that we build burbling bit

00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:41,490
off for collaboration and they often

00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:42,750
between collaboration between people and

00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:46,020
people in this room who collaborate

00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:49,170
whether whether with a professional

00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:50,610
identity and so if you're in this room

00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:53,880
when you put up your size you want

00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:55,800
people know your your LinkedIn profile

00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:57,720
if using then your Twitter profile on

00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:59,760
you they want you you want you should

00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:02,100
know where you've published your papers

00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:07,150
and so so the sent to a certain extent

00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:08,990
as a there's a role for for

00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:11,780
they talk about people which is very

00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:14,120
very open in public but then when it but

00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:17,179
then if your whistle or if your they get

00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:19,730
to go into a mode where you want to do

00:21:17,179 --> 00:21:21,530
something quietly or you want to have a

00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:25,760
very different the world start with you

00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:28,860
can have as many you you can have as

00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:30,210
many solid IDs as you want

00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:32,179
and you don't have to have any

00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:34,549
connection between them

00:21:32,179 --> 00:21:37,429
other things you do which is by need is

00:21:34,549 --> 00:21:40,100
for example you can if I have to know

00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:42,889
you through a completely different who

00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:45,049
are sailing together or something it may

00:21:42,889 --> 00:21:46,460
be that I will know that that you're

00:21:45,049 --> 00:21:48,440
Monica and the sailing club is the same

00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:50,720
as your Monica that you've used when you

00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:52,759
go to malls fest and so I might be able

00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,740
to when I look at your stuff I might see

00:21:52,759 --> 00:21:56,960
all of your blogs in both sides because

00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:58,460
you've told me but I saw that a little

00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,740
piece of information very privately in

00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:04,249
my contacts although interesting things

00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:07,159
you can do there but but and but also

00:22:04,249 --> 00:22:11,389
you can have you can also meant a a

00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:13,669
solid ID not attach anything to us at

00:22:11,389 --> 00:22:15,860
all go and make your point you know go

00:22:13,669 --> 00:22:18,169
through tour to a solid provider mints

00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:22,029
something have your discussion make your

00:22:18,169 --> 00:22:22,029
point and then disappear and

00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:28,150
here so the question is

00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:33,610
the question is what would you build

00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:37,020
with the trillion dollars

00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:37,020
you can't say solid

00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:43,789
if I had to trillion dollars

00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:45,619
doc bill

00:22:43,789 --> 00:22:47,850
uh well I start by making the

00:22:45,619 --> 00:22:51,179
distributed get

00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:53,340
uh-huh but but what I would build and

00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:54,900
fill of those stuff with but it would

00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:59,100
all be based on solid it would all be

00:22:54,900 --> 00:23:00,370
solid it'd all be solid at so

00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:02,170
I'm

00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:05,350
gonna build anything now which is motive

00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:07,260
compatible uh I don't I'm not gonna

00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:08,460
build a silo

00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:11,510
I'm just gonna build everything

00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:11,510
everything that was

00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:16,789
but Java check

00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:24,490
quick question technically it sounds

00:23:21,059 --> 00:23:27,460
very elegant I just wondered if there's

00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:31,450
any environmental concerns with kind of

00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:33,190
moving to such a decentralized model as

00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:35,740
mean I guess say what you like about

00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:38,980
Facebook Google you know they obviously

00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:41,950
have learned how to build very efficient

00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:45,220
large-scale datacenters I just wanted

00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:48,070
any concerns around decentralizing in

00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:49,840
that way advice you might have it's a

00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:55,240
good question so I'm not an expert on

00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:58,419
the on the ecological efficiency of my

00:23:55,240 --> 00:24:02,650
brother is closer to that asking Mike

00:23:58,419 --> 00:24:05,720
but so it is a good question I think

00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:08,090
never I think I'd never be sure whether

00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:12,680
all are worried about the huge data

00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:14,720
centers is whether in fact it's as

00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:16,430
serious as worrying about everybody

00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,800
having each other they've run it they

00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:20,330
leave running and so on and if you do if

00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:24,950
you do have a server at home then it

00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:28,580
does have an assay on but so building

00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:30,710
servers which can be very which vary

00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:35,120
which wind down mentally don't have

00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:37,100
hands and for example have and the art

00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:39,200
of building center like that that is

00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:41,450
quite important I think that in fact

00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:44,650
solid I imagine a lot of the solid part

00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:48,740
will be on a on machines that are all

00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:52,700
earlier ha between a thousand and one

00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:54,260
hundred thousand and many and many of

00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:56,690
them will have them anymore so the many

00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:59,990
were there will be big riders but on the

00:24:56,690 --> 00:25:02,270
other hand it is nice that you can you

00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:04,670
can get a Raspberry Pi and you and put a

00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:06,560
disk on it and you can download the

00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:08,450
solid server on it and you can be and

00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:11,290
people done that ok they've got solid

00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:13,190
solid balls running on rusty pipes now

00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:14,810
occupies it might turn out to be

00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:17,600
horribly inefficient if they are the way

00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:20,900
or every saw their data but it's very

00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:23,960
cool to be able to put or OData just an

00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:26,210
erosion flag gotta say so yeah and the

00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:28,340
total effect on environment yeah we

00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:32,180
should think about it down the line some

00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:34,820
interesting page but the spirit of being

00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:38,600
free with your own Rogers pie I think

00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:40,220
for such a man I would have to cook with

00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:44,140
the warming is it over the path that

00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:44,140
introduces requested her

00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:50,590
in Iran

00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:52,330
Oh is there going to be some sort of

00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:55,600
moderation on what data is actually

00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:58,000
stored on odds on the solid pods because

00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,680
what you long ago this great new system

00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,750
for sharing files came around little bit

00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:04,420
boring but these days people use

00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:07,120
Victorian to download pirated media so

00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:10,240
how are you gonna maybe protect solid

00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:12,100
not becoming that really good question

00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:15,580
because yeah but other people would say

00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:18,490
how can you will you promise not to stop

00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:19,990
solid becoming that so people say if I

00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:22,120
use solid but I should be able use it

00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:23,560
for my pirated media via so some people

00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:25,000
wonder the stream will say but that's

00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:29,320
free speech be able to send over my

00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,580
power parity media so what is tricky at

00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:32,680
the moment

00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:36,100
though I think two related questions

00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:38,530
that I'm less worried about well in fact

00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:40,210
I'm boom worried in a way yes I'm

00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:43,480
worried about people use abusing solid

00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:49,470
in lots of different ways that's one the

00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:49,470
if the article 13 gets through European

00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:56,169
we've got through your palm comes law

00:26:52,539 --> 00:26:58,450
then now that there's a law coming along

00:26:56,169 --> 00:27:01,450
which would mean that I would have to

00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:03,840
not only take down stuff that dizzy

00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:06,190
tells me is is infringing but also

00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:08,590
construct my service so that nobody

00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:10,539
could ever upload them again that would

00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:11,950
be you know that we can't do that with

00:27:10,539 --> 00:27:14,200
all sort of software we can't do that

00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:16,360
with our team which I haven't gotten in

00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:20,020
anyway we talk about privacy so we're

00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:22,059
not going to have adults ravaging

00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:24,100
through all our users files to find out

00:27:22,059 --> 00:27:25,960
whether they're pornographic or whether

00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:27,520
they're or whether they're parish and so

00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,990
on so that that is not a simple question

00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:31,090
to answer

00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:33,220
I think but following on the previous

00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:35,020
poking away at the question I'm in a way

00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:38,440
more interested in which is more

00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:39,669
important Hannett American because the

00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:42,809
corporate copyright system is kind of

00:27:39,669 --> 00:27:46,659
broken anyway but

00:27:42,809 --> 00:27:49,149
hate speech and radicalization online

00:27:46,659 --> 00:27:50,620
yeah anybody if you want to start if you

00:27:49,149 --> 00:27:53,019
wanna recognize people invite them to

00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:55,419
your solid community it's a great way of

00:27:53,019 --> 00:27:59,380
thousand you effort community in which

00:27:55,419 --> 00:28:04,299
you create a world of of completely fake

00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:07,380
values and so on so yeah I think when

00:28:04,299 --> 00:28:09,750
you look up what's up

00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:13,500
was used by whatsapp groups were used to

00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:15,330
radical to to get people to believe that

00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:19,110
they should saw so there hang here for

00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:22,470
example in Myanmar and they did sorts of

00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:24,030
people in Myanmar and the Facebook one

00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:25,890
what happened they didn't really do

00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:27,330
anything about it is they calm well that

00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:31,380
is he lifted and that's where people

00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:33,230
like it and so as massive look so lots

00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:36,320
of tricky questions about if you want it

00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:38,270
if you want to build a system

00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:40,460
shouldn't we should yeah on one right

00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:43,400
and we should give other people's

00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:47,350
privacy is taraj extent is it is assured

00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:50,870
with them how do you there's always been

00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:52,220
this comforter this conflict between the

00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:54,680
needs of law enforce

00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:57,320
and the leaves of the privacy of

00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:59,780
reasonable human being sent

00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:02,480
that's always a debate in this country

00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:06,400
is swung recently looked quite a lot

00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,400
over towards the demands of lon

00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:10,110
okay Oh

00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:16,960
but my question is how can we help we

00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:20,120
partner and how can we help promote

00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:22,430
solids because I'm based here in the

00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:24,680
Olympic and I know it's a big data

00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:26,120
project they're about how they can use

00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:28,490
people's data to help them navigate the

00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:29,780
part with a view to actually expending

00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:31,760
that if it works for the part it's gonna

00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:34,850
work for London beyond and my question

00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:36,440
is have we helped so well involve solid

00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:38,990
in your project build build build the

00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:40,550
apps so that they store users data if

00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:42,560
you have to use user data

00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:45,680
ask them to log in with a solid and then

00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:48,260
you'll have access to their odd as a

00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:49,730
read/write space and you can store all

00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:53,210
the history of them wandering around

00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:55,370
Rock and what they like and there and

00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:56,870
then you can allow them to share it with

00:29:55,370 --> 00:29:58,640
people if they wanted to or otherwise

00:29:56,870 --> 00:30:00,500
not share depending on what they were

00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:04,340
doing in the park I suppose and so

00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:07,430
there's but yeah that's a great example

00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:08,780
of a Civic app right where you're

00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:11,720
building it for the community one thing

00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:13,730
is you could have a solid pod where you

00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:17,720
put all the park data and you have to

00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:20,900
and you have a one run by the town run

00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:22,670
by the by the project which

00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:24,230
we're gonna have discussions about what

00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:26,660
what we should do with the park or about

00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:29,000
what what would be better instead of

00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:30,800
that ugly thing in in the park those

00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,350
we're going to host and we're going to

00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:35,330
store them you can keep copies of them

00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:38,059
but we're gonna store them all right on

00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:39,740
our pod because it's house you know it's

00:30:38,059 --> 00:30:42,320
a civic thing this is an open public

00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:44,330
public vision and the chat will be

00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:46,190
archived and it will be real forever and

00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:50,330
people get understand why we came to

00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:53,090
these discussions so when you're doing

00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:56,330
civic things having a pod which is which

00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:58,160
is uses the same architect but it says

00:30:56,330 --> 00:31:02,540
let's be open about this and lock it

00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:05,300
open it is great that people meanwhile

00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:08,059
come along and put the bookmark be part

00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:11,290
of they could put their bookmarks over

00:31:08,059 --> 00:31:13,940
this last part like in their own solid

00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:16,520
private basis of the nobody that nobody

00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:19,120
needs to know which bits they like

00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:19,120
yeah Oh

00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:26,649
I think that's a an excellent way to

00:31:23,049 --> 00:31:27,850
celerity of the Olympic everyone we're

00:31:26,649 --> 00:31:29,799
