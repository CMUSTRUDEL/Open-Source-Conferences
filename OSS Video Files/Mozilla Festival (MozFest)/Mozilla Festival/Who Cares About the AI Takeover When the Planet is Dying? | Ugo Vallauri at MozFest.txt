without further ado let me welcome who

00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:17,490
go the Lowry and talking about something

00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:20,160
that's very dear to my heart I didn't

00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:22,350
bring you any slides but I decided to

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,840
bring you a story and it's a story about

00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:28,260
last year I received a special present

00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:30,269
my very first wearable connected or how

00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:34,140
should we call this marked perhaps smart

00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:36,690
device it's a SmartWatch and my wife

00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,910
bought it for me not really knowing what

00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:40,440
amount of travel we would all get that

00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:43,440
by doing that here it is

00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:45,690
so as in all the first time

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,719
relationships I decided I will take some

00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:51,210
time learn to love it because I

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,230
generally love technology I want to make

00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:56,820
the most of it

00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:59,399
and so I learn to control it to make

00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:01,710
sure it wouldn't disturb me all the time

00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:03,809
with the multiple level of notifications

00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:07,680
that these things can have so we had a

00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:11,549
good relationship and then actually

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:16,680
something once it's very wrong one day I

00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:19,229
take it off just as I'm doing now and I

00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,030
have to charge it so I charge it because

00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:23,600
if things as marked as they are they

00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:27,000
need to be charging all of the time and

00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:32,369
the next morning when I try to put it

00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:36,390
back on it dies and what happened it was

00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:43,500
exactly a year and perhaps two weeks

00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:45,509
after the end of the warranty and but

00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,820
there's actually worse to it it's not

00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:48,460
just that so I go online of course and

00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,350
turns

00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:54,520
that the manufacturer that had come up

00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:56,850
with this watch had since folded had

00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:59,140
been bought by another manufacturer and

00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:01,930
the first thing that this manufacturer

00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:04,090
did was to discontinue all level of

00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:06,670
support and all the products and

00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:08,619
services around that device just one

00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:10,030
final software update and that was it

00:02:08,619 --> 00:02:12,100
end of story

00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:14,319
and of course that means there is no

00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:17,130
place to repair this product anywhere in

00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:20,200
the world also because it was a niche

00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:21,910
product that was supported by a

00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:25,600
crowdfunding campaign like many

00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:28,360
excellent makers products and there's no

00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:30,820
repair manuals for that very specific

00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:33,850
model of the device there are no spare

00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:36,790
parts available and I have nothing that

00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:40,510
I can do about it so it's probably about

00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:42,310
every problem in this case and it's

00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:45,340
really hard you go on all kinds of

00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:47,980
websites online and you just cannot find

00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:50,800
that very battery or it's in some

00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:54,030
obscure website you're not so sure that

00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:57,790
it will give you the answer you're after

00:02:54,030 --> 00:03:01,030
so for me it was kind of an easy

00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:03,250
solution like put it aside like most

00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:06,010
people do because I spent a lot of time

00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:08,230
and what I do like to repair things at

00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:12,310
times you just don't have the time to do

00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:15,790
it guess what I did I brought back from

00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:19,060
the dead my good old 11 year old watch

00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:22,209
which is perhaps not as smart as this

00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:25,690
one but when I come to it think about it

00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:28,120
it is solar powered it's worked for 11

00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:30,820
years it's seen better days but it's

00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:33,070
never let me down and despite not

00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:35,109
connecting to the internet it can

00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:36,790
somehow magically connect to some

00:03:35,109 --> 00:03:38,400
satellites and all throughout Europe

00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:40,560
always know what timing

00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:45,420
three days without being a connected

00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:47,250
devices magic so I suspect that I'm not

00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:50,129
really the only one in this room that

00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:52,110
has had similar experience perhaps not

00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:54,599
with a SmartWatch perhaps it was with

00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:57,359
that printer or with that phone or

00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:59,159
laptop or any other device make some

00:03:57,359 --> 00:04:00,870
noise if you had the experience of

00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:05,909
similar thing and it's frustrated the

00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:07,980
hell out of you exactly where all of us

00:04:05,909 --> 00:04:10,500
all of us in this room have had this

00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:13,889
problem sooner or later or we will have

00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:16,169
this problem so it's not obviously just

00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:19,919
about batteries it's about how products

00:04:16,169 --> 00:04:22,289
are designed manufactured marketed to us

00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:26,220
and how the level of support to this

00:04:22,289 --> 00:04:29,220
product is way less than stellar so what

00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:31,620
can we do about this five years ago my

00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:36,090
friend John at cancer and I had an idea

00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:38,970
and we decided we would throw the first

00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:41,639
of many restart parties in a small

00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:44,160
public Northland W it was a Saturday

00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:47,240
afternoon someone made me think well

00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:50,430
actually it was a sunny summer afternoon

00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:54,289
in London like there's not that many of

00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:56,849
them and people came people came out to

00:04:54,289 --> 00:04:58,860
volunteer or to take things to repair

00:04:56,849 --> 00:05:01,470
people that we have never met of course

00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:05,039
a few friends as well but I'll never

00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:08,250
forget the woman who had cycled with her

00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:10,590
printer on her bike for five miles to

00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:12,120
get to this place because she was too

00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:14,669
frustrated to give up her and her

00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:17,729
printer and I'll never remember the man

00:05:14,669 --> 00:05:20,789
who arrived with a suitcase full of

00:05:17,729 --> 00:05:23,669
tools and he didn't need any explanation

00:05:20,789 --> 00:05:25,889
somehow we both knew what had to happen

00:05:23,669 --> 00:05:28,050
we had never spoken before and he

00:05:25,889 --> 00:05:31,199
started fixing straightaway like a

00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:34,110
machine but like a human really because

00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:36,260
it wasn't just fixing he was engaging in

00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:39,570
conversations with others trying to

00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:43,220
explain why that lamp or the alarm clock

00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:45,289
could still have a secretaries of life

00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:49,259
fast-forward to

00:05:45,289 --> 00:05:51,809
2017 soon we realized that this was not

00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:53,699
going to be just a hobby and we created

00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:56,339
an organization it's called the restart

00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:59,429
project which aims to inspire people not

00:05:56,339 --> 00:06:01,379
just to fix things but to really rethink

00:05:59,429 --> 00:06:02,639
our relationship with electronics and

00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:06,629
small electricals

00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:09,119
to really renegotiate who owns what and

00:06:06,629 --> 00:06:11,449
what level of control we have over the

00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:15,389
devices that are increasingly

00:06:11,449 --> 00:06:17,249
controlling our lives we all have so

00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:19,649
many gadgets and increasingly

00:06:17,249 --> 00:06:22,199
increasingly we have even more of them

00:06:19,649 --> 00:06:25,919
with more connected devices popping up

00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:28,649
all the time and yet we seem to be

00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:31,439
losing control of them and not being

00:06:28,649 --> 00:06:34,469
able to decide when to upgrade when to

00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:38,159
buy the next one I want to just make the

00:06:34,469 --> 00:06:40,139
most of what we already have in five

00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:42,479
years the research project has started

00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:45,149
supporting groups in more than 10

00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:47,909
countries to run their own repair events

00:06:45,149 --> 00:06:50,729
we developed an educational program

00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:53,579
where we support teachers to inspire

00:06:50,729 --> 00:06:56,839
people young people to think in a more

00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:59,819
holistic way about the challenges of

00:06:56,839 --> 00:07:01,889
electronics and the environment right

00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:02,509
because the environment is key to all of

00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:07,279
this

00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:11,009
so in 2018 it is projected we will have

00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:13,409
50 million tons of electronic waste

00:07:11,009 --> 00:07:15,569
around the world now that number might

00:07:13,409 --> 00:07:19,049
mean nothing to you but it means that

00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:21,839
this massive electronic waste is growing

00:07:19,049 --> 00:07:22,639
at a rate of approximately 5% year and

00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:26,039
here

00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:29,069
what's even more worrying is that while

00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:31,860
we all feel guilty when we see the

00:07:29,069 --> 00:07:35,189
pictures of how people in places like

00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:38,039
Ghana are trying to recycle in a DIY way

00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:40,229
electronics and health conditions that

00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:42,209
they experience doing that we don't

00:07:40,229 --> 00:07:44,639
really do enough to look in our own

00:07:42,209 --> 00:07:45,630
backyard we don't do enough to see how

00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,090
personally

00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:50,490
we can make a difference and so it's

00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:52,320
easy to get upset about that just as

00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:54,270
much as it easy to say oh it's cute that

00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:56,250
people are doing community repair events

00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:57,990
around the world but there's something

00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:59,670
to eat that's more profound and

00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:02,910
something that we can all learn

00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:05,340
something from we're not just doing this

00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:08,010
because it's fun to have a community

00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:11,250
event where volunteers shares with

00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:14,400
others we're doing this because it is

00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:16,860
important to increase people's awareness

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,780
about the true impact of the products we

00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:20,730
own I spoke about an electronic waste

00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:24,240
but actually we should be speaking a lot

00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:26,730
more about the embodied carbon in all

00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,470
the products we buy it's not just about

00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:30,540
how much they weight in fact they weight

00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:33,090
less and less every year and that's part

00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:35,340
of the problem the embodied carbon the

00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:38,729
footprint of this product is increasing

00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:41,520
at a really worrying rate and we have to

00:08:38,729 --> 00:08:43,260
take action we the people who developed

00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:45,870
the software and the hardware for this

00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:48,570
products we the people who consumed we

00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:51,120
the citizens who should be a lot more

00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:53,430
concerned about what's happening we're

00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,100
not working in isolation there's plenty

00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:58,680
of others that are doing similar work

00:08:55,100 --> 00:09:00,600
thankfully in the last few weeks we've

00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:03,420
launched the very first international

00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:06,150
repair day forget don't forget it will

00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:08,550
be celebrated on the third Saturday of

00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:12,420
October so just one week before most

00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:14,370
Fest every year to come we had about 70

00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:16,590
men around the world to celebrate this

00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:19,440
and we expect a lot more happening in

00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:21,330
the next few years even more importantly

00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,060
we've launched an open repair alliance

00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:24,780
with people running repair cafes around

00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:28,830
the world

00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:31,290
fix-it clinics and a lot more and the

00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:33,990
idea of this is that together citizen

00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:38,010
action can bring out the stories that

00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:41,070
currently are just purely speculative

00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:44,760
about what are the recurrent faults that

00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:47,310
people can or cannot fix a community

00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:49,740
why should the design of products really

00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:51,960
change to make an impact in the way

00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:54,390
products can become again more

00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:58,470
repairable rather than less repairable

00:09:54,390 --> 00:10:01,860
now why is this crucial for the future

00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:04,740
of a healthy internet well more and more

00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:07,110
devices are connected internet and

00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:11,010
things or Internet of Things as people

00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:12,990
call them and this is not coming without

00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:16,470
some level of trouble

00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:19,020
firstly we are seeing products that are

00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:21,510
increasingly miniaturized what that

00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:23,910
means is it's becoming increasingly hard

00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:26,250
to open them to repair them and give

00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:28,410
them a second lease of life I'll give

00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:31,620
you a small example there are laptops

00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:34,530
out there today that if you break the

00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:36,360
keyboard you will have to replace the

00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:38,430
whole top face of the laptop which is

00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:42,030
worth about two thirds of the whole

00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:45,650
machine not just one key that you could

00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:48,360
evolve for independence or 50 cents and

00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:50,910
you can no longer upgrade the memory of

00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:53,280
this products for example but there's

00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:54,900
something even more deeply worrying the

00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:57,870
conversation around the Internet of

00:10:54,900 --> 00:11:00,030
Things it's currently very much focused

00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:02,610
around the security and increasingly the

00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:04,500
safety around using this Berlin's the

00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:08,340
security because of the data breaches

00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:11,520
and our data being exploited by third

00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:13,670
parties without us even knowing safety

00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:16,740
because some of these products are used

00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:20,780
to save people's lives and if they can

00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:23,940
become at the heart problems cars

00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:25,770
pacemakers and the likes but these are

00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:27,690
symptoms of something bigger that's

00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:31,170
happening and that we're not realizing

00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:33,690
for basically products are no longer

00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:36,120
supported sufficiently more products

00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:38,640
include software inside them that

00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:41,220
theoretically is there to be updated

00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:44,340
over time but practically the support to

00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:47,100
these products end of times much sooner

00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:48,390
than the company is willing to provide a

00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:51,030
warranty

00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:54,120
which is probably insane but I bet most

00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:55,950
of you have a home a smart TV and you

00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:58,320
realize quite quickly that some of the

00:11:55,950 --> 00:12:00,210
apps that it came with are not really

00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,800
working on that TV anymore

00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:04,800
perhaps the machine is still under

00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:06,480
warranty and yet you're stuck and you

00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,420
might want to start thinking about

00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:12,150
what's next you really shouldn't you can

00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:16,590
still fix it and find alternatives but

00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:19,380
you get the idea so it's becoming pretty

00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:22,110
much paradoxically that in it's not even

00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:24,660
about fixing a product what's the point

00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:28,020
of being able to fix a product as it

00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:30,780
repair it if it's broken if the software

00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:32,550
that runs on the product ill is no

00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:35,160
longer supported and ultimately will

00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:37,710
make that product useless it's coming to

00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:40,110
the point where this is a reality it's

00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:41,850
not like some distant future dystopian

00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:45,480
it's something that's happening here and

00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:49,050
now and it's not to even mention what's

00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:52,140
happening when a manufacturer decides to

00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:54,750
provide a software update which actually

00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:57,420
makes the product too slow

00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:59,580
to continue using or even worse and this

00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:01,820
has happened in the last month release

00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:05,600
is a software update that renders all

00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:07,860
non-certified genuine spare parts

00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,590
incompatible and makes the product no

00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:14,280
function anymore this is happening now

00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:17,700
and while we discuss about how nice it

00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:21,380
is to think about maybe a fridge of the

00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:23,550
future where you can simply order

00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:26,130
automatically your milk when you run out

00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:29,130
and you know all this nice utopians less

00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:30,960
dystopian scenarios there's actually

00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:33,450
something that's happening here now and

00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:36,060
somehow we'll become complicit because

00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:40,170
we like the slick device devices they're

00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:44,400
designed and whatnot but I'd like to

00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:46,380
give you some hope because it's up to us

00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:48,540
to do something about all of this and

00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:52,320
there's a lot that we can do as

00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:54,810
individuals we can all take part in

00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:58,380
there are promoting a healthier approach

00:13:54,810 --> 00:14:02,310
to the devices that we use so next time

00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:05,310
you break some don't despair just walk

00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:07,740
to your community repair event whether

00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:10,949
it's a restart party Club the repair

00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:13,589
odorous in South America report on in

00:14:10,949 --> 00:14:16,139
North American Canada or America fail or

00:14:13,589 --> 00:14:18,569
whatever else and if your technical

00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:20,220
share your skills and you learn a lot

00:14:18,569 --> 00:14:23,130
from the participants that you'll engage

00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:25,709
with if you're desperate about trying to

00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:27,959
fix the device bring the device with you

00:14:25,709 --> 00:14:30,449
and you learn something about it but a

00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:33,240
lot of people in this room are very

00:14:30,449 --> 00:14:36,060
technical and they're deeply involved in

00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:38,459
making the internet a better place if

00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:41,040
you're a software developer if you are a

00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:43,949
hardware developer if you're a maker if

00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:47,880
you think about crowdsourcing your

00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:50,430
future device think about how you can

00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:52,980
put people and the planet at the heart

00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:55,649
of your design process think about the

00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:59,639
services you're developing as something

00:14:55,649 --> 00:15:01,889
that should live longer than just the

00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:05,220
warranty period of the device and try to

00:15:01,889 --> 00:15:07,560
think about support in the open free and

00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:10,410
open source communities that are at the

00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:12,199
heart of an enhancing and prolonging the

00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:16,769
life of the products that we already own

00:15:12,199 --> 00:15:19,399
perhaps more importantly act as a

00:15:16,769 --> 00:15:22,260
citizen first not just thinking about

00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:24,660
behind next products or making the most

00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:28,139
of a product but let's use our connected

00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:29,490
voices and let's tell the better story

00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:32,459
of how products

00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:36,420
supported for longer can be more

00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:40,740
powerful and helpful for everyone one

00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:42,839
last thing I've spoken to many designers

00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:46,079
engineers that are at the heart of

00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:49,139
developing the products that we all use

00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:52,439
I spoke to previous developers of the

00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:53,910
iPhone and they all agree with us if

00:15:52,439 --> 00:15:56,370
they all agree with us that it's

00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:57,330
nonsense that products don't last as

00:15:56,370 --> 00:16:00,480
long as we

00:15:57,330 --> 00:16:02,880
beside them to last so as individuals we

00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,930
all agree but we have a strong chance to

00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,570
tell a better story

00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:09,510
convincing manufacturers regulators and

00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:11,940
designers to jump on board and say no to

00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:15,109
unnecessary waste thank you

00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:15,109
[Applause]

00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:27,449
[Applause]

00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:36,180
very bright others oh there's a burning

00:16:27,449 --> 00:16:38,459
question in the back sorry sorry so if

00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:42,300
you don't have restart cafe near you as

00:16:38,459 --> 00:16:47,790
fortunate lots of people that bristle do

00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:49,800
rather don't isn't it just

00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:52,319
isn't that already a frequent for this

00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:56,220
in the form of repair shops that we can

00:16:52,319 --> 00:17:00,350
go to and is it sustainable to rely on

00:16:56,220 --> 00:17:00,350
open community which is unpaid

00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:07,140
absolutely far from saying that open

00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:10,589
communities are the only solution in

00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:13,799
fact they are one small part of a bigger

00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:16,199
solution we increasingly know that the

00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:19,890
challenges that we face as community

00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:23,010
repair activists are exactly the same

00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:25,890
that trustworthy repairs across the

00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:29,039
world experience a lack of access to

00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:31,070
good parts to manuals and the threat

00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:34,409
that even if you install a third-party

00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:37,320
screen on the phone next time you update

00:17:34,409 --> 00:17:40,010
the software who reject it so we are

00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:42,780
very much in favor of returning to

00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:45,980
repair economy a thriving repair economy

00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:49,020
except at the moment it seems to be

00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:51,780
concentrating on very high value devices

00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:55,289
like mobile phones tablets and

00:17:51,780 --> 00:18:00,510
increasing game unavailable for problems

00:17:55,289 --> 00:18:02,250
like this so we need to support all

00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:06,330
kinds of commercial and nonprofit

00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:08,659
initiatives that NGO that promotes a

00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:08,659
different

00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:27,480
so there are multiple initiatives

00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:29,480
happening in the US there's a growing

00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:34,080
movement around the right to repair

00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:37,380
which touches upon the IP and the

00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:40,590
control over that manufacturers have in

00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:44,720
allowing or not allowing independent

00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:47,929
repairs to do their work in the EU level

00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:53,580
there's work around the circular economy

00:18:47,929 --> 00:18:56,820
on on multiple fronts but not yet around

00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:59,070
the software obsolescence that we see at

00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:01,860
the heart of tomorrow's problems so

00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:04,940
we're trying to bring that voice but

00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:07,050
we're desperately behind and in a sense

00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:09,390
there's a lot of people thinking about

00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:13,559
this in the context of connected cars

00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:17,130
and not realizing that this is the same

00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:20,809
for your music players for your all we

00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:20,809
are the devices so a lot more

00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,400
