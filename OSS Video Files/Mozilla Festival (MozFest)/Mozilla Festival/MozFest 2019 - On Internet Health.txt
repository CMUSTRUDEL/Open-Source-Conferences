okay next up we have Morita Chaka she is

00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:07,919
Stanford centers policy policy center

00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,690
international policy director she

00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:12,030
previously served as a member of the

00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:13,530
European Parliament and she has a talk

00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:21,660
for you guys next so I'd like to bring

00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:22,980
up rich Chaka so I'm sorry if you

00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,350
thought you were gonna come to a talk

00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:27,060
that's called the health of the internet

00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,710
but when I was writing and thinking

00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:31,050
about what I actually really wanted to

00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:34,140
tell you I changed the title to who

00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:37,770
wants to be a rebel and only today I

00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:40,620
found this flyer Mozilla and the Rebel

00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:42,719
Alliance which it's not really actually

00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,250
intended to address this flier but we'll

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,200
see this talk is a little bit of tough

00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,539
love and I hope you can handle it

00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,190
because when I come to festivals like

00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:52,680
this it's actually my first time at Mo's

00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:54,660
fest but I feel really great already the

00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:57,570
same at you know events like write scone

00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:59,010
or the IGF or other places where a lot

00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:00,660
of people that believe in the open

00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:03,629
Internet and the rights of people on it

00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:08,400
come together in such a committed and

00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:10,080
and fun way but the relief that I have

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,810
and the sense of hope that I get at

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:17,610
events like this always come from

00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:19,340
experts policy advocacy people that have

00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:22,049
the best legal arguments to convince

00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:23,460
policymakers to turn something in the

00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:28,560
right direction or come up with fun

00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:30,509
gifts or or campaigns I leave when when

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,799
I leave from these kinds of events with

00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:33,540
a sense of relief that there's a lot of

00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:36,450
people that I agree with and that

00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:38,369
there's a real fight back to the sort of

00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:40,799
closing and shutting down of the

00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:43,380
Internet's at times or the trend of

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:48,659
actually using it as a plantation to

00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:50,220
harvest data and profits alike but

00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:51,450
during the last 10 years that I was in

00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:53,670
the European Parliament

00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:55,920
I saw civil society organizations but

00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:57,990
also others working on digital rights

00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,030
really as my key allies I liked

00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:02,189
consulting them along with with others

00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:03,659
before I made decisions and I was always

00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:05,250
very happy and also a little bit

00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:07,920
relieved when I could count on the

00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:10,979
support of organizations whose goals I

00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,110
hoped to help achieve with the things I

00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:16,260
was doing in the European Parliament

00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:20,370
and so it's from this experience of sort

00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:22,170
of looking at this ecosystem of civil

00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:23,700
society and others in the technical

00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:25,440
community who believe in the open

00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:27,150
Internet and the rights of people on it

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,850
that I actually want to share some more

00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:33,240
concerned thoughts and my thoughts today

00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:36,540
are gonna be about big words about spam

00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:39,600
and about my mother or your mother or

00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:42,000
your neighbor we can see later firstly

00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:44,790
on big words this is really something

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,950
that keeps me up at night because I

00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:49,410
think when we talk about the open

00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:52,410
Internet and digital rights all the big

00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:54,330
words have been used we've seen a Magna

00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:56,460
Carta for the Internet's Bills of Rights

00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:58,740
that are being drafted in many places

00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:01,680
and a number of them have been adopted

00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:04,320
in multi-stakeholder gatherings like

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,720
this one not so much by Parliament's and

00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,130
I think that that's interesting

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,410
there have been social compact

00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:14,370
declarations of independence and there

00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:16,830
are now already more than 120 ethical

00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:19,580
guidelines in Europe alone when it comes

00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:22,290
to dealing with artificial intelligence

00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:24,239
however even though all these big words

00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:26,790
are being used the Internet is still

00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,110
being chopped up its sovereign eyes I

00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:30,540
don't know if that's a word but I hope

00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:32,610
you know what I mean and human rights in

00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:36,660
general but digital rights in particular

00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:39,390
are under enormous pressure we may still

00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:41,870
speak of the open Internet but frankly

00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:44,010
it is more and more with nostalgia and

00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:47,160
surveillance from commercial and

00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:49,920
political control goals is actually

00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:51,420
becoming more and more of a norm so I

00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:56,310
truly think we need to ask ourselves

00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:59,040
what went wrong because while those of

00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:01,410
us who believe in the open society and

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,660
the open Internet alike face the biggest

00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:04,739
challenges all the big words have

00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,780
already been used

00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:09,510
and while these words are anchored in

00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:12,420
concepts of law and democracy they have

00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:14,130
not rendered laws that were adopted in

00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:16,620
Parliament's or regulations for example

00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:18,419
I would even dare to put the challenge

00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:20,640
before and I hope somebody's willing to

00:04:18,419 --> 00:04:24,000
to research it with the challenge before

00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:26,180
you whether more than 1% of CEOs and

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,100
political decision-makers are

00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:30,740
aware of the existence of all these

00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:33,009
beautiful and rights-based declarations

00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:37,310
at all the various Bills of Rights

00:04:33,009 --> 00:04:39,050
social complex for the web etc etc and I

00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:41,509
hate to say that but I think it's not

00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:48,350
good enough that we are in the situation

00:04:41,509 --> 00:04:52,690
where we are so - about spam and maybe

00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:55,940
also big words actually many rebels

00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:59,060
digital rights organizations will Lobby

00:04:55,940 --> 00:05:00,830
or organize campaigns around topics on

00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:03,770
the political agenda they will often

00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:06,590
mobilize thousands hundreds of thousands

00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:09,830
maybe even millions of people and I've

00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:12,289
experienced from the receiving end let's

00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:15,169
say that even though my position was

00:05:12,289 --> 00:05:17,300
well-known for example against the

00:05:15,169 --> 00:05:20,479
copyright directive that was adopted in

00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:22,280
the you before the summer still I would

00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:25,009
be included in the list of politicians

00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:28,370
who were sort of free for all to start

00:05:25,009 --> 00:05:32,599
spamming and targeting with emails spam

00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:35,300
or social media messages and I mean I'm

00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:37,610
not talking about an email with concerns

00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:40,070
but really you know automated every

00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:42,169
couple of seconds sort of flooding the

00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:44,539
inbox which really made it impossible to

00:05:42,169 --> 00:05:47,539
do my work and that was not only for me

00:05:44,539 --> 00:05:49,849
but also for my colleagues and what that

00:05:47,539 --> 00:05:51,919
suggested was really that it didn't

00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:55,639
quite matter what position I took I

00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:59,330
would be showered with advocacy to the

00:05:55,639 --> 00:06:01,280
contrary either way and I think that we

00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:04,130
see more and more that politicians as

00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,990
such sort of in bulk are made the target

00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:08,210
of criticism and sometimes even the EU

00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:10,370
was being blamed for nothing less than

00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:12,259
destroying the Internet we're looking

00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:14,360
here at a slide of an organization that

00:06:12,259 --> 00:06:16,610
I love bits of freedom which says the

00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:19,159
European institutions agree the internet

00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:21,979
must be broken and it's integrally

00:06:19,159 --> 00:06:24,080
copy-pasted by a very populist blog

00:06:21,979 --> 00:06:26,449
called hence tell for the Dutch speakers

00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:29,380
among us which basically says Brussels

00:06:26,449 --> 00:06:32,330
agrees the internet must be broken and

00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:33,770
here you see something similar it's not

00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:37,159
about copyright the EU is trying to

00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:38,870
destroy the internet now not only do I

00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:39,490
think that this rhetoric plays into the

00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:41,500
hands of

00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:43,750
populist waves against the European

00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:46,419
Union while many others place big hope

00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:49,300
in the EU as a super regulator as a

00:06:46,419 --> 00:06:52,000
principal and values-based place that

00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:55,210
can also translate to the Internet but

00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,060
it also gave I would say colleagues were

00:06:55,210 --> 00:07:02,250
not as committed to tech topics an

00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:04,780
impression that basically there is no

00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:07,300
solution that everything is is doomed

00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:10,599
and things can only get worse so it's

00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:14,530
it's I think not really an invitation to

00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:17,560
engage in a conversation it also really

00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:19,539
implies that any regulatory proposal on

00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:21,970
the table is very heavily scrutinized

00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:24,159
while the status quo just you know

00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:26,860
continues without intervention and I

00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:30,240
think status quo also needs equal

00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:33,220
scrutiny as new legislative proposals

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,139
now another observation about how

00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:36,940
sometimes the whole dynamic between

00:07:35,139 --> 00:07:38,289
lawmakers and civil society

00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:40,990
organisations plays out and this is

00:07:38,289 --> 00:07:42,639
broader not just digital rights

00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:44,409
organisations but there's a lot of

00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,930
organisations that have strong ideals

00:07:44,409 --> 00:07:49,449
that will only be satisfied when hundred

00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:51,669
percent of these ideals are reflected in

00:07:49,449 --> 00:07:53,830
final legislative outcomes for example

00:07:51,669 --> 00:07:54,460
but realistically that is never going to

00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:56,979
happen

00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:59,979
in a democratic process there is a need

00:07:56,979 --> 00:08:02,110
to compromise to get anything done and

00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:04,680
this is not my favorite part of

00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:08,889
lawmaking but it is a very normal and

00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:10,750
predictable element of democracy now

00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:12,819
other trends I've seen is basically

00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:15,449
organisations not taking a position even

00:08:12,819 --> 00:08:17,979
though advocacy could have been helpful

00:08:15,449 --> 00:08:19,870
waiting for the negotiated result and

00:08:17,979 --> 00:08:20,949
then using the time that for example in

00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:23,620
the U is going to be used for

00:08:20,949 --> 00:08:25,659
translating to then start lobbying for

00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:28,900
the outcome that was already achieved

00:08:25,659 --> 00:08:30,669
and then victory if it wasn't for us

00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:33,190
this would have never happened although

00:08:30,669 --> 00:08:34,479
I think that can be debated so the

00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:36,370
question is really looking at this

00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,110
landscape and it just put yourselves in

00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:39,820
the shoes of someone who's not at most

00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:43,149
fest you know a politician that you have

00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:44,860
to convince why would an individual

00:08:43,149 --> 00:08:47,740
who's political group for example is

00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:51,260
wholesale being targeted as evil in its

00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:54,560
entirety be invited to meet and so

00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:56,750
and to engage I think that for those

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,480
people there's not really an upside in

00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:01,070
doing so even though and we learn these

00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:03,410
painful lessons over and over again

00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:05,630
sometimes a few votes can really make a

00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:08,180
difference in the copyright directive we

00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:09,890
saw that as well so being able to reach

00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:12,500
people that you don't agree with and

00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:15,640
have a have them open the door to you

00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,640
really matters

00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:20,990
let me see I'm not so good with slides

00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:22,460
oh here was another example of Europe

00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:25,450
delays a plan to destroy the Internet

00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:25,450
okay well I guess that was good

00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:34,880
so my last observation is about my mom

00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:36,680
or my neighbor I think if you want to

00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,890
make sure that there are digital rights

00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:41,180
and that the open Internet has a chance

00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:44,390
the person you want to convince is

00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:51,110
actually my mom and when my mom sees

00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:53,810
this or this or this she will not have

00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:55,540
the impression that those people are

00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:59,000
talking about something that matters to

00:09:55,540 --> 00:10:00,590
her she may think it's a demonstration

00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,800
for something completely different even

00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:06,710
though I would say it would be good if

00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:08,660
she thinks that this is about her my mom

00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:11,480
is not a rebel I believe the majority of

00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:14,000
people do not identify as rebels I don't

00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:16,010
identify as a rebel but I really believe

00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,740
that we need to preserve standards of

00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:21,080
openness digital Rights the open

00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:26,480
Internet if we can the rule of law

00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:29,260
online etc so I know that stickers are

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,400
really cool here for laptops I

00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:33,140
understand but I think that there's

00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:36,230
others who see it as maybe like high

00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:41,120
schoolish or a sign of sort of squatters

00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:43,010
and immaturity maybe even like why would

00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,050
you want to do that I think it's a

00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:47,030
subculture that is not always broadly

00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:48,740
understood and I'm a liberal so I'm

00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:50,270
always very hesitant to say anything

00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:52,280
about appearances and I think anyone

00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:54,500
should feel free and be free to show up

00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:56,210
whichever way they want but it's also

00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:59,270
good to be realistic about what its

00:10:56,210 --> 00:11:00,920
signals and how what you send out could

00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:02,780
be perceived by the audience so it's

00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:04,309
more about trying to understand what

00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:09,470
people may see

00:11:04,309 --> 00:11:12,769
when they see these kinds of images so

00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:15,649
that was kind of the tough now comes the

00:11:12,769 --> 00:11:17,389
love because the only reason why I'm

00:11:15,649 --> 00:11:19,129
actually sharing these observations is

00:11:17,389 --> 00:11:20,600
because I believe a lot more can be

00:11:19,129 --> 00:11:23,839
accomplished and I really really really

00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:25,639
wish for that to happen and for that to

00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:28,579
happen I think a strategic agenda is

00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:29,989
very very important so I encourage you

00:11:28,579 --> 00:11:32,749
all as a very broad and diverse

00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:35,629
community to move from a more niche

00:11:32,749 --> 00:11:37,369
position to a constructive Center

00:11:35,629 --> 00:11:40,179
position and to switch from a more

00:11:37,369 --> 00:11:43,279
declaratory approach to a very strategic

00:11:40,179 --> 00:11:45,529
approach it's not only urgent to have

00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:49,189
more impact but it also is important

00:11:45,529 --> 00:11:51,290
that you that you can still have your

00:11:49,189 --> 00:11:52,879
own position in this debate while more

00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:54,739
and more organizations are moving into

00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:57,410
the space of digital because everything

00:11:54,739 --> 00:12:00,139
becomes digital so to look at how you

00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:02,619
can reach that broader conversation from

00:12:00,139 --> 00:12:06,279
let's say a very specialist very

00:12:02,619 --> 00:12:09,499
specific position in the political and

00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:10,819
public debate it's probably something to

00:12:09,499 --> 00:12:12,410
think about I think there is more and

00:12:10,819 --> 00:12:15,279
more competition coming from that same

00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:19,429
more established NGOs and other

00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:21,290
organizations as well so I think it's

00:12:19,429 --> 00:12:23,559
important to work with other

00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:26,389
organizations of course to do mutually

00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:29,569
beneficial exchanges of knowledge but

00:12:26,389 --> 00:12:32,089
instead of having more declarations or

00:12:29,569 --> 00:12:34,220
every organization wanting to launch its

00:12:32,089 --> 00:12:36,559
own set of principles and declarations

00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:40,129
to work together more to have a

00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:42,049
longer-term strategic approach and I

00:12:40,129 --> 00:12:44,019
hope it can be done without depending on

00:12:42,049 --> 00:12:46,879
money from the very tech companies that

00:12:44,019 --> 00:12:49,549
have to be challenged in a lot of the

00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:51,769
negative effects that we see in the

00:12:49,549 --> 00:12:53,480
whole digital ecosystem that are

00:12:51,769 --> 00:12:55,549
actually responsible I believe for

00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:58,339
significant parts of the harms that we

00:12:55,549 --> 00:13:00,439
are now dealing with but as I mentioned

00:12:58,339 --> 00:13:02,329
before a strategic approach will also

00:13:00,439 --> 00:13:04,970
mean compromise at times and an

00:13:02,329 --> 00:13:08,989
articulation of a landing zone which

00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:10,850
falls outside of the 100% perfect it

00:13:08,989 --> 00:13:14,389
means being more sophisticated than

00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:16,399
attacking the EU or politics but rather

00:13:14,389 --> 00:13:17,580
to work with individuals that you can

00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:21,870
actually see

00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:24,899
or engage to embrace who is doing

00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:26,399
something well and - of course criticize

00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:28,320
what's not going well but I would

00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:31,260
encourage in a way that still allows

00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:33,930
both sides to bridge and find each other

00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:37,230
not to get into trenches that are you

00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:39,779
know important impossible to overcome to

00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:43,560
listen and not to push people too much

00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:45,899
into the defensive I'm also hoping this

00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:48,029
is also a tricky point to make I realize

00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:49,980
but that we will see an end to the Glee

00:13:48,029 --> 00:13:52,709
of how little politicians actually know

00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:54,839
about technology I've seen a lot of

00:13:52,709 --> 00:13:56,490
places and I understand why it can be

00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:59,420
funny sometimes because there are some

00:13:56,490 --> 00:14:01,950
crazy expressions when it comes to

00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:03,240
technology in the internet sometime but

00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:05,010
it is really not something to be happy

00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:07,560
about it is much better to create a

00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:09,420
space that people can come to to

00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:12,899
understand it better where they feel

00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:14,700
safe to ask stupid questions instead of

00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:19,050
sort of feeling like they may be laughed

00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:21,060
at in their faces and I think the

00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:22,440
opposite is also true is that a lot of

00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:24,390
people who are very good at technology

00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:26,760
do not automatically know everything

00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:29,790
about the Democratic and policy process

00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:35,520
so there's mutual learning that I think

00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:38,010
can be very very beneficial so if the

00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:40,290
goal is to get things done to see

00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:43,050
changes and to see results it's

00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:45,390
important to grow the pool of people who

00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:47,190
believe in digital rights open standards

00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:49,079
good governance and tech policies and

00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:50,339
whatnots it's important to make them

00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:51,510
feel at home to make them feel

00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:54,480
comfortable to make them feel welcome

00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:57,000
and to be open to them to work with

00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:59,190
people across various political opinions

00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,170
because more and more we will see

00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:03,510
political fragmentation as we see in

00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:07,020
Europe but in many places all over the

00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:09,240
world and so that really means that new

00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:09,750
more creative coalition's will have to

00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,480
be built

00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:14,850
slimmer majorities will also often mean

00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:17,430
that every vote counts and so in an

00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:20,220
ideal world I would like to see more

00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:21,839
politicians at events like this walking

00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:23,820
in the door and understanding this is a

00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,680
space where I can be where I can

00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:27,959
participate in the debate where I can

00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:31,290
ask the questions that I have and where

00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:34,920
I can find people that that welcomed me

00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:36,420
so if that means and this is a metaphor

00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:38,550
of course but showing up without

00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:42,120
stickers on the laptop in a parliament I

00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:44,550
think it's worth it now I understand why

00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:47,400
people would think are you crazy why

00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:49,230
would you give a talk like this to the

00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:51,750
people who are fighting hardest under

00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:54,240
difficult circumstances for digital

00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:57,210
rights open standards and good tech

00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:59,370
policies especially at a festival that

00:15:57,210 --> 00:16:01,590
brings together many of its leaders that

00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:03,630
actually share the goals that you have I

00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:05,760
totally understand why people think that

00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:08,670
that's crazy and indeed it is more

00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:12,090
comfortable to all agree to drink to

00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:14,940
dance to find friends to hang out and to

00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:17,190
go home feeling hopeful it's easier to

00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:20,100
do that than to critically look at all

00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:22,170
of us and to evaluate where we are today

00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:24,690
despite all the hard work that's been

00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:28,590
done and to reignite a new sense of

00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:30,360
urgency to strategize to reach people

00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:32,160
outside of your own friendship and

00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:34,510
comfort zones because I really believe

00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:37,630
it is needed thank you

00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:37,630
[Applause]

00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:45,830
that was great okay so we're gonna do

00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:52,040
we're gonna do a quick audience Q&A any

00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:54,380
questions oh thanks hi my name is Dolman

00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:57,080
I'm coming from Slovenia I'm one of

00:16:54,380 --> 00:17:01,580
those people who were shouting they're

00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:05,390
destroying out our internet from 2012-13

00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:08,390
when actor Tweety was was on the on the

00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:13,190
chopping board my question to you would

00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:16,510
be this is all great but there is a

00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:19,610
whole industry and bought out

00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:22,250
politicians on the other side saying for

00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:24,709
example in the copyright directive fight

00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:26,720
that you know all activists are paid by

00:17:24,709 --> 00:17:29,270
Google we don't have a we don't have a

00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:31,850
things to say just copying the what what

00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:34,070
Google is saying so how do you fight

00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:36,760
against that this is this is all great

00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:39,710
for let's say if we make a ten year plan

00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:43,460
but in ten years there's going to be at

00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:46,070
least two to three maybe four issues

00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:50,870
like the copyright directive and stuff

00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:53,090
on the on the block and they will use

00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:55,940
the same argument every time while we

00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:58,640
are supposed to be the nice guys who

00:17:55,940 --> 00:18:02,570
play with and share and stuff yeah I

00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:04,700
understand your concern I mean I think a

00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:06,320
couple of observations so I'm gonna be

00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:08,480
the devil's advocate I'm gonna pretend

00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,370
that I you know I'm not interested in

00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,690
this discussion I'm gonna say oh I've

00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:13,600
heard you saying the internet was gonna

00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:16,640
be destroyed in 2012 and guess what

00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:19,310
still here you know people can very much

00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:21,140
dismiss very big concerns if they

00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:22,640
haven't seen it so that's just one it's

00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:23,840
something I've also heard how gosh we've

00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,860
heard this before internet it's not

00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:30,650
going to go away please

00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:34,100
you know the other thing is is to try to

00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:36,230
see who you can reach before the whole

00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:37,790
sort of shouting matches and escalations

00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:39,710
are happening because in the copyright

00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:41,630
directive I had a very strong position

00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:44,390
but I can assure you it was it was not

00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:46,250
pretty on all sides things were said

00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:48,110
back and forth things were done back and

00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:50,990
forth let's say if you divided roughly

00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:52,550
into camps that I think are not really

00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:54,530
where we want to go and

00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:57,770
it also wears out I believe you know if

00:18:54,530 --> 00:19:00,590
you if you get to sort of the strongest

00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:02,570
arguments also on the other side you

00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:04,640
know dismissing criticism as fake news

00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:06,170
as being bought by Google as well I mean

00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,390
everybody seemed to be bought by someone

00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:10,490
in this debate even though that - is is

00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:13,550
not true you know people may just

00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:16,070
disagree even if they're not bought so I

00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:18,230
would say I fully agree there's gonna be

00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:20,180
major files coming up probably the

00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:24,560
e-commerce directive digital services

00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:26,900
other stuff on very important areas for

00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:29,270
everyone try to engage in sort of

00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:31,490
ongoing relations and try to already

00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:32,510
establish relations with new members of

00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:34,520
the Commission new members of the

00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:37,070
European Parliament hopefully before

00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:38,510
things are becoming a shouting match

00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:40,220
where nobody wants to come out of the

00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:42,260
trenches anymore I mean I've spoken to

00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:43,730
colleagues who said I think I may have

00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:46,670
made a mistake on the copyright

00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:50,390
directive but it was so harsh

00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:52,160
I couldn't come back and I'm serious so

00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:53,780
you have to find a landing zone that's

00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,460
not the perfect but where you can still

00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:57,200
bring people that are willing to move if

00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:58,580
a handful of people would have moved on

00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,380
the copyright directive we would not

00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:02,270
have had such a terrible law right now

00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:03,850
so I think there's lessons for everybody

00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:06,260
and that's what I'm trying to show you

00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:08,090
not to say - stop your hard work but

00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:09,890
just just sort of give the perspective

00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:11,600
of how it can be perceived not by people

00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:13,400
that are like-minded but by people that

00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:20,810
you have to convince that's what I was

00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:22,190
trying to do hi I'm sorry I came in a

00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:24,950
little bit later so maybe you've talked

00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:27,170
about this before and in terms of

00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:29,270
destroying the Internet the internet

00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:31,820
will always go on no matter what the

00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:34,250
copyright laws or the freedom in the

00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:36,140
Internet you're able to do the internet

00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:37,910
from the 90s was so much freer than what

00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:39,860
we see today you know the internet

00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:42,830
hasn't you know been killed it's just

00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:45,950
been taken over by monopolies so how can

00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:47,570
you know we tackle this monopolization

00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:50,060
of the Internet because I don't believe

00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:52,640
it could be free while the monopoly is

00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:54,550
taking place yeah so I think that's a

00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:57,740
very important point I think

00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:59,650
privatization of almost everything

00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:02,060
digital especially in the hands of a few

00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:03,740
gatekeepers or you know those that I

00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:06,059
mentioned treat the internet as a

00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:08,700
plantation where they can just harvest

00:21:06,059 --> 00:21:13,440
data and profits in a complete

00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:15,779
asymmetrical power position so questions

00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,909
of antitrust you know is are their

00:21:15,779 --> 00:21:20,159
monopolies questions of how do we value

00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:21,929
not only monetary power of companies but

00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:24,419
also the data that they hold when it

00:21:21,929 --> 00:21:26,190
comes to mergers and acquisitions how do

00:21:24,419 --> 00:21:28,229
we apply the general data protection

00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:30,629
regulation to questions like micro

00:21:28,229 --> 00:21:31,979
targeting and not only for political ads

00:21:30,629 --> 00:21:34,379
but maybe for you know different

00:21:31,979 --> 00:21:35,969
sensitive categories that could be in

00:21:34,379 --> 00:21:39,029
conflict with anti-discrimination

00:21:35,969 --> 00:21:40,919
principles or whatnot so I think that in

00:21:39,029 --> 00:21:45,029
the EU and that's the good news there's

00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:47,879
a lot of anchors hooks points to start a

00:21:45,029 --> 00:21:49,859
conversation and to see what what can be

00:21:47,879 --> 00:21:51,749
done I think the momentum is there but

00:21:49,859 --> 00:21:54,059
at the same time that the momentum and

00:21:51,749 --> 00:21:56,729
the urgency is there the fragmentation

00:21:54,059 --> 00:21:59,249
of politics is greater it will make it

00:21:56,729 --> 00:22:00,509
harder and also just more timely to get

00:21:59,249 --> 00:22:02,549
the decisions because there will be

00:22:00,509 --> 00:22:05,129
people who work who will try to obstruct

00:22:02,549 --> 00:22:06,839
decisions and procedures will be will be

00:22:05,129 --> 00:22:09,739
used or abused no matter you know

00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:14,489
depending on which side you come from to

00:22:09,739 --> 00:22:17,059
obstruct and to delay so urgency is huge

00:22:14,489 --> 00:22:20,249
I would indeed try to look at those

00:22:17,059 --> 00:22:23,820
topics that are opportune for European

00:22:20,249 --> 00:22:25,259
action but I wish it was easier than I

00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:28,349
think it will be I think will be tough

00:22:25,259 --> 00:22:32,299
yeah we have one more question and we

00:22:28,349 --> 00:22:32,299
can do let's do different room yeah

00:22:36,259 --> 00:22:40,259
hello I am Elena from Croatia

00:22:38,669 --> 00:22:42,570
thank you for everything you did for

00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:44,730
European democracy I was sitting in

00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:46,799
Brussels when we had this gathering of

00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:49,679
people having stickers on the laptops

00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:52,230
talking to you and you did amazing copy

00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:54,929
fight thank you very much so I'm

00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:57,990
thinking like about integration and

00:22:54,929 --> 00:23:00,120
onboarding of digital rights activists

00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:01,799
in that particular space because I think

00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:03,870
that what you are observing you saw a

00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:05,580
European perspective but you're also

00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:07,019
having likes a privilege coming from

00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:08,789
Netherlands the first country that

00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:11,039
embraced net neutrality the country

00:23:08,789 --> 00:23:13,649
today has such a amazing digital rights

00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:16,080
scene like pins of freedom yeah I am

00:23:13,649 --> 00:23:18,149
kind of from small country creation and

00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,860
we don't have digital right activists I

00:23:18,149 --> 00:23:21,570
think I was actually the only one and

00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:24,090
it's not a very good because I'm in my

00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:27,750
40s my old digital literacy is quite

00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:30,899
questionable and talking to MPs in

00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:33,269
German sirens yeah I know it's easy for

00:23:30,899 --> 00:23:36,450
us but you know sometimes you find those

00:23:33,269 --> 00:23:38,519
I found like you find your own challenge

00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:40,769
is to integrate in something that you

00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:42,149
believe in because we are coming from

00:23:40,769 --> 00:23:44,190
different backgrounds and different

00:23:42,149 --> 00:23:45,870
cultures and different age but also I

00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:47,460
was observing for the first time in

00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:49,080
copyright I told you there is that

00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:52,919
that's my question possible alliance

00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:54,840
between let s Amis startups and I

00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:57,360
touched it finally we are tapping into

00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:59,100
some resources because we don't have it

00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:01,679
as a digital right scene we barely have

00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:03,750
a scene yeah and like it takes a lot of

00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,159
resources to actually do like what

00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:06,750
you're saying now because we need

00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:09,389
structures we need somebody like you to

00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:11,549
tell us how to lobby what to do but how

00:24:09,389 --> 00:24:13,620
to go about that practically can be

00:24:11,549 --> 00:24:16,049
tapping something that is more already

00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:19,379
existing kind of how to because usually

00:24:16,049 --> 00:24:22,409
who is creating those alliances is it's

00:24:19,379 --> 00:24:24,809
on broader national or EU level so it

00:24:22,409 --> 00:24:27,059
it's supposed to be you kind of creating

00:24:24,809 --> 00:24:30,059
because private entities cannot create

00:24:27,059 --> 00:24:32,669
those alliances so how do we go better

00:24:30,059 --> 00:24:35,700
about like waving the network of

00:24:32,669 --> 00:24:37,559
supports and resources that is required

00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:39,480
to continue on thank you very much

00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:41,070
thank you for that question and I didn't

00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:42,990
want to imply that anything is easy I

00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:44,340
mean I know how hard it is and how you

00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:47,279
know from a position of being the

00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:47,890
underdog I didn't become a lobbyist

00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:50,590
after Paul

00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:53,830
on purpose so I did I don't want to do

00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:55,720
that but I think if I were a civil

00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:57,250
society organization in the digital

00:24:55,720 --> 00:25:00,130
right space or in the open standard

00:24:57,250 --> 00:25:02,110
space I would really mention much more

00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:04,210
that there's too much corporate funding

00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:06,790
going to civil society and knock on the

00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:09,070
doors of more independence foundations

00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:10,720
and where possible incredible

00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:13,809
government's to say look guys this is

00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:16,510
what's happening you know because one of

00:25:13,809 --> 00:25:18,100
the other arguments against those who

00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:19,570
are critical of the copyright directive

00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:23,919
was that they're all being bought by the

00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:27,040
tech companies well it's a mixed picture

00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:28,540
unfortunately actually but I would say

00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:30,640
what you already mentioned that there

00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:34,900
were multiple organizations SMEs it's

00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:36,640
always a hugely solid and big group of

00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:38,169
representatives so if you can be in a

00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:41,470
coalition with others than digital

00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:43,210
rights activists have have a larger

00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:45,370
group of people it's always more

00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:47,290
powerful to speak in any debate on

00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:48,460
behalf of more people that's just how it

00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:50,440
works you were expressing how

00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:53,440
challenging it was to be basically like

00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:55,660
the lone fighter if you have a hundred

00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:58,330
thousand people two hundred thousand you

00:25:55,660 --> 00:26:01,150
know five million companies etc behind

00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:04,240
you it just makes your message louder

00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:06,340
even if you say the same how is to work

00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,600
together on the European level but you

00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:09,549
know it's still tapping into what's

00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:12,010
important nationally but really trying

00:26:09,549 --> 00:26:14,080
to also pool resources there and to

00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:17,049
build coalitions to build coalitions

00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:19,150
it's a permanent effort but I would say

00:26:17,049 --> 00:26:21,520
consumer rights organizations or natural

00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:22,750
allies as well who are also increasing

00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,429
the understanding that everything is

00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:27,669
digital so that there's a lot to be done

00:26:24,429 --> 00:26:30,850
in consumer rights and tech so there's

00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:32,710
not one formula for coalition's but it's

00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:34,809
a process it's also typically Dutch I

00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:37,929
have to say we now have a four party

00:26:34,809 --> 00:26:39,760
coalition but to work together to work

00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:41,890
together and I think it's usually a very

00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:44,500
good thing to do and the more you can

00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:48,160
make that coalition be centrist and

00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:49,510
representing many the more powerful I

00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,860
think the message will be towards the

00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:52,630
people who have to make a decision it's

00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:54,460
harder to simply say it doesn't matter

00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:58,750
if you speak on behalf of such a big

00:26:54,460 --> 00:27:00,470
group all right applause for potaka

00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:03,700
thank you so much

00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:03,700
