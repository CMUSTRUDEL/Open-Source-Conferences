hey Twitter thanks for joining us today

00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:05,400
I'm Xavier Harding and I'm a writer here

00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,040
on the constant team in Mozilla

00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:10,230
this is now the second time I've worn a

00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:11,219
shirt that I would wear outside I'm not

00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:12,660
happy about that

00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:15,480
but we have a great session plan for you

00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:18,390
today Before we jump in some quick

00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,830
background a lot of us a full time home

00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:21,779
right now would that be working from

00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:24,449
home researching some home networking

00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:27,300
from home even hanging out with friends

00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:28,859
separately virtually from home so with

00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,650
that in mind many of the events that

00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:33,899
Mozilla's internet looks forward to each

00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:36,750
and every year are either being canceled

00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:38,820
or postponed so that's why Muslims

00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,110
taking its Maz fest events and speaker

00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,750
series dialogues debates

00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:44,579
virtual it's a chance for us to continue

00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:47,640
the important conversations about online

00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:51,059
privacy trustworthy AI big tech etc etc

00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,800
etc so today's dialogues and debates

00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:53,460
very special dial as the base for you

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,530
today

00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:58,230
it's called trustworthy technology and

00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:00,180
the time about pandemic and features a

00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:01,289
london-based Mozilla fellow Frederico

00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:04,049
call thinner

00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:05,909
Frederika works on trust for the AI and

00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:08,130
how it can be biased before mozilla

00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:10,619
federico was a director at privacy

00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:13,080
international in london has given expert

00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:16,110
advice to European Parliament Belgian

00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,549
Parliament and much more so today we're

00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:20,580
hoping to talk about the ways

00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:22,860
coronavirus has unexpectedly cross paths

00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:25,680
with Internet and with the internet and

00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:27,509
technology some things that people are

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,780
wondering how do I have to trade my

00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:32,700
privacy to protect my health our social

00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,579
media sites profiting from fake news

00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:38,100
about Perona virus how secure are video

00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:40,229
chat apps that we use to do work and

00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:42,210
hang out with friends so folks watching

00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:44,100
at home could do so live as you're

00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:46,409
probably doing right now you can tweet

00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:49,200
at us using the hashtag trustworthy

00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:51,329
technology we put the hashtag sign in

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,610
front of it so let's get started with

00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:58,380
our first question are you ready very

00:01:53,610 --> 00:02:00,930
good I'm ready okay cool so have any

00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:03,530
countries emerged as kind of leaders in

00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:05,939
protecting both public health and

00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:08,310
privacy and if so are there any

00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:11,009
countries who are exhibiting truly

00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:11,970
terrible bad privacy practices as their

00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:13,870
response that's been definitely

00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:16,040
absolutely awful

00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:18,770
what I like about this question is that

00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:20,810
it dives right into the question should

00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:23,450
we balance privacy how should we balance

00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:25,190
public health and privacy and before we

00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:27,320
deconstruct this I just want to say that

00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:29,540
I think it goes without saying that sort

00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:31,730
of anyone was lost the job is worried

00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:34,790
about the health of lost ones or finding

00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:38,330
it incredibly hard to be in isolation we

00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:40,730
all want this to be over and as soon as

00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:43,370
possible so I think the moment we start

00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:45,860
framing this entire debate as privacy

00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:48,020
versus public health it's clear who the

00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:50,120
winner is we all want Public Health to

00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:52,370
win at this point in time so the

00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,959
question is not which one wins but the

00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:56,300
question is is that the right question

00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:59,540
to be asking in the first place and I

00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:01,730
think the answer is mostly no it is not

00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:03,560
true that there's an inevitable

00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:05,270
trade-off between privacy on the one

00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,700
hand and public health on the others

00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:09,739
just simply not true and a good example

00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:12,230
for something they'll probably that will

00:03:09,739 --> 00:03:14,390
probably come up later again is the case

00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:16,340
of contact tracing ABS the question is

00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:17,690
not should we what's the trade-off but

00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:20,150
there are many different ways of

00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:22,580
building these app so I think the real

00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:25,100
question is what role of any show

00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:27,320
technology play in hiding the virus what

00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:31,070
is actually evidence-based and effective

00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:33,200
and how can we may how can we use

00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:35,720
technology in a way that's responsible

00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,180
and trustworthy something that I also

00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:40,160
think is important when we talk about

00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:43,610
responsible or trustworthy AI sorry

00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:45,799
technology in general privacy plays

00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:48,650
definitely plays a part it's sort of a

00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:50,110
necessary ingredient but it's not alone

00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:52,910
sufficient to make technology

00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:54,950
responsible so we need to talk about a

00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:59,030
lot more rights than just privacy in

00:03:54,950 --> 00:04:00,890
this crisis and finally sort of this

00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:02,120
district I see Brooks versus Public

00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:05,570
Health has really been annoying me

00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:07,790
because it also assumes that privacy is

00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:10,940
something that's completely absolute so

00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:12,440
you either have privacy or you don't but

00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:13,940
what's interesting is that even

00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:16,790
international human rights law

00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:19,760
recognizes that in an emergency like

00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:23,599
public health crisis some rights can be

00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:25,760
restricted but the question is this is

00:04:23,599 --> 00:04:26,930
only possible under a long list of

00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,729
conditions and

00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:31,520
just want to throw some in one condition

00:04:28,729 --> 00:04:34,699
is this has to be strictly necessary

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,560
this has to be lawful it can't be sort

00:04:34,699 --> 00:04:38,720
of like it has to be of limited duration

00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,330
and it has to be respectful of human

00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,490
dignity etc etc so I think I would

00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:45,949
really love to shift the debate more

00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:47,870
towards whatever rights were currently

00:04:45,949 --> 00:04:50,509
restricting and we're restricting much

00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:52,220
more than just privacy how are these

00:04:50,509 --> 00:04:54,800
restrictions justified what's the

00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:57,919
oversight what's the limit and how can

00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,759
we just use technology responsibly yeah

00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,580
that's a very good question

00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:01,759
this next question it's kind of

00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:03,349
us-centric

00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,599
but it could be broadened out one of the

00:05:03,349 --> 00:05:06,889
consequences of September 11th back in

00:05:05,599 --> 00:05:09,680
the day was the creation of a mass

00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:11,720
surveillance network unlike any other

00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,380
we've seen before how likely is it that

00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:17,090
coronavirus could do something similar I

00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:19,160
can't predict the future I can only say

00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:21,110
that I would not want this to happen but

00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:23,840
I think I've heard this come up several

00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:26,240
times what are the parallels and there

00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:30,410
are two caveats I think we need to throw

00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:32,690
in the first one is yes 911 has really

00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:34,130
led to mass surveillance but it also led

00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:36,710
to something very different which is

00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:39,590
targeted surveillance of certain kinds

00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:41,000
of communities particularly Muslims so

00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,599
it's not just mass surveillance that's

00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,580
the problem

00:05:41,599 --> 00:05:47,030
so is discrimination of certain groups

00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:48,889
option in society when we talk about

00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:51,710
this parallel something that keeps

00:05:48,889 --> 00:05:53,780
irritating me is sort of the use of war

00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:56,840
language and metaphors because a

00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:58,490
condemning is not the same as a war or

00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:01,130
even as a terrorist incidents it's

00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:02,960
something completely different and the

00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:04,729
German president in a speech he said he

00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,580
put this very eloquently when he said

00:06:04,729 --> 00:06:10,220
and I'm paraphrasing sort of but he said

00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:11,690
this is not a war there are no nations

00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:14,030
fighting against each others there are

00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:16,699
no soldiers this is where the crisis of

00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:19,909
humanity so the lesson we should draw

00:06:16,699 --> 00:06:21,530
from this I hope is not sort of savannas

00:06:19,909 --> 00:06:23,870
surveillance is not going to fix this

00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:25,699
but when we look around and see sort of

00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:28,490
the countries that are dealing with this

00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:30,620
better than others they allow people who

00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:32,870
are sick to to stay home when they're

00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:34,460
sick they give people access to health

00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:36,380
care so this is about something entirely

00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:38,719
different it's really more about sort of

00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:40,790
social justice and inequality and I

00:06:38,719 --> 00:06:42,530
really hope that we take the

00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:44,270
away from this crisis and not more

00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:46,880
surveillance because it just really

00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:49,220
missed the point yeah none that same

00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,270
note you know you know I'll use my I'll

00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:52,400
use a face mask sometimes when I'm

00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:55,280
outside and my my phone's face ID

00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:58,640
doesn't work when we start to think

00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:00,020
about people wearing masks in public for

00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:02,690
kind of the rest of the year maybe even

00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:05,960
the foreseeable future does this mean

00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:07,460
that facial facial recognition tech is

00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:09,140
now a lot less accurate just in general

00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:11,840
or kind of in other words our mask

00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:13,850
protecting both our privacy and our

00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:18,080
immune systems at the same time like

00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:19,430
could you talk about that yeah I think a

00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,740
lot of people are making the experience

00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:23,900
that make ugly condom look their phones

00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:25,940
anymore and we hope is obviously that

00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:27,650
does that also mean that case

00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:29,540
recognition won't recognize me in public

00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:31,550
but these are different kinds of

00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:34,240
application of face recognition so they

00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:34,240
work slightly differently

00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:38,690
the idea of masks and people covering

00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:41,150
their face that's not a new research

00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:44,240
topic for biometrics researchers and AI

00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:46,190
researchers because also in a lot of

00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,440
sensitive context like protests people

00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:51,170
wear masks they cover their faces and

00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:53,990
there's already been a paper in 2017

00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:58,190
that showed people who partially covered

00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:59,600
their face can be recognized at a at an

00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:01,850
accuracy that's higher than chance

00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:04,220
basically so I think there were a couple

00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:07,010
of companies a Chinese company that now

00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:08,840
camp came out and said yes we find you

00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:10,760
there are systems we are able to

00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:12,650
recognize people even if they're

00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:16,400
covering their face so the answer is

00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:21,020
unfortunately a face Mac is not going to

00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:25,010
give you more privacy in public without

00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:27,470
their face like how is that happening so

00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:29,840
what's interesting is the face is just

00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:31,130
one way in which were unique sort of in

00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,260
the initial paper they were sort of

00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:35,599
modeling how people would look like with

00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:37,940
their mouths covered but also the

00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,950
industry is actually moving away or

00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:42,050
expanding from faces and using things

00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:44,090
like gait recognition or vein

00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:46,250
recognition so there are a lot of things

00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:48,470
about us that make us unique that allows

00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:50,120
cameras to recognize us so the face is

00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:52,670
just one but I think the bigger lesson

00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:54,680
is I don't think hiding from

00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:56,660
surveillance tank that this can

00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:58,339
always be a strategy and a mix of tools

00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:00,290
but it's never going to be the solution

00:08:58,339 --> 00:09:02,510
the solution is comfy and I'm obviously

00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:04,160
biased because I work in policy but I

00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:06,260
think for me the solution is always we

00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,210
need to have better laws that protect us

00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:11,240
it can't be our full-time job to hide

00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:13,880
from whatever tech or surveillance

00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:16,180
industry has come up next it's a better

00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:21,529
laws but in the meantime hide your veins

00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:23,300
because they will find you the next

00:09:21,529 --> 00:09:25,279
question is that it's not a little bit

00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,750
more of a basic question and we actually

00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,970
the panel about this last week that you

00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:32,110
were also on I also hosted what is

00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:34,880
contact tracing in technological terms

00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:39,740
and that one's from vs cath on Twitter

00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:41,959
all right um before I answer this I want

00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:44,060
to go back and say Tech has been talking

00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:45,680
about contact tracing to the extent that

00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:48,620
I'm a little almost a little tired of

00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,899
the debate but the contact tracing

00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:53,870
actually comes from epidemiology and if

00:09:50,899 --> 00:09:55,450
you look at the whe OHS core strategy

00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:58,370
and fighting this pandemic it's

00:09:55,450 --> 00:10:01,310
isolating cases it's testing people and

00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:03,350
it is tracing their context and the

00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:05,720
entire reason is you want to break the

00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:08,240
the transmission chains between people

00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,589
and traditionally contact tracing has

00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,230
been done or is still being done

00:10:09,589 --> 00:10:13,820
everywhere by health authorities so when

00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:15,170
you test positives they try to figure

00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:17,270
out where it's been people you've been

00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:19,040
in touch with and we've all read these

00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:21,170
early stories at the beginning of the

00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,300
pandemic where we rest the person who

00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:25,970
traveled there and there the problem of

00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:28,190
this is that obviously the more cases

00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:29,959
you have the more difficult even if you

00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:32,089
hire as thousands or tens of thousands

00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:34,220
of people this because it's incredibly

00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:37,040
labor-intensive and it becomes a little

00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:40,970
difficult and this is where technology

00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:42,770
comes in but whatever system and sort of

00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:44,329
to answer the question there are

00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:45,970
different technologies that are

00:10:44,329 --> 00:10:48,620
currently being discussed as solutions

00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:50,180
but before we even talk about this I

00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:53,300
think it's important to recognize that

00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:55,220
any sort of tech that does the contact

00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:57,680
trace and tracing has inherent

00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:59,750
limitations so any kind of contact

00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:02,540
tracing app no matter how it's built or

00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:05,630
made always has a limitation that not

00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:07,160
everybody has a phone not everybody uses

00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:08,360
a phone that they don't share with other

00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:10,010
people

00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,750
and not everybody sort of takes their

00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:13,670
phone with them and alter at all times

00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:15,589
and then they're also the question of

00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:17,290
how accurate is the contact tracing so

00:11:15,589 --> 00:11:21,260
there's like there is a margin of error

00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:23,240
and it's also important to say that this

00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:25,610
is something that's inherently risky

00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:27,410
this is incredibly invasive so if there

00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:29,959
wasn't a pandemic at the moment we would

00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:31,550
never accept an app that would track us

00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:33,980
and trace everywhere we've done it

00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:34,880
everywhere everyone we've met so this is

00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:38,990
very risky

00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:40,550
so if epidemiologist and it's up to them

00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:42,620
to decide whether this is actually

00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:46,760
useful and they keep saying well it is

00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:48,560
actually useful um then the question is

00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:52,579
how can we deploy this in a way that

00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:54,320
it's most responsible that is that is

00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:56,570
sort of like trustworthy in a way that

00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,190
we can actually trust this app because I

00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:59,480
think that the core principle always has

00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:02,510
to be that such an app has to be

00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:04,279
voluntary so it's up to the designers of

00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:08,480
the app to design something that is

00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:11,029
worthy of our trust yeah you make such a

00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,920
good point like the idea that if you

00:12:11,029 --> 00:12:15,680
don't have a smartphone you don't get to

00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:17,750
have health like the assumption that

00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,730
everyone just has a smartphone like you

00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:21,380
to be able to be part of this global

00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:23,959
experiment contact tracing you have to

00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:26,930
be able to afford this 400 or $500 600

00:12:23,959 --> 00:12:28,579
or more device I think and it goes even

00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:30,740
further not all phones have the

00:12:28,579 --> 00:12:33,230
technical capability to do the kind of

00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:35,240
tracing we're talking about but also

00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:37,399
sort of if you as a country if they're

00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:40,310
not enough tests then there's no way for

00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:42,680
me to notify people that I'm sick and if

00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:44,480
I can't isolate because I don't you know

00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:47,690
I don't have physical space to actually

00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:49,910
isolate myself then sort of I can get

00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:51,800
the notification that I might be sick

00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:53,630
but I can't really draw any consequences

00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:56,930
from this so there's so many assumptions

00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:59,029
build around that sort of whatever role

00:12:56,930 --> 00:13:01,610
this place it will only ever supplement

00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:04,339
all the other strategies so this is not

00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:06,320
going to be the Silver Bullet and at the

00:13:04,339 --> 00:13:07,550
same time it's so invasive and so risky

00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,920
that we do need to have a conversation

00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:12,050
about how should such an app look like

00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,360
and what's the most sort of the the

00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:17,630
lowest risk most responsible way of

00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:19,699
deploying it yeah yeah the assumptions

00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:22,170
part is always kind of like the Achilles

00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:24,330
heel attack so on the top of your car

00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:26,400
tracing we have question from Creative

00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:29,400
Commons on Twitter which is you know a

00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:30,000
three-parter so get ready what data will

00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:33,060
be collected

00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,680
how will it be shared and who owns the

00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:37,050
data is that something we know what can

00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:38,730
you tell us about that there are lots of

00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:42,690
there lots of varieties of this that are

00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:44,540
being discussed on the part of the

00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:46,590
question was who owns the data I think

00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:48,540
data ownership was something that's

00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:51,060
being discussed as a solution to give us

00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:52,620
more control of a data and I personally

00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:56,340
don't think that's the right solution

00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:58,230
not just in this context so whatever

00:13:56,340 --> 00:14:00,300
solution we think about what you need is

00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:02,400
you need both technical safeguards and

00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:04,110
you need legal safeguards and the

00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,880
technical safeguards are such an ab

00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:07,950
processes health data which is a

00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:09,690
technical way of saying it just holds

00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:12,000
data that reveal a lot about your health

00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:16,290
such as whether you tested positive for

00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,120
the corona virus so such an app needs to

00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:19,590
be extremely secure it can't have

00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,600
anything like advertising trackers

00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:23,880
that's not even a should not even be on

00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,950
the table it should collect as little

00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:28,650
data as possible it should use

00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:31,590
pseudonymous data so ids not a real name

00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:33,960
and something that has been discussed a

00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:35,760
lot is there is a centralized version of

00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:38,280
this and a decentralized version and

00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:40,920
there are a lot of arguments in favor of

00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:42,840
the decentralized version so it's a it's

00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:44,580
a bit technical but to summarize you say

00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:46,710
centralized and decentralized what does

00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:49,010
that mean exactly in case somebody

00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:51,570
doesn't know sure so the question is

00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:54,330
we've seen some very distinct versions

00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:56,400
of this app I don't really want to go

00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:58,260
into detail but for examples sort of

00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,940
like and very early in the debate there

00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:03,210
were discussions about an app that uses

00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:06,030
GPS and collects your entire movement

00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:07,740
history and hence everybody you've

00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:09,240
interacted with and shares this with a

00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,920
centralized server and you don't even

00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,720
know how secure this is so I think this

00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,130
is extremely dangerous and the

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,980
discussion has moved away from this

00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:18,480
what's currently being discussed is sort

00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:21,360
of contact tracing using Bluetooth

00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:24,000
technology and the advantage of this is

00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:26,130
you don't collect data about your

00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,260
movements you only collect data about

00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:30,750
your interactions with people who also

00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:32,460
have the app so now the difference

00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:34,320
between the decentralized and I'm really

00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:35,459
really summarizing here and the

00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,199
centralized version is

00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:40,350
should this data be processed and stored

00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:43,110
so in the decentralized model it all

00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:46,019
stays on your phone we have the changing

00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:48,480
ID that changes contact key and whenever

00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:51,720
you meet someone you exchange the ID so

00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:53,850
my phone knows who I have met when I

00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:56,610
then find out and I get tested that I am

00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:58,889
sick I can notify people who I have been

00:15:56,610 --> 00:16:01,769
in touch with but they won't know who it

00:15:58,889 --> 00:16:03,389
was and where it was and when it was so

00:16:01,769 --> 00:16:05,040
the decent man centralized question is

00:16:03,389 --> 00:16:07,619
should this data also be shared

00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,240
centrally and should there be a way for

00:16:07,619 --> 00:16:12,240
let's say house of sort or authorities

00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:14,519
to find out who somebody was in touch

00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,379
with or not and the decentralized

00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:18,990
version doesn't do that because it only

00:16:16,379 --> 00:16:20,579
stays on your phone and the advantages

00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:23,399
of this was more that the potential for

00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:24,509
misuse are significantly lower because

00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:27,089
whenever you have such data on a

00:16:24,509 --> 00:16:29,309
centralized server the question is you

00:16:27,089 --> 00:16:30,720
know what is gonna happen to this day

00:16:29,309 --> 00:16:32,790
now how long is it going to be stored

00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,920
etc so I left out many many of the

00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:36,720
details yeah okay somebody on Twitter

00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:39,509
gets angry with me so this is like the

00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,399
broad but I also think it's the

00:16:39,509 --> 00:16:43,559
technical safeguards and I also think

00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:45,209
Curtis Ian securities is crucial in this

00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:49,139
debate but there are so many other

00:16:45,209 --> 00:16:50,939
dimensions to this and something that

00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:52,679
I'm worried about is I think this app

00:16:50,939 --> 00:16:56,040
should be something like this has to be

00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:57,959
voluntary it has to be time limited but

00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:00,329
we also need things like oversight and

00:16:57,959 --> 00:17:02,519
we also don't want police stopping

00:17:00,329 --> 00:17:04,620
people and asking them do you have this

00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:07,230
app so nobody should get should be

00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:09,209
punished for not having a phone for not

00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:11,100
having that phone charged for not using

00:17:09,209 --> 00:17:12,870
the app etc but those are legal

00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:15,449
questions they're not technical

00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:18,000
questions so a responsible contact

00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:19,740
tracing app which is only ever going to

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,990
be one piece of the puzzle of things

00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:24,209
that need to happen a responsible app

00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:25,919
needs to have very strong the strongest

00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:28,409
possible technical safeguards but it

00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,490
also needs legal protections yeah you

00:17:28,409 --> 00:17:30,690
guys insist a little bit and we're

00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:33,120
actually to move on from contact tracing

00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:34,649
soon but I want to get into question

00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,000
from Paul milk on Twitter this whole

00:17:34,649 --> 00:17:39,090
milk got a question in the last panel

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,799
shout to whole milk so the last question

00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:42,360
you mentioned centralized model like do

00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:44,610
you think that data that they collected

00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,960
contact tracing could ever be used for

00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:47,309
marketing purposes and I think your

00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:49,340
answer is kind of like if a centralized

00:17:47,309 --> 00:17:52,340
like who knows what they could like

00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:54,110
use that therefore I think the it's

00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:55,970
important to you might trust your

00:17:54,110 --> 00:18:00,170
government where you currently live or

00:17:55,970 --> 00:18:02,390
you don't but I think the whatever app

00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:04,190
you use it has to be interoperable which

00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:05,900
means that if you travel abroad it's

00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:08,090
sort of if we want to loosen

00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:10,700
restrictions it has to work like the

00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:12,380
virus doesn't no borders basically so

00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:13,370
the question is really it doesn't really

00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:15,140
matter whether you trust your

00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:16,610
governments there are we know that there

00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:20,510
are governments that are not really

00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:22,700
trustworthy so sort of like a

00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:24,170
trustworthy technology means we don't

00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:26,120
want to blindly trust something that

00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:28,730
sort of it is built in a way that that

00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:30,920
the risk is as minimized as possible on

00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:33,800
the marketing question someone has them

00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:37,580
an amazing job I'll tweet out the name

00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:39,620
so a French sort of a French group has

00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:41,060
done an amazing job of testing all the

00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:42,740
existing Corona apps that are out there

00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:45,200
and it was quite shocking to see that

00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:47,120
many of the early apps included

00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,820
advertising trackers which i think is

00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:52,340
completely unacceptable so there was a

00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:54,080
symptom checker which shared sort of all

00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:56,540
the symptoms you put into the app we

00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:58,940
share this data with advertisers that's

00:18:56,540 --> 00:19:00,500
obviously unacceptable especially in

00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:03,170
countries that lack laws to protect

00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:04,850
people's data and if this data ends up

00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:06,410
with insurance companies or employers

00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:08,120
like this is sort of that's a really a

00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:10,520
nightmare that that should happen so

00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:13,360
absolutely no this is like this is not

00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:15,860
the you know that's just not the time

00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,900
that it's not appropriate you're

00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:19,550
probably tired of talking about contact

00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:21,110
tracing between last week's panel and

00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:23,330
this question right now so we can move

00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:26,090
on from this question from Jacob

00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:27,530
climbing on Twitter is about a little

00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:28,970
bit more broad in general but you know

00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:31,460
back in the day I would never using a

00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:33,800
webcam I kept the block all the time for

00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:36,650
security reasons now I use my webcam

00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:38,660
every day for all kinds of work and

00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:39,950
friend calls but I still sometimes cover

00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:42,410
it up in between meetings at the end of

00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:44,000
the day is that a legitimate concern or

00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:46,370
is that just paranoia what do you think

00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,660
about that before it ends on that

00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:49,520
question I just want to correct what I

00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:53,360
said about contact tracing because I

00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:55,220
think sort of the risk for abuse is like

00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,690
this is incredibly risky so it's very

00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:58,790
very important that we're having this

00:19:56,690 --> 00:20:00,740
discussion and it's disheartening to see

00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:02,530
that some governments I'm not opting for

00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:04,510
the decentralized version

00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:06,250
but they are opting for them way more

00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:08,650
previously an amazing first version

00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:10,450
that's really really concerning when I

00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:12,520
say I'm a bit tired of it like the more

00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:15,310
we talk about it the more it sounds like

00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:16,960
this is the solution when everybody says

00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:18,730
it's only ever going to be a part of the

00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,500
solution so I'm a little bit torn and I

00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:22,960
want to talk about that this has to be

00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:25,060
done the right way it has to be

00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,610
trustworthy but at the same time we also

00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:28,570
really really shouldn't over hide this

00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:30,520
especially as someone who's not even in

00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:33,070
effort like I'm not an epidemiologist

00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:34,960
that this is not my expertise but on the

00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:38,140
other question so someone asked about

00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:41,470
covering your webcam covering the webcam

00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:43,630
so reason why lots of digital rights

00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:46,600
organizations recommend to you to cover

00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:48,610
your webcam is that your your webcam can

00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:50,560
be hacked so you can't even usually when

00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:52,960
you turn your webcam on and light pops

00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:54,910
up and you know that it's on but it can

00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,800
be hacked in a way that you don't even

00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:59,070
notice so that's the reason why the

00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:02,110
recommendation is always to cover your

00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:04,420
have your camera but of course it really

00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:05,980
depends on your individual circumstances

00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:08,830
so there were images of Mark Zuckerberg

00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:10,690
covering this camera the former FBI

00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:12,460
director James Comey said that he

00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:14,800
congress's camera but these are high

00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:17,830
risk individuals and they really they

00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:19,750
are a target so the recommendation is to

00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:22,450
do it but it obviously depends on your

00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:23,980
circumstances whether you think that's

00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:26,680
right for you but I would always say

00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:29,170
they're very useful sliders where you

00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:30,610
can just slide it on and off so when you

00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:32,980
need your camera you just slide it open

00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:34,360
and otherwise you turn it off are you

00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:36,280
trying to say that Jacob climbing is not

00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:40,300
a high risk individual maybe he's like

00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:42,910
this famous person I'm saying that I

00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:44,140
don't know it's sort of with all

00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:47,200
security questions it's very

00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:50,530
context-specific so say he's to judge

00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:53,500
what his situation is that's true so at

00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:55,690
Short or data mocap on Twitter hopefully

00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:57,820
I didn't screw up that pronunciation how

00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:59,800
exposed is our privacy during lockdown

00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:06,720
what consequences will the COBIT

00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:10,510
emergency have on our daily lives I

00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:13,150
think again I think I think privacy is

00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:13,840
one of the many many things we need to

00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:15,779
be worried about

00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,399
so doing the

00:22:15,779 --> 00:22:19,320
condemning a lot of very important

00:22:17,399 --> 00:22:21,690
rights have currently been restricted so

00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:23,309
think about the right to protest there

00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:25,529
were protests movements around the world

00:22:23,309 --> 00:22:27,869
that have currently come to a pause and

00:22:25,529 --> 00:22:30,149
obviously rightfully so because it would

00:22:27,869 --> 00:22:32,399
be very dangerous to have masses of

00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:34,019
people outside protesting but it's

00:22:32,399 --> 00:22:35,729
important to remember that the right to

00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:40,469
protest is a really really important

00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:42,779
right so I think see as with all rights

00:22:40,469 --> 00:22:45,899
not just privacy the question is we

00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:47,809
really need to monitor we really need to

00:22:45,899 --> 00:22:50,099
unmonitored our governments are

00:22:47,809 --> 00:22:51,899
restricting rights currently and it

00:22:50,099 --> 00:22:53,789
needs to be all of these restrictions

00:22:51,899 --> 00:22:55,289
need to be necessary there needs to be

00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:58,080
oversight and they need to be time

00:22:55,289 --> 00:23:00,599
limited and the reason is autocrats

00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:02,549
love emergencies because in emergencies

00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:04,919
the normal rules don't apply so the

00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:06,599
normal rules where you have a free press

00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:08,460
but you have protests this is very

00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:11,249
convenient also that all of these things

00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:13,109
are currently well free press yes but

00:23:11,249 --> 00:23:16,229
sort of that protests and things like

00:23:13,109 --> 00:23:18,749
this are currently not possible so I am

00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:21,149
I am quite worried I am little worried

00:23:18,749 --> 00:23:23,700
about this and I think that's why I

00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:26,219
think the emphasis on privacy is yes I

00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:27,869
care about privacy but there are so many

00:23:26,219 --> 00:23:30,779
other things I also care about and all

00:23:27,869 --> 00:23:32,609
of them need our sort of like collective

00:23:30,779 --> 00:23:35,820
we really need to watch out for these

00:23:32,609 --> 00:23:37,619
things and see how they are being where

00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:41,820
their restrictions are really necessary

00:23:37,619 --> 00:23:44,549
and proportionate you raise a good point

00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:46,830
about how you know for certain folks a

00:23:44,549 --> 00:23:48,509
pandemic is like a prime opportunity to

00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:49,799
strike because one thing to keep in mind

00:23:48,509 --> 00:23:52,259
is like you know some of the stuff might

00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:56,789
stick around after the pandemic is

00:23:52,259 --> 00:24:00,080
finished I think I am what happened in

00:23:56,789 --> 00:24:02,399
Hungary I think is concerning like

00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:05,339
there's no justification for an

00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:07,200
unlimited suspension of Parliament and

00:24:05,339 --> 00:24:08,729
in extension of power that sort of like

00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,769
that's really really disproportionate

00:24:08,729 --> 00:24:11,429
and something else to talk to someone in

00:24:10,769 --> 00:24:13,289
them

00:24:11,429 --> 00:24:16,289
I mean governments I found different

00:24:13,289 --> 00:24:18,809
ways someone in Dubai told me that in

00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:21,210
order to leave the house the government

00:24:18,809 --> 00:24:23,070
closed automatic license plate reading

00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:26,029
so in order to go to the supermarket you

00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:28,589
need a request to be allowed to pass and

00:24:26,029 --> 00:24:29,220
and when I listen to this I thought yes

00:24:28,589 --> 00:24:31,830
obvious

00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:34,169
in a pandemic I see why they are doing

00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:36,059
this and then you can automatically

00:24:34,169 --> 00:24:37,500
exclude like trucks and essential

00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:39,390
workers they automatically have the

00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:41,159
right to pass but my thought was

00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:43,799
immediately well that's also very

00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:46,260
convenient in a very different

00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:47,760
circumstance like protests so yes I

00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:50,340
think there are especially when it comes

00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:53,070
to text so a lot of things that appear

00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:54,870
to be very useful at the moment thermal

00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:57,030
cameras that recognize that measure

00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:58,740
people's temperature once they're

00:24:57,030 --> 00:25:01,230
installed they're there and then they

00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:03,750
can be abused by other purposes that's

00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:05,220
true we have a question from at gemenon

00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:08,549
Matt on Twitter shut up Matt Mitchell

00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:09,960
and it's more of a not quite only route

00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:12,000
coronavirus it's kind of more in general

00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:14,070
should we be concerned about AI systems

00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,200
that classify judge and evaluate

00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:19,850
people's identities feelings emotions

00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:22,650
how advanced is technology in 2020 I

00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:23,929
like this question because because this

00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:26,309
is sort of like that was my original

00:25:23,929 --> 00:25:28,020
Mozilla project and the reason I picked

00:25:26,309 --> 00:25:31,169
this is that what I find fascinating

00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:34,320
about this is that it really opens our

00:25:31,169 --> 00:25:37,140
eyes to the dual challenge of automated

00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:38,970
data processing so when these kinds of

00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:40,679
predictions are accurate they're

00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:42,720
incredibly invasive so there are

00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:45,000
predictive systems that classify my

00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:47,340
sexual orientation my gender my

00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,860
interests but at the same time those are

00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:51,840
only ever there are only predictions so

00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:54,150
when they're wrong they're that comes

00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:56,159
with its own challenges and I used to

00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:57,960
say it's a well un it's accurate and

00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:00,179
it's Kafkaesque which when it isn't

00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:01,950
which means that these systems can

00:26:00,179 --> 00:26:03,059
classify you as something that you don't

00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:05,220
even know that it's happening

00:26:03,059 --> 00:26:07,200
you don't necessarily agree with it but

00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:09,299
it still has consequences and it's

00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,770
largely invisible and that's why I think

00:26:09,299 --> 00:26:12,690
this is really interesting and what I'm

00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:16,500
looking at in my research at the moment

00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:19,289
is there are many so-called alternative

00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:21,330
credit scoring companies that are

00:26:19,289 --> 00:26:23,039
targeted for people who don't have a

00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:26,490
bank account so they don't have enough

00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:28,679
data to make use of traditional credit

00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:30,720
scoring so where these companies do is

00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:33,299
they analyze all of their data that

00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,799
phone metrics who they call but also

00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:36,960
sometimes make use of things like

00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:39,090
personality prediction so predicting

00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:41,880
people's personality to decide if

00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:43,090
someone gets a loan and if this works

00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:45,340
it's sort of like

00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:46,570
it means that if you think about it it

00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:50,770
means that people with a certain

00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:52,210
personality can't qualify for a loan but

00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:53,860
if it doesn't work it also means that

00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:55,090
this system just constant ID or

00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:58,780
something and you don't even know what

00:26:55,090 --> 00:27:00,790
happens so I think in general a lot of

00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:03,730
the AI discussions were about bias and

00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:05,260
discrimination but I really would love

00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:08,590
to shift the debate a little bit towards

00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:11,170
what can I do and what can I I not do

00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:13,360
and predicting your identity is

00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:14,800
something there's an inherent limit

00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:17,920
because you're the ultimate authority

00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:20,800
over your identity it doesn't matter

00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:22,660
whether a system says what my sexual

00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:24,250
orientation is it might be very

00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:27,130
different because it's really just up to

00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:28,540
me so I think that's really yeah what

00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:31,060
what is sort of one of the things that

00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:35,800
really a I just can't do because it's

00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:37,390
only ever going to be a guess yeah one

00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,920
question I kind of just have personally

00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:41,200
myself you know going back to what you

00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:43,630
said earlier about all the ways that AI

00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:45,610
can detect my identity not just with my

00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:46,780
face even my face is covered you can

00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:48,940
look at how I walk you to look at my

00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:51,700
vein patterns which is absolutely wild

00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:53,910
but then we also look at the number of

00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:56,680
people at least in the u.s. how you know

00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:59,440
black citizens have been more at risk to

00:27:56,680 --> 00:28:01,240
coronavirus than certain others you know

00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,820
my fear is that would they ever use AI

00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:06,880
to detect who might be more susceptible

00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:08,020
to coronavirus well they just kind of

00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,120
just be looking at okay who's black

00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:13,420
who's not is that something I should be

00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:16,900
afraid of I mean we already know was

00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:20,320
most at risk right we know that the

00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:22,270
people that people who can't who can't

00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:24,460
work from home who can't have zoom

00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:26,350
meetings and you know do sound or bread

00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:28,780
people have to let people are essential

00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:30,730
workers are most at risk and people who

00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:32,470
are generally marginalized that if

00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:35,080
you're if you're poor if you're if you

00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:37,180
lived in cramped living spaces then

00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:38,890
you're most at risk and in many parts of

00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:40,840
the world this sort of coincides with

00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:42,760
people's race and that means that

00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:44,860
certain people are at a higher risk so

00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:46,690
you don't need a I tried to answer this

00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:48,520
question because that's sort of like

00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:50,770
it's not an AI you kind of question it's

00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:54,580
a statistical question where we can see

00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:56,419
who's most affected I think what's the

00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:59,509
role of AI in this

00:28:56,419 --> 00:29:02,029
I don't think a crisis is necessarily a

00:28:59,509 --> 00:29:05,859
time where you want to use untested

00:29:02,029 --> 00:29:08,960
technology to experiment basically I

00:29:05,859 --> 00:29:12,109
haven't seen I haven't looked into this

00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:14,210
in detail this what rolling I can can or

00:29:12,109 --> 00:29:18,799
cannot play in this crisis but I'm very

00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:20,570
very always very suspicious when this

00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:22,190
crisis isn't like is seen as a business

00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:24,070
opportunity to try something out because

00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:26,869
really really we don't want to be trying

00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:30,139
those people's lives in the health at

00:29:26,869 --> 00:29:31,970
the moment yeah my worst case scenario

00:29:30,139 --> 00:29:33,409
fear is like an app that just says okay

00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:35,090
this person is an essential worker watch

00:29:33,409 --> 00:29:37,190
out for them this person black watch out

00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:39,200
for them that's probably it maybe is not

00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:42,259
feasible but should I be worried about

00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:45,830
that probably no I think the it is I

00:29:42,259 --> 00:29:47,749
think what I'm all of these privacy

00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:49,999
discussions what they're really about is

00:29:47,749 --> 00:29:53,570
the reason why I think we the reason why

00:29:49,999 --> 00:29:56,029
we need privacy is that we don't want

00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:58,909
people to be segmented and excluded and

00:29:56,029 --> 00:30:00,649
discriminated against so there was a

00:29:58,909 --> 00:30:03,139
case in Kenya where someone was beaten

00:30:00,649 --> 00:30:05,480
to death because some other people

00:30:03,139 --> 00:30:07,669
suspected they had coronavirus we're

00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:10,429
sort of like if we sort of there is a

00:30:07,669 --> 00:30:11,840
scenario where I don't know certain

00:30:10,429 --> 00:30:13,940
people have immunity other people have

00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:18,230
don't so they treat it differently or

00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:20,359
like you know you you test positive and

00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:24,259
you infected other people and then they

00:30:20,359 --> 00:30:26,720
execute like the they're like so many

00:30:24,259 --> 00:30:29,119
terrible possibilities of things that

00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:31,460
can go wrong and this is why we need to

00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:32,899
the tech we use needs to be really

00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:34,999
really really respectful not just a

00:30:32,899 --> 00:30:37,879
pharmacy but of all sorts of rights to

00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:39,799
keep that in mind now yeah we got a

00:30:37,879 --> 00:30:41,779
question from the panopticon foundation

00:30:39,799 --> 00:30:44,029
on twitter what are the risks of

00:30:41,779 --> 00:30:46,220
immunity certificates becoming the

00:30:44,029 --> 00:30:47,299
condition of our access to public and

00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:48,799
social life do you want to explain a

00:30:47,299 --> 00:30:50,779
little bit what you mean any

00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:53,539
certificates are and then answer the

00:30:50,779 --> 00:30:55,489
question so there was that in a lot of

00:30:53,539 --> 00:30:56,950
English media there were claims that

00:30:55,489 --> 00:31:00,070
Germany is planning on introducing

00:30:56,950 --> 00:31:03,019
immunity passwords which was sort of

00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:06,259
initially a weird translation so there's

00:31:03,019 --> 00:31:08,840
a there are immunity studies and one of

00:31:06,259 --> 00:31:09,970
the lead researchers first said that yes

00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:12,010
potentially

00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:15,040
we could issue some of the people who

00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:17,170
participated an immunity passport but

00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:19,060
that's just sort of piece of paper

00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:20,350
basically there are some private

00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:22,210
companies who are really really

00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:25,930
interested in action and are pushing

00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:27,880
this idea but what I think is important

00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:30,700
is that the whu-oh has said very clearly

00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:33,010
they're warning very clearly against

00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:35,440
immunity certificates and the reason for

00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:36,880
this is from their perspective which is

00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:40,510
not my area of expertise but their

00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:42,610
perspective is that immunity to the

00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:45,370
coronavirus them to cope 19 is an

00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:48,310
ongoing area of research we simply don't

00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:50,500
know yet if people will be immune and if

00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:52,960
yes for how long and as long as we don't

00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:55,150
know this that's very difficult and the

00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:58,390
second part is that many of the immunity

00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:59,950
tests aren't very accurate so sort of

00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:01,810
like we don't we can't even measure it

00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:03,610
and we don't even know how long it lasts

00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:06,670
and until these two criteria are met

00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:08,560
aren't met I find it very strange that

00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:11,020
we're already talking about immunity

00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:13,630
certificates when the basic fundamentals

00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:15,490
aren't there what worries me is that we

00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:17,890
just were rushed to deploy this without

00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:20,800
the evidence that there's any sense in

00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:23,560
it there's also sort of an identity

00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:27,220
industry that's very very interested in

00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:29,260
pushing for a digital identity that

00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:31,630
centralizes lots of different parts of

00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:33,610
our lives in an identity so this is

00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:35,470
something to be worried about and then

00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:38,830
finally I think again this isn't about

00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:40,900
privacy it's more how are we going to

00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:42,550
treat people who are immune are we going

00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:44,560
to give you certain privileges and

00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:47,190
advantages and other people not so this

00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:49,300
is me there are some very scary

00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:52,630
implications of this idea that I'm

00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:55,270
personally very skeptical and quite

00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:56,110
worried about yeah it's crazy this is

00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:58,660
not easy

00:32:56,110 --> 00:33:00,820
yeah yeah and also sort of like so what

00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:02,710
does that mean is it sort of does it

00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:04,300
mean that people will try to get sick so

00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:06,130
that they are immune that's really

00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:08,860
really not what we want or there are

00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:11,110
also certain people who are so at risk

00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:12,550
that there really cannot be sick so what

00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:14,860
about these people they never get an

00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:18,280
immunity password so sort of it raises

00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:20,110
so many crucial questions that yeah I

00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:23,260
currently find this very very concerning

00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:23,800
plus if the WHL warns against it why are

00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:27,430
we having

00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:31,210
this discussion yeah it's just crazy the

00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:33,700
ways we rush to stratify society like it

00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:35,680
seems like you would issue those too as

00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:39,250
a way to treat certain people better and

00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:40,930
certain people worse it seems like which

00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:43,270
we're already doing in a society but

00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:45,610
it's sort of right it's not somebody

00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:47,920
really smart on Twitter it said the

00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:49,870
other day we're not in the same boat but

00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:51,250
we're all in the same storm and some we

00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:53,380
have different kinds of boats and I

00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:56,710
think that that captured the entire

00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:58,540
pandemic quite well but then adding

00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:59,860
immunity certificates on top of this you

00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:02,350
again have the question who will have

00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:04,180
access to these immunity tests will it

00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:06,280
be all the celebrities so again like I

00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:09,820
have an immunity password and other

00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:11,440
people who don't so it's sort of yeah

00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:13,780
this is already such an equality

00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:17,140
question that adding this on top just

00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:19,090
sounds yeah consumers has shown me that

00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:21,640
if the apocalypse went down it would

00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:24,450
only be like rich folks who survived and

00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:26,890
like folks with access to like it's just

00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:28,870
okay so the next question is crazy so

00:34:26,890 --> 00:34:30,700
next question some good tech policy

00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:33,399
ideas have been gaining momentum in the

00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:35,500
US we have and before the pandemic not

00:34:33,399 --> 00:34:37,600
just after the dynamic the CCP a

00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:39,040
California consumer Privacy Act the

00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:40,960
honest ads Act these are things that

00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:43,929
were kind of gaining some ground before

00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:45,970
coronavirus hit have privacy initiatives

00:34:43,929 --> 00:34:49,810
like this completely stalled as a result

00:34:45,970 --> 00:34:51,909
of the pandemic so everything is on halt

00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:54,929
at the moment and it's sort of that's

00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:57,580
that's why we also need this to be over

00:34:54,929 --> 00:34:59,770
because everything is on halt and that

00:34:57,580 --> 00:35:01,510
means lots of important issues aren't

00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:04,180
deserving the attention they need I

00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:06,670
still think that the pandemic shows us

00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:08,140
how urgently countries that lack

00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:10,330
comprehensive privacy and data

00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:12,010
protection laws actually need them and

00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:14,590
something I read the other day that

00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:17,140
worried me in the US which does not have

00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:19,390
a comprehensive data protection law

00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:21,940
there's the California law law and there

00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:24,400
are sort of second there are sort of

00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:26,530
there's a a law about health care data

00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:28,980
but health care data is very narrowly

00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:31,150
defined it doesn't cover things like

00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:32,950
browsing data that reveals information

00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:35,110
about you health it's really strictly

00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:37,690
about medical information and as a

00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:39,819
result of this lots of browsing

00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:41,560
tracking data that actually reveals what

00:35:39,819 --> 00:35:44,650
they you depressed what your health

00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:46,089
state of this is up for grabs so this is

00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:47,770
something where I'm like I'm really

00:35:46,089 --> 00:35:49,569
worried about what I advertise it's like

00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:51,880
we've already seen that data brokers now

00:35:49,569 --> 00:35:53,650
offer targeting categories for how

00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:55,599
people are dealing with a pandemic and

00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:58,869
that's not healthy but this is like

00:35:55,599 --> 00:36:01,420
anxious or like stockpiling or like

00:35:58,869 --> 00:36:03,730
bored and hollow - I again the potential

00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:05,800
for abuse is really high but what's also

00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:08,260
really important is sort of how our what

00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:09,030
rights do employees have in the

00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:12,819
workplace

00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:14,589
I'm worried that companies will say well

00:36:12,819 --> 00:36:18,550
and this would not be allowed like this

00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:21,010
in under European laws but employers say

00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:22,720
if you want to come back to work you

00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:24,730
need to install this very invasive app

00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:26,800
you need to wear a bracelet and you need

00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:29,410
to do we need you need to share all your

00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:31,210
health data with me that's really really

00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:33,190
concerning because what happened will

00:36:31,210 --> 00:36:34,990
you get fired if you test positive and

00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:37,839
they're all these there are very good

00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:40,060
reasons why workers need previously

00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:41,680
protecting of the health data so because

00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:44,680
it's just one of the many reasons what I

00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:46,060
think I hope that this will not put an

00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:49,930
end to these debates that that you will

00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:54,670
sort of give them more a greater sense

00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:54,880
of urgency yeah I totally agree with

00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:59,410
that

00:36:54,880 --> 00:37:02,290
oh I'm sorry yeah just clarified you

00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:05,290
know Corona over there yeah and when it

00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:07,210
comes to try helping them over there

00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:10,050
which is another limitation of the

00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:12,310
contact tracing apps if you asymptomatic

00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:15,040
you will probably not get tested so

00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:18,130
that's another limitation that's true

00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:21,790
that's a very good point so you know

00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:24,760
going back to the this sort of broader

00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:26,770
of reaching tech policy GDP are

00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:29,950
something that has passed and has been

00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:33,369
set in stone over in Europe well GDP our

00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:35,589
help or any privacy over reaches that EU

00:37:33,369 --> 00:37:39,760
governments attempt in response to the

00:37:35,589 --> 00:37:43,630
pandemic so GDP now is a good base it

00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:47,589
offers a baseline of protection not more

00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:49,030
and not less but it's also sort of there

00:37:47,589 --> 00:37:50,470
are many exemptions for example

00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:52,720
especially when it comes to government

00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:56,170
so for example for national security

00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:58,300
reasons for immigration purposes the

00:37:56,170 --> 00:37:59,859
standards are lower for certain

00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:02,080
government applications and many EU

00:37:59,859 --> 00:38:04,780
Member States states have made use of

00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:07,180
that to pass local laws that give them

00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:10,290
certain exemptions and a health crisis

00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:12,520
is certainly a crisis that that sort of

00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:14,950
is adjusted it's sort of like that's a

00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:17,440
special kind of situation so I think

00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:19,720
when it comes to companies processing

00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:21,820
data yes G is great to have GDP on

00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:23,950
because it means that at least in theory

00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:27,070
health apps are not allowed to have

00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:28,900
advertising trackers within them but

00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:32,290
I've done a study in my last jobs with

00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:34,330
my colleague Elliot we looked at sort of

00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:36,400
the kind of data that health websites

00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:38,590
websites about depression specifically

00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,630
share with advertisers and we were very

00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:42,790
shocked to learn that and we only looked

00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:44,650
at European websites in the UK and

00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:46,510
Germany and in France and we were really

00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:48,250
shocked to find out that in an

00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:50,080
incredible amount of websites about

00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:53,140
health shared health data with

00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:55,810
advertisers so the it's only ever going

00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:57,670
to be the baseline GPR and there is a

00:38:55,810 --> 00:39:01,270
massive enforcement gap so there is a

00:38:57,670 --> 00:39:03,160
problem that some of the DPS have been

00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:05,770
very active and it's great to have this

00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:07,480
framework but when it comes to sort of

00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:09,520
like the enforcement they're still sort

00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:12,070
of like a gap so the answers yes

00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:13,630
definitely but it's also it's not gonna

00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:16,089
it's not gonna solve everything and

00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:18,190
especially on the corona virus amp

00:39:16,089 --> 00:39:21,460
Lillian Edwards she's a professor and

00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:23,380
the okay she worked on a proposal for a

00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:25,450
bill on the contact tracing app because

00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:27,490
she says no de perak isn't enough you

00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:30,369
really need specific safeguards to

00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:32,380
protect people yeah

00:39:30,369 --> 00:39:34,510
young topical apps the next question is

00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:35,650
you know what messaging and video

00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:36,910
conference and it's actually something

00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:39,130
we've been talking about on the content

00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:41,349
team a bit what messaging and video

00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:43,780
conference apps do you suggest that

00:39:41,349 --> 00:39:44,980
privacy minded people use in this moment

00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:47,650
when they're working from home and then

00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:51,130
doing everything from home I don't like

00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:52,780
to recommend products because again sort

00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:54,970
of people's threat model is kind of

00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:58,390
different and and what that role means

00:39:54,970 --> 00:40:00,099
is sort of who you're afraid of and what

00:39:58,390 --> 00:40:02,320
you're afraid should be afraid of really

00:40:00,099 --> 00:40:03,880
different depends on your situation so

00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:06,039
if you're a therapist and you

00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:08,890
offering counseling or therapy online

00:40:06,039 --> 00:40:10,210
you need a different level of protection

00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:14,019
than when you're just talking to your

00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:15,609
grandma not cooking but what I think is

00:40:14,019 --> 00:40:17,829
I think a lot of companies there is a

00:40:15,609 --> 00:40:20,170
real risk a lot of as a lot of companies

00:40:17,829 --> 00:40:22,960
I'm working remotely a lot of sensitive

00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:25,599
topics are being discussed on zoom'

00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:27,369
calls for example so I think something

00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:29,369
that corporate espionage this is really

00:40:27,369 --> 00:40:32,670
really important for companies that the

00:40:29,369 --> 00:40:34,750
technology they use is very secure I

00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:36,279
think currently like the reason why

00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:37,750
people were rushing to zoom is that

00:40:36,279 --> 00:40:42,099
there's currently there's a lack of a

00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:44,259
really really good solution there's like

00:40:42,099 --> 00:40:45,819
jitsi me there's an open source one but

00:40:44,259 --> 00:40:47,049
then it's not that reliable so they're

00:40:45,819 --> 00:40:49,240
all of these solutions that are

00:40:47,049 --> 00:40:52,089
currently around I personally find have

00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:53,799
their different trade-offs so initial

00:40:52,089 --> 00:40:58,089
correction they're my grandma's cooking

00:40:53,799 --> 00:41:00,069
recipes are highly confidential so some

00:40:58,089 --> 00:41:01,809
people who might be draw so next

00:41:00,069 --> 00:41:04,240
question is you know privacy versus

00:41:01,809 --> 00:41:06,970
public health this person says isn't a

00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:08,589
zero-sum game but at the same time I

00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:10,839
also believe there are some privacy

00:41:08,589 --> 00:41:13,119
concessions we should be willing to at

00:41:10,839 --> 00:41:15,069
least temporarily make to help prevent

00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:17,319
the spread is this opinion shared

00:41:15,069 --> 00:41:19,269
amongst privacy activists or are they

00:41:17,319 --> 00:41:22,509
unwilling to make any concessions at all

00:41:19,269 --> 00:41:25,240
I again I think it's useful to go back

00:41:22,509 --> 00:41:28,390
to human rights law and say that yes of

00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:31,299
course like during a crisis fundamental

00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:33,160
rights can be restricted but only if a

00:41:31,299 --> 00:41:34,839
number of conditions are met and I think

00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:36,940
it's so important to go back to human

00:41:34,839 --> 00:41:38,619
rights law because the the conditions

00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:41,619
that are laid out there are very make a

00:41:38,619 --> 00:41:43,210
lot of sense so this amongst other

00:41:41,619 --> 00:41:45,400
things the restriction has to be

00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:47,619
necessary it has to be evidence-based it

00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:49,420
has to be timely and limited there needs

00:41:47,619 --> 00:41:52,359
to be oversight so this is a long list

00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:54,009
of things that are really sensible what

00:41:52,359 --> 00:41:56,019
I'm worried about is that governments

00:41:54,009 --> 00:41:57,940
are rushing to deploy they're desperate

00:41:56,019 --> 00:42:00,190
they want to be seen as doing something

00:41:57,940 --> 00:42:03,000
and there's a great work word in German

00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:05,410
which is to mismos it's just like

00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,960
looking like pretend like you just want

00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:09,670
to be doing something so I'm worried

00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:12,279
that governments will deploy technology

00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:15,250
without evidence that this is actually

00:42:12,279 --> 00:42:17,740
effective without just without the

00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:21,670
necessary transparency I find

00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:23,770
in the UK was quite concerning the lack

00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:25,270
of transparency with which certain kinds

00:42:23,770 --> 00:42:27,609
of tools were being discussed that's

00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:29,890
really worrying in a democratic country

00:42:27,609 --> 00:42:32,230
where because I feel like if democracies

00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:35,049
don't manage to build responsible

00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:36,549
trustworthy technology who will so sort

00:42:35,049 --> 00:42:39,400
of like I think it's also important to

00:42:36,549 --> 00:42:41,410
to send the signal to elsewhere to say

00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:43,359
yes it is possible to build responsible

00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:46,569
tools and if we are not backing down

00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:48,640
like you know you really don't have any

00:42:46,569 --> 00:42:51,369
leverage to point the finger elsewhere

00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:53,799
and say well you are using this tech

00:42:51,369 --> 00:42:56,410
irresponsibly and it is really sort of

00:42:53,799 --> 00:43:00,010
it's not a trade of their sort of their

00:42:56,410 --> 00:43:02,440
we there are some sort of acceptable

00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:05,589
solutions that are out there they have

00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:06,970
already been developed yeah yeah I like

00:43:05,589 --> 00:43:08,710
the idea that where you mentioned just

00:43:06,970 --> 00:43:10,240
like someone you're doing a lot but you

00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:12,640
also said not doing anything at all

00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:14,440
really productive that's crazy that's

00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:16,240
funny so there are a lot of headlines

00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:17,710
out there about you know they say like

00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:21,220
you know AI is helping fight the corona

00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:24,640
virus but AI can be pretty broad and

00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:27,369
also sometimes people misuse the term AI

00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:28,839
when describing certain things does that

00:43:27,369 --> 00:43:31,690
actually mean anything when you see that

00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:33,609
or is it as insane as saying doctors are

00:43:31,690 --> 00:43:35,220
helping fight corona virus like it like

00:43:33,609 --> 00:43:38,440
what is that tell us more about that

00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:41,799
you think AI I has become a

00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:43,480
frustratingly broad term that is just

00:43:41,799 --> 00:43:46,960
sort of sometimes used to just mean

00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:48,430
anything that's data driven and there

00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:49,960
were studies like there was a study a

00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:52,210
few years ago that chat like two years

00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:54,369
ago that showed that a significant share

00:43:52,210 --> 00:43:57,400
of European AI startups don't actually

00:43:54,369 --> 00:44:00,539
use AI so there's a lot of hype around

00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:02,650
AI there's a lot of sort of like

00:44:00,539 --> 00:44:04,750
snake-oil meaning there's a lot of false

00:44:02,650 --> 00:44:06,450
marketing and the thing that I spotted

00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:09,970
early on there was a company that claims

00:44:06,450 --> 00:44:11,920
they're selling a I driven cameras that

00:44:09,970 --> 00:44:15,579
can spot whether you have corona virus

00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:17,619
that's obviously snake-hole because if

00:44:15,579 --> 00:44:19,180
it was so easy if you could just point a

00:44:17,619 --> 00:44:21,640
camera at someone and see if they have

00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:24,660
corona virus you we wouldn't you know we

00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:26,890
wouldn't need to develop all these tests

00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:28,539
that would be a game-changer and this

00:44:26,890 --> 00:44:30,250
company would be incredibly rich but so

00:44:28,539 --> 00:44:32,920
the truth is what this company

00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:34,810
offering is like a thermal camera that

00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:36,640
shows whether someone has a fever which

00:44:34,810 --> 00:44:38,920
is sort of we now know it's just one of

00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:41,200
the many many different symptoms that

00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:42,760
people can and some people don't have so

00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:47,410
sort of like I think that's a classic

00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:48,700
example of AI snake oil and I pivoted my

00:44:47,410 --> 00:44:52,090
project a little bit in light of

00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:53,770
everything being canceled ii think i

00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:56,380
think we need to get collectively we

00:44:53,770 --> 00:44:59,290
need to get better at recognizing and

00:44:56,380 --> 00:45:01,870
calling out when the time a eye is just

00:44:59,290 --> 00:45:04,240
used as a form of hype when it's used at

00:45:01,870 --> 00:45:06,490
snake oil and and also just calling out

00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:09,550
blatant pseudoscience or things that are

00:45:06,490 --> 00:45:10,450
that just simply just aren't really

00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:11,980
scientific

00:45:10,450 --> 00:45:13,480
so i think it's really really important

00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:16,030
to get better at just calling this out

00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:18,400
the fact that a company like this can

00:45:16,030 --> 00:45:20,410
get a media headline that says hey i can

00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:22,690
find out if you have the corona virus

00:45:20,410 --> 00:45:24,280
that's kind of concerning because it

00:45:22,690 --> 00:45:25,930
means that somebody didn't go back and

00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:27,790
checks like is that something i can

00:45:25,930 --> 00:45:32,280
actually do like what is this company

00:45:27,790 --> 00:45:34,540
actually doing yeah yeah i'm afraid to

00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:36,580
find out that there's anyone working

00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:38,500
right now on a camera detection corona

00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:42,220
virus detection app to like scan people

00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:43,750
to like make millions that's my fear but

00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:47,140
it's also like it's just something sort

00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:49,090
of a camera cannot detect it's just not

00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:51,700
it's just sort of like category that not

00:45:49,090 --> 00:45:53,560
not possible is if you can find out if

00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:56,500
someone has a fever but that's not i

00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:58,840
mean i mean we already have a fever

00:45:56,500 --> 00:46:01,060
detector it's called a thermometer right

00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:02,320
you can everybody has a phone and you

00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:05,620
can find out if you have a fever but

00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:08,140
that that's not a diagnosis it takes it

00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:11,080
takes more than that i mean it's sort of

00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:13,150
like you need to just turn around yeah

00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:14,740
I'm picturing an app that just says like

00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:16,630
Oliver selfie and it says fredericka

00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:19,150
coronavirus is a bright red just like

00:46:16,630 --> 00:46:20,200
yeah but that doesn't make any sense no

00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:24,130
it doesn't make any sense but I think

00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:25,720
some of the in the in the shortage of

00:46:24,130 --> 00:46:27,730
testing that still exists in so many

00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:30,580
countries some of the contact tracing

00:46:27,730 --> 00:46:34,120
apps I've seen around the world some of

00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:36,160
them allow you to not don't say well I

00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:38,380
have tested positive but allow you to

00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:41,320
but let you take a test and answer some

00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:43,690
questions that comes with its own

00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:46,780
challenges because it really depends on

00:46:43,690 --> 00:46:50,020
these questions good enough - are they

00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:52,630
good enough - to really diagnose you is

00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:54,609
this sufficient and then what does it

00:46:52,630 --> 00:46:55,900
mean sort of if you've been in contact

00:46:54,609 --> 00:46:58,030
with someone who filled out a

00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:59,920
questionnaire that has a very different

00:46:58,030 --> 00:47:02,049
way than you've been in close contact

00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:04,690
with someone who actually tests positive

00:47:02,049 --> 00:47:06,910
so again going back to all the legal

00:47:04,690 --> 00:47:09,940
protections that are necessary what what

00:47:06,910 --> 00:47:12,520
happens when your app shows well I've

00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:13,900
been in contact with someone does it

00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:15,400
mean that the government restricts your

00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:16,809
movement for like what are the

00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:19,059
consequences so all of these things

00:47:16,809 --> 00:47:21,069
really need to be it need to be sure

00:47:19,059 --> 00:47:21,750
that the human rights aren't being

00:47:21,069 --> 00:47:25,140
violated

00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:32,220
unjustifiably and disproportionately and

00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:34,720
arbitrarily and against I mean yeah yeah

00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:36,819
do you think about it like if you if you

00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:39,160
don't have a phone on your own if you

00:47:36,819 --> 00:47:41,410
share your phone with others which is

00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:43,539
the reality for many poor people in the

00:47:41,410 --> 00:47:46,119
world it means your chances also higher

00:47:43,539 --> 00:47:48,520
up getting in touch with someone because

00:47:46,119 --> 00:47:49,539
several people carrying this around so

00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:52,359
there are all these sort of questions

00:47:49,539 --> 00:47:55,299
around this yeah yeah like you said

00:47:52,359 --> 00:47:56,650
before like the assumptions that mess

00:47:55,299 --> 00:47:59,500
you up right there

00:47:56,650 --> 00:48:01,180
question from Leon en shaa - Leon do you

00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:03,789
know of any surveillance companies or

00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:06,279
other companies that make suppressive

00:48:03,789 --> 00:48:11,319
technologies that are pivoting to Coba

00:48:06,279 --> 00:48:13,180
detection I've seen this more at the

00:48:11,319 --> 00:48:15,549
beginning and at the beginning I mean

00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:18,670
from a European perspective like a u.s.

00:48:15,549 --> 00:48:19,809
perspective in March so in March in mid

00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:22,150
March there were a lot of companies

00:48:19,809 --> 00:48:24,539
pitching the anisole group so that's a

00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:28,420
very controversial Israeli spy company

00:48:24,539 --> 00:48:31,539
it also builds the Pegasus spy when they

00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:33,309
were pitching a software that uses

00:48:31,539 --> 00:48:35,190
mobile phone data to predict the spread

00:48:33,309 --> 00:48:38,160
of the virus

00:48:35,190 --> 00:48:40,720
Palantir so a company that also heard

00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:42,099
after us predictive policing tools and

00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:45,010
works with police departments they've

00:48:42,099 --> 00:48:46,839
been pitching in technology what I

00:48:45,010 --> 00:48:49,270
mentioned already is a camera that the

00:48:46,839 --> 00:48:51,970
AI detecting coronavirus surveillance

00:48:49,270 --> 00:48:54,260
camera so I think going back to the I

00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:55,820
think the second question about 911

00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:57,080
this isn't inevitable because it

00:48:55,820 --> 00:49:00,350
actually logically doesn't make that

00:48:57,080 --> 00:49:01,910
much sense but of course there's a huge

00:49:00,350 --> 00:49:04,400
interest a lot of companies are

00:49:01,910 --> 00:49:05,720
struggling at the moment and everybody

00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:07,820
is trying to think how can we you know

00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:09,290
how can we adapt and so is the

00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:10,460
surveillance industry so for the

00:49:09,290 --> 00:49:11,359
surveillance industry they're like

00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:13,460
perfect

00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:14,480
we need a monitor that you can pitch the

00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:17,210
government's that you need to monitor

00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:19,580
everyone that you need to you know trace

00:49:17,210 --> 00:49:22,640
their location so I think this is a this

00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:23,960
is something that civil society and

00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:26,600
anybody who cares about these issues

00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:29,180
really needs to monitor closely and call

00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:30,530
out when it's happening every time you

00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:32,900
mentioned that camera app when just like

00:49:30,530 --> 00:49:35,990
picturing like like the idea of a corona

00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:39,320
camera app someone oh my god I just

00:49:35,990 --> 00:49:40,580
can't this is a question here and we're

00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:41,780
getting towards the end of this not

00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:44,630
quite at the end right now towards the

00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:47,150
end a question from Twitter at writely

00:49:44,630 --> 00:49:49,850
data will data regulators be less likely

00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:51,080
to penalize companies and what can

00:49:49,850 --> 00:49:55,030
consumers do to better protect

00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:55,030
themselves from their data being misused

00:49:55,060 --> 00:50:00,920
I always like to stress that there are

00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:03,369
many countries that don't have any laws

00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:06,050
and many countries that do have laws

00:50:03,369 --> 00:50:08,180
don't have regulators who are

00:50:06,050 --> 00:50:09,950
independent and sufficiently funded to

00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:13,340
actually enforce the laws so that's a

00:50:09,950 --> 00:50:15,140
huge problem always I think in some of

00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:16,760
those so I do you think in Europe there

00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:19,130
is an enforcement gap and that is a

00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:20,690
problem but the problem is also that we

00:50:19,130 --> 00:50:22,670
live in a world that's made of data

00:50:20,690 --> 00:50:26,180
everything is data so these regulators

00:50:22,670 --> 00:50:27,859
they're not staffed and funded enough to

00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:30,380
investigate every single app out there

00:50:27,859 --> 00:50:33,080
and to respond to every complain there

00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:34,670
is so that is a huge problem part of the

00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:36,980
question was also what can I do to

00:50:34,670 --> 00:50:41,960
better protect myself and I never sort

00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:43,130
of I don't like I sort of like I know

00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:44,690
that this is a very common question

00:50:43,130 --> 00:50:45,920
because people want to be able to do

00:50:44,690 --> 00:50:47,900
something they want to know how to

00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:51,770
protect themselves but I'm always very

00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:53,119
careful to blame people because they're

00:50:51,770 --> 00:50:54,770
the weakest link in the chain

00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:57,020
and it's not our it can't be our

00:50:54,770 --> 00:50:58,609
full-time job to protect ourselves and I

00:50:57,020 --> 00:51:01,130
always like to say when you go to a

00:50:58,609 --> 00:51:03,200
restaurant you don't bring a testing kit

00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:04,609
to test whether you're back when you

00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:05,960
still could go to restaurants you

00:51:04,609 --> 00:51:07,060
wouldn't bring a test and get to test

00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:08,650
whether your meal is say

00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:10,870
you just trust that you don't get food

00:51:08,650 --> 00:51:12,730
poisoning but we don't have the same was

00:51:10,870 --> 00:51:15,160
tanks I would like to live in a world

00:51:12,730 --> 00:51:17,560
where you can just purchase a service a

00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:19,630
product and you can trust that it

00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:22,090
doesn't exploit your data but sadly

00:51:19,630 --> 00:51:24,190
actually the opposite is true most

00:51:22,090 --> 00:51:26,440
products even the ones you pay for it

00:51:24,190 --> 00:51:28,690
still share your data would emphasize us

00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:30,640
and in ways that are very hard to

00:51:28,690 --> 00:51:32,620
understand and I think that's what we

00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:35,800
should be asking not what can I do to

00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:38,160
protect myself but how can how can tech

00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:40,180
Jeremy become what trustworthy

00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:41,980
yeah such a good point I mean like you

00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:43,960
buy food and like at least the grocery

00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:45,820
store is like Nutrition Facts but when

00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:47,440
you like sign up for a website you could

00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:49,480
go inside the privacy policy and like

00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:51,340
read through all the legalese but it's

00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:55,480
just like not easily it's not easily

00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:57,610
done next question what do you but even

00:51:55,480 --> 00:52:00,660
if you do sort of like I sometimes do

00:51:57,610 --> 00:52:04,900
this because this used to be my my job

00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:06,550
even then it's not always clear like if

00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:07,840
when I using health app I really read

00:52:06,550 --> 00:52:08,340
the privacy policy and sometimes I'm

00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:10,840
next

00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:12,580
very vague language I know that this

00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:13,780
opens up lots of doors but I don't

00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:16,150
really know what the app is doing and

00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:18,070
that's that's just a problem yeah I

00:52:16,150 --> 00:52:19,750
agree I mean like you buy some cookies

00:52:18,070 --> 00:52:22,120
and you can say ok 5 grams of sugar

00:52:19,750 --> 00:52:23,500
that's very easy to understand you like

00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:24,760
go through the power of privacy policy

00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:28,060
and you read it and it's like wait what

00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:30,400
did I just read like you don't know so

00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:32,440
one of the last questions here as the

00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:34,570
benefit is from front-porch cs on

00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:37,390
twitter as the benefits and popularity

00:52:34,570 --> 00:52:38,470
telemedicine and telehealth become you

00:52:37,390 --> 00:52:40,660
know they're now like abundantly clear

00:52:38,470 --> 00:52:43,480
why we should have that especially for

00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:45,880
older adults when it comes to over 19

00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:47,410
what privacy and security issues should

00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:50,560
we be concerned about when it comes to

00:52:47,410 --> 00:52:53,440
telemedicine until telehealth that's a

00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:56,050
very specific question I when it comes

00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:59,260
to older people there are a lot of

00:52:56,050 --> 00:53:00,780
barriers to usability I like there are

00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:03,490
many older people who have dementia

00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:04,930
that's very challenging so how do you

00:53:03,490 --> 00:53:06,880
how do you make sure that older people

00:53:04,930 --> 00:53:09,190
can use technology and I've noticed with

00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:11,560
my grandparents in this crisis that

00:53:09,190 --> 00:53:13,270
they're finding it incredibly it would

00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:15,040
be so easy to stay in touch with them

00:53:13,270 --> 00:53:17,980
but they're finding it really difficult

00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:19,180
to use even with like the larger letters

00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:20,440
on the phone they're finding it really

00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:22,060
difficult to use tech

00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:24,160
so the question is look like how can

00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:27,099
this be exclusive and usable for most

00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:29,859
people I'm not an expert on telemedicine

00:53:27,099 --> 00:53:32,770
it's sort of any kind of medical use of

00:53:29,859 --> 00:53:34,270
tech needs to in the in the European

00:53:32,770 --> 00:53:36,849
framework of thinking about this your

00:53:34,270 --> 00:53:39,510
processing health data and the same in

00:53:36,849 --> 00:53:41,770
the u.s. sort of you have HIPAA you have

00:53:39,510 --> 00:53:43,420
laws that govern sort of health data

00:53:41,770 --> 00:53:45,579
you're really really processing

00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:48,339
sensitive data so this needs to abide by

00:53:45,579 --> 00:53:50,619
the highest standards possible while

00:53:48,339 --> 00:53:53,440
also being usable and at the same time

00:53:50,619 --> 00:53:54,819
sort of we all know that online is

00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:58,030
useful but it also can't replace

00:53:54,819 --> 00:54:00,040
everything especially when you're sort

00:53:58,030 --> 00:54:00,990
of old and lonely it's also nice to see

00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:05,380
a doctor

00:54:00,990 --> 00:54:06,970
yeah this question is from at Roger

00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:09,310
Neill I probably messed that

00:54:06,970 --> 00:54:10,720
pronunciation up on Twitter so given

00:54:09,310 --> 00:54:12,670
your background in privacy what do you

00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:14,800
think of the limits of the concept of

00:54:12,670 --> 00:54:20,440
privacy to capture the full range of

00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:21,700
concerns and tech kovat responses people

00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:24,069
understand that what privacy very

00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:25,599
differently and I think my personal

00:54:24,069 --> 00:54:27,730
understanding of the term is much

00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:29,589
broader than most people's so for me

00:54:27,730 --> 00:54:31,960
privacy is something that is not just

00:54:29,589 --> 00:54:33,970
about hiding it's not just about me

00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:35,619
individually it's sort of like it's

00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:38,589
something that enables a lots of other

00:54:35,619 --> 00:54:40,569
rights it's something that sort of like

00:54:38,589 --> 00:54:42,609
that is also beneficial for collectives

00:54:40,569 --> 00:54:44,589
and groups but that's a little bit sort

00:54:42,609 --> 00:54:48,180
of most most people sort of intuitive

00:54:44,589 --> 00:54:51,280
understanding of privacy is different as

00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:53,260
I said several times before I think no

00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:55,119
privacy is really important in this

00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:57,089
debate but it's only one of many many

00:54:55,119 --> 00:55:01,450
rights that we need to be talking about

00:54:57,089 --> 00:55:03,970
and the reason why I personally welcome

00:55:01,450 --> 00:55:06,460
privacy or why I'm very passionate about

00:55:03,970 --> 00:55:08,859
it is that I find while it affects us

00:55:06,460 --> 00:55:10,720
all it always harms and risks always

00:55:08,859 --> 00:55:13,060
disproportionately affect certain kinds

00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:14,829
of people so if you think about privacy

00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:17,079
in the broader sense the way that I

00:55:14,829 --> 00:55:19,510
think about it this is really a social

00:55:17,079 --> 00:55:21,819
justice issue because it means that

00:55:19,510 --> 00:55:23,859
again sort of like who has cheap phones

00:55:21,819 --> 00:55:25,569
cheap phones have really worse per VC

00:55:23,859 --> 00:55:27,460
than more expensive pumps and you can

00:55:25,569 --> 00:55:29,950
find these examples everywhere in tech

00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:32,619
so it's really sort of I care about

00:55:29,950 --> 00:55:34,150
privacy because I care about justice but

00:55:32,619 --> 00:55:36,190
many people's understanding of

00:55:34,150 --> 00:55:37,809
is about I don't I just want to hide it

00:55:36,190 --> 00:55:40,269
and if you frame it in this way I think

00:55:37,809 --> 00:55:41,799
this is where the public health versus

00:55:40,269 --> 00:55:44,650
privacy discussion is coming from

00:55:41,799 --> 00:55:46,930
because people think sort of I need to

00:55:44,650 --> 00:55:49,210
balance my individual privacy versus a

00:55:46,930 --> 00:55:49,839
public benefit versus my understanding

00:55:49,210 --> 00:55:52,749
as well

00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:54,670
I need a and I want to I want to protect

00:55:52,749 --> 00:55:56,650
people who are most vulnerable while

00:55:54,670 --> 00:55:58,359
also fighting the pandemic I think this

00:55:56,650 --> 00:56:01,480
is where this misunderstanding is coming

00:55:58,359 --> 00:56:03,789
from but yes it's just one of the many

00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:06,130
many rights we have to look out for and

00:56:03,789 --> 00:56:07,900
I and I as I probably said several times

00:56:06,130 --> 00:56:09,880
I have been a bit frustrated with this

00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:11,680
privacy versus public health frightening

00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:14,470
because it's just really really not the

00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:15,609
right question to ask yeah that's a good

00:56:14,470 --> 00:56:18,279
point and what you mentioned before

00:56:15,609 --> 00:56:19,480
about like who has a phone like just

00:56:18,279 --> 00:56:21,789
think we're all in the same storm but

00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:23,440
the books are so different yeah

00:56:21,789 --> 00:56:25,480
someone's not and someone's not upset

00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:27,480
that I didn't but is I think really it

00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:30,369
really really can't just this is sort of

00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:32,950
the virus affects us all but how we deal

00:56:30,369 --> 00:56:35,319
with its consequences once we get sick

00:56:32,950 --> 00:56:37,329
is so vastly different different sort of

00:56:35,319 --> 00:56:39,130
weather you can isolate whether you can

00:56:37,329 --> 00:56:40,989
get tested whether you can get access to

00:56:39,130 --> 00:56:44,410
health care they're just worlds apart

00:56:40,989 --> 00:56:45,880
and that's really sort of that's that's

00:56:44,410 --> 00:56:48,039
where you've just been so evident in

00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:50,279
this crisis yeah it's really interesting

00:56:48,039 --> 00:56:52,420
seeing how Corona has really like

00:56:50,279 --> 00:56:55,119
surfaced a lot of these problems that

00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:57,309
have always been there this is the last

00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:58,839
question I'm gonna try to end on an

00:56:57,309 --> 00:57:00,069
optimistic note but this is a really

00:56:58,839 --> 00:57:02,710
heavy talk so I'm probably gonna fail

00:57:00,069 --> 00:57:04,440
but you know going forward you know do

00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:08,289
you see this pandemic changing any

00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:10,809
privacy norms or other bad tech norms

00:57:08,289 --> 00:57:14,369
for the better or the worst but maybe

00:57:10,809 --> 00:57:17,319
the better since it's not mystic I am

00:57:14,369 --> 00:57:21,099
trying to be optimistic I serve actually

00:57:17,319 --> 00:57:22,269
practicing being hopeful and that's one

00:57:21,099 --> 00:57:24,099
of the reasons why together with a

00:57:22,269 --> 00:57:27,039
friend I've started a blog that sort of

00:57:24,099 --> 00:57:29,410
collects things that have suddenly

00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:31,329
become possible that we're previously

00:57:29,410 --> 00:57:33,160
seen as impossible and it's really

00:57:31,329 --> 00:57:34,630
interesting to see across different

00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:37,239
kinds of society there are lots of

00:57:34,630 --> 00:57:39,039
actually positive things that

00:57:37,239 --> 00:57:42,039
governments that companies are doing in

00:57:39,039 --> 00:57:45,549
response to the crisis and protect

00:57:42,039 --> 00:57:47,980
specifically I think the zoom example is

00:57:45,549 --> 00:57:49,930
kind of interesting so the company

00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:52,600
had security and privacy issues for a

00:57:49,930 --> 00:57:54,880
long time but it's now suddenly become

00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:56,980
in the media spotlight because so many

00:57:54,880 --> 00:58:00,160
people are rushing to use their product

00:57:56,980 --> 00:58:01,690
and the company then decided it realized

00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:04,060
that it needs to change their approach

00:58:01,690 --> 00:58:05,470
and it needs to prioritize or that's at

00:58:04,060 --> 00:58:06,820
least what they announced we need to

00:58:05,470 --> 00:58:07,330
check with them whether this is actually

00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:08,770
happening

00:58:07,330 --> 00:58:10,960
but they announced that they're going to

00:58:08,770 --> 00:58:13,480
prioritize security and privacy over

00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:14,980
growth and adding new features and I

00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:16,750
thought that's them actually that's a

00:58:14,980 --> 00:58:18,880
really good lesson for a lot of other

00:58:16,750 --> 00:58:20,920
companies especially smaller startups

00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:22,780
who at the beginning prioritize growth

00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:25,030
and don't really think about privacy and

00:58:22,780 --> 00:58:26,760
security and the company like zoom is

00:58:25,030 --> 00:58:28,900
like if we don't get our act together

00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:32,310
we're not going to make this so it's

00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:34,750
like if June doesn't fix these problems

00:58:32,310 --> 00:58:36,910
they're in an existential crisis so I

00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:40,090
think yes I'm hopeful when it comes to

00:58:36,910 --> 00:58:42,760
many things but when it comes to text

00:58:40,090 --> 00:58:45,580
specifically I think I hope the crisis

00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:48,190
shows so if the framing of trustworthy

00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:49,900
technology so because we depend on tech

00:58:48,190 --> 00:58:52,510
so much at the moment we really need

00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:54,220
tech to be worthy of our trust and we

00:58:52,510 --> 00:58:55,720
shouldn't be trusting it blindly it's

00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:57,910
sort of it needs to be built in a way

00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:59,740
that we don't have to trust it blindly

00:58:57,910 --> 00:59:02,320
but that it's rough you know we can

00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:05,140
trust it with our secrets and our lives

00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:07,540
and all the conversations we have so

00:59:05,140 --> 00:59:09,970
that would be my hope for tech but also

00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:11,710
all of these things so not just in tech

00:59:09,970 --> 00:59:14,290
but also sort of like in society at

00:59:11,710 --> 00:59:15,970
large this is now a possibility we can

00:59:14,290 --> 00:59:20,440
go this way or that way but it really

00:59:15,970 --> 00:59:21,970
depends on all of us which way which

00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:25,510
where we're going and we need a fight

00:59:21,970 --> 00:59:27,609
for learning from this crisis not

00:59:25,510 --> 00:59:29,740
falling into like the war metaphor is

00:59:27,609 --> 00:59:31,150
and mass surveillance but see this as an

00:59:29,740 --> 00:59:34,840
opportunity to fix a lot of things

00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:36,490
that's sort of my optimism that's a good

00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:38,140
sage wisdom right there all right I

00:59:36,490 --> 00:59:41,140
think that's a wrap there's anything

00:59:38,140 --> 00:59:45,820
else you want to add on top all that no

00:59:41,140 --> 00:59:47,230
and the only thing would be sort of just

00:59:45,820 --> 00:59:49,480
sort of all my time at the contact

00:59:47,230 --> 00:59:51,070
tracing a perfect there are some really

00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:54,730
really good simple explainers that

00:59:51,070 --> 00:59:57,250
explains how the tech works and I just

00:59:54,730 --> 00:59:59,410
really hope that more governments will

00:59:57,250 --> 01:00:01,780
opt for like the decentralized version

00:59:59,410 --> 01:00:03,820
that is the most responsible that

01:00:01,780 --> 01:00:05,230
and I've seen so far I think that would

01:00:03,820 --> 01:00:07,510
be pretty important because it sets a

01:00:05,230 --> 01:00:08,980
bad precedent for so many other uses of

01:00:07,510 --> 01:00:10,540
text and we're still early in this

01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:13,030
crisis we don't know where this is gonna

01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:15,240
take out and the dystopian potential is

01:00:13,030 --> 01:00:17,680
endless so here we have a very concrete

01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:19,750
problem we know what the limitations are

01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:21,220
we know what the solutions is I'm just

01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:24,220
like let's just go for the most

01:00:21,220 --> 01:00:25,870
responsible version as you said to stop

01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:27,370
in solutions are endless I pictured The

01:00:25,870 --> 01:00:31,060
Sound of Music gift with the woman in

01:00:27,370 --> 01:00:33,010
the field well yeah right that's a wrap

01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:35,080
thank you so much to everyone who

01:00:33,010 --> 01:00:37,900
followed along watched live asked

01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:39,280
questions etc etc and a very big big big

01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:40,960
THANK YOU to Frederico sharing her

01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:42,520
