another Oh an sis to go first aren't I

00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:30,689
hello everyone thank you so much for

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,210
being here I am delighted to introduce

00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:35,070
our host today mark Thurmond who is the

00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,320
executive director of the Mozilla

00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:40,070
Foundation for nearly what nine years

00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,640
now something like a decade who is

00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:43,440
responsible for throwing this party

00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,840
bringing us all here today to talk about

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,520
the open web open communities and our

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,820
mutual responsibilities to each other

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:54,300
all right well I'm gonna introduce Brian

00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:57,090
Merkley and also just as context this

00:00:54,300 --> 00:01:00,329
big open thing where we are introducing

00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:02,820
each other is a three act play we

00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:04,860
started this at Wikimania in the summer

00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:07,130
where we also introduced each other just

00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:10,049
so you understand the stick has pedigree

00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:11,970
and we will do it again at the Creative

00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:15,119
Commons summit in Toronto next year

00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:16,799
which Ryan will be hosting Ryan somebody

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,130
who I've known for almost all of those

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,630
nine years or probably even longer

00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:23,880
started out in city politics was at

00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:26,520
Mozilla as our director strategy and

00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,409
chief operating officer and now runs

00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,840
Creative Commons which is one of these

00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:32,759
three organizations that has been trying

00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:36,509
to build an open culture for a very long

00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:38,280
time now so I will be introducing

00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:43,280
Katherine Mar who is the executive

00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:48,560
director of the Wikimedia Foundation she

00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:52,970
has been in this role since S&L audio in

00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:56,310
2016 16 and was interim prior to that

00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:58,140
comes to the role with a strong

00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:02,219
background in communications and

00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:05,130
activism and advocacy and a big heart

00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:08,819
and has done really wonderful things in

00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:12,209
support of the movement right

00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:14,010
they're in charge now I mean and so how

00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:15,420
do you define the structure of your

00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:17,159
organization's and now you've really

00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:19,709
kind of one movement or are you three

00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:21,769
separate movements ryan looks like he's

00:02:19,709 --> 00:02:24,420
a he's a but he's ready to ever this one

00:02:21,769 --> 00:02:26,310
so the the organizations are not the

00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:29,760
movement would be my first answer which

00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:31,709
is i think the people who contribute to

00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,079
Creative Commons or Wikipedia or Mozilla

00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:37,349
or any of the other open projects that

00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:40,379
aren't yet on this stage they pick us

00:02:37,349 --> 00:02:41,430
because we share their values and the

00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:43,319
reason we wanted to have this

00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:46,889
conversation is because we know that

00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:48,359
there is a Venn diagram of our shared

00:02:46,889 --> 00:02:50,400
values and there are places where we

00:02:48,359 --> 00:02:52,470
think we could do more together to

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,189
mobilize all of those people to

00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:55,919
collaborate

00:02:53,189 --> 00:02:58,439
I go to Moz fest I've been to every

00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:00,389
single Moz fest but I also go to wiki

00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:01,769
mania and go to other events and I

00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:04,169
always wish that there was more

00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:06,810
continuity for the participants to

00:03:04,169 --> 00:03:08,609
recognize that they are often similar

00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:10,919
are the same people who move between

00:03:08,609 --> 00:03:12,659
these these movements and so my hope is

00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:14,069
that we start thinking about it kind of

00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:15,569
I want to flip your question a bit and

00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:17,040
say that I want to actually think more

00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:20,970
about the people rather than the

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:22,440
organization's yeah I mean I think of it

00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:24,269
as very much sort of a moveable feast

00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,979
everywhere I go they see the same people

00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:27,540
and I've gotten into the habit of not

00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:29,989
saying goodbye to anyone just sort of

00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:32,940
see you later or see you the next time I

00:03:29,989 --> 00:03:35,790
feel very strongly as Ryan does that we

00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:37,079
are part of one large community we can

00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:39,030
media actually uses the language of a

00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:40,590
movement to describe Wikimedia and I

00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:41,940
think that that's important for our

00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:43,590
context in the sense that it's

00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:44,609
aspirational and it describes the fact

00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:46,620
that we're part of something that is

00:03:44,609 --> 00:03:48,419
global and has a vision and a mission

00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,220
that we're trying to achieve but when I

00:03:48,419 --> 00:03:51,750
pause and take a step back and I'm

00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:53,549
really reminded of this at Moz fest

00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:55,769
because Mars Fest is so excellent at

00:03:53,549 --> 00:03:56,879
bringing in such a diversity of folks on

00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:58,799
everything from the Internet of Things

00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,930
just repairability as we were just

00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,389
hearing about to sort of civic hacking

00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:04,949
and open cities that were really part of

00:04:03,389 --> 00:04:06,780
a group of people who share a set of

00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:09,629
values around the way the world should

00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:11,099
operate and that in and of itself is a

00:04:09,629 --> 00:04:12,479
movement and we are just the

00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:15,019
organizations that sort of hold up

00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:18,029
various different pieces of the ceiling

00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:19,829
so I mean I would agree with those and

00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:22,049
it maybe extend it a little bit further

00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:22,480
and look at some of the challenges we

00:04:22,049 --> 00:04:25,000
face

00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:26,650
right now certainly the values and the

00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,650
people are at the core of it and any

00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:31,210
good movement that's what makes it right

00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:32,920
it is bigger than any of the people or

00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:34,480
any of the organizations involved and

00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:36,010
you know Greenpeace and the World

00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:38,080
Wildlife Fund and earth first are all

00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:39,340
very different organizations and I don't

00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,610
think anybody would question them

00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:44,880
calling themselves environmentalists and

00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:47,530
I think you know good movements often

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:50,580
probably almost always have conflict in

00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:53,200
them it's interesting confused as well

00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:55,300
and I actually think it wouldn't be a

00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:58,060
real movement that had meant anything to

00:04:55,300 --> 00:05:00,250
anyone if it wasn't certainly you look

00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:01,690
at the civil rights movement or the

00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:04,570
environmental movement or or anything

00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:07,810
there are you know they exist in as much

00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:10,600
to grapple as they do to project

00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:13,330
outwards I mean I I will out myself as a

00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:14,860
the son of a minister and often we

00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:16,780
criticize ourselves when we talk about

00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:19,020
things like confusion of preaching to

00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:21,160
the converted or being inwardly focused

00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:22,570
but you know one of the things that I

00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:26,080
watched you know growing up in that

00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:27,880
context I left that religion but you

00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,550
know is a lot of the energy actually is

00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:32,860
in the community talking to itself and

00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:35,020
being together and being strong and that

00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:36,970
is as important as growing the movement

00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:39,070
and so I think one of the important

00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:41,920
functions of movement organizations is

00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:44,800
to focus resources and to be a support

00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:47,800
for us to come together to grapple to

00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:51,340
deal with our confusion and to actually

00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:53,770
be strong and so you know that that I

00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:55,870
think is I see us and I think you guys

00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:58,030
would probably agree as in service to

00:05:55,870 --> 00:06:01,420
those people and those values as we

00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:03,070
grapple with what do they mean now you

00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:05,410
touched on it slightly that you've got

00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:07,350
some personal shared history but what

00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:09,550
kind of collaborations of the three

00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:12,670
organizations within the same wider

00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:19,930
movement out done in the past or what's

00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:22,510
kind of a shared view 3 mmm clumsy but I

00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:25,390
mean I think ever since you know I I

00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:28,420
probably been in this role I know longer

00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:30,400
than you know from very very early on

00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:31,930
you know I remember a meeting where

00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,790
Mozilla Creative Commons and and

00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:35,060
Wikipedia got together say like how do

00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:37,220
we do some joint campaigns

00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:39,730
joint fundraising and trying fundraising

00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:42,139
always a you know great place to start

00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:44,090
and you know they've been a number of

00:06:42,139 --> 00:06:47,330
other attempts at collaborating and in

00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:49,580
the past really there wasn't so much of

00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:51,950
a palpable purpose and so I think we've

00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:54,230
always recognized with different leaders

00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:57,050
even you know before I was in this world

00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:58,580
as illa that there's a common cause I

00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:00,080
think we have clumsily tried to figure

00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:01,880
out what to do about that common cause

00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:05,510
but that might be different now I don't

00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:07,550
know that was a queue for Brian yeah but

00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:12,080
to say the times are different the times

00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:15,020
have changed mark thanks for that that I

00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:17,840
think all of us are feeling an urgency

00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:19,639
that the way that the world has been

00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,530
shifting and I don't just mean the

00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:23,510
shifting political climate in the u.s.

00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:24,530
though all three of us work for US based

00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:27,380
organizations

00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:30,889
I think climates are shifting all over

00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:31,910
the world you have instability and you

00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:34,310
know challenges I've been following the

00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:36,919
election in Kenya and just thinking

00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:40,910
about the the need for knowledge the

00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:42,260
need for inclusion the need for the sort

00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:44,990
of power and potential of this movement

00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:46,520
as one of you know around collaboration

00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:48,080
and the power of it and what we've

00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:50,390
actually been able to already achieve

00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,950
together starts to make me say well what

00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:54,380
could we do if there were particular

00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:56,419
things we wanted to focus on where

00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:58,460
there's that alignment and overlap where

00:07:56,419 --> 00:07:59,900
we want to mobilize I'm just thinking

00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:01,370
about the last question there there are

00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:03,620
two answers to that because there are

00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:05,539
the ways the institutions have worked

00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:07,490
together but there's also the way that

00:08:05,539 --> 00:08:08,539
Mazzilli ins and Wikipedians and

00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:10,789
creative commoners have work together

00:08:08,539 --> 00:08:12,320
and like many of you have probably

00:08:10,789 --> 00:08:14,210
worked on those projects and found

00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,130
common ground to work on things that

00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:17,330
happens all the time

00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:19,340
informally so one of the other things I

00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,960
think about is what can we do to help

00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:23,240
those people and lift them up and

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,440
profile their work and talk about how

00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,419
that's a thing that we want to support

00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,770
more yeah that's exactly where I was

00:08:26,419 --> 00:08:29,300
gonna go with this is I think that it's

00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:30,889
nice for the three of us to sit on stage

00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,870
and talk about how we collaborate but

00:08:30,889 --> 00:08:34,360
the reality is that most of the most

00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:36,589
most of the really productive

00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:38,360
collaboration doesn't happen between the

00:08:36,589 --> 00:08:40,640
three of us we just sort of talking

00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:42,110
heads I think the really productive

00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,820
collaboration happens at the community

00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:45,500
level where you have people who have

00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:46,690
this like intersectional identity of

00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,790
being all of these

00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:51,070
and what they you know Ryan you talk

00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:52,630
about this a lot when people walk into

00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:54,370
the room they choose to have an identity

00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:56,530
but it doesn't mean that it negates the

00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:59,800
other identities of being a mozillian or

00:08:56,530 --> 00:09:02,170
being a creative commons or common sight

00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,820
comments what a commoner common area

00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:07,060
common create a common okay

00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:08,260
or being a Wicca median and I and I

00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:09,760
think that that's just sort of a really

00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:11,830
critical understanding but I would be

00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,180
remiss if I didn't note because someone

00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:15,070
informed me of this that apparently

00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:16,690
since we're sitting in the UK that all

00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:18,790
three of our organizations have made

00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:20,560
formal intensive collaboration and I

00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:25,720
think to Mark's point they have been a

00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:27,010
little clumsy I feel as though and I

00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,120
know that there's always opportunities

00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:30,190
say it's different this time but I think

00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:32,050
it is different this time in that we've

00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:33,370
all as organisations recently gone

00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:35,290
through processes of trying to

00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:37,150
understand our future and that is

00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:38,860
something that we perhaps did not have

00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:41,050
as a common point of reference in the

00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:42,970
past and what is interesting to me and

00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:44,680
it's perhaps not surprising because so

00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:46,540
many there is such overlap within the

00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:48,970
people who make up our movements is that

00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:50,890
those processes have centered or found

00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:53,470
themselves landing in very similar

00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:55,870
places which is a need for an urgency

00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:57,700
around growing our movements in it in a

00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:59,200
global sense not just the numbers sense

00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,910
but who are the people that were serving

00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,830
and that we're reaching protecting the

00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:05,320
values that made us who we are in the

00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:07,600
first place in order to achieve our

00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:09,250
mission and I think that that creates an

00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,170
opportunity for us in terms of alignment

00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:12,370
that perhaps in the past we were just

00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:15,400
like hey you're open you're you know

00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:16,720
you're cool like we work together now

00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,950
there's just so much clearer direction

00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,280
that we're all sort of travelling down

00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:23,950
the path of two of you have used the

00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:26,740
words urgency and so what are the

00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:30,250
biggest issues and most urgent issues to

00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:32,020
an open movement today I'll go I think

00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:34,600
that one of the challenges that I've

00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:37,500
really been grappling with lately is we

00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:40,060
serve the public good we are

00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:48,040
institutions that seek to provide

00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:50,920
services in the public interest we weep

00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:52,780
that - we're institutions that seek to

00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:54,820
provide services in the public interest

00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:56,230
we are public good institutions the

00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:58,800
medium through which we do our work is

00:10:56,230 --> 00:11:00,370
not a public medium it is a private

00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,650
infrastructure of

00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:04,089
the web and that is something that gives

00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:08,500
me a great amount of time it's really

00:11:04,089 --> 00:11:09,910
hard to watch this guy it's pretty funny

00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:13,060
but it's pretty distracting

00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:14,290
is this idea that we are trying to do

00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:17,800
our work through a medium that we do not

00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:19,450
own that is consolidated and has zero

00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:22,470
accountability to the public that we

00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:25,029
seek to serve and the values and sort of

00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:27,870
the objectives that we have within our

00:11:25,029 --> 00:11:30,940
respective organizations yeah I think

00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:32,830
certainly the the political economy and

00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:35,410
the control of the Internet I mean it

00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:37,000
was this sort of anarchist utopia in

00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:40,000
some sense when the people who founded

00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,529
these organizations got got going what

00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,839
they're doing and that's the roots of

00:11:41,529 --> 00:11:46,450
the free software movement in some sense

00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:48,250
of it you know ignore we don't need to

00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:49,750
worry about big business and government

00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:52,000
because you know we're just making this

00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:55,210
thing and that is not the world we live

00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,380
in now this is part of all of our lives

00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:57,970
you know half of humanity's on the

00:11:56,380 --> 00:12:00,250
internet that will only grow more

00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:03,550
pervasive and it's controlled by a very

00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:06,550
few companies or governments and so how

00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:08,589
we shape it as you know a movement and

00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:11,200
as organizations who were part of

00:12:08,589 --> 00:12:13,990
actually shaping it fairly freely and

00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:16,870
easily at a time when probably nobody

00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:19,330
was really watching it's a it's a pretty

00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:21,190
different thing and so it means that

00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:23,140
this is about a set of issues that are

00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:26,100
the traditional issues of political

00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:28,750
economy and control it's not just about

00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:31,360
picking up a keyboard and making what we

00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:34,000
want but that's head what the thing is

00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:36,160
the strength of this group you know

00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,450
these organizations is there is a

00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,589
history of picking up the keyboard and

00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:40,600
making what you want so I think not

00:12:38,589 --> 00:12:42,100
losing that knowing that we actually can

00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:44,050
build a particular future that's what

00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:47,680
Moz Fest is about but we certainly

00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:49,810
needed to do it you know in a way that

00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,310
has valves a much more diverse set of

00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:53,140
talents a much more diverse set of

00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:55,779
people a much more diverse set of

00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:56,770
geographical perspectives than where the

00:12:55,779 --> 00:12:58,930
free software movement and the

00:12:56,770 --> 00:13:02,680
open-source movement started like it is

00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:04,990
only possible by having something more

00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:07,390
diverse and probably not just in terms

00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:09,190
of perspectives and talents but also in

00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:10,200
terms of the resilience of being hard to

00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:17,010
shut down and being

00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:18,960
many places Mitchell Baker often says

00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:21,690
that you know the Internet is real life

00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:22,680
and this perception that this is you

00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:23,640
know this is the thing that we are

00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,170
building and we actually have the

00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:29,400
opportunity to shape this this is our

00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:31,890
new society online and and I think that

00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:35,700
that like I read that both as scary and

00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:37,170
as opportunity and I think about another

00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,850
thing that I remember her saying when I

00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:41,970
was at Mozilla talking about the way

00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:44,310
that open-source built expectation into

00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:46,620
the web this idea that if things were

00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:48,000
open and you could touch them and you

00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:50,040
would expect to be able to see the code

00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,620
when you would then go to things that

00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:54,810
were not open you would be disappointed

00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:57,090
by that and that that expectation is

00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:59,940
really powerful and I think that that's

00:13:57,090 --> 00:14:01,800
true more and more around content and

00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:03,360
knowledge and the way that we share

00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,280
things there's an expectation that we

00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,660
should have this stuff and I think

00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:08,160
there's a power to the way these

00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:09,690
organizations have done that work and

00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,360
the way these movements have fought for

00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:14,490
it that is creating this urgency we need

00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:16,290
information about climate change we need

00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:18,120
the knowledge I mean it's open access

00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:20,580
week so to talk about research and data

00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:23,340
and think about you know how do we get

00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:25,710
discovery and innovation and how do we

00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:28,380
unlock our investments like government

00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:30,180
investments that lead to discovery why

00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:33,600
how do those things belong to us how do

00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:35,760
we share them what can we do to unlock

00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,230
that so I think you know agree with all

00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,450
the points on the panel and also say

00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:42,360
like this feels like an urgent moment

00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:45,720
where we will miss the chance to advance

00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:47,970
our call out our kind of common cause if

00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:50,460
we don't rally around some opportunities

00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:53,160
in there so I'm gonna take it from that

00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:56,070
you said and I the Ekman I like the sort

00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:57,900
of expectation component of the way that

00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:59,340
the web was built that I I've been

00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:02,310
thinking a lot about the nostalgia that

00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:05,460
we bring to the web the three of us here

00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:08,130
on stage certainly maybe younger people

00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:09,270
only audience can speak to this but we

00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:11,070
bring a nostalgia to the web and we

00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:13,350
bring a sense that the web used to be

00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:15,420
this thing but people who are coming

00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:16,410
online today or young young people

00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,520
doesn't matter where you are it doesn't

00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:19,950
matter if you're like the next billion

00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:22,410
they have no sense of that expectation

00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:23,460
and so we talked about openness and yes

00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:25,200
people expect

00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:26,850
and they expect access but they're not

00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:29,130
expecting it in the debate that we

00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:31,260
define open this and so I worry that

00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:33,810
some of this urgency also comes you know

00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:35,730
you often feel urgent right before the

00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:38,310
end and I worry that some of this

00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:40,320
urgency may in fact come from the fact

00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:43,740
that we are aging out of a generation of

00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:45,240
expectation oh wait I think there's a I

00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:46,890
think we're in the opposite I think

00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:49,950
that's we're in that spot and the

00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:51,360
opposite spot and none of us interesting

00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:52,860
that I said really reacted the fact that

00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,170
Trump is so big on there you can talk

00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:56,670
and that Facebook is right there I mean

00:15:55,170 --> 00:16:01,110
I think there's both urgency in a

00:15:56,670 --> 00:16:04,890
palpable moment where it is everyday in

00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:06,720
the news that the the thing we have all

00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:08,580
helped build in some way is least the

00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,209
Internet and I probably most of us

00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:14,370
participated in participating you know

00:16:11,209 --> 00:16:17,279
centralized social media has turned into

00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:19,700
a battleground for very we're very weird

00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:22,950
that's also true a very weird and real

00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:25,500
political warfare and so you know we are

00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:26,779
I think Dana void tweeted a McLuhan

00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:29,400
quote that I'd never seen before

00:16:26,779 --> 00:16:31,770
today which is World War through three

00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:33,500
will happen in electronic communications

00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:37,560
and will evolve both citizens and

00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:41,670
governments and you know that is what

00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:44,490
we're in the middle of so that and the

00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:47,790
the reason I would kind of not think

00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:50,580
that we're aging out is that is palpable

00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:53,459
and on everyone's tongue so as I kind of

00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:55,110
walked into England and went past the

00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:57,240
borders I got 60 something-year-old

00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:59,520
border guard as I work for Mozilla

00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:01,560
there's no I'm glad you know you guys

00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,730
aren't Facebook and it's really bad and

00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:05,699
they're surveilling I said he just

00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:08,069
brought this up and this happens to me

00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:09,990
all the time now now he also felt

00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:11,640
incredibly powerless I said oh we're

00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:14,220
gonna fight it and we're you know as I

00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:16,589
can't do anything good so there is

00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:18,270
actually well I think we may be aging

00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:20,939
out in our perspective and I don't think

00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:23,400
we have the answer maybe somebody in

00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:24,959
this room does hopefully somebody in the

00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,970
mosque that's building does in terms of

00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:29,970
what he can do to take action

00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:31,350
we actually are at a moment where I

00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:34,020
think we can seize it because people

00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:35,190
actually want to act on this stuff and

00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:37,180
if people are wanting to act on this

00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:39,490
stuff and these issues are

00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:41,770
the threat has changed if you like and

00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:43,450
is it forcing any of you to or

00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:47,730
encouraging any of you to rethink your

00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:50,020
missions and I think all of us have been

00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:52,660
thinking through the ways in which we

00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:55,000
need to relate to the world so Cece has

00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:58,030
just gone through a significant process

00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,550
to re-evaluate the way our network works

00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:03,490
and built a strategy around that the

00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:04,990
movement strategy for Wikipedia is in

00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:06,970
the endorsement phase right now they've

00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:09,580
done tons and tons of work with their

00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:12,310
communities around doing that Mozilla

00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:14,890
just published a kind of addendum to the

00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:16,540
manifesto to start to express some of

00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:18,460
these additional values and to have that

00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:21,040
conversation so I think we're we're all

00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:23,320
pushing against these ideas you know for

00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:25,480
our part coming to terms that advocacy

00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:28,180
activism and the political nature of our

00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:30,490
work was part of our work that we don't

00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:32,470
just make an obscure legal license that

00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:33,970
people count on for a certain kind of

00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:35,740
content sharing that we're actually

00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:38,920
expressing a view of the world and the

00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:41,380
way it could and perhaps should be you

00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:43,450
know the the nature of whether or not

00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:45,910
Wikipedia is political or the work of

00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:47,290
openness is political which will

00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:50,410
surprise no one that I think that it is

00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:52,360
and many others do that that's that's a

00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:54,190
shift and to step squarely into that

00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:56,550
space I think in in some sense is pushed

00:18:54,190 --> 00:19:01,390
by this urgency because there's a need

00:18:56,550 --> 00:19:02,830
I'd say to act out more that that the

00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:04,810
things that we make that are valuable to

00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:06,280
the world don't necessarily speak for

00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:08,770
themselves that we may have to go

00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:11,470
further than that if we want to have the

00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:12,790
outcomes we care about so you've

00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:15,460
identified the issues we've identified

00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:18,040
the issues so so what can we make the

00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:22,600
greatest impact in solving these these

00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:25,900
issues wait I was gonna answer the last

00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:29,500
question sauce segue into this one which

00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:32,170
is I think one of the challenges part of

00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:35,020
thing is I don't think we have the

00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:35,560
answers of so we mobilize this political

00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:37,540
force

00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:39,520
you know we collectively the movement we

00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:41,290
use our audiences to be able to do that

00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,720
like what do we actually want to do

00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:46,300
right now and there are some things like

00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:47,680
yes get more people to use more

00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:49,930
encryption and change their passwords

00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:51,340
all the time there are things that are

00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:53,020
simple that we gonna ask people to do

00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:56,650
but really that is not going to stop

00:19:53,020 --> 00:20:00,130
Trump and so one of the things actually

00:19:56,650 --> 00:20:02,590
to do right now is actually slow down a

00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:04,090
little bit as things speed up and deal

00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:06,040
with some of the dilemmas that we're

00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:07,900
facing politically and actually figure

00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:09,610
out what are some different outcomes we

00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,840
want the one that I've been thinking a

00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:14,170
lot about and have a lot of

00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:16,120
conversations here is you know we come

00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:18,580
from the open source movement very much

00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:20,560
believing in openness and and free

00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:22,210
speech right the idea is this is a

00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:25,360
platform for people to express

00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:28,510
themselves to innovate we're now very

00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:32,050
clearly in a world Trump being a prime

00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:35,080
example where equality and inclusion and

00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:39,160
freedom of speech and openness really

00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:41,500
are at odds and the answer I think for

00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:43,900
us is not gonna be to just stick with

00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:46,060
the values we started with of just

00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:47,920
freedom and openness and privacy and

00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:50,620
anonymity I have to deal with that

00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:51,280
tension and come up with action that

00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:53,470
respects that

00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:55,120
and it's why Mitchell's looking at she's

00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:56,650
running a session tomorrow a plug on

00:20:55,120 --> 00:21:00,330
what's called the Mozilla worldview

00:20:56,650 --> 00:21:02,590
looking at adding things like inclusive

00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:05,680
society that involves and invites

00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:07,330
everyone into the manifesto because just

00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:10,390
the original values around openness are

00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:12,100
not enough to build a digital world that

00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:14,140
actually does include and welcome all of

00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:16,060
us in fact it's it's going in very much

00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:19,450
the opposite direction so I think some

00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:21,490
of us have we can do to maybe have an

00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:24,280
impact in 10 years is slow down and have

00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:27,340
really kind but critical conversations

00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:29,080
right now about what to do to carry

00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:31,060
forward our values in the context of

00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:32,530
those tensions and dilemmas yeah I mean

00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:34,660
we just went through this process at

00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:35,710
Wikipedia and Wikimedia and the

00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:37,360
community and we're broadly around

00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:40,360
thinking about where do we want to be by

00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,920
2030 and I can you know the answers are

00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:45,220
sort of I think speak to what Mark just

00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:47,680
said around we actually started talking

00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:49,090
about equity as a major value of ours

00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,560
and I think that what's interesting and

00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:52,840
it's or speaks to Ryan's point is that

00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:54,220
we can media for us the vision statement

00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,660
is a world in which every single human

00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:58,450
can freely share in the sum of all

00:21:55,660 --> 00:22:01,210
knowledge so that implied equity as a

00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:02,650
value is in there it's a world-changing

00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:04,960
vision it says nothing about

00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:06,280
and encyclopedia but you know and I

00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,350
think that we were quite radical when we

00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:09,640
started and in some sense and embrace

00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:11,590
that radicalness and then we got

00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:13,570
comfortable and now I think we have to

00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:16,060
be radical again if we're going to get

00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:19,210
anywhere near what that sort of been

00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:20,650
that call is for us to achieve but what

00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:22,390
I would say is in is really I've been

00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:25,300
thinking a lot about investing in people

00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:27,460
people are tired right we live in this

00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:29,560
you just saw the word cloud it's

00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:32,560
distressing it's disturbing we feel

00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:35,460
disempowered to the pure border guard we

00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:39,010
live in the state of constant sort of

00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:42,820
animation and arousal around the fear

00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:46,060
that there's sort of ongoing threat on

00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:48,430
this ongoing threat to our values and

00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:50,940
that is a really hard place for people

00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:54,450
to be and I think that providing

00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:57,280
additional resources to our communities

00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:59,530
investing in what people need practicing

00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:01,330
self-care is actually going to be one of

00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:02,620
the most important things that we can do

00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:03,850
if we're going to be able to

00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:05,320
successfully move into the future

00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:06,280
because this is a really difficult time

00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,300
that we're going through and I think

00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:09,010
it's something that we need to

00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:10,060
acknowledge and then I would also say

00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:13,390
and I know it's already come up in the

00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:14,650
world world cloud word cloud just we

00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:16,480
really need to invest in being more

00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:18,250
inclusive communities and we really need

00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,870
to invest in better representation from

00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:21,880
all different walks of life all

00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:23,470
different lived experiences it's

00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,580
ridiculous to me on some level that the

00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:26,740
three of us are all from North America

00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:31,870
sitting up here telling anybody what a

00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:34,210
global movement needs to be just quickly

00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:36,120
I'll say that this sort of foundational

00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:41,290
piece that you talked about mark seems

00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:44,350
kind of vital the previous speaker and

00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:46,360
then the presentation before that was

00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:48,940
talking about there was a question from

00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:50,320
the floor about the sort of I'm

00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:51,490
paraphrasing because the person didn't

00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,920
use this word but the privilege of

00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:55,840
working in the open and thinking about

00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:57,940
how many people are here and they do

00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,110
this on their own time how many people

00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:00,430
don't have the privilege of working in

00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:02,080
an organization that allows them to

00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:05,470
share their code openly or their content

00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:07,570
openly and how many people spend their

00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:09,730
own money to be here

00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:10,870
you know that that's a privilege and

00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:12,550
that there are many many more people

00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:15,130
that we need in this conversation and we

00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:17,740
don't have systems of funding or systems

00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:19,990
of of support that enable that or even

00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:21,820
acknowledge that and often even as

00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:23,620
simple as hiring for years and years

00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:26,380
every job posting I would put out with

00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:28,360
say experience in the open movement and

00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:29,920
I would we've taken that off because I

00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:32,530
can teach somebody to work openly in

00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:35,110
about an hour yes those are values that

00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:36,490
you build over time but I can't there

00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:38,410
are lots of things you want to hire for

00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:40,090
but I'm excluding all those people that

00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:41,140
would love to work in this movement but

00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:42,580
don't have that privilege because

00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:45,130
they've never been in an environment

00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:46,840
there so I think we got to get at the

00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:49,300
root of those values about what we mean

00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:51,760
by inclusion about who's missing from

00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:54,100
these conversations and then what do we

00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:57,490
do to bring them in and actively do

00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:59,170
those things which will also mean those

00:24:57,490 --> 00:25:01,410
of us with power will have less when

00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:04,180
it's over and those of us with with

00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:05,440
profile will have less when it's over

00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:06,880
and I think that's those are

00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,140
uncomfortable things to do but I think

00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,330
we've got to get to the root of that

00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:13,180
stuff before we start going forward

00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:16,810
again someone asked me the other day one

00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:18,100
of our comedians who's involved in our

00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:20,350
afro crowd project which is about

00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:21,850
writing African history into Wikipedia

00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:24,040
what are we doing to prepare our

00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:25,360
movements for change and I realized I

00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:27,280
didn't have a good answer for that I

00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:29,740
think we all are sort of in alignment

00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:31,270
now about where we want to go and who we

00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:33,430
want to be in the values that we have

00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:34,510
but I don't know what we need to do to

00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:36,250
prepare for that change because that

00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:39,280
change is going to be disruptive and it

00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:42,820
does I think it it's threatening to

00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:44,260
those with power and for us to get

00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:46,270
through that in a way that we are

00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:51,060
stronger on the other side and don't

00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:51,060
fall into the sort of fractures and

00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:56,350
dissonance that I think could occur I

00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:57,370
don't have an answer and I'm curious if

00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:59,200
either of you have really thought about

00:25:57,370 --> 00:26:01,510
how do you prepare a movement for change

00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,920
not just well what is the change that we

00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:06,250
need to see but how do we make sure we

00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:07,840
can do we as a movement are capable of

00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:11,530
doing that in a way that we come out on

00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:12,340
the other side Pole I was thinking as

00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:13,930
you were saying that I was thinking

00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:16,420
about Darren Walker he's the president

00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:17,390
the Ford Foundation's posted about moral

00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:19,160
courage

00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:21,080
and calling for the need for moral

00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:23,060
courage in America in that context but

00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:25,010
in some ways it's not just prepared for

00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:27,170
change to sort of gird yourself for

00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:28,610
change to be kind of resilient in the

00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:31,220
face of things that are going to be hard

00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:34,430
and are going to be painful and

00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:36,770
disruptive you know how do you how do we

00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:38,630
have those conversations especially you

00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:39,800
know Trump looms large in part because

00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:43,190
many of the things we thought were our

00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:45,530
values we feel challenged that maybe

00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:47,810
they weren't maybe our values maybe

00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:50,810
maybe they were some of our values but

00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:52,520
this idea of maybe equality wasn't isn't

00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:54,770
a value that's shared by everybody maybe

00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:56,570
the idea that poverty is a bad thing

00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:58,250
that some people shouldn't be poor is

00:26:56,570 --> 00:26:59,900
maybe not such a bad thing in the view

00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:01,070
of some people and what does it feel

00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:02,420
like to live in a world where you might

00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:04,030
be surrounded by those people they might

00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:06,500
be your neighbors or coworkers and

00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:10,400
that's that's that kind of assault that

00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:11,720
you're talking about so I think to go

00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,000
all the way back to your earlier point

00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:15,530
well he's a Nicias often come from

00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,900
communities I think one of the things

00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:19,610
leaders can do is declare values that

00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:21,260
they hear from their communities to say

00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:23,690
this is what I have heard and so one of

00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:26,450
the things that I try to do and I've

00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:28,910
seen each of you do is is say what we

00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:31,430
value because there's actually a lot of

00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:33,380
import in just saying it and having

00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:35,660
people hear it and play it back to you

00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:37,970
and say yes that's me too so that we

00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:39,470
actually do know what we all value and

00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:40,880
then we can decide how we want to work

00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:43,580
together and it's never felt more

00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:45,770
important to do that than it has in the

00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:47,480
last couple of years and so I think that

00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:49,490
is important work for us to do it's very

00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:51,440
foundational as you said work and it's

00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:53,690
just because I it's all the comment and

00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:55,880
it's not just about Trump right no I was

00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:57,260
just in Cairo with our Arabic with

00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:58,310
comedians and they're not talking about

00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:00,980
Donald Trump they're talking about the

00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:02,390
very real realities of what's happening

00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:04,130
in their countries and I was in Warsaw

00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:05,840
with our Eastern European with comedians

00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:08,150
and they're going you know we have

00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:10,100
political pressures across our entire

00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:11,600
region that have nothing to do with

00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:13,190
Donald Trump right this is something

00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,960
that is is a global thing and I just

00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:16,490
it's not acknowledged that I'm nothing

00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,500
that you weren't acknowledging that but

00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:21,680
I felt like it was important to state

00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:24,530
right I very much it's a global thing

00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:27,860
and it's not about trauma I think the

00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:29,309
thing that is true globally is the

00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:31,529
values that

00:28:29,309 --> 00:28:33,929
to underpin these movements what you do

00:28:31,529 --> 00:28:35,190
actually show up you know as you travel

00:28:33,929 --> 00:28:38,100
around the world you see say free

00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:40,169
software conferences in Asia and Latin

00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:42,299
America and in lots of I'm sure it feels

00:28:40,169 --> 00:28:43,620
the same in a Wikipedia movement

00:28:42,299 --> 00:28:47,370
different in different places but there

00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:48,600
is a historical set of values one of the

00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:50,279
things is certainly to restate those

00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,720
values but the other is the question of

00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:54,749
them and that's what Mitchell's trying

00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:56,940
to do with this will view peace is the

00:28:54,749 --> 00:28:59,580
other thing is if we want more diverse

00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:01,409
leadership we need to describe that

00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:03,090
which hasn't actually been put out has

00:29:01,409 --> 00:29:05,340
been raised you know it here a bunch of

00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:06,299
times as a value of the organization and

00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:08,840
then do it and hold ourselves

00:29:06,299 --> 00:29:11,879
accountable and I don't think you know

00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:13,769
something we don't have the plan to do

00:29:11,879 --> 00:29:16,769
that we have a statement of that as a

00:29:13,769 --> 00:29:18,960
value we have a commitment to growing it

00:29:16,769 --> 00:29:20,700
but it is actually going to be something

00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:27,720
we need to push ourselves and be held

00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:30,269
accountable for I'm curious when for the

00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:32,399
hope panel when would it be ready for

00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:35,490
you to step aside I mean I think about

00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:37,740
this a lot when I step aside who do I

00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:39,600
want who do I hope for places me and

00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:41,879
when will it be time for me to step

00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,889
aside and I know that that time will

00:29:41,879 --> 00:29:45,480
come sooner than I think and I hope that

00:29:43,889 --> 00:29:46,619
it does because I actually think that

00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:50,220
means that the movements in a really

00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:52,110
healthy place yeah I think certainly ask

00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:55,649
that question by myself and and also

00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:57,119
about Mozilla and you know that's a

00:29:55,649 --> 00:29:59,730
little bit about being the the

00:29:57,119 --> 00:30:01,860
organization's who have been here for a

00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:03,450
long time and so whether Mozilla evolves

00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:06,899
into something different or other things

00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:09,029
come up certainly you know a big piece

00:30:06,899 --> 00:30:12,090
of it looking at Mozilla's history and

00:30:09,029 --> 00:30:15,869
present you know certainly it's not just

00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:17,669
a one piece is going to be as we have

00:30:15,869 --> 00:30:20,100
leaders in other parts of the world that

00:30:17,669 --> 00:30:23,460
have real decision-making power and real

00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:25,499
resources so that's a big part of what

00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:28,289
we're focused on right now is making

00:30:25,499 --> 00:30:29,490
sure that it isn't California that is at

00:30:28,289 --> 00:30:32,990
the center of this I think you've got a

00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:36,929
deeper history in that but you know

00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:39,840
California is part of the problem and

00:30:36,929 --> 00:30:41,080
having and building and investing in

00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,990
leadership

00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:46,900
from a lot of different places is a key

00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:50,650
piece and as it happens that creates the

00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:52,060
space really to step back I think that

00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:53,980
both of your organizations have done a

00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:56,800
really phenomenal job of that stepping

00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:59,650
away from a centralized organization and

00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:03,250
I look around for us and I recognize it

00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:03,730
no okay well from the outside nope how

00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:06,430
about that

00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:07,960
I'll give you working on it okay I mean

00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:09,640
I think about the fact that the sort of

00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:11,830
expression of one one person's remote

00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:14,980
everyone's remote that to me comes from

00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:16,660
a Mozilla perspective I think from our

00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:18,580
organization I look at us now and I go

00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:20,290
gosh we're more distributed than we are

00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:22,810
centralized and let's how do we step

00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:25,890
into that as an opportunity space so

00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:28,150
that we can reduce the centricity of

00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:29,050
California as the problem well

00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:32,440
recognizing their very real

00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:34,120
jurisdictional issues for us I think

00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:35,830
planning for succession is something

00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:37,450
I've been thinking about more and more

00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:41,620
and also not because I'm leaving but

00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:44,320
because I want to imagine CC as a 20 or

00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:46,180
a 30 or a 50 year organization which I'm

00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,890
not gonna be here that long

00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:49,750
and so how do we do that and who should

00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:51,460
be in those roles where do we find those

00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:53,170
people and what kind of even what kind

00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:55,270
of organization do we have to be to be

00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:57,100
able to hire those people so Creative

00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:58,900
Commons became fully virtual we closed

00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:01,600
our Mountain View office a couple of

00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:04,930
years ago you know our last two hires

00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:06,430
were Boston Chile Kenya we've never had

00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:10,270
the capacity to hire that way before

00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:11,500
and to send a message to our community

00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:13,540
and people who want to work with us that

00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:15,940
we can hire them wherever they are and

00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:18,940
we know how to work that way and it's

00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:22,240
been hard to learn that we're certainly

00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:24,250
not there yet but that that seems to me

00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,960
foundational and making that kind of a

00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:28,330
chef we're also trying to step aside and

00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:30,400
let I think for the Wikimedia Foundation

00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:32,350
trying I've been thinking a lot about

00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:33,700
how does the foundation itself recognize

00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:37,270
that we are just one part of the puzzle

00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:40,270
and create more space for our affiliates

00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:44,470
and other organizations to have co-equal

00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:45,790
leadership it's been really interesting

00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:47,020
to see how that works in practice and

00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:48,490
what the sort of structural resistance

00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:50,770
is but I feel like that's another

00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:53,510
essential part of it yeah

00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:55,610
the affiliate I don't need to join in so

00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:57,890
he wants to he's got questions or wants

00:32:55,610 --> 00:33:02,230
to pick up on a thread of something that

00:32:57,890 --> 00:33:02,230
somebody on the on the panel has said

00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:17,360
sorry the three people on the platform

00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:20,540
represent for me probably the most

00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:23,090
prominent activists in this war and I

00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:25,270
agree to war if I were on the other side

00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:34,100
what I would try and do is neutralize

00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:36,170
the people here and I have no doubt

00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:38,390
people thinking of doing it at the

00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:41,510
moment who else is there in the fight

00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:44,270
how do you bring together a wider

00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:47,930
community to act as if you like a single

00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:52,030
political focus which is robust you know

00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:58,160
to attack from the forces of darkness I

00:33:52,030 --> 00:34:01,670
love your DMR I mean I would actually

00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:04,550
say there's 1500 of the most important

00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:06,950
activists on this issue in this building

00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:09,380
and and there are many many tens of

00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:13,700
thousands of them around the world and

00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:15,320
you know it I'm more optimistic possibly

00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:17,360
than you in that we can actually build

00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:20,060
something but I think we do have to look

00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:24,050
at there's a potential if we as we stand

00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:26,660
up more strongly that you know we're not

00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:29,840
us but all of us gonna get a lot more

00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:32,720
pushback or worse and one of the things

00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:35,660
that I think is critical is that there

00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:37,970
is more leadership more authority more

00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:42,290
resources spread out in more different

00:34:37,970 --> 00:34:44,380
places so decentralization of what this

00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:46,730
movement is which which will happen

00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:48,500
naturally on some level but I think we

00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:50,990
also need to look at how we resource for

00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:53,990
it and it's a reason that investing in

00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:55,970
fellows and people who are kind of in

00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:57,680
lots of places around the world is key

00:34:55,970 --> 00:34:59,720
it's the reason we're trying to create a

00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:02,090
stage for the set of people who you see

00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:03,350
on stage here it's a reason that we

00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:05,720
really looked at

00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:08,570
a much broader scope of people in

00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:10,880
sessions here is because it is about

00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:13,400
creating leadership everywhere because

00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:15,590
frankly it's the you know the only way

00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:17,420
to not get shut down this idea of

00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:21,710
openness as a strategic imperative not

00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:23,360
just a set of values I mean to your

00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:25,550
point Peter I think part of it is

00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:28,880
deciding that that's that's what we're

00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:30,950
doing like deciding that that this work

00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:34,400
is political that we have that it that

00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:36,260
sometimes it is a fight and and doing

00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,580
that intentionally you know there there

00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:39,560
have been times in each of our orgs

00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:42,500
where we were just an encyclopedia just

00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:44,750
a set of licenses just a browser and I

00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:47,390
think having that conversation has

00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:48,830
actually been part of the first part and

00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:51,140
then the second piece for me is

00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:53,810
essential is that we are only as

00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:55,910
powerful as we are together that we are

00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:57,950
never the best funded that we are not

00:35:55,910 --> 00:36:00,020
the most influential that we don't have

00:35:57,950 --> 00:36:04,640
the best lobbyists or lawyers that on

00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:11,300
just straight up my sorry we don't have

00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:13,400
the most wealth oh sorry Louis I didn't

00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:17,030
mean to knock you there that's not what

00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:18,650
I meant a third-rate lobbyists we have a

00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:21,680
delightful obvious I didn't mean it that

00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:23,810
way it in any room we are generally

00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:26,450
outgunned other than you know intellect

00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:28,610
and passion and that our greatest power

00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:30,290
is when we are all together the hardest

00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:32,870
part of that is we have to all get

00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:35,660
together and we haven't done that yet

00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:36,860
and so the part you know part of the

00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:38,840
reason we wanted to start this why this

00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:42,560
thing we call the big open which is a

00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:46,310
term we got from Nikola Burr that we've

00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:48,110
sort of fallen for is that we need to

00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:50,930
actually decide to do a thing together

00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:52,850
that whatever that thing may be and I

00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:55,610
think maybe that's a nice chance to plug

00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:57,710
the session that's tomorrow which is for

00:36:55,610 --> 00:37:00,020
more of you and less of us to talk to

00:36:57,710 --> 00:37:02,450
say what should we do together where are

00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:04,640
the places where we can all march

00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:07,220
together and in politics I used to say

00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:09,530
to politicians find a parade and stand

00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:11,720
in front of it and so what is the parade

00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:13,520
that we want to build together that

00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:14,740
marches towards the thing the kind of

00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,960
feature we want

00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:19,030
so that we can bring others to that to

00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:21,460
that movement I may just add I actually

00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:23,680
would welcome a little more attention

00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:25,240
right I would welcome a moment in which

00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,890
we're successful enough that we are

00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:28,510
under attack because that means we're

00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:30,190
succeeding one of the biggest

00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:32,260
frustrations that I think I have is that

00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:35,290
very often we're not even invited into

00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:37,480
the room right and so you know if that

00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:39,100
means bring it on a little bit I'm

00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:40,600
willing to take that I think that that

00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:42,640
actually means that that's an

00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:44,320
opportunity if someone's yelling at you

00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:46,060
that is an opportunity for you to share

00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:48,790
that message right back as to where you

00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:52,000
want to go and what you want to do great

00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:53,230
well on that I suggest that you do join

00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,270
the conversation continue the

00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:57,460
conversation the big open tomorrow at

00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:59,740
11:00 that's also at the same time that

00:37:57,460 --> 00:38:02,110
these speaker the discussions are

00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:04,240
starting again tomorrow morning don't

00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:06,610
forget the time change but and let's

00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:09,360
thank mark Katherine and Ryan I heard

00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:09,360
