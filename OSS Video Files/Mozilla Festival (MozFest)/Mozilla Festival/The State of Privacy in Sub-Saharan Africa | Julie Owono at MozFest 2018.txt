um alright so we have in this afternoon

00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:08,519
session which does not belong to another

00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:13,980
hour or so we have a talk and then a

00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:16,379
panel the talk will be Julie overlay who

00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:18,210
is the executive director of Internet

00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:21,449
Without Borders and if you were here

00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:22,560
this morning listening to Amber's a few

00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:24,990
things I'm not talked about which I

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,570
think Judy's tying that conversation

00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:29,939
forward especially to do with data

00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:32,610
protection and privacy in parts of the

00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:36,510
world where regulation isn't as robust

00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:40,200
as it is here or indeed in other bigger

00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:42,590
richer countries so with that Julie it's

00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,590
all yours

00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:45,690
[Music]

00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:53,969
hello everyone I'm very happy to be here

00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:58,649
this is my first most wet so these of

00:00:53,969 --> 00:01:01,559
the week I am sure and thanks for coming

00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:04,619
and also thank you to those who are will

00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:08,820
be watching so today I'm going to make a

00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:12,960
case for a more robust privacy and data

00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:16,350
protection in in Africa why is that it's

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:19,049
because when we talk about the Internet

00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:23,189
today we talk about connecting the next

00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:25,580
billion billions and most part of these

00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:29,880
billions are located on this continent

00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:32,939
which is potentially which has

00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:37,560
potentially said 1 billion Internet

00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:41,189
users so then what we've been observing

00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:44,670
is that we mostly talk about market so

00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:47,460
having those products being used by a

00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:51,810
lot of citizens and users in these in

00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:54,590
this region but we don't we don't we

00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:58,229
don't talk a lot about piracy the

00:01:54,590 --> 00:02:00,270
liberalizing the principles and human

00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:04,470
rights that should underlied the cyber

00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:08,970
development everywhere in the world so

00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:12,660
consequence there seems to be a split

00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:15,060
between two worlds and specifically in

00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:17,430
terms of internet development what are

00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:20,580
these two worlds on the one hand you

00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:23,790
have a world where an Internet world

00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:24,960
where privacy is really at the heart of

00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:28,560
all the preoccupation

00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:30,270
you all remember on May 25th or around

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,160
when we all receive those emails making

00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:35,520
sure that we consent to receive

00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:38,160
information from X&Y surveys platform

00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:41,700
well this is a world that was made

00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:43,470
possible with the European Union and the

00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:46,740
adoption of the general beta protection

00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:49,200
regulation which considered as one of

00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:52,770
the best regulation existing on the

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,959
issue of privacy protection today such a

00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:57,060
good protection that it also inspires

00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,490
the rest of the world and particularly

00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:01,860
parts of the world where the world of

00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:04,500
the very world world of regulation is

00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:06,240
not agreed upon by everyone and I'm

00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,890
thinking specifically of the United

00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,840
States where market related regulation

00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:12,330
and specifically in that regulation is

00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,030
still a matter of debate you are you've

00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:17,700
probably all seen that this week Tim

00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:20,160
Cook Apple CEO called for more robust

00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:22,230
privacy protection including in the

00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:26,010
United State with the US federal law on

00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:29,340
the matter so you have on the one hand

00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:32,730
this world and on the other hand you

00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:36,090
have the rest of the world including as

00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:39,000
I was saying Africa there here's a map a

00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:42,000
great map that was gathered by friends

00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,790
at article 19 which shows on the

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,820
continent what governments have enacted

00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:50,850
data protection laws what governments

00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:53,250
what countries are currently discussing

00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:57,690
a bill and what countries do not have

00:03:53,250 --> 00:04:00,600
data protection at all though on this

00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:04,049
map you can see that out of 55 African

00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:06,420
states only 24 have enacted a data

00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:10,950
privacy law and 15 are currently

00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:13,080
discussing adopting such legislation 24

00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:15,599
is a good number but it's not enough and

00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:18,239
we it should be specified that out of

00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:20,280
this fit 1224 countries

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:23,330
if you look at the legislation that are

00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:25,770
applied most of them are inspired from

00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:29,160
regulations that were put out together

00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:31,680
something like 30 years ago in the 70s

00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:34,530
where obviously the data economy did not

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:37,710
look at all like the one we are seeing

00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:40,169
today so these texts normally need to be

00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:44,370
updated but that's a matter for another

00:04:40,169 --> 00:04:47,280
debate and this has consequences this

00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:51,449
dichotomy these two worlds have indeed

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:53,789
consequences so we live in an

00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:56,280
interconnected world with interconnected

00:04:53,789 --> 00:04:58,289
consequence and on that I'm thinking

00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:01,830
specifically I will mention specifically

00:04:58,289 --> 00:05:05,460
the issue of civilians ironically if you

00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:08,880
put a map of governments in Africa using

00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:11,669
surveillance tools it was more or less

00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:15,020
correspond to the map where data

00:05:11,669 --> 00:05:17,669
protection is more or less existing and

00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:19,560
this has serious consequences so these

00:05:17,669 --> 00:05:23,010
government's do not hesitate to use

00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:24,990
surveillance products to repress their

00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:28,500
populations and make sure to maintain

00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:30,570
their repressive regimes of power but

00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:33,270
not only governments use civilians also

00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:38,370
companies are very famous for harnessing

00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:40,950
the data to influence policy and we all

00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:43,410
remember how we woke up into in shock at

00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:47,030
the beginning of this year when we

00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:51,570
learned that original integrand had

00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:53,090
influence has used data from various

00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:55,979
social networks in specifically Facebook

00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:58,349
to influence the presidential election

00:05:55,979 --> 00:06:02,370
in the US and the rest of debate in the

00:05:58,349 --> 00:06:05,760
UK but what was even more surprising was

00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:08,099
to learn that already in 2015 that same

00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:12,210
company was already testing its product

00:06:08,099 --> 00:06:13,710
on in a country like Nigeria which still

00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:18,419
doesn't have a data protection law

00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:20,370
though obviously the company used all

00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:25,300
the data that were available try to

00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:28,449
influence the outcome vote so we see

00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:31,479
the interconnectedness and I'm talking

00:06:28,449 --> 00:06:33,099
about this because of course governments

00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:35,500
are primarily responsible for this

00:06:33,099 --> 00:06:38,770
situation they are responsible for

00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:40,599
adopting the needed regulations and

00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:43,000
setting the right boundaries to protect

00:06:40,599 --> 00:06:45,759
the data of their citizens but they are

00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,490
not the only ones companies of course

00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:51,669
also have a responsibility and it's not

00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:53,590
me saying this it's actually from a

00:06:51,669 --> 00:06:57,909
resolution that was adopted by the

00:06:53,590 --> 00:07:00,219
United Nations in 2011 which endorses

00:06:57,909 --> 00:07:02,440
what is what are known as the UN guiding

00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:05,469
principles on business and human rights

00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:07,780
and these principles are grounded on the

00:07:05,469 --> 00:07:10,509
idea that indeed the primary responsible

00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:12,969
for in ensuring that human rights are

00:07:10,509 --> 00:07:15,940
respected and protected are at the

00:07:12,969 --> 00:07:18,340
government's but companies also have a

00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:19,840
responsibility to respect these rights

00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:22,659
and by them and protect them

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,449
and I'm saying this based on the

00:07:22,659 --> 00:07:26,830
principle number nine which is the

00:07:24,449 --> 00:07:29,080
fundamental principle which is tied to

00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:31,330
companies according to these guiding

00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:33,490
principles and this principle says that

00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:35,229
business enterprises should respect

00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:37,719
human right and they should avoid

00:07:35,229 --> 00:07:41,020
infringing on the human rights of others

00:07:37,719 --> 00:07:43,389
and they should address adverse human

00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:48,219
right impact of their activities or

00:07:43,389 --> 00:07:50,380
their products so you might say okay if

00:07:48,219 --> 00:07:54,969
the UN they have so many tags from a

00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:59,080
resolution nobody here no people do care

00:07:54,969 --> 00:08:02,770
and I'm thinking particularly about a

00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:05,229
great project which is called the

00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:08,050
ranking digital Rights Project but I'll

00:08:05,229 --> 00:08:11,349
tell you more about it it's a it's a

00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:14,050
project team that every year ranks

00:08:11,349 --> 00:08:16,090
companies depending on their commitments

00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:18,759
and are there practices to protect

00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:22,419
freedom of expression and privacy of

00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:24,909
their users so as you see it so it's not

00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:27,210
only internet companies such as Facebook

00:08:24,909 --> 00:08:29,590
Google Twitter but it's also

00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:32,260
telecommunications operators successful

00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:35,800
halls are Vodafone which is more known

00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:38,779
here and when I was first told about

00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:42,860
this this index

00:08:38,779 --> 00:08:45,199
in 2015 I was amazed by the the ambition

00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:48,980
of course which is at the end of the day

00:08:45,199 --> 00:08:51,740
making sure that companies operating on

00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:54,769
the Internet have a social

00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:56,600
responsibility and respect human rights

00:08:54,769 --> 00:08:59,209
of their users difficulty free

00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:03,139
expression and priority but I also

00:08:59,209 --> 00:09:05,480
immediately wondered hmm what if it

00:09:03,139 --> 00:09:08,779
would be interesting to compare this map

00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:11,449
this ranking so of these companies of

00:09:08,779 --> 00:09:13,999
how they perform in certain markets and

00:09:11,449 --> 00:09:15,889
specifically in their native markets I'm

00:09:13,999 --> 00:09:18,139
thinking for instance of a house which

00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:20,809
is er a French company or a Vodafone

00:09:18,139 --> 00:09:24,709
which is a would be interesting to

00:09:20,809 --> 00:09:27,319
compare their ranking with the ranking

00:09:24,709 --> 00:09:29,360
of their subsidiaries and ranking of

00:09:27,319 --> 00:09:32,660
their activities elsewhere in the world

00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:37,129
and particularly in sub-saharan Africa

00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:39,620
and to do that we ask the ranking

00:09:37,129 --> 00:09:41,120
digitalwrite theme and also the support

00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:44,360
of access now which is also in another

00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:46,970
super great digital rights organization

00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:50,350
to help us do this research which is

00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:53,329
called it the rights of South Africa so

00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:56,389
to do this research what we thought was

00:09:53,329 --> 00:09:59,180
ok when it will be difficult to make an

00:09:56,389 --> 00:10:01,750
assessment for all the 50 55 states

00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:04,660
but what we'll do is that will take the

00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:08,480
modal's basically in terms of democracy

00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:11,089
terms of political stability and also in

00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,519
terms of language as you know in Africa

00:10:11,089 --> 00:10:17,180
there many countries speaking English

00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:18,649
French Portuguese Spanish and apparently

00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:20,449
there's are there are certain

00:10:18,649 --> 00:10:22,850
consequences political consequences to

00:10:20,449 --> 00:10:24,470
that in the form of the relationship

00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:27,379
between governments and their citizens

00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:28,970
so we chose one francophone country and

00:10:27,379 --> 00:10:30,860
one english-speaking one so the

00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:33,319
francophone one is Senegal in West

00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:39,160
Africa and the english-speaking one is

00:10:33,319 --> 00:10:41,209
Kenya and we focused on two companies

00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:43,550
telecommunications in particular because

00:10:41,209 --> 00:10:46,459
they have very important influence and

00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:48,679
they are also leading they're leading

00:10:46,459 --> 00:10:51,529
their respective markets so these two

00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:54,680
companies are the subsidiary of the

00:10:51,529 --> 00:11:00,259
all spinning l and the subsidiary of

00:10:54,680 --> 00:11:05,420
Buddha phone which is Safaricom and what

00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:08,300
we found was enlightening I would say we

00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:11,480
found that there was indeed a severe

00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:13,579
dichotomy between the way that these

00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:17,540
companies behave when they are operating

00:11:13,579 --> 00:11:19,850
here and the way that they behave when

00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:23,269
it comes to privacy and they operate in

00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:26,089
those two markets and I'll give two

00:11:23,269 --> 00:11:28,279
examples in the case of or also to

00:11:26,089 --> 00:11:30,079
explain rapidly the ranking digitalwrite

00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:32,480
methodology is based on a set of

00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:34,970
indicators and you have to assess for

00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,370
the company whether the company respects

00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:39,529
or not these indicators but one of the

00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:42,889
indicators is related to the

00:11:39,529 --> 00:11:45,499
accessibility of privacy policies of the

00:11:42,889 --> 00:11:47,809
company so in the case of a washing they

00:11:45,499 --> 00:11:49,699
got what was interesting is that when

00:11:47,809 --> 00:11:51,800
you go to their website there is no

00:11:49,699 --> 00:11:55,100
privacy policy you don't know what

00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:57,949
happens with your privacy when you use

00:11:55,100 --> 00:12:00,920
their services and in the case of

00:11:57,949 --> 00:12:03,290
Safaricom while the privacy policies

00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:07,730
were accessible either on the website or

00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:10,100
also in the contract sign the user the

00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:13,040
privacy policy was very vague you need

00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:15,920
two terms did not tell you precisely who

00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:18,559
your data are shared with who has access

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:21,050
to them what are the measures that the

00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:23,509
the company is taking to ensure that the

00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:26,089
data are stored in a very secured way

00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:27,970
and this has obviously consequences in

00:12:26,089 --> 00:12:31,160
the case of ohon's when we did our

00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:32,930
investigations we were we received many

00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:34,309
testimonies from users who said who

00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:36,709
complain about the fact that they

00:12:34,309 --> 00:12:39,170
receive unsolicited SMS is from

00:12:36,709 --> 00:12:42,279
companies that they didn't know never

00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:45,889
knew they had share that data with and

00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:47,990
in the case of Safaricom which is very

00:12:45,889 --> 00:12:49,160
interesting we worked with a local

00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:52,129
organization called the International

00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:54,139
Association of for women in the radio

00:12:52,129 --> 00:12:55,870
and TV who helped us view our infant

00:12:54,139 --> 00:12:58,819
investigations and these women

00:12:55,870 --> 00:13:00,769
particularly focused on the harms that

00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:01,670
are caused to women gender-based

00:13:00,769 --> 00:13:04,180
violence

00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:06,160
using telecommunication tools

00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:08,800
the case of Safaricom they had made an

00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,270
investigation and found out that women

00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,180
some women were complaining that their

00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:16,660
data had been accessed by a former vite

00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:19,060
I mean a violent former companions how

00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:19,840
is that possible well as possible

00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:22,060
depends well

00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:25,570
piracy is not in a protected Kenya does

00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:27,850
that have data privacy privacy law for

00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:30,100
now and in the case of Senegal while the

00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:32,200
data privacy law exists the problem is

00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:35,230
that the data of thority does not have

00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:37,450
have sufficient I mean acknowledges that

00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:41,350
its powers are limited make sure that

00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:54,550
the rights of everyone are respected so

00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:56,050
I so what are the states obviously we've

00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:58,810
mentioned the splitting of these two

00:13:56,050 --> 00:14:00,340
worlds to internet the one internet with

00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:03,490
right which is privacy centers and the

00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:05,530
other that has but there are also other

00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:07,210
sticks coming up I'm thinking of course

00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:09,640
of the hacking industry which

00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:13,720
particularly like this part of the world

00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:16,870
and I'm thinking also about an emerging

00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:19,300
industry which is of course artificial

00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:22,660
intelligence which relies a lot on on

00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:25,930
data you may know that the rule has

00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:29,050
recently opened a Center in artificial

00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:32,590
set a digital intelligence center in are

00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:35,020
crying Ghana who trained the greatest

00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:39,390
number possible professionals in this

00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:43,060
domain but of course what is what

00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:45,880
happened to the data I mean how are they

00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:48,280
are going to be used and are they going

00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:51,160
to be stored who will be accident them

00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:53,380
and many other questions but I think

00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:56,860
more broadly there is a philosophy of

00:14:53,380 --> 00:15:00,250
question behind all this which is do we

00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:03,670
agree that just because you were born on

00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:06,490
the wrong hemisphere or on the wrong

00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:09,100
continent you are not entitled to the

00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:11,890
same data protection as others meaning

00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:15,040
that your data can be used pretty by

00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:17,830
anyone who has the best of the worst

00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:20,410
idea possible or do

00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:22,990
we think that indeed we're equal even

00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:25,060
and especially on the network we should

00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:26,890
remember that this network was also

00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:29,140
invented to make sure and the web today

00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:31,840
was invented also to make sure that

00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:36,370
everybody would have people activities

00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:38,640
knowledge and to the rest of humanity or

00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:41,260
yeah what what is our philosophical

00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:43,390
thinking of course we agree that

00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:48,130
everybody should have the same the same

00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:50,710
when right but I think ultimately what

00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:53,950
is really at stake is again going back

00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:56,400
to this idea of splitting Internet so

00:15:53,950 --> 00:16:00,250
you know that now there there is a

00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:01,660
fierce opposition especially in in the

00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,760
parts of the world which are yet to be

00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:06,460
connected a fierce opposition between

00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:09,160
two internet offers on the one hand the

00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:13,420
open and free internet which we've all

00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:15,460
enjoyed up until very silly thing and

00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:18,160
which for instance allowing me to be

00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:21,820
here speaking to you giving me a voice

00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:24,370
as we like to say or on the other hand

00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:26,080
an internet which is controlled which

00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:29,320
helps repressive regime maintain

00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:32,410
themselves obviously governments are in

00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:35,590
Africa will make the choice of a tool

00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:37,480
that and help them maintain themself but

00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:40,690
I think companies have an opportunity

00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:42,460
here to have allies and users of course

00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:44,260
users what want an internet that

00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:46,540
empowers them when your have your

00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:49,060
privacy protected you're empowered as a

00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:51,820
citizen you're empowered as an Internet

00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:53,980
user it gives you more opportunities so

00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:56,620
if companies make sure that they have

00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:58,840
allies in the person of users that they

00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:01,000
offer them an Internet that's centered

00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:03,280
around and services Internet services

00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,920
that are centered around their privacy

00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:07,570
they will make sure that these citizens

00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:11,320
whenever the government's will want to

00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:13,990
block these services disrupt internet or

00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:15,490
any other censorship measure they will

00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:18,850
make they are sure that this government

00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:20,830
these cities in Surrey will oppose their

00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:22,420
governments in the fiercest way to make

00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:24,970
sure that they they'll have access to

00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:28,000
tools that are empowering them but that

00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:31,279
again is the responsibility of private

00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:34,159
so I'm going to leave it there

00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:36,679
I thank you for your and and if you want

00:17:34,159 --> 00:17:42,460
more information please visit our

00:17:36,679 --> 00:17:42,460
website and don't hesitate thank you

00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:52,760
we'll do some questions if anyone's what

00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:55,000
is raise your hand somebody will be with

00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:55,000
me

00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:02,370
you

00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:10,009
if you're familiar with John le carré

00:18:07,249 --> 00:18:13,100
novel The Constant Gardener which talks

00:18:10,009 --> 00:18:15,470
about the exploitation of African

00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:16,820
communities by drug companies that use

00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:18,470
them as the

00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:20,559
historically have used them as guinea

00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:23,799
pig because of the lack of regulation

00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:27,169
will obviously see some parallels here

00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:31,159
form of learning elders neo-colonial

00:18:27,169 --> 00:18:33,860
isolation but I wondered there's been a

00:18:31,159 --> 00:18:36,250
lot of investment by China in many

00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:38,920
sub-saharan African countries

00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:43,000
and China's internet model is obviously

00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:45,950
low and China is making technology and

00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:50,800
know how many of these and base

00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:53,520
you think China's influence is um a

00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:55,560
factor in the

00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,740
and by governments who making decisions

00:18:55,560 --> 00:19:00,790
about which model of internet governance

00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:03,300
to adult

00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:03,300
obviously

00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:10,369
I've seen that I mean we've observed

00:19:06,499 --> 00:19:12,590
that without working another in another

00:19:10,369 --> 00:19:16,070
on another issue which is related to

00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:19,460
free expression so they're increasingly

00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:22,549
governments relying on shutting down the

00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:25,190
Internet whenever some pretty cool I

00:19:22,549 --> 00:19:27,950
mean something believable happens they

00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:31,039
don't like it so what we have observed

00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:32,450
is that the techniques used to censor

00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:36,950
the Internet are increasingly

00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:38,989
sophisticated and look weirdly almost

00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:40,009
exactly like what is being practiced in

00:19:38,989 --> 00:19:43,269
China

00:19:40,009 --> 00:19:47,450
for instance we remember when Iowa

00:19:43,269 --> 00:19:49,639
something no no no I was sorry for that

00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:51,369
Luke Jarrow sorry I almost made a

00:19:49,639 --> 00:19:53,570
mistake sorry

00:19:51,369 --> 00:19:55,759
when neutral were passed away

00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:57,950
unfortunately remember that users

00:19:55,759 --> 00:20:01,129
reported that they could not share the

00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:03,529
pictures or post about it on the

00:20:01,129 --> 00:20:07,039
internet but we're seeing that as well

00:20:03,529 --> 00:20:08,690
in certain parts of Africa but on my

00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:12,810
staff people complain that they cannot

00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:14,820
share videos in certain subjects

00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:18,030
it's a matter of investigation but

00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:20,100
obviously yes China is of the first

00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:23,660
economic partner and financial partners

00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:26,910
in many countries so and at the recent

00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:29,610
summit between China and Africa tech

00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:31,650
issue became one of the leading issues

00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:35,730
of this collaboration so obviously

00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:38,100
that's why that hence my call today we

00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:42,450
need allies in order to make sure that

00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:44,160
well this I mean close internet does not

00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:47,540
become the principal for certain part of

00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,540
the world entities

00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:55,050
you

00:20:55,650 --> 00:21:00,840
I thanks for that talk just now as was

00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:02,400
I'm interested in know what what

00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,950
incentives can be put in place for

00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:07,340
sub-saharan African governments to

00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:11,040
implement strong user protections and

00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:13,230
also know what incentives and people in

00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:15,190
place book and he's operating in in

00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:17,860
their market

00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:20,380
as far as they are concerned I think

00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:23,710
sovereignty is going to be a very

00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:25,780
important issue data is all well

00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:27,730
personal data of citizens is obviously

00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:30,820
becoming also a sovereignty issue

00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:33,160
because whoever access as access to who

00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:36,580
your citizens are can manipulate your

00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:39,309
citizens in the way they want

00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:44,440
so for governments yes sovereignty and

00:21:39,309 --> 00:21:47,609
of course AI and SP you know you can you

00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,609
can harness

00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:52,610
intelligence revolution or your or your

00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:56,960
economy development so obviously these

00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:59,510
are arguments at work for companies well

00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:03,550
I think

00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:06,230
as I was trying to to to advocate for

00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:09,470
increasingly these companies are our

00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:11,950
challenge on the services that they use

00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:15,190
and they're increasingly block from

00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:20,020
being attest accessed sorry by

00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:20,020
operations in those regions so

00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:27,429
with increasingly citizens are pushing

00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:30,940
the boundaries said by their governments

00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:32,559
in terms of pressure and and the

00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:35,679
censorship I'll give an example recently

00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:39,760
in Benin which is a very I mean a small

00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:41,410
in the size country in West Africa where

00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,390
the government had adopted what they

00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:44,950
call the social media that so taxing

00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:49,809
people just because they use whatsapp

00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:52,330
good idea and well big citizens pushback

00:22:49,809 --> 00:22:58,030
to the point that the government was had

00:22:52,330 --> 00:23:01,780
to stop the tax so it means that there

00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:04,000
is a there is a dynamic here which

00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:06,250
should be harness increasingly citizens

00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,250
have the power and the ability to push

00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:12,400
their governments to perform better and

00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:13,929
I think yes that's probably a good

00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,760
incentives if you don't do that your

00:23:13,929 --> 00:23:18,480
service won't be accessed by potentially

00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,480
1 billion users

00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:25,850
and of course Human Rights

00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:29,260
relations cost you more than making sure

00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:29,260
that your product or human rights

00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:37,670
hi Julie I'm Fredrik it's really nice to

00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:40,140
meet you oh hey my question is in

00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:41,910
discussions with big Western tech

00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:45,000
companies like Facebook we're not only

00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:47,970
also YouTube etc the products that

00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,970
people use in markets where Internet is

00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:53,550
more expensive for those are essentially

00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:56,030
different platforms they're limited data

00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:58,470
platforms and I sometimes wonder whether

00:23:56,030 --> 00:24:01,320
in discussions about things like

00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:03,420
newsfeed and targeting etc that these

00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:06,390
users are basically underrepresented and

00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:08,370
my question to use what can

00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:11,190
organizations that are based in Europe

00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:13,320
or the ass due to pressure tech

00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:16,620
companies based in the u.s. to make sure

00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:19,799
that all users are represented

00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:24,970
that's a very very important question

00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:28,150
and mystifying to find the best solution

00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:30,580
I guess one of the ways to go is to tell

00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:32,860
these companies that if you don't pay

00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:35,860
attention your products are going to

00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:38,610
need to be used and tested to do bad

00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:41,590
like we've seen in the case of

00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:44,340
originating and I mentioned

00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:46,500
which I don't think

00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:48,270
these companies wand I mean they want

00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:52,590
their products to bring people together

00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:58,310
cause polarized polarization insist I

00:24:52,590 --> 00:25:00,100
mean theory they say what that so yes

00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:01,900
they

00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:03,570
one argument that could be made is that

00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:06,610
you don't take the necessary measures

00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:08,740
you're the the flaws within your system

00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:11,559
the flowers between your products will

00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:14,410
always always be harnessed to be tested

00:25:11,559 --> 00:25:17,380
in order to be used two three five years

00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:19,240
later in your native market that's

00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:21,940
called in that way and this will cause

00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:24,340
you well we see the consequences from

00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:28,570
Facebook in terms of trust between their

00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:30,520
users and so I think this is one when as

00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:34,620
you Avenue that can be exported and that

00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:34,620
can help yes indeed equalize

00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:43,250
sure that there is no no whistling in

00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:43,250
the in the the net

00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:50,270
yeah couple of hands raised here we're

00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:52,700
gonna have to spit that we move on now

00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:54,380
to lost balance it's gonna be some

00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:57,280
chairs being put up as Julie thank you

00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:57,280
thank you very much

00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:07,440
