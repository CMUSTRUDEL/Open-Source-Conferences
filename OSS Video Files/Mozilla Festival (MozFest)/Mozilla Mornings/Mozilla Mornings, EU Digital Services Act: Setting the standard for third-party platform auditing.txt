[Music]

00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:09,360
very good afternoon to everyone

00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:11,599
and welcome to our mozilla mornings at

00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,040
two in the afternoon in brussels and no

00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,360
we haven't gone mad

00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,199
uh we have a guest joining us from the

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,400
us where it is morning and after all

00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:22,240
it's always morning somewhere so i hope

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,519
everyone's ready for a great chat we've

00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,560
only got an hour today

00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,279
and we're going to look at the dsa of

00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,279
course many

00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:30,320
times we've talked about this before but

00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,960
today we're going to look

00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,640
at auditing and give the tires a kick

00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,079
and look under the hood of what the

00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,399
possibilities are

00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,600
so let us kick off i'm going to guess

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,879
owen from

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,039
mozilla owen bennett is senior policy uh

00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:46,480
manager at mozilla corporation is going

00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,840
to kick things off and tell us why this

00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,360
has been organized today

00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,760
before we jump straight into the

00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,920
discussion

00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,360
thank you jen and thank you everyone for

00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,640
tuning in to what is the second

00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:00,480
installment of mozilla mornings in 2021

00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,559
and we're humbled that like despite the

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,479
challenges of zoom fatigue that

00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,479
you consider our event to be worthy of

00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,920
your time and of course we'll endeavor

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,880
to make sure that that is time well

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,280
spent

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,799
um so as jen mentioned today's event is

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,280
going to be looking specifically at

00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:17,040
article 28 of the dsa which deals with

00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,520
uh with third-party auditing

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,600
and at mozilla we we consider that this

00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,920
this regime this auditing provision

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,200
can be quite an effective pillar of the

00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,840
dsa's

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,560
next generation approach to what

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,960
oversight looks like in the tech sector

00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,840
and of course specialist auditors they

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,079
can provide a

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,920
an oversight baseline that that

00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,200
complements the work of regulators and

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,360
also frees up

00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,520
and gives more space for public interest

00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,200
researchers to focus on the things

00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,720
and the the hidden harms which might

00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,960
otherwise go unseen

00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,720
in the platform ecosystem and of course

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,960
the discourse around this topic

00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,159
is is taking place around the world not

00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,840
just in europe so

00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,759
it's good that at least the dsa is

00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,240
trying to move things forward by giving

00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,880
it

00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,159
a legislative basis in one jurisdiction

00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,240
at least

00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,840
and but of course as with with many

00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,680
aspects of the dsa

00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,119
and this is a good start but of course

00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,879
there's a lot more that still needs to

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,239
be done and at mozilla when we think

00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:14,080
about these provisions

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,319
three things come to mind where we think

00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,640
a little bit more work needs to be done

00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,400
uh firstly the auditing regime needs to

00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,200
be granular in nature

00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,040
at the moment the dsa simply specifies

00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,959
that an audit must take place

00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,800
but it doesn't really give much clarity

00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,640
into how that audit

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,840
should be conducted and what kind of

00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,000
specific elements

00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,920
need to be included in that process and

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,239
so for us a big step forward was to

00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,040
get rid to be to get a lot more granular

00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,440
into what that

00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,599
that regime should look like secondly

00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,560
the issue about standardization and

00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:47,360
certification

00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,760
as as we know this third-party platform

00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,480
monitoring is very much an

00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,879
nascent industry and we don't yet have

00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,120
good

00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,080
international standards or certified

00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,159
bodies to

00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,280
to kind of manage it and to give it a

00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,440
kind of a

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,959
strong degree of credibility and so

00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,080
solving for that whether it's through

00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,560
the dsa or

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,159
through whatever comes next in delegated

00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,080
and access and so forth

00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,440
is going to be crucial for the eu for

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,640
this regime to be um

00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,280
to be impactful and then finally the

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,360
question about

00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,519
auditing the auditors like in the

00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,720
sectors where auditing works or at least

00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,720
in those where it

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,799
fails better there tends to be a

00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,720
structural misalignment of incentives

00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,959
that the auditor knows they need to do a

00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,640
good job or else they might get sued by

00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,440
somebody who's upset by their by their

00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,000
outcomes

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,840
and in the dsa the draft text at least

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,760
that kind of structural misalignment is

00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,440
not built into the system so

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,040
exploring how that could be could be

00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,840
improved would be a would be a really

00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,400
interesting

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,319
work stream to pursue and now of course

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,840
given the sheer novelty of this this

00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,280
issue space there's so much more that

00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,640
could be unpacked and that's just a

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,640
small flavor of the

00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,560
potential issues and of course it's

00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,319
important that we give space for some of

00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,920
this expert

00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,040
led and kind of critical engagement with

00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,959
how the tech should be should be

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,560
improved now obviously we've uh

00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,239
we've assembled what we think is a

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,120
stellar panel to help us through that

00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,799
process

00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,319
and so i think now is the time to to

00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,400
give them the floor to to help us on

00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,920
this this journey so with that jen i i

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,080
hand back to you

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,000
thanks owen you've definitely set out at

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,880
least the in broad strokes what's in the

00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,199
mozilla

00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,320
position paper on auditing which is why

00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,120
we're actually having a look at this

00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,800
today

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,440
and we are of course delighted to have

00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:29,040
joining us alexander gisa mep

00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,720
who is the imco dsa shadow rap water

00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,880
uh who obviously has been following this

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,880
very closely knows a lot about it from

00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,560
all angles of the dsa but we're going to

00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,720
try and stick to auditing today

00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,120
uh joining us from across the pond uh

00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,080
deborah raji who is a mozilla fellow and

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,240
research collaborator

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,199
with algorithmic justice league deborah

00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,880
thank you so much

00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,120
for allowing us all to lie in this

00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:51,280
morning because we've changed the time

00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,800
and obviously last but not least our

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,120
token mail on the panel

00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,960
dr ben wagner who is assistant professor

00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,840
at the faculty of technology policy and

00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,479
management

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,199
at tu delft and lovely to have you all

00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,479
with us

00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,479
as i would mention we're going to give

00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:05,120
you a minute to set out your stall and

00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,280
just

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,039
provide an introduction to what you

00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,039
think and why you think it's important

00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:13,280
and i will remind attendees there is a q

00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:15,840
a button at the bottom of your screen

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,120
use it please do click on it and ask

00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,120
questions or even make comments and i

00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,720
will try and direct those to the panel

00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,960
so we get through everyone's thoughts in

00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,759
the next hour alexandra i will let you

00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,600
start so the floor

00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:28,560
is yours that is an honor thank you very

00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,560
much jennifer

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,639
and thank you very much to mozilla for

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,320
having me and especially for discussing

00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,720
this topic because my impression was in

00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,880
the beginning that article 28 sort of

00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,240
nobody was really focusing on it so i'm

00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,440
really delighted to

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,800
to see this um i think what article i

00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,880
think it's quite stunning

00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,800
that the commission should suggest this

00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,320
article and comes back to saying oh we

00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,840
have these independent audits and when

00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,840
you ask the commission who is supposed

00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:56,479
to do the independent audience

00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,560
they just go blank and they say well

00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:01,680
actually we don't know

00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,840
um and then when you really insist they

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:07,039
say well there's going to be a market

00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:09,039
for it we expect the market to be there

00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:10,560
and then maybe the big four the auditing

00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:12,080
companies who are specialized on

00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,840
financial auditing which is something

00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,199
completely different from auditing

00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,840
algorithm systems

00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,280
as we all know and i think what is being

00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:23,280
totally ignored here

00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:25,919
is um beyond the the questions of

00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:28,400
of methodology what exactly are you

00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:30,880
auditing what are you looking for

00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,800
what is what are your goals is the issue

00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,919
of power relations

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,199
because the the huge majority of people

00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,919
who now who would know

00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:42,000
how to analyze this kind of data how to

00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:44,400
work with algorithmic systems

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,960
and also have some knowledges knowledge

00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,639
on how society works how bias works how

00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,800
democracy works

00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,759
work for big tech i mean those are the

00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,520
companies where

00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,120
you can make a living with that kind of

00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,840
knowledge and

00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,919
therefore i'm really would like to start

00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,440
out really with that with that doubt how

00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,240
are you going to deal with this power

00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:06,240
relations

00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:08,400
any independent um auditing

00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,639
a private auditing buddy and notified

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:13,599
buddy would have to rely heavily

00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:15,599
on recruiting people who formerly worked

00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,319
for big tech and who might want to go

00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:19,280
back there

00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,479
in their future life so i think the

00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,840
issue of of

00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:27,680
revolving doors is really is really huge

00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:29,840
um there is an issue of um of scale

00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,680
because you can't just say well we find

00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,840
some ngo who's going to

00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,280
process all that data that's not not a

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,759
real option

00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,199
um there's academia but even academia

00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,039
really doesn't have the processing

00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,560
capacities you would need to in order to

00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,319
be able to look at raw data and

00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,680
interpret it and then we know

00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:50,720
um that a lot of academia experts are

00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,400
somehow reliant on funding by google

00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,440
facebook and whoever you know

00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:58,080
we want to mention here um so

00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:00,160
before we really go into the the more

00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,960
technicalities if i can say that with

00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,919
this

00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,680
this term um which are absolutely

00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:07,599
important i think this is really the big

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,720
issue we need to face here and what we

00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,879
need to solve this

00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,000
i think is a european agency it's a

00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,639
public oversight

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,280
body that is really able to specialize

00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,599
in

00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,960
in this in this aspect and to attract

00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:21,599
professionals

00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,280
who know they can stay there for a long

00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:26,560
time and really specialize

00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:29,120
in auditing um therefore very very

00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,440
specialized staff who can be offered a

00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,640
lifelong career almost or at least some

00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,560
some safety for

00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:39,839
for their lives and that could at least

00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:41,839
provide advice to the commission but

00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:43,919
better to have really um

00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,920
the possibilities to to really conduct

00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,120
those audits and take decisions so that

00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,920
would be

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,120
my first take thank you thank you um

00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,560
you've raised a lot of the points that

00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,959
we're going to really get into

00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,839
obviously um deborah let me come to you

00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,600
i mean

00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,120
you're you're not based in europe and

00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,760
we're talking about this potential

00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,080
market

00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,880
place for for auditing these very large

00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,399
platforms

00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,200
um is that going to be a global

00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:09,519
marketplace i mean

00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,040
um yeah i think i i was actually just

00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,920
thinking that when alexandra was making

00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,040
her comments

00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,080
um uh and i apologize in advance a lot

00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:20,080
of my comments will

00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:21,760
be very u.s u.s canada um specific but

00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,279
there is there is this emerging

00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,839
community of um

00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,880
researchers involved in the auditing

00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:29,519
practice and

00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,480
um you know article 31 um which is sort

00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,120
of

00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,680
related in certain ways article 28 goes

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,800
into

00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,440
sort of the assumptions that uh clearly

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,000
pervade

00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,440
a lot of the policy community around who

00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,120
is doing this auditing work i think

00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,800
there's a lot of assumptions around

00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,640
academic researchers being sort of the

00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,720
dominant auditing

00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,320
um you know participants but there's

00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,080
definitely a lot of

00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,920
uh great sort of investigative

00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:57,200
journalists like the markup

00:09:53,920 --> 00:10:00,000
um there's uh you know uh uh sort of

00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,760
lobbying groups and um you know uh law

00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,360
firms that have sort of technical

00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,760
auditing capacity

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,399
uh there's you know consultancies like

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,959
orca

00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:11,600
and upturn um there's uh you know civil

00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,000
society orgs like ajl and the aclu that

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,160
we

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,839
you know we have the in-house sort of

00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,600
technical capacity people within civil

00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,560
society that are participating in this

00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,959
auditing work

00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,480
so there it is definitely not um a

00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:24,800
mature industry

00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,760
um you know the assumptions around uh

00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,519
standardization

00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,120
and certification and training programs

00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,680
is definitely not there i don't know if

00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,440
there's

00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,279
a current player in this space that has

00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,079
the capacity to audit facebook for

00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,839
example

00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,839
that would be like you know an eight

00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,680
hour a day all year

00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,440
event for them to audit a company of

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,200
that size um

00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,920
but i do think that there's definitely

00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,519
an emerging community and that community

00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:50,000
definitely

00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:52,240
um uh you know involves the scope of

00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,800
participants beyond what i think people

00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,399
usually realize um so i think that's

00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,839
maybe the first point is that there

00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,360
definitely is a community

00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,519
and that community is international to

00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,240
some degree as well um

00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,440
you know you definitely have article 19

00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,720
ava love lance there's

00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,399
there's definitely awo uh fox glove you

00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:14,160
know there's a lot of great

00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:16,240
uh uh you know civil society orgs and uh

00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,600
you know law firms specialized in terms

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,720
of accountability

00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,959
for algorithmic systems and uh

00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,880
and and technical companies sort of

00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,399
holding these technical uh these tech

00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,160
these tech companies accountable that

00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,880
that that have that

00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,000
in-house technical capacity uh even the

00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,839
aclu and

00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,839
sort of the equivalencies in in the in

00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,760
the eu um

00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,959
have uh sort of technologists and are

00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,959
sort of hiring

00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,480
tech fellows that that have this this

00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:44,399
technical capacity to audit

00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,160
so i wouldn't underestimate the ability

00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,000
of you know some of these

00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,079
uh participants to engage in that

00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,040
auditing work i do think that the field

00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:54,240
is

00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,760
not standardized um but um

00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,360
there's definitely a lot of potential

00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,120
there especially if um

00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,959
as mentioned you know there's incentive

00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,519
for that market to develop

00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:04,320
um i one of my um sort of challenges

00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,880
with um

00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,079
the current version of article 28

00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,240
actually goes

00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:12,240
uh you know it is is connected to what

00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,279
um alexandra mentioned around revolving

00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,320
doors and

00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:17,040
uh you know vetting independence uh you

00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,200
know

00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,240
because there is no certification board

00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,160
there is no

00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:27,360
um you know standards body for

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:30,160
uh you know what constitutes a valid

00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,959
auditing organization there's a lot of

00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,120
uh kind of

00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,639
potential for reckless behavior and a

00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,240
lot of potential for conflict of

00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,839
interest you know anyone can declare

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,320
themselves an auditor today and then go

00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:40,480
for

00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,320
go work for the company they audited the

00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,360
next day and there's no sort of

00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,720
mechanism for consequence in in that

00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,760
kind of situation and i think i find

00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,079
that very

00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:53,120
uh disturbing and very difficult and the

00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:55,839
analogy i sort of see in my mind is um

00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:58,240
i'm not sure if this is how it works in

00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:00,880
uh the eu but in canada

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:03,200
um and the u.s um you know the way that

00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:06,639
regulatory frameworks work for

00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:09,920
uh the biomedical device industry

00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:11,600
is that they have a set of sort of uh

00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,360
you know the government has a man you

00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,000
know in our case health canada in the

00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,560
u.s it's

00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,519
fda but they'll mandate that you know if

00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,079
you want to

00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,880
deploy your biomedical device in the

00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,320
market

00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,000
uh you have to get it audited and they

00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,160
just mandate that you get it audited by

00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
a set of approved auditing organizations

00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,279
and those auditing organizations

00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,639
have to go through a certification

00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:33,200
process and the government sort of

00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:35,600
appoints a set of auditing organizations

00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,399
and there's a marketplace involved there

00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,160
as well where

00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,399
you know the company can choose any of

00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,399
these certified auditing organizations

00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,680
uh they can pick you know who they who

00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,920
gets to audit them

00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,720
based off of this market of sort of

00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,720
certified

00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,240
bodies the challenge there is that you

00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,000
know you have certain companies where

00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,680
they'll have a consultancy arm where

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,199
they'll do a pre-audit

00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,720
where they'll come in and you you pay an

00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:57,680
extra fee and they'll do this pre-audit

00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,560
where they'll tell you everything that

00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,920
you're doing wrong

00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,760
and they'll come in and they'll do the

00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,079
actual audit and then just certify you

00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,519
and

00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:06,399
there's a lot of um you know uh dynamics

00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,240
involved in that

00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:10,000
industry right now at least in canada

00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,360
where people are really questioning

00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,199
you know the independence of these

00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,440
auditing organizations and

00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,639
the incentives of you know why would an

00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,320
organization actually

00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,480
have an incentive to really truly

00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,760
contradict you know what is in the best

00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,079
interest of this company

00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,760
and i feel like with you know with um

00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:28,320
online platforms and with

00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,519
um you know some of the technologies

00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,600
we're talking about

00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,360
uh that would sort of qualify to be

00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,320
audited under the dsa that can become

00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,720
quite

00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,399
uh dangerous and quite difficult if the

00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,920
auditing organization cannot be

00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,279
independent enough to truly

00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,199
critique that company and truly

00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:45,600
challenge that company um

00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,560
so yeah you know lots of feelings and

00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,000
emotions about

00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,000
you know what this marketplace can look

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
like but there's versions of this that

00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,920
already exist and challenges involved

00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,839
in um in implementing something like

00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,800
this you know that being said

00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:00,320
it's incredibly difficult also for the

00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,760
government to have that technical

00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,199
capacity and develop that technical

00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:06,480
capacity internally

00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:08,240
um i think it is possible for uh

00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,839
you know the government to attract

00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:13,760
technologists to work for them

00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:15,279
um but uh in terms of just you know the

00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,959
the attraction of working for the

00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:18,000
government versus working for this big

00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:20,639
tech company

00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,800
um i'm not sure if that dynamic is

00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,639
always gonna be in favor of the best

00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,320
technologists wanting to work

00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:28,639
on these kind of problems so there's

00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,360
definitely a lot of challenges that will

00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,560
happen if

00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:34,399
you know recruitment is tied to

00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,160
you know a government job or a

00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,440
government entity that might not be able

00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,399
to have the knowledge

00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,680
to um you know foster the talent or

00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,759
retain the talent

00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,440
that's required to you know design and

00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:48,399
execute some of these audits

00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,839
um so yeah i'll end there but yeah lots

00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:51,279
of lots of thoughts

00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:53,680
lots of thoughts around sort of how this

00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:56,720
marketplace could develop

00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:59,440
and analogies especially from the sort

00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:02,160
of biomedical device industry

00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,600
um let me turn that thank you deborah

00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,920
let me turn to ben i know

00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,959
uh you've written a policy paper on

00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,399
transparency

00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:10,800
and disinformation with regard to

00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,519
auditing um feel free to share that in

00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,320
the chat for

00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,279
our our attendees as well but ben give

00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,320
us your

00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:19,360
thoughts i mean you know uh alexander

00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,399
commented that you know

00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:24,160
sometimes academia is hand in glove with

00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,959
some of the big tech companies i'm sure

00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,800
that's not you but do tell me why

00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:30,079
i think it's a very significant problem

00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,199
and i agree with

00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:33,120
basically everything that's been said

00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:35,759
before by the two wonderful panelists

00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,560
ahead of me i think the the challenge we

00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,639
face now

00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,079
is to really work out how this could

00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,160
work while

00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,600
first perhaps acknowledging that six

00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,839
months ago we weren't even

00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,279
able to have a conversation about audits

00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:50,720
and for many years

00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:51,920
civil society researchers different

00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,519
international organizations members of

00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,279
parliament have all been screaming about

00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,079
the abusive practices of large tech

00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:58,079
companies

00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:59,519
and how the data that they are providing

00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,720
in their transparency reports the

00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,440
information they are providing to the

00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,799
public

00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:08,079
is false is incorrect is misleading

00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:09,760
and is manipulative and that we are now

00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:11,600
able to have a conversation about audits

00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,760
is because this proposal is on the table

00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:15,280
so first of all it's very exciting that

00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,640
we're able to talk about audits

00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,640
and as you mentioned we put together

00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,760
this this policy paper which tries to

00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,319
tackle some of those issues and

00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,439
challenges as was been mentioned already

00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,640
i don't want to go into too much detail

00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,240
because you've already discussed it and

00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,559
mentioned all of the key elements but

00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,679
capture is a big aspect both in academia

00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:31,919
and elsewhere

00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,880
the the thought of a university that is

00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:34,559
being funded by google

00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,640
also doing these audits is completely

00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,440
crazy in the same way that the conflict

00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,799
of interest will

00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,360
apply both to organizations and

00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:43,760
individuals so we can't assume unless

00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:46,799
these individuals have some kind of

00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,840
long-term protection but also some kind

00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,520
of long-term

00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,280
requirement not to work for the

00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,160
companies they're auditing or in similar

00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,600
industries

00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,440
that these people will be able to do

00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,280
audits in an effective manner

00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,760
now if we add on top of that what i

00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,000
think we can claim is an ongoing crisis

00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,840
in

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,080
the existing auditing industry in the

00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,440
first place which is that the auditors

00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,960
themselves are picked

00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,120
by the companies that are going to be

00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,640
auditing them you can ask a little bit

00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,760
whether the big four or existing

00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,320
financial auditors

00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,919
might be the right choice simply because

00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,760
we've seen from numerous financial

00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:20,880
scandals in the past decade that

00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:22,720
they perhaps aren't the ideal choices

00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,000
and they have numerous problems of

00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,600
capture of

00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,080
power imbalances that we've already

00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,440
discussed and the real challenges

00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,280
are difficult to bring out in the

00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,440
context of audit relationships and

00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,120
over many years and in the cases of many

00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,400
of the abuses of power that we see in

00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,919
the context of the technologies that

00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,320
we're talking about right now

00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:41,760
we are not able to wait for years for

00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,039
auditors to work this out we need

00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,080
solutions in the next months in the next

00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,559
weeks in the next years

00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,080
as soon as possible so i think and i

00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:51,280
fully agree with alexandra here

00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:53,520
i think that a public sector regulator

00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:56,720
doing the audits is a much better way to

00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:58,000
go but i would also try to agree with

00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,320
deborah in the sense that she's saying

00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,320
there are numerous civil society groups

00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,080
empowered to be able to be part of that

00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,679
process the main thing is that the

00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,919
choice of who does

00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:08,799
the regulation in the sense of who does

00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,039
the audits

00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:12,720
shouldn't be a marketplace where the

00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,440
companies themselves can choose their

00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,919
auditor

00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,640
but rather the process by which that

00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:19,679
happens

00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:21,280
takes place by a public sector body

00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,520
that is doing this and they can then

00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:25,200
draw on the expertise the

00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,640
fantastic capacity that exists already

00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,679
in civil society

00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:32,640
i would also add that the audit capacity

00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:34,160
here is extremely sensitive in the sense

00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,720
that they're dealing with huge amounts

00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,240
of

00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:41,600
really powerful data that if misused

00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:43,520
is can be misused on the scale of like

00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,120
another snowden leak or in the scale of

00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,679
another great

00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,440
problem for both elections and democracy

00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,760
and so it's really really important to

00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,799
get

00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:54,160
the the mechanisms here right and that

00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:56,559
they don't sort of devolve

00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,440
into a mechanism for government

00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:59,919
surveillance

00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,520
i don't think that's a necessary

00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:02,720
consequence but it's certainly something

00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,559
to be careful of

00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,240
and specifically to be careful of

00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,520
precisely because right now the way the

00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,600
dsa is written

00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,440
not just audits but the regulatory model

00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,360
itself lacks independence

00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,120
so we have a huge problem about a lack

00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,320
of independence which can only be

00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:19,120
resolved by

00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:20,080
independent public regulators taking the

00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,080
lead

00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,679
definitely involving existing capacity

00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,200
that's there deborah provided a far

00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,640
better list than i ever could so

00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,720
there's really many many organizations

00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,919
that could be involved that could

00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,760
support this process

00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:33,120
but i think if you don't put the public

00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,880
sector in the lead if you just create a

00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,320
marketplace and you allow the companies

00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,480
to pick who's auditing them

00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:40,240
you won't get an auditing process that

00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,840
really provides the accountability that

00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,679
we need right now at this point in time

00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:46,080
and all of the academic research in this

00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:48,000
area but also all of the

00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:50,000
many statements from civil society from

00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,840
numerous politicians to support this

00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,360
there's a need for change and i don't

00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,440
think there's there's strong

00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:58,559
disagreement from

00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:00,159
almost any party talking about these

00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:02,400
issues for an extended period of time

00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:03,679
which is unusual we don't often get to

00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,520
these points where

00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,120
everybody seems to agree that this is

00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,400
the way to go so let's hope that that

00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,840
continues and that we can really have a

00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,400
serious conversation about how to do

00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:14,000
audits right

00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,600
thank you ben you've dived in straight

00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,200
into the question of who should be doing

00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,720
the audits um i mean i

00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,320
initially was going to ask you all like

00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,240
why is the commission come up with this

00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,919
uh in this particular area because

00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,280
it isn't something in particular that

00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:27,120
we're necessarily used to

00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:29,440
in regards say if we compare to data

00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:31,440
protection we've got the regulatory gpas

00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,120
if we compared to other areas there's

00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,480
you know we've got a nissa doing cyber

00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,559
security and so on

00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,720
um but talking about who is doing those

00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:40,880
audits ben you mentioned civil society

00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,640
academia and public bodies what those

00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,440
three things have in common

00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,159
is that they are not necessarily for

00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,440
profit

00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:49,200
you know and when we talk about a

00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,960
marketplace that

00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,000
sort of seems to me to be an imbalance

00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,600
there we're talking about different

00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,600
groups of people that are going to do it

00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,280
so i mean alexander you i saw answered

00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,720
the question on the q a already but it

00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,000
was it was a pertinent one

00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,600
and it was about attracting the right

00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,200
talent to people who want these careers

00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,440
and do they want to work

00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,559
for not-for-profits do they want a

00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,760
career based in

00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:09,679
in an industry where they feel they've

00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,440
got opportunities and outlets

00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:13,600
and if you can paraphrase with you i

00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:15,360
know you you wrote in the in the text

00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:18,000
yeah happy to do that i'm sorry for

00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:21,039
answering the question too early

00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,720
um i think i think when ben came up with

00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:26,320
the perfect solution i think we

00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:30,240
we need a broad um industry

00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:32,159
of um of auditing or bodies

00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,520
um where where talent can find their

00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,840
place where people can

00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,919
be very innovative maybe specialize in

00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,919
certain types of types of audits

00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:42,080
you know one organization might might go

00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:44,799
for bias audits and the other one for

00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:46,640
certain aspects of regulatory audits or

00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:48,799
like ethic aspects i mean the issue is

00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,960
do you audit for technicalities for

00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:53,280
technical aspects is something

00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,960
is there conformity with the standard or

00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,720
are there other risks that may

00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,159
not even have been considered for

00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,159
society or you could have an

00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:02,000
environmental audit for example what

00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:03,039
about you know energy consumption or

00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,120
something like that

00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:06,720
so i do think we need very different

00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:09,919
kinds of organizations

00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,200
but i also think um that really we need

00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,600
a public regulator

00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,200
who has oversight over all these

00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,440
organizations and and

00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,720
has the last word and can really decide

00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,080
you know which companies need to be

00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,280
audited by whom

00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,360
and i think that the point on

00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:25,280
granularity is a very good point

00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:27,200
obviously as european regulator what

00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:29,039
what i have mostly in mind is

00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,799
i mean how do you regulate face how do

00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:32,559
you how do you audit facebook

00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:34,080
as deborah said that's that's really a

00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:35,520
feat um but

00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,919
obviously this is very different for

00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,440
smaller digital smaller digital services

00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:40,799
who might need audits as well but i

00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,880
think in article 28

00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:44,559
28 we talked mainly about about the

00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:47,919
bigger ones so it depends a little bit

00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:51,200
on the going granularity what you need

00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:52,159
well as you've brought it up um tiernan

00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,240
kenny has already

00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:55,520
asked this question in the q a about

00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,200
owen's point regarding

00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,640
granularity and suggest would it be

00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,559
better to look at including some

00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,640
specific audit requirements

00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:04,000
in the codes of conduct for large

00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:07,200
platforms rather than in primary

00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,640
secondary education uh deborah what's

00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,840
your thought on that i mean

00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:14,880
yeah modes of conduct sound wonderful

00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:17,760
but we're lack teeth um

00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,600
yeah i i find that interesting i just

00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,640
want to also comment on a couple things

00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,640
that were said sorry i don't want to

00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:25,520
derail the conversation too much but

00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,000
um i i definitely so depend to ben's

00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,320
point

00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,120
um you know this is definitely a step

00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,240
forward

00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:34,080
um you know um you had mentioned earlier

00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,760
um you know we already have sort of some

00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:38,640
of these uh you know

00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,520
uh impact assessment requirements um you

00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,840
know

00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,799
what is different about this dsa article

00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:45,279
and i think that

00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:47,200
you know as an external auditor what we

00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:48,080
see as the opportunity with this article

00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,159
is the fact

00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:52,159
that you know one of the big challenges

00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:55,600
of auditing from the outside

00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:58,000
is this challenge of access so um

00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,720
you know as an internal auditor so

00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,120
meaning you know

00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,480
an employee or maybe an internal audit

00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,880
team within the company

00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,320
um think of you know google or

00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,360
facebook's internal

00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:11,360
sort of ethics team or um uh you know

00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,640
accenture one of the consultancy that

00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:15,760
they might hire to come in

00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:18,000
and an audit um you know in those cases

00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:20,240
uh you know you kind of you you sign a

00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,360
contract that has very specific clauses

00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,880
that make it so that

00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,640
you can't disclose the information

00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,480
beyond a particular realm

00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:29,039
um and you sort of represent the

00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:32,159
interests of particular stakeholders so

00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:34,880
um you know the audit is sort of shaped

00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:36,159
and informed by a perspective that's

00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:39,200
prioritizing

00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:40,960
you know shareholders maybe um or

00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,559
thinking about liability and compliance

00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,240
and quality control whereas with

00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:45,840
external auditors and mostly

00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,000
i'm speaking from you know someone

00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,840
working with a lot of advocacy groups

00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,200
um you know our stakeholders are

00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,120
completely different we're thinking

00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:56,159
about the affected population

00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:57,120
and uh you know the mission statement

00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:59,039
with respect to

00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,640
you know how these systems affect them

00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:02,240
we don't have any restrictions we don't

00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,159
sign any contracts with these companies

00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,720
that restrict our ability to disclose to

00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:06,640
the public

00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,640
or um you know share whatever

00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:11,679
information we discover in the audit

00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:14,720
and i think that that definitely um

00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:16,960
makes it very difficult to access

00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,559
the the systems we're trying to audit so

00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:21,679
something like the dsa's

00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:23,039
article 28 and like i mentioned later on

00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:24,880
like article 31

00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:26,240
sort of provide this opportunity to

00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,880
actually

00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:30,159
get some in like you know maybe force a

00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,880
little bit of access

00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:33,760
uh inside the company by being some kind

00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,000
of third

00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:38,000
party you know vetted third party audit

00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,679
body you know perhaps we can finally get

00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,159
a peek under the hood to be able to

00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:43,440
truly

00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:45,760
assess these systems and um you know um

00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,039
uh you know i guess discover results

00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,640
that are relevant

00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:50,240
to the well-being of whatever

00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,480
stakeholders where

00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,840
we're representing which is you know

00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,600
perhaps a different group than the

00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,640
shareholders that the internal auditors

00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,200
might be representing

00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:01,440
so as a result of that you know

00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,400
depending on who the external auditor is

00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,000
representing

00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,520
they can behave very differently and

00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,159
have very different methods i think

00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:09,279
there's some

00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:10,240
there's some um restrictions that make a

00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:12,000
lot of sense

00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,440
i think one of the reasons why academic

00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,520
institutions keep coming up is this

00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:18,960
expectation of an irb

00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:21,840
process or um you know

00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:23,360
an ethics review of of like the audit

00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,440
procedure itself just to make sure that

00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:27,919
it's thorough and scientifically sound

00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,440
um the idea of peer review um all of

00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:31,840
these um

00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,600
sort of academic practices that just

00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,120
guarantee a certain amount of robustness

00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:38,320
and ethical research practice

00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:41,520
like those are definitely uh you know

00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:43,279
requirements that can be imposed on all

00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:45,279
third party auditors even outside of

00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,919
academia just to ensure a certain amount

00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:48,640
of

00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:49,679
thoroughness to the audit work itself um

00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,919
and you can see

00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:52,880
you know uh i bring up the markup

00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:54,480
because they're they're this

00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,399
investigative journalism group and

00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,159
they're mostly based in the us but they

00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:00,159
they they have a lot of great stories

00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:02,080
and they kind of hold themselves to that

00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:03,120
academic standard with respect to you

00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:06,480
know they will

00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:08,320
disclose uh you know the the raw data

00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:11,039
of their audit results they will they

00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:13,120
will release their code in a github repo

00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:14,880
um they they engage in a form like an

00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,559
informal version of peer review and

00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,880
they'll list their reviewers

00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:20,799
so these are practices that they don't

00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:23,679
have to do but they sort of do it for

00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:26,080
accountability practices and just to

00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:27,279
give some legitimacy to the their audit

00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,240
process even though they're not

00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:30,880
necessarily

00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,440
academics or who or regulators that

00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,080
might

00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,640
be you know um required to act this way

00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,520
so

00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:39,120
yeah a code of conduct that is you know

00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,799
procedural in the sense of

00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,880
you know your audit needs to be composed

00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:44,559
of step abc i think those are not

00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,559
helpful because

00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:48,240
every auditor every external auditor

00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:50,960
especially

00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,880
is representing a different interest and

00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,399
is going to ask different questions so

00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,320
imposing a set of questions is not going

00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:59,760
to be helpful but imposing

00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:00,720
you know um you know research integrity

00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,720
practices

00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,000
uh you know research ethics practices i

00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,360
think is totally within the realm of

00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,279
something that can be useful

00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:08,799
and then i personally have a stance

00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:10,880
towards um

00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:13,039
you know requiring a certain amount of

00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:15,520
disclosure public disclosure

00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:17,200
of the audit results or transparency

00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:19,919
around the audit process

00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,640
um for the public to be able to see for

00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:22,320
themselves

00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,240
you know what actually went into the

00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,600
audit and what the results were

00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,960
um and you know of course that's

00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,240
something that's very difficult to get

00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,880
companies to agree to

00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,240
so um uh that's that's you know it's

00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,480
definitely something that's been

00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:36,320
when i read the dsa that's something i i

00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,159
notice immediately as missing is

00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,600
any kind of disclosure requirement to

00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:42,159
the public um

00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,679
or even uh you know there's it's unclear

00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:45,120
how much needs to be disclosed to even

00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:47,039
regulators or how much needs to be

00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,960
transparent to regulators as to

00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:50,960
the details of the audit process and the

00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,799
audit results so that's definitely

00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,080
something that can be this external sort

00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:55,760
of accountability mechanism

00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:57,840
that's not necessarily present in the

00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:59,760
current draft

00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:01,120
thank you i mean i'm taken by your

00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,640
comments on the the investments of

00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,919
journalism organizing i'm old enough to

00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,600
remember a time when

00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:07,279
trust and ethics were enough and we

00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,559
didn't have to necessarily expose

00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:10,320
everything

00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:11,840
and show quite that granularity not that

00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,320
granularities and transparency is a bad

00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:15,279
thing

00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,760
then um one of the things that you

00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:18,559
mentioned

00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:20,080
in your last uh intervention was that we

00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:22,399
can't wait around for this

00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,919
we need this now um and i'm just talking

00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:24,720
a little about what i listen to deborah

00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:26,559
talking about

00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,399
academic principles and ethics and

00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:30,559
checking and

00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:31,840
that takes time i mean thoroughness

00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:34,240
takes time

00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:35,520
and and you know one of the mantras of

00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,120
one of these platforms were even

00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,760
thinking about was move fast and break

00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,760
things

00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:41,520
they move faster than the auditors can

00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,799
you think particularly in the tech world

00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:45,039
that it's going to be a problem

00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:46,799
i mean we see auditing as a marketplace

00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:49,520
is quite mature with regard to

00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:51,360
finance and financial institutions who

00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:53,600
don't necessarily move at the speed of

00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,600
light

00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:58,080
so i think it's definitely a challenge

00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,559
but i don't think it's an insurmountable

00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,240
one

00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:01,760
especially if you acknowledge that we're

00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,080
not talking about

00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,960
dealing with the fast agile small

00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,960
startups

00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,640
we're talking about the large

00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,840
monopolistic or odigo ballistic

00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,559
companies that are already extremely

00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,240
powerful

00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:14,080
and are often using that power for

00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,039
market dominance so when you're looking

00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,960
at those companies

00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:19,600
and when they have considerable effects

00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:21,440
on society i think that they already

00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,880
extract sufficient rents from those

00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,480
societies there's no reason that they

00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,880
can't give back a little in the terms of

00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,919
sort of

00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:30,399
regulatory capacity and just to sort of

00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:31,600
because there's been different things

00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:33,360
mentioned about

00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,799
academia and i'm certainly not able to

00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:37,679
speak for the whole of academia

00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:39,679
but at least in my impression so far i'm

00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:40,399
not sure that academia has the right

00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:43,039
incentives

00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:43,760
to be the auditor in this case and it

00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:45,120
needs to be

00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,559
individuals and organizations that are

00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,360
specifically set up for the purpose of

00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:48,720
volunteering

00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,799
and that would be better in the public

00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:54,480
sector than in the private sector again

00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:57,039
and the the challenges that we

00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:58,320
we are looking at now in how to sort of

00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:00,960
regulate

00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,519
do pose the danger as they have with

00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,320
either

00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:05,120
private similar privacy regulations that

00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,760
you create

00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:09,679
a set of companies able to respond to

00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:11,840
these auditing requirements

00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:13,200
that is exclusive so it becomes

00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:15,200
difficult to become

00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,559
as large as facebook or as google

00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,279
because they are the only companies who

00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:19,360
are able to

00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:21,360
go through this whatever process and

00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,720
that is a challenge i don't think it's

00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,240
an insurmountable one but it's certainly

00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,519
a challenge on how to design this in a

00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,360
way that it's still possible

00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:29,039
to engage in audits without limiting the

00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:31,360
the scale of the company is able to

00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:33,519
comply with it to a select few

00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:35,440
and i would also add that in that

00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:36,159
context it's not just about thinking

00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,159
about

00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:39,679
innovation and development and

00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:41,679
opportunity but

00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:43,279
just to acknowledge that right now the

00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:45,519
existing regulatory

00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:46,799
frameworks and the existing regulators

00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:50,159
aren't able

00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:51,360
to actually understand what these

00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:53,760
platforms are doing

00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,399
so in the the model that we propose it's

00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:57,120
not so much

00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:58,000
linked to the dsa directly is inspired

00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,240
or linked

00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,840
it has a many references to the dsa but

00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:04,240
what we're actually suggesting

00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:05,679
is that even regulators with technical

00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,399
capacity lacking

00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:11,039
should still be able to ask a question

00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:11,760
of a platform and get an answer that is

00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:13,679
not just an

00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:15,360
ad-hoc answer but an answer that

00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:18,159
somebody else has checked

00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:19,440
and that would plausibly also apply to a

00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:20,559
set of civil society groups who could

00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,080
then also go and say

00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:24,000
i have done this really important

00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:26,080
research can you confirm to me

00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,519
that this is actually happening or can

00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,640
you give me a verified statement that

00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:31,279
this is not true

00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:32,880
and this again i don't think it can

00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:34,159
necessarily apply to every single

00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,720
citizen in the world

00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:38,559
but truthful statements are i think the

00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,440
minimum we should be able to expect from

00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:41,440
these platforms

00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:43,120
and it sort of draws on something that i

00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,720
think we've learned over time

00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:46,720
uh for many of the people working on

00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:48,559
privacy which is that the bigger and the

00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,320
more powerful the actors are involved

00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:52,000
you have to assume that the actors will

00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,519
be adversarial which means that

00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,200
essentially you can't trust them

00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:58,399
and so you need a mechanism to create

00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:00,240
trust you can't assume trust by default

00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:01,519
well then as a follow-up question you've

00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,080
mentioned several times you know that

00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:06,720
this you should be sort of public bodies

00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:07,440
how then would you see the relationship

00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,240
between

00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,359
sort of such public body auditors and

00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,960
the regulatory

00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:14,879
organizations the regulatory bodies i

00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:18,639
mean would they simply just be another

00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:18,639
arm of that regulatory body i mean

00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:22,159
uh no no no

00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,159
that's the point so you need a separate

00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:25,520
body that does the auditing there are

00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:26,879
different actors which it could be

00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,919
attached to so for example you could

00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:30,079
think about

00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:31,280
organizations that have a high degree of

00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:32,560
independence already such as the

00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,679
european court of auditors let's say but

00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,639
there are also others which it couldn't

00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:37,440
be attached to

00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:38,399
but the key point about it is that you

00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,000
don't have

00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:42,079
the same regulator asking for

00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,000
information that is also

00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:46,000
accessing the data and so you split

00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,399
those two to ensure that there's one

00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,159
body that is basically independent and

00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:51,839
has access to the data but is not able

00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:53,040
to ask questions and somebody else is

00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:54,000
able to ask questions but doesn't have

00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,359
access to the data

00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,280
and that where you deal with a lot of

00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:58,880
the sort of surveillance concerns and

00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:01,440
limitations in that area

00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,079
um and while at the same time ensuring

00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,000
that

00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:05,920
you don't need this very high degree of

00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,440
technical capacity in every single

00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:10,000
regulator that would need to

00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:12,000
be able to get responses you have your

00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,359
election observers you have your

00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,880
people who are responsible for managing

00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:16,079
the elections you have your dpas you

00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,920
have your media regulators

00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:19,119
all of these regulators have very

00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:21,280
legitimate questions

00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:22,960
to facebook and google and many other

00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,160
large tech organizations but they aren't

00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,079
getting answered right now

00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:28,240
and so enabling them to get solid

00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:30,240
answers is a key

00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:32,400
mechanism that can be developed through

00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:34,560
the dsa and i think very powerfully so

00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,680
but it needs an intermediary that is

00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,680
probably also public

00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:39,200
to ensure that they get answers that are

00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:41,599
actually solid and trustworthy

00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:43,520
and we've seen now so many times like

00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:45,359
there's numerous academic publications

00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,480
civil society publications video reports

00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:49,680
like there's a whole

00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:51,839
wealth of information how

00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:53,119
lacking in truthfulness the statements

00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:54,320
made by large platforms are

00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:56,240
so at a certain point you just need to

00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:59,200
stop and say okay this is

00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:00,320
not acceptable this is not truthful how

00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,000
can we ensure that

00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,680
people who are responsible for

00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,400
regulating are able to do that

00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:06,240
regulating

00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:09,200
and they need some kind of truthful

00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:10,960
information as a basis of doing that

00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,720
alexander what do you think about this

00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,520
model if you like that that ben is

00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:16,800
suggesting

00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:17,440
um do you see any any way it can work it

00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,720
sounds

00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,640
complex but complexity is not

00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:23,359
necessarily wrong but it's just

00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:24,960
i'm also mindful of timing and speed and

00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:26,320
also the limitations of what's actually

00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,320
set out in the dsa

00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,920
it doesn't provide an exhaustive list of

00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:32,160
things that we need to be checking

00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:33,680
um and that list could go on

00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,440
indefinitely when you think about large

00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:38,560
platforms i mean do we need

00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:39,599
more in the dsa that's specific and

00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:42,720
specifying

00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:44,160
what needs to be done um yeah i was i

00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:46,160
was i was listening and i was

00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,839
actually in note-taking mode because

00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:49,599
this was this was really interesting so

00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:51,920
i was just already thinking about how to

00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:54,960
transform this an amendment

00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:56,320
but it's the complexity is challenging

00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,400
as you say

00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:00,000
and i think there might be an issue and

00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:02,640
just you know i'm just thinking aloud

00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,520
um of standardization in some form

00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:07,040
because

00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:08,160
um on the one hand i think you need a

00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:10,240
standard

00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:12,160
what kind of questions can be asked

00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:15,680
because what is in the dsa now

00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:17,680
is um the um the compliance with the

00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:19,760
the obligation set out in chapter three

00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:22,160
and with the codes of conduct

00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:24,079
and you know just by the way this little

00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:25,680
bit answers also the question that was

00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:27,280
asked before the codes of conduct i

00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,000
think that was a more specific question

00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,440
would that were

00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,200
interpreted differently which was a

00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,240
great interpretation because it was also

00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,240
helpful

00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:36,560
um but in europe we have codes of

00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:37,280
conduct on on disinformation hate speech

00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:40,560
and

00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:42,640
child sexual material um but that's

00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:44,480
not exhaustive you know they're more

00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,839
obligations that need to be audited just

00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,359
to answer that question from the

00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:50,960
participant

00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:53,040
um to come back to what ben said

00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,000
i think on the one hand you need to do

00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:56,160
you need a legislative

00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,280
you need a legal basis for the kind of

00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,839
questions you're allowed

00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:01,599
to ask because otherwise that could be a

00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:02,720
little bit arbitrary because you could

00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:04,480
answer ask one

00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:06,240
one platform one question and another

00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:08,240
platform another question

00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:10,560
and that might be some sort of

00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:12,240
discrimination so why are you asking

00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,839
facebook to i don't know do fact

00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:15,359
checking and you don't ask twitter to do

00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:16,720
it or just just as an example they both

00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:19,599
do it but

00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:21,119
um on the other hand that's exactly the

00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:23,119
kind of flexibility

00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:25,119
you would like to have because obviously

00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:26,400
the very large online platforms are very

00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:29,839
different in nature one

00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,720
from another um and i i still don't know

00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:33,680
how to solve that

00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:34,960
exactly i think what ben said was a very

00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:37,599
good hint

00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:40,320
to take up questions asked by different

00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:42,800
kinds of regulatory authorities even

00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:44,320
even in the member states and that this

00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,960
public european

00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:48,640
body would need to make sure that the

00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,960
the questions are asked the right way

00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:52,560
and the answers are truthful or at least

00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,400
checked against some other kind of

00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:56,160
evidence so the public regulator

00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,839
on the european level could say well

00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:59,280
this is the answer we got but

00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:01,119
we don't believe this is right because

00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:02,640
we have other kind of evidence and that

00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:05,280
would you know then we have

00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:06,960
we would have a procedure for that i i i

00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:09,119
think we don't need to be

00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,640
afraid of complexity the world is

00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:12,880
complex

00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:14,000
and i think what we're really facing is

00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,680
that we are living in

00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,079
in democratic societies with

00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:21,280
constitutions that

00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:24,400
are where great in in the 1940s

00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:26,400
late 40s and 50s but they absolutely

00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,800
couldn't foresee what is going on now

00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,320
the kind of globalization of information

00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,560
we have and the kind of

00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,599
so we need to come up with new solutions

00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:36,000
that make sure

00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:36,880
we can we can preserve these democracies

00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,440
and the spirit

00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:42,160
of those constitutions and that is

00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:45,440
necessarily complex

00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:46,960
um in terms of speed um

00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,960
well i think it depends and what ben

00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,640
said we know you get you get a question

00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,680
from a regulatory authority and then you

00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,359
get an answer and that

00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,880
doesn't takes more than a few weeks

00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:56,480
definitely

00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,560
but that's the time we need to do

00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:00,960
thorough work i mean i think that's

00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:02,800
the burden of democracy but it's also

00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,160
the fact that yeah then you do things

00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,839
in a thorough way and you find a

00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:07,920
consensus and i think it's important to

00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:10,160
take that time

00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:11,440
thinking about this complexity and it's

00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:13,280
really occurring to me as

00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,720
i'm listening to you speakers is there

00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:18,079
any way that

00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:19,680
the recent ai proposals have taken a

00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:22,640
risk-based approach

00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:24,240
might somehow be allowed to put into a

00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:25,680
model that will allow flexibility

00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:27,200
depending on where you see the risks

00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,520
with each particular platform i mean i'd

00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,280
say

00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,560
as you said you don't ask the same thing

00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,720
of every platform

00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:33,920
but maybe you form some sort of a

00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:37,440
pyramid of risk

00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:39,119
for each platform well

00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,800
i would need to think about that i think

00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:43,280
the ai proposal

00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:45,200
really is not up to the task because the

00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:46,240
ai proposal treats artificial

00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:49,359
intelligence

00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:50,800
applications and context as if there

00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:52,240
were can openers

00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:54,079
you know that just have the same

00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:55,839
standard it's just a technical center

00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:57,200
that's a ce standard to make sure you

00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:58,560
know that the toys you buy for your

00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,800
child are safe

00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,680
and it just completely ignores all the

00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:04,800
societal

00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:08,640
concerns around ai um

00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:10,960
so notified boxes have to check whether

00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:12,400
the ai applications um you know they

00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:14,400
have to go through these conformity

00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:16,640
assessments

00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:18,400
but i i just don't think it's enough

00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:20,240
because as long as the technical

00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:22,319
specifications are sort of fulfilled or

00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:23,920
the technical obligations you get that

00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:25,599
conformity assessment and the big

00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:27,680
questions are not asked

00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:29,119
so i i don't think that's particularly

00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,640
inspiring i thought it was in the

00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:32,240
beginning when i read it the first time

00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:34,000
i thought oh this is great for the dsa

00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:36,160
and then i realized i i

00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,000
don't think it is i think their article

00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:40,640
26 might be

00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,680
might be uh more interesting when where

00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:43,520
the risk decides

00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:45,599
assessments are defined i mean that's

00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:47,200
something to work on because there are

00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:48,880
more questions asked i think that's

00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:50,560
important to have that openness to ask

00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:51,760
the big questions about democracy about

00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:53,680
the environment

00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:56,160
about bias and i'm not really seeing

00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:58,000
that in the ai proposal

00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:59,440
well i don't mean to get us off track

00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,119
because we're talking about dsa today

00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,720
but i was just i saw some parallels that

00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:04,720
might be worth exploring

00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:06,319
debbie we have a question from an

00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:10,480
anonymous attendee

00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:12,720
um asking how do specifically for you

00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:14,480
asking how do we ensure that auditors

00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,280
can meaningfully scrutinize very large

00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:17,760
platforms

00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:19,040
given their sheer size and complexity of

00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,960
business practices

00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:22,160
will companies not simply engage in data

00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:25,040
dump practices that

00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:26,079
issue analysis i mean i think i can

00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:29,599
guess your answer but

00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:32,160
uh yes

00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:33,599
they do that a lot um i i just have to

00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:35,119
sorry i just have to react to some of

00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:38,960
what has been said before

00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:40,079
um uh uh just speaking from experience i

00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,520
guess as a

00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:43,440
as someone that's played the role of an

00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:46,480
external auditor through ajl

00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:49,520
um and we've audited you know ibm and

00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:51,599
uh and microsoft and amazon products

00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:53,520
and i just want to comment on speed

00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:56,560
which is a um

00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:58,800
i i do think these companies people over

00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:59,920
uh so on one hand yes these are very

00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,920
large companies

00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:03,119
um for the entire company to make a

00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:06,000
decision especially a

00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:07,839
legal liability related decision will

00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,880
will take a longer time

00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:12,400
um but the ai machine learning

00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:14,720
groups at these companies are actually

00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:18,000
quite small amazon's

00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:19,280
aws um facial recognition team was less

00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,640
than 20 people

00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,400
um and they were building products that

00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:25,119
were deployed on you know

00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:26,079
um you know hundreds of thousands of

00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:28,000
people if not

00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:29,680
through their ring product uh you know

00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,520
now they're partnered with you know 400

00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:32,800
police departments affecting who knows

00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:34,880
how many people so

00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,160
at google you know they're they're

00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,280
they're product teams around

00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:39,359
machine learning products that are

00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:41,280
affecting you know millions

00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:44,079
uh tens of millions of users are very

00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:45,440
small so i wouldn't underestimate

00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:47,359
uh the ability of some of these

00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:48,960
companies to move quickly um

00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:50,400
once we audited the facial recognition

00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,119
products of these big companies you know

00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:54,240
they made their

00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:55,680
updates within seven months so um i just

00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:58,000
wanted to comment on that i

00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:59,359
i just want to make sure that there's

00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,599
clarity around the fact that yeah

00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:04,960
although these are very large companies

00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:06,880
us often in terms of like you know who

00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:08,079
how large is the team at facebook

00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,920
working on

00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:11,680
these recommendation systems that are

00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:13,680
you know shaping the newsfeed or twitter

00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:15,440
who's working on moderation it could be

00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,720
large teams or it could be quite small

00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:19,280
teams um

00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:20,400
that's not always necessarily clear i

00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,920
just wanted to make that as a comment

00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:23,200
and then also comment on ben's point

00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:24,079
around you know having different

00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:27,359
regulatory

00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:28,720
agencies in charge of collecting data

00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:29,920
and then another sort of regulatory

00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:32,319
agency to ask

00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:34,000
questions about that data i do think

00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:36,319
that there definitely should be

00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,520
regulatory oversight of auditors there

00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:40,640
definitely should be

00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:42,880
a regulatory agency collecting data

00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:44,480
um but the value of having external

00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,599
auditors being the ones to ask the

00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:47,680
questions is that

00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:49,680
they represent very specific communities

00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:50,960
so you have you know

00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,640
groups like data for black lives

00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:53,920
representing the interests of you know

00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:56,800
african americans

00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:58,400
um or you know uh different there's a

00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:59,760
there's a there's an advocacy group that

00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,720
represents the interests of those that

00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,520
are going through the immigration

00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,960
process

00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:04,880
and they have a completely different set

00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:08,000
of questions that regulators will not

00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:08,960
think to ask about um the system itself

00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,359
so including

00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:14,000
and providing access to these external

00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:16,800
auditors particularly advocacy groups

00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,520
um kind of opens things up where each

00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,839
community

00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:21,520
now has an opportunity to ask the

00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:22,640
questions that are relevant to their own

00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:24,400
community

00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:25,760
and that's a really important

00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:27,920
contribution

00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:29,520
of external auditors in general to this

00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:31,040
space i just wanted to make those

00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:32,480
comments sorry

00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:34,240
before digging into the question that

00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:36,560
you asked um

00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:38,160
which is yeah do do kind of do auditors

00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,800
get overwhelmed with sort of these data

00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,720
dumps

00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:42,960
uh i actually think there's uh in the

00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:43,680
dsa they're in the dsa article draft

00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:46,880
there's

00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:47,599
a lot of opportunity for the off the

00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:49,760
sort of

00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:51,040
frequent excuse you get when you demand

00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:53,839
for information is

00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:54,160
uh you know trade secrets um or privacy

00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:57,440
and

00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:59,920
those two excuses are sort of uh viable

00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:02,000
uh you know uh loopholes and back doors

00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:02,480
that you know are mentioned in the dsa

00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,720
as

00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:06,079
uh valid excuses for a company not to

00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,280
provide information so i think that

00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:09,599
that's already

00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:10,319
um you know something that you notice

00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:12,720
right away

00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:14,079
reading the article is that um yeah a

00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:16,160
company can claim that

00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:17,359
um you know for privacy reasons or trade

00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,640
secret reasons they won't share

00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:20,319
information at all

00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:22,560
or when they do share information they

00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:24,480
don't share and this happens

00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:26,400
more often than not they don't share

00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:28,079
sort of the data dictionary

00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:29,599
or um you know every so everything is

00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:31,920
sort of uh

00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:33,839
you know uh you might have all these uh

00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:36,240
symbols and acronyms and none of it

00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:38,400
actually defined in a meaningful way

00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:39,359
or um and this happens often if you

00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:41,359
demand for

00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:43,839
access to a code base um they'll share

00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:46,560
the code but then they will remove

00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:48,319
the um you know the parts of the code

00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:50,640
that they see as sort of

00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:52,079
property technology and thus you can't

00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:54,160
actually run the code

00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:55,440
um or you can actually read the code

00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:57,520
because it's not well commented and

00:46:55,440 --> 00:47:00,640
there's not information available there

00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:01,440
um so that definitely um does happen as

00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:04,400
well where

00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:07,119
uh you know just having access to all

00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:09,599
the information in a disorganized way

00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:10,400
is not helpful um i'm not sure if that

00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:13,359
was the question

00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:15,520
um that was axed around um the data

00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:18,720
dumps

00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:19,680
oh sorry i said a lot of things at once

00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:21,119
it was just a question came in at

00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:22,240
exactly the same time it's you were

00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:24,880
wrapping up there

00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:26,960
okay it is an interesting one um

00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:27,520
regarding advocacy groups in poland and

00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:30,079
hungary

00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:31,839
who are looking want to see how

00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:33,040
platforms are suppressing anti-abortion

00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:35,599
content for interests

00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:37,680
in instance um and how do you prevent

00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:39,040
those groups from getting access to data

00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:40,240
or should they have the same right to

00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:41,920
demand such access

00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:43,760
does this boil down to the question of

00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:47,359
who is a legitimate

00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:48,079
ngo i mean i suppose you you know you

00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:50,240
can't

00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:51,680
you know you mentioned different rights

00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:53,680
based

00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:54,800
so perhaps that's wonder i mean briefly

00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:55,520
before because we are running out of

00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:58,319
time

00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:59,040
what's your take on that yeah i i like i

00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:00,640
mentioned i

00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:02,400
i agree with alexandra there should be

00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:04,240
regulatory oversight over

00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:06,240
um you know uh who gets to call

00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:08,880
themselves an auditor um

00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:09,359
and uh there should definitely be you

00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:13,119
know

00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:16,160
um uh an understanding or

00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:18,000
um a set a bar set by by

00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:19,200
the government as to who's sort of a

00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,200
qualified

00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:22,319
uh auditor that can have that can demand

00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:25,599
that access

00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:27,359
um and you know in terms of like

00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:30,160
representing particular interests and

00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:32,000
particular you know political objectives

00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:34,240
i do think that there there does need to

00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,160
be the current situation at the moment

00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:37,280
is that these companies are so closed

00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,960
off or

00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:40,319
um you know the information that they

00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:44,079
provide uh

00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:44,640
is so inaccessible uh that if i as a

00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:47,119
citizen

00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:49,200
or you know i as a sort of member of a

00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:50,880
community group or an advocacy group

00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:52,640
have you know important questions

00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:54,319
related to my community

00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:56,000
uh in which you know i'm affected by

00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:56,400
this technology and i have questions

00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,400
about

00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:00,880
you know exactly how that technology

00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:02,559
affects me or i want to investigate that

00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:05,119
the perceived impact of this technology

00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:05,680
in my own life um i don't have avenues

00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:08,160
or

00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:10,160
access to opportunities to to voice this

00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:12,400
concern and be taken seriously

00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:14,079
um and i don't have avenues or access to

00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,960
opportunities to actually investigate

00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:17,920
that or audit that

00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:19,520
myself or you know contribute to an

00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:22,800
audit of that of that sort

00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:25,599
so i do think that there's definitely um

00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:26,960
value in giving you know regular

00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:29,440
citizens

00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:30,000
the opportunity to either you know

00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:32,559
communicate

00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,640
with their advocacy group with their

00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:37,359
sort of related advocacy group

00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:39,280
and have you know some level of

00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:41,040
participation in the audit process i

00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:42,559
think if regulators are the only ones

00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:45,040
coming up with questions

00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:46,880
uh there's going to be a lot of uh

00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:49,280
relevant questions that won't

00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:50,079
necessarily be axed of these companies

00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:51,680
um

00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:53,599
so i think that's sort of my stance on

00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:56,800
that and with respect to you know how

00:49:53,599 --> 00:50:00,000
valid that organizational objective is

00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:02,319
um you know how it might how the the

00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,520
the sort of advocacy group may or may

00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:05,280
not represent

00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:07,359
you know particular political positions

00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:08,640
or polit particular interests

00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:10,880
um i think that that's up to the

00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:13,599
regulator to sort of decide

00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:14,319
which advocacy groups or which auditors

00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:17,040
um

00:50:14,319 --> 00:50:18,800
you know should have that opportunity to

00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:20,079
investigate or to ask these questions of

00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:21,599
these companies

00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:23,599
but ultimately it plays down to the fact

00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:24,960
that if the regulators are coming up

00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:25,839
with these questions on their own

00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:28,800
they're gonna miss

00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:29,440
important questions um i don't think

00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,839
every

00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:33,359
com every you know every advocacy group

00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:34,240
should have access to that information

00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:35,760
directly

00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:38,240
but i definitely think that there should

00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:39,359
be an opportunity given to external

00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:41,520
auditors to make

00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:42,720
to make those demands to sort of put in

00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:43,760
that foia request

00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:46,319
in the same way that you can have

00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:49,359
journalists from any kind of publication

00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:51,119
um you know make that request um uh to

00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:53,920
access public information

00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:55,680
uh i do think that there's uh you know

00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:59,040
there should be that level of

00:50:55,680 --> 00:51:01,040
um access or transparency granted to

00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:02,960
uh external auditing or uh bodies or

00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:06,160
other sort of external auditor

00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:07,599
organizations and advocacy groups well

00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:09,599
you've raised some challenges there and

00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:10,720
provided some i think good potential

00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:12,720
solutions

00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:14,000
and as we are sort of for the last five

00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:15,920
minutes ben let me go to you

00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,839
uh you know how the sausage is made here

00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:19,520
in brussels we're at the amendment stage

00:51:17,839 --> 00:51:23,200
everyone's having a look at this

00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:24,240
um what would you want to see added in

00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:27,920
or taken out

00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:29,119
or elaborated on in in the recitals of

00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:33,200
either as it may in

00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:34,160
in the article um in the dsa what what's

00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:37,440
your

00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:38,880
you know call at this point

00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:41,119
well it's not like there's anybody here

00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:43,040
who would be possibly able to submit

00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:44,000
those amendments right so like that does

00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:46,079
of course make things

00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,040
a lot easier when we're in that

00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:50,559
situation

00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:52,800
i think i i am not so

00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:53,680
well versed in brussels legal language

00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,680
that i would

00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:58,000
uh like say this specific wording or

00:51:55,680 --> 00:52:00,160
these exact words need to be in place

00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,599
i think that it's more amendments that

00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:02,800
would need to take place which is carry

00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:03,760
the spirit of the conversation the

00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:05,599
future had

00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:07,119
and to make sure that the the the

00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:07,680
mechanisms that are in place and that

00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:09,599
the

00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:11,280
procedures that are in place respond to

00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:13,520
capture respond to conflict of interest

00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:15,760
respond to the challenges associated

00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:17,359
with a private or public sector

00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:18,880
marketplace potentially or lack of a

00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:20,559
marketplace being chosen

00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:22,640
and i really think there's potential

00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:24,319
there to you mentioned beforehand the

00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:26,400
sort of the ai regulation

00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:28,079
and how it sort of it took a path

00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,640
towards let's say a slightly more

00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:31,440
limited

00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:33,599
perspective on that and i think that

00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:35,599
there's still the potential for the dsa

00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:38,079
to be something bigger and to really be

00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:39,760
like this this potential gdpr for speech

00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:41,359
which is really the basic framework

00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:43,440
where we have a set of rules and

00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:44,880
regulations that are far more general

00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:46,000
one thing that i think is important

00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:47,839
because we were discussed a bit in the

00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:50,319
context of complexity and

00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:51,599
just to mention again i think the the

00:52:50,319 --> 00:52:53,119
statements made here in the report

00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:55,040
published by benoit luttrell is

00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:56,960
extremely helpful from 2019

00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:58,880
where he basically is a former french

00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:00,880
regulator essentially saying that

00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:02,240
the the companies are so evasive in how

00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:04,000
they provide you information

00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:05,280
that you constantly need to be able to

00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,760
ask them different questions again and

00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:07,040
again

00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:08,640
and you can't just fix a set of

00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:09,119
questions and legislation and then

00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:11,440
expect

00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:12,720
those questions for work and just also

00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:14,880
to completely agree with what deborah

00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:17,599
said i think it's very valid

00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:19,119
i was trying to suggest perhaps that

00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:20,720
some civil society groups or some

00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:22,240
organizations who ask questions

00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:24,319
might not have the technical capacity

00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:25,119
and so might want just the answer rather

00:53:24,319 --> 00:53:26,720
than the data

00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:28,559
but i don't think that should preclude

00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:30,880
organizations from being able to

00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:32,720
find out themselves because that is a

00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:33,760
like a an increasingly important

00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:35,200
dimension of

00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:37,440
if you're affected by this and have the

00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:38,160
technical capacity why should that be

00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,760
impossible

00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:41,359
again with all of the difficulties and

00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:42,640
limitations and restrictions of you need

00:53:41,359 --> 00:53:43,440
a process for that that makes it safe

00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:44,880
and secure

00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:47,359
and that creates accountability and

00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:49,119
avoids capture but

00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:50,240
i think that the this is really not a

00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:52,000
question that should be posed to me but

00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:54,240
to alexandra because she's in a

00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,280
far better position to write the right

00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:57,119
amendments and

00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:58,800
to really influence this in a positive

00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:00,000
direction

00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:01,920
well then i am going to put that to

00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,079
alexandria now so

00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:06,079
i mean you're a note-taking mode you're

00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:06,880
in amendment drafting mode at this point

00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:08,960
i suppose

00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:10,480
what are your takeaways then from this

00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:11,359
we can't solve it in one hour but we

00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:13,280
have had a pretty

00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:14,480
good stab at getting to the main points

00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:16,720
today

00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:18,319
yes sort of everything actually as i

00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:19,599
said i'm really in no taking mode so i

00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:20,960
was i was i was happy for

00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:22,480
about the question because i was

00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:24,079
expecting now ben to enumerate the

00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:25,839
amendments and i was just supposed to

00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:28,800
take note on table them

00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:29,599
um well not going to happen i know um

00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:32,880
yeah i think the

00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:35,760
the idea of um having a public

00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:38,160
regulator and then a flourishing

00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:39,359
hopefully industry of different kind of

00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:42,880
auditing bodies

00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:45,359
is is very interesting um where

00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:46,960
the the public regulator is going into a

00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:49,040
different article i suppose because

00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:51,040
there's this very complicated oversight

00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:51,440
architecture and i would have to look at

00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:53,839
that

00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:54,559
i mean we're looking into that again and

00:54:53,839 --> 00:54:56,160
already

00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:58,559
and it needs to be somehow

00:54:56,160 --> 00:55:02,160
interconnected obviously

00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:04,400
um definitely this issue of who asked

00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:06,240
the questions and who has access to the

00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:08,000
data this is something that i hadn't

00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:08,400
come up with i have to admit so that's

00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,160
very

00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:13,119
interesting and i think deborah's point

00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:13,839
on on advocacy groups being able to ask

00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:15,520
the questions

00:55:13,839 --> 00:55:17,119
is really really important because this

00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:18,960
is something that's completely missing

00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:20,960
from the dsa and it's completely missing

00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:21,760
from the ai regulation and i've really

00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:24,880
been looking for

00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:27,200
for a solution how to bring that back in

00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:28,240
so i think that's that's that's really

00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:31,119
interesting

00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:32,079
um also the issue what what is still

00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:34,319
unsolved

00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:35,680
um i think is the issue of the you know

00:55:34,319 --> 00:55:36,480
what we call in your the polish or

00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:38,559
hungarian

00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:40,880
issue you know ngos or somehow

00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:42,079
government funded ngos asking questions

00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:44,319
to game the system

00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:46,400
rate and then to take off abortion

00:55:44,319 --> 00:55:48,640
content and stuff like that

00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:50,720
that's really i'm not sure because

00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:53,280
that's obviously a very very political

00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:55,760
choice to make for a regulator

00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:57,440
and that that's still difficult and if

00:55:55,760 --> 00:56:00,240
anybody has any input

00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:00,559
we are grateful just to come to us we

00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:02,240
are

00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:04,480
in amendment writing mode and i think we

00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:06,319
will we will get back to experts and

00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:08,400
certainly to ban or we already

00:56:06,319 --> 00:56:10,559
always already in touch with and i would

00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:13,599
be very happy to talk to deborah

00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:15,280
as well to to look into this further but

00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:17,839
this was this was extremely helpful for

00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:19,760
my work so thank you so much for that

00:56:17,839 --> 00:56:21,359
and thank you alexandra it's wonderful

00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:23,119
to you know it is good to have someone

00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:24,720
on these discussions who is

00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:26,720
in the position you're in to be able to

00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:27,920
actually say well we're looking at doing

00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:29,040
this and so uh

00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:31,040
people can feel that they've actually

00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:32,960
been heard with these concerns and

00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:34,720
um i mentioned the sausage making

00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:35,200
machine we know how it goes with these

00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:36,640
laws

00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:38,160
you put an awful lot in and it's

00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:38,960
sometimes not clear to people on the

00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:40,720
outside

00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:42,240
how amendments get drafted and how and

00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:44,160
how concerns are made

00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:46,559
