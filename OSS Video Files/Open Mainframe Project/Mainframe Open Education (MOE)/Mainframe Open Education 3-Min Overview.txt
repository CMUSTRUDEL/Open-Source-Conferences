hi

00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,719
my name is lauren valente head of

00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:16,400
education and customer engagement within

00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:17,680
the mainframe software division at

00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,520
broadcom

00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,560
i'm here today to talk to you about the

00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:25,439
mainframe open education project

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,760
we've seen the technology industry has

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,920
had a need to replenish the aging

00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,199
workforce with talented and skilled

00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,920
professionals

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,880
new hire managers for example don't know

00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,600
where to get their

00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,680
education materials yes they can talk to

00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,480
partners like us in ibm

00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,440
and get our materials from our site but

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,000
there is not

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,879
a collection of education materials out

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,520
there today

00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:51,600
that includes the unique expertise of

00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,840
the mainframe community

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,120
there's also a lack of a community

00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,120
support platform

00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,600
where experts can share their knowledge

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,600
and their materials

00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,760
now the open mainframe project has

00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,960
helped fill the gaps in its mentoring

00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,840
ship program

00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:09,280
the kobo project and will now take it a

00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,320
step further

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,080
with this new education project the

00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,799
mainframe open education

00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,000
project will offer a convenient easy to

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,680
use platform

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,439
through which the experts can share

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,920
their up-to-date materials

00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:26,400
and even foster collaboration with the

00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,799
broader mainframe community

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,119
and what's the result we're looking to

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,520
provide a clear learning path for those

00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:35,600
to have a rewarding career

00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,640
we're looking to close that technology

00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,759
skills gap

00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,079
by offering materials at no cost or even

00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,119
low

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:45,439
cost and then we're also looking to

00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,640
open opportunities for community support

00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,119
and engagement

00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,720
where experts and seasoned professionals

00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:54,399
can now share their knowledge

00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,960
and best practices right now the project

00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,680
has

00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,360
recently started where we have a court

00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,640
team that not only

00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:04,640
represents broadcom and ibm but now we

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,960
have representation from the industry

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,720
and academia area

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,680
since we can't boil the ocean with the

00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:14,319
mainframe we need to start somewhere

00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,120
and thought it was best to launch this

00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,319
as a phased

00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:21,599
approach we can't do this on our own

00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:24,160
we need the community's help your help

00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:26,160
there is a wealth of passionate subject

00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,239
matter experts out there today

00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,000

00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,519
to retire
