and i am a part of the core team on the

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,520
mainframe open education

00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,840
project and i'm joined by lauren valenci

00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:25,039
okay hi lauren hi everyone hi

again thank you so much and i manage the

00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,720
mainframe education and customer

00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,199
engagement at broadcom

00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:34,239
and i am also part of the core team for

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,239
the mainframe open education project

00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,320
so we will be spending some time with

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:41,600
you today um talking about

00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,120
what the project is and um how we are

00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,719
reaching out to the community and hoping

00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,840
that you all will join us

00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:50,079
to help bring this project to life more

00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,160
um so we're just going to go ahead and

00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:55,360
dive into the agenda and take a look at

00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,360
what we'll be covering today

00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,120
all right so we got to start off with

00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,559
the why

00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:06,240
so what is it why do we have it

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,760
and then we are going to go through a

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,720
little bit of role play to go through

00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,920
the context

00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,600
of um how this all came about what needs

00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,040
we're trying to address

00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,119
and then of course we'll dive into what

00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,720
exactly is the open mainframe project

00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,240
and what we've been doing

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,080
um we're going to go through a little

00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,439
bit of the framework that we've been

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,200
putting together

00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:26,720
and then of course a call to action so

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,479
really for those of you that are joining

00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,280
us or maybe later on watching us on the

00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:32,159
replay

00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,439
um how you can help how you can join in

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,799
um

00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,799
how we hope to interact with you

00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,119
all right we're ready for some role play

00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,439
so lauren and i are very

00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:44,799
not professionally trained actors i

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,000
won't be getting you know a call from

00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,360
the academy uh

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,040
you know for an award for this but we're

00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:52,159
gonna take you through

00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:55,600
uh a little scenario okay

00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:57,280
so let me kick it off hey jen i have a

00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,840
resource within our company

00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,320
that wants to join our mainframe team

00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,399
they're

00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,560
new to the mainframe and boy are they

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,560
hungry to learn about it

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,239
now i feel this person is such a huge

00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,920
win for the organization

00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,920
they have the drive they have the

00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,920
passion that we're looking for

00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,920
but i want to make sure i have the right

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,360
resources and the training for them to

00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,879
start taking

00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,599
even an understanding of what the

00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,239
mainframe is or the history the role it

00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,959
plays

00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,160
and what it's even used for but i can't

00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,160
seem to find

00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,319
any of that anywhere do we have

00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,840
something that you know of

00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,680
have you checked our uh learning

00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,280
management system there's anything on

00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,280
there

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,879
yes and we do have some material but

00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,000
that doesn't give the overview that i'm

00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,239
looking for

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,840
also like any basic mainframe

00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,760
foundational technology that they're

00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,319
going to need to understand

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,080
we have some but not all and it would be

00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,800
great to get more of the some of the

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,200
hands-on

00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,440
lab activity and even some kind of

00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,800
learning path

00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,720
well you know we can reach out to some

00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,360
of our partners and see if they can

00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,640
be helpful in the gaps um maybe if you

00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,959
could come up with a list

00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,720
of what it is that you're looking for

00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,319
and we can take a look at what the gaps

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,920
are and then we can try to figure out

00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,040
where to get the resources from

00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,560
and we've got some really awesome

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,080
partners we can reach out to you so we

00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,680
can always ask ibm

00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,519
you know if they've got any courses or

00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,200
some of our other partners and

00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,000
and see and then worst case maybe we

00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,560
look to build it ourselves

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,519
okay i was hoping to have something

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,920
in-house

00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,760
i wish there was one location that we

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,519
can just send our resources to

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,200
and get what is needed to learn about

00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,879
the mainframe it's so

00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,239
important for them to understand the

00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,480
basics and the background of the

00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:41,120
mainframe itself

00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,000
wouldn't that be awesome um good luck

00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,480
finding it though

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
um everything in my experience is just

00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,000
kind of spread throughout the web

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,319
it's you know who had what is it still

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,120
updated you know how do you find it

00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:54,159
is it so accurate so you know good luck

00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,760
if you do find anything you think is

00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:57,760
valuable let me know it's always good to

00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:01,280
kind of bookmark that

00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,799
thanks jen yeah so

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,959
i don't know about any of you guys does

00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,400
this sound familiar you can um

00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,000
you know i think you can raise your hand

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,799
or you can um yeah you can you can raise

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,959
your hand

00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,319
um but yeah i think this is like

00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,920
scenarios we all

00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:18,000
feel and experience which is exactly why

00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,120
this mainframe open education project

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,840
came around

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,120
um we get new hires or we meet people or

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,720
maybe we work with other people just

00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,479
want to understand more

00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,680
about the mainframe technology that we

00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,000
all get the privilege of working on

00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,800
every

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,560
day um but it's hard like especially if

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,639
you want hands-on like where do you go

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,479
how do you have any labs even if you

00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,720
have a system like

00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,080
who's gonna make labs and try to keep

00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,600
them current where you can get those

00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,280
experiences

00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:48,639
so this is where the idea came from

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,639
so we'll go to the next slide

00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,120
all right so the mainframe open

00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,000
education mission

00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:00,320
is to offer all of the mainstream users

00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,600
a platform to cultivate skills

00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,000
that are going to be the most critical

00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,280
to future hires and to allow them for

00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,600
knowledge sharing and community

00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,479
contribution

00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,520
why well it's to make it easier for

00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:14,000
hiring managers

00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,759
to have access to a plan um and to

00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,160
co-develop valuable assets

00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,600
um which so much of it is in the minds

00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,680
and the archives of our

00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,720
organizations and you know everybody

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,160
we've worked with

00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,840
whether it's you know five years 10

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,120
years 20 years 30 years

00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,960
it's amazing how much we all know and

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,560
retain and we just kind of have around

00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,320
and so it's a chance to finally get to

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,919
share that and pull it all together and

00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,520
have a community resource instead of

00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:37,680
having it in our own kind of

00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,840
little back pockets in our own parts of

00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,840
the world

00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:43,919
um so with that the open the mainframe

00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:46,080
open education project

00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,120
the goal is to have a single source open

00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,120
platform

00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,560
um so any individual can contribute

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,199
their knowledge and collaborate with

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,840
others

00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,800
so maybe that's a retiree maybe that's a

00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,520
software vendor

00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,680
maybe it's technical leads um maybe it's

00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,919
people in education like lauren like

00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,280
whoever i might be that can contribute

00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,800
to the vast amount of mainstream

00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,680
knowledge and leave a legacy for the

00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,479
future

00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,080
so there's thousands of experts that are

00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,440
in the market

00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,800
and they they do want to pass on what

00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,199
they know to the next generation to get

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:18,560
them ready for the jobs that await them

00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,759
um we are in the early stage stages of

00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,560
the project so

00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,759
the project uh wasn't announced last

00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,280
september

00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,440
and now we're really ready to move

00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,120
forward with identifying work streams

00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,000
and developing the process to obtain

00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,319
content

00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,520
so kind of the brief summary of it is is

00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:39,199
or the goal is the content will exist

00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:40,880
through the project um at this point

00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,880
it's not necessarily planned but could

00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,520
be looked to to actually have it as like

00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,600
a

00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,840
course you could go through but the idea

00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:51,039
is to have

00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:53,759
modules of material labs

00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,960
quizzes or questions and answers that

00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,800
you could come

00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,319
and help contribute to to create but

00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,199
then also if you're looking to help

00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,479
teach people

00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,240
you could come pick up what you might

00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,520
need to fill the gaps for what you have

00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,960
or what you know

00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,520
to teach them what it is that you'd like

00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,520
them to learn

00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:16,000
we'll go to the next slide okay

00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,360
so as jen explained in the last few

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,759
months the core team

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,800
we pulled together a phased approach of

00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:24,080
the framework or

00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:27,280
i should say structure and this is what

00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,720
based on what the core team thought even

00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,039
through our very own personal

00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:34,080
experiences working with our customers

00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:36,639
our new hires that we're on boarding etc

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,599
and that's why it's so important for us

00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,919
to ensure

00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:42,319
that you see this as a community and

00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:44,879
provide your feedback as well

00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,720
and again this is about our mainframe

00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,400
community and your needs

00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,479
it's not about what we think it should

00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,120
be it's about getting your collective

00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:54,639
feedback

00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:56,960
on what this this whole thing should be

00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:59,039
about and what we should be providing

00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,319
what you see here is just that starting

00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,400
point but again

00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,319
it's about getting your help in making

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,960
sure that it is addressing

00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,160
what is needed for the community itself

00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,879
we are conducting

00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,000
a survey currently as we speak to gather

00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,680
this input from each

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,919
of you in which we'll review the next

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,960
slides that jen will talk about as well

00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:21,680
uh we know we all know

00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,199
we know how big this space is we can't

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,879
boil the ocean right now

00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:27,840
but we need to be able to start

00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:29,919
somewhere and the focus on this project

00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,120
is really on the foundations of the

00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:33,120
mainframe

00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,320
now you can access the survey through

00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,760
our slack channel

00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:40,320
at a pound omp dash education dash

00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,240
project or on our mainframe open

00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,040
education page on our omp

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,200
website there is a link to access and

00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:49,279
again this is just an example

00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,959
we're just i think it's the next the

00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,600
next slide actually i'm going to talk

00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,399
about the

00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,519
example as you can see here this is just

00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,000
an example

00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,920
of the topics that we figured that we

00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,839
would talk about in phase one

00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,920
and this is what we have in the survey

00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,880
that we really want to get your feedback

00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,040
on

00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,320
we want to understand are we hitting the

00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,560
right topics

00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,399
are we missing any areas that you feel

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,640
that we should really really spend time

00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,200
on

00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,680
and getting more content for you to help

00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,120
or

00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:20,720
is this is this really why this is why

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,279
i should say this is why we need your

00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,040
help in getting what we need for this

00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:27,040
and again it's not for ourselves but

00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,279
those who are beginning to learn

00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:32,560
about the mainframe and getting them the

00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,560
help that they need as well

00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:39,760
and we can move to the next slide

00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:41,920
all right so what does that mean

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,360
to you who are joining us are watching

00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,640

the community is

00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,880
involved so the core teams tried to get

00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,560
a good start and we're trying to set the

00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,680
processes and the directions for

00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:35,600

all right so just a good recap of all of

00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,120
the open mainframe projects

00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:53,040
there are so many and it's always

00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,320
growing um that enables

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,600
more innovation um i think we're all

00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,120
familiar with stewie it was i think

00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,560
really kind of the first big splash

00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,680
where we all got really familiar with

00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,839
omp

00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,200
um but there's a really awesome cobalt

00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,279
programming course

00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,240
that's um a graduated open mainframe

00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:10,079
project

00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,079
um but then there's also a working group

00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,680
for cobalt um

00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:15,360
so many ways that you can contribute

00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,839
there's a really cool software discovery

00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,920
tool

00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,360
project um i've got some teammates that

00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,120
are working on it so i'm always checking

00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,959
in because i've had a lot of interest

00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,720
um to be able to see like how they're

00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,399
going to make that work

00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,800

and it looks like there's links to the

00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,560
to the survey into the mainframe

00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,200

00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,680
contributing to them

00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:19,040
all right and now it's time to open it

00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:21,839
up for q a so i believe everybody is on

00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:23,279
mute so i believe the q a will be

00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,880
through the chat

00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:28,320
and we'll just read the questions out

00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,320
loud and try to respond to those

00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:34,399
and just another uh as as jen was

00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,880
talking about the

00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:38,560
how how we're going to in slack the

00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,560
slack channel itself that's one of the

00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:43,279
things that we talked about as a core

00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,000
team is opening that up we have like a

00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:46,800
trello board

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,240
that we're working on and we want to be

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,160
able to share that with you

00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,760
so that you could see the things that

00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,279
we're working on and there are some

00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,600
struggles that we're having right you

00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,680
know

00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,160
like for instance getting access to a

00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,920
mainframe so that people can play

00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,600
so that's one of the things that we are

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,560
talking about and i understand from a

00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,079
larger omp

00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,920
perspective it's an issue so that's

00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,480
something that we are working on as an

00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,440
omp

00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,600
organization which is phenomenal um so

00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,240
that that is being talked about

00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:16,160
but the other things are is you know how

00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,720
we're breaking it up into work streams

00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,800
and

00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,480
you know how we can get people like

00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,680
yourselves to be part of those work

00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,399
streams to help us

00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:26,079
review content or contribute content how

00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,839
do we want it to look like

00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,759
so there's a lot of like i said there's

00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,839
like this there's a starting point but

00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:34,160
we also need the community's help

00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,759
in involving especially those who are

00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,959
new to the mainframe it would be great

00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:40,000
to hear from you

00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:42,720
as to going through this and you know

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,639
us getting your feedback as well on that

00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,759
so it looks like we do have a question

00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:49,120
here

00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:52,240
we do so are there

00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:54,240
okay no no go ahead jen are there ways

00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,680
to involve community college or early

00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,680
training programs

00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,759
or are these programs more oriented

00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:01,120
towards working adults and companies so

00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,680
lauren do you want to go first

00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,720
yeah to me it's for everyone it's not

00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:08,399
just those who

00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:10,720
are you know changing mid-career or

00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:13,040
you know those who are uh to me it's

00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,959
about even the students right we want to

00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,880
make sure that they're also involved and

00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:19,279
here you know the more we know the more

00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:21,279
people the colleges that get involved

00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:22,800
i know we have bob dahlberg who's

00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:24,800
involved in this as well

00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,800
so the more that these universities can

00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:29,839
also leverage the better that we

00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:32,079
that we're in yeah and all

00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:33,120
onto that so completely agree so it is

00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:36,560
for everybody

00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:38,000
it's for um the community colleges for

00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,440
the early training programs it's for

00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,880
universities as well as

00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,560
you know companies and working adults

00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,079
that may be looking to reskill

00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,600
um at the end of the day particularly

00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:46,560
for our project the mainframe open

00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,839
education

00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,160
the knowledge that you would want to

00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:52,720
learn

00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,519
i mean it's the same what i mean if

00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,720
you're starting from scratch you're

00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,240
starting from scratch but even if you're

00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,959
not you just want to pick up a new area

00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,480
of it

00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,639
maybe you are a kick specialist and you

00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:03,680
really want to understand more about db2

00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:05,280
um you know that's why we're looking at

00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,480
a modular approach so you can you can

00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,640
work through what you want

00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,240
and that way you know the community

00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,760
colleges and other training programs

00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,520
could augment and maybe pick up things

00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,319
from there as well and also contribute

00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,199
back

00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:19,360
um we know we want to know you know is

00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:22,240
is it is it the right approach i mean

00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,640
um my experience coming in as a new hire

00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,120
um

00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,319
into z was i was given a lot of like

00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,839
base things to work on

00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,919
but i felt like they weren't actually

00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:32,880
basic enough i needed like

00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:34,559
the basics for the basics um so we

00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,960
really want to make sure we we fill that

00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,200
gap

00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:39,039
i i passed that area now but it

00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,240
definitely is a hard gap to um

00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:42,160
to come through so that's a lot of what

00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,600
this is aimed at is helping to make sure

00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,919
it's approachable for

00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,679
any stage of life that you want to learn

00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:50,080
right especially college where they

00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:52,480
don't even they may not even know

00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,480
at all

00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,679
all right we got another one so it says

00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,360
would this be the kind of platform that

00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:00,880
educators and healthcare

00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,480
could use to conduct continuous

00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,679
education and training

00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:08,080
or is this a platform for sharing or

00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:14,320
learning and teaching modules that are

00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:17,039
shared to institutions

00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,440
you wanna you want i mean i'm thinking

00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,760
here

00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,120
so it could right to me it's a you know

00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:24,320
again it's about

00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:26,080
sharing so yes for instance that's one

00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,559
of the things that we are looking for is

00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,360
again people like myself from broadcom

00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:31,919
from people

00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,559
you know in any industry that they can

00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,320
go to

00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:35,600
to learn about the mainframe right we

00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,080
want to send people

00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,520
so that they have a one stop shop one

00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,840
platform that they can go to

00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,559
to get any materials that they need for

00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,640
their

00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,640
trainings within your own companies to

00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,760
build upon there's learning paths at

00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,320
least you know

00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,679
and there's one source of information

00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,200
that you know is going to be accurate

00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,960
too because we have people that will

00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,080
review that content and make sure for

00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,080
accuracy

00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,400
so to me i think you can use that i

00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:02,720
believe you can use it

00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:05,039
yeah so i would say this is a bit of a

00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:07,200
work in progress so i would say it is

00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:08,559
initially we're looking at the kind of

00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,080
the base of the sharing

00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:11,679
learning teaching modules that can be

00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,760
shown to institutions and

00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,720
institutions being broad whether it's um

00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:18,160
academic

00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:20,960
or professional um to teach kind of

00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,000
the basics of anything related to ibmc

00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,600
and i say that very

00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,679
broadly because it could be hardware it

00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,039
could be zos it could be subsystems it

00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,840
could be components of the operating

00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:30,160
system

00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,039
whatever it is you might want to learn

00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,480
um

00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,919
but you probably won't recall a couple

00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,280
of slides back but as we had the

00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:37,360
different phases

00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,320
you know we do kind of look for could

00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,320
this be

00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,000
kind of the continuous education part

00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,960
there's always updates you know

00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,760
z os is released what is it a four year

00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,880
cycle now two

00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:50,240
seconds about um yeah so

00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,080
you know we always have updates so

00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,720
operating system we're releasing

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,919
hardware so could this be the continuing

00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,600
education

00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,799
i mean that's something i think we as a

00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,320
community will have to look and decide

00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:03,520
how to handle how to handle

00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,640
um because there is definitely a need

00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,080
for that it's one thing to learn the

00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,760
basics but you also want to learn about

00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:10,320
the new features

00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:13,600
that are coming and available to you so

00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,600
i hope that answers your question

00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,840
okay any other questions

00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:27,919
has there been any interest from

00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:31,280
universities in the uk

00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:34,559
oh that is a great question um so

00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:38,640
for the project um

00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:42,159
not that have joined necessarily but

00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:45,039
i know from working and living in the uk

00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:46,960
that yes absolutely there are interests

00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:47,280
from universities and having things like

00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,240
this

00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:51,679
and so it is trying to figure out how to

00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,400
make it so that they can work and

00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:54,880
contribute

00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,880
to these

00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:02,080
all right and then is cova 19 pandemic a

00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:06,320
barrier

00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:09,919
to achieve sdg4

00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:12,480
do you know what sdg4 is i don't

00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:17,840
what i don't either can you can can you

00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:17,840
explain that

00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:31,840
or if anybody knows

00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,400
i'm just looking it up myself

00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,320
sustainable development goals

00:21:54,320 --> 00:22:02,320
okay yeah um yeah

00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:05,440
go ahead if you have an idea goal

00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:13,840
number four yeah okay see that

00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:13,840
from the un uh

00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:23,120
okay so for is it

00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:25,840
it i don't think it's necessarily been

00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,880
discussed yeah it's not something that's

00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,240
been discussed

00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,080
it's not necessarily been identified as

00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,400
a problem right

00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:34,159
um we saw the closure of a lot of

00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,960
schools we definitely have seen an

00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:38,960
impact to like university or academic

00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,520
institutional learning and how to work

00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,000
with them

00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,640
i think we've all felt that mostly

00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,679
through work

00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:48,720
not as much through omp

00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:49,600
um and trying to be sensitive i guess to

00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,080
that

00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:54,240
um but there's definitely a need that

00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,840
existed far beyond covid and i think

00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,480
maybe it was amplified a bit more with

00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,679
code

00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:01,760
to have the quality education that um

00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:03,440
enables that upward socioeconomic

00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:05,280
mobility

00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,039
so it is the idea of with having this

00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,240
would definitely impact and hopefully

00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:09,919
help

00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,000
in some of the other countries to help

00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,200
escape poverty to get to be able to work

00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,960
for corporations for

00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,600
maybe people that haven't had the

00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,600
opportunity

00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,480
that's a good point though that's a very

00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,320
good point yeah that's something i think

00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:27,840
we'll have to add to our notes and talk

00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:29,760
about it i know i agree i agree

00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,200
that's a very good point thank you

00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,200
exactly

00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,360
um and then we had a question on what is

00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,480
the second step to contribute it's not

00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:40,400
clear so if we could

00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:43,520
back up a few slides um

00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:46,080
i'll just show that

00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,720
there we go so explore on github so if

00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:50,559
you went

00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:53,039
to the um open mainframe

00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:54,720
project and then navigated to the

00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:56,159
projects to find the mainframe open

00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,400
education page

00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:59,279
every project under openmainframe

00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,960
project has

00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:06,159
a github repository where they

00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:09,360
accept contributions to their projects

00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:11,200
um made from open education is the same

00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,640
ours is going to be a little different

00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,400
so

00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,159
i'll use zoe as an example since we're

00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,840
familiar with it and

00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:20,320
so he's got three different components

00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,279
but it's all you know technology coding

00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,520
based

00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:25,520
um so you might be actually contributing

00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,480
electrical you know property that you've

00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,880
created

00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,679
um through open source licensing to the

00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,880
zoe project

00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:33,600
through uh the repository on github for

00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,360
us

00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,600
for the mainframe open education project

00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,440
we still have a github repository

00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,120
this is where we'll be collecting and

00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,640
assembling all of the

00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:45,120
learning materials and where we'll be

00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:48,240
organized into the different modules

00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:49,679
um but instead of contributing to a code

00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,559
base

00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:54,240
you'll be contributing potentially a

00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:57,039
markdown file full of text

00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,960
or a tutorial that's written in markdown

00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:01,760
which markdown is just a

00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:03,760
it's kind of like a wiki type but

00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:06,799
basically it's something that renders

00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:07,520
um appropriately on github and so that

00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:09,520
way

00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:13,039
you can share your knowledge and

00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:14,880
information and the things that you have

00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:16,159
to become part of what will be the code

00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,640
base and then

00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:20,559
as a project it'll be organized into the

00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,440
modules in a way that makes sense and

00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:23,039
flow

00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,840
to cover the various topics that are

00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:27,600
identified that should be covered

00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:29,600
and that will have like directions on

00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,440
how to do right we have the readme

00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:34,159
and then we're working on an actual

00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:36,799
video on how to go about doing it too

00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:38,320
for those who don't know yeah so there's

00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:40,880
a reading on how to contribute

00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:42,080
really a video about it and then we'll

00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:45,279
put together um

00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:46,799
another process guide for um or a little

00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:48,960
flow diagram that will come

00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:50,080
on how you can contribute different

00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,919
types maybe you've

00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,080
created a video or maybe you've got

00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:54,480
something else that maybe doesn't just

00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,400
come

00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,080
and come into being in you know a word

00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,279
document or markdown file or something

00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,120
like that we'll have

00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:03,760
some guidance on how to contribute those

00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,760
those pieces

00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:09,200
but that's why we also need help right

00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,799
that's where we would like to hear

00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,559
you know one of the things that we did

00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:14,559
talk about too is

00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:16,159
you know the platform is github the

00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,720
place that we should be doing this as

00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,559
well

00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,640
right so that's something else that we

00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:22,880
are also looking into

00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,320
maybe for just to gather the content

00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,240
maybe we use github

00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:28,080
but perhaps maybe we look at another

00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:30,000
platform like some type of open source

00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,200
learning management system of some sort

00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,440
that we go to

00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,039
so that's something else that we are

00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,760
trying to get feedback as well from the

00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:38,640
community

00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,120
as to what how would you how would you

00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,039
feel

00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,320
what would it be best for you to work in

00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:44,320
as well is github

00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,840
the place that you would want to provide

00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:48,240
content or is it another

00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:50,480
avenue so again the more help the more

00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,720
feedback we get the better

00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,480
so the question came in has the project

00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:57,279
platform been decided on so

00:26:54,480 --> 00:27:00,000
for example using wordpress or xcrm or

00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:00,000
something like that

00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:08,080
um i would say for the moment

00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:10,559
we are using github right we are looking

00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,919
to have people contribute to markdown

00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:14,400
but as lauren has said

00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:16,080
we are evaluating if that's really

00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,600
appropriate and how sustainable that

00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,720
will be for the type of content and

00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,240
that's where

00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,559
we absolutely need the community

00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,440
feedback but right now we are trying to

00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:26,159
follow

00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,799
the opening plan project standard and

00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:30,080
make sure we

00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:32,720
fall in with the appropriate licensing

00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,360
um to stay within the project so we're

00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,520
kind of

00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,880
evaluating everything within that so

00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:39,440
it's um

00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,799
not set permanently but we are at this

00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:44,559
point looking to use

00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:46,799
markdown and github and evaluating

00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:49,120
how that will work long term but if

00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:52,559
there are ideas we're open to it

00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:53,120
right yes we are open to hearing those

00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:55,760
ideas

00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:57,520
on what would work for people right what

00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,039
makes it easier and even for us to

00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,880
review it to make sure for

00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:02,559
ensure accuracy and things like that

00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,080
like that whole review process that it

00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:05,919
has to go through

00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,120
yes and that's another good part if you

00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:10,399
have friends

00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:12,559
that are maybe retired and yes are so

00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:15,360
passionate about teaching other people

00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:16,960
even as we get content we need smes and

00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,880
i always say this because i've had some

00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,440
amazing mentors in my career that i've

00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,799
now

00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,880
seen that are fortunate enough to have

00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:24,240
retired and i am going to be bugging

00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,640
each and every one of them so if any of

00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,000
you are listening you better believe

00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,000
i'll be calling and texting and

00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,840
messaging you on facebook um

00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,919
because we need their expertise to help

00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,039
review the material for accuracy

00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:36,399
so even if they're not looking to

00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:38,159
contribute maybe they've you know

00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:39,840
deleted all their files or whatever

00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:41,440
they still have all of the knowledge to

00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,880
teach it and yes a lot of them i know

00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,480
still love to do it so i would love to

00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:48,000
have just even just reviewers

00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,000
as we have the contents

00:28:53,760 --> 00:29:00,000
any other questions these are good ones

00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:00,000
by the way there

00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:09,520
any ideas i don't mind brainstorming

00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:13,200
here too

00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:15,200
yeah i'd love to have some ideas yeah

00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,720
and if you can't make our community

00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,159
meetings they're every

00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,919
they're the third thursday of every

00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:22,640
month at from 12

00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:23,840
uh p.m eastern to one we do we will

00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,480
record them

00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,279
we will post the recording on our slack

00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,080
channel

00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:30,799
as well but if there's any ideas that

00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,559
you have

00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:35,120
put them on the slack channel so at

00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:37,279
least we're all monitoring it

00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:39,200
and we would love to hear from you and

00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:41,039
get your ideas at the same time even if

00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,760
you listen it through the recording our

00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:44,240
meeting

00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:47,210
if you have ideas definitely share them

00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:50,720
