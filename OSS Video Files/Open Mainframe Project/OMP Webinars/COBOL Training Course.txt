Description: 
	Most financial organizations, banks, insurance companies, retailers, and governments need systems that must flawlessly handle huge volumes of transactions every day. Mainframes have been quietly managing this process for decades as their reliability, availability, security, scalability, and performance are unparalleled. While these core systems run Java, Python, and other languages, part of these core systems is COBOL, a reliable, proven programming language that has helped run some of the most mission-critical services applications at the worldâ€™s largest companies. The OMP COBOL Programming Course aims to educate and train the next generation of COBOLers.
