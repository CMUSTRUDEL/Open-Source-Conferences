really really exciting milestone for

00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:32,550
this project at it showcases the

00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:35,579
maturity and the downstream adoption

different open-source engagements of the

00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:46,410
communities and offerings built from

00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:49,349
them and Rose Sakic from Broadcom she's

set of folks here today after a little

00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:02,669
bit of direction we're gonna dig more

00:05:01,409 --> 00:05:06,539
into it we're gonna remind everyone what

00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:10,710
Zooey is again we're gonna have dig into

00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:13,349
what is the Zoey LTS release as a whole

00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:14,759
and give a kind of an overview of the

00:05:13,349 --> 00:05:17,250
concept of what the Zoey community's

00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:20,250
looking to drive here and what it needs

00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:23,240
for use at downstream consumer of this

00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:26,940
technology will talk about the Zoey

00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:29,759
conformance program which is being

00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:31,289
updated for the LTS release and we'll

00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,919
talk about some of the features and

00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:37,710
changes that have happened in here and

00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:39,509
then a peek into the future of Zoey you

00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:41,639
know where the features what's coming on

00:05:39,509 --> 00:05:43,110
what's coming down the pipe and then how

00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:46,680
to get involved and we'll have some time

00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:48,300
again for for Q&A but I really want to

00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:51,419
kick things off around the open

00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:53,370
mainframe project which is the host here

00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:56,820
of the Zoe Project

00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:58,139
and it's a broad community that brings

00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:00,180
together

00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:03,060
not only supporting organizations that

00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:05,490
hosted projects and really looks to make

00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:08,759
a broad impact on the open-source

00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:10,229
community on on the mainframe by being

00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:11,789
that focal point for that community to

00:06:10,229 --> 00:06:16,379
come together for them to be able to

00:06:11,789 --> 00:06:19,080
collaborate for them to be able to you

00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:21,960
know communicate broadly around and be a

00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:25,080
thought leadership angle for open source

00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:27,629
on the mainframe and then also just

00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:29,430
being at that place where people can can

00:06:27,629 --> 00:06:32,310
congregate they can come they can

00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:35,129
discuss you know topics of how this

00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:38,490
ecosystem continues to involve and it

00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:42,000
none of this is possible without the 36

00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:44,789
supporting organizations globally from

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,800
vendors to systems of riders to leaders

00:06:44,789 --> 00:06:48,810
in the space to the universities all of

00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:52,650
them are critical to this project

00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:57,599
success and if we look at those projects

00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:59,249
it's a vast number that are across the

00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:04,580
ecosystem here I think that the slide

00:06:59,249 --> 00:07:09,469
here should show nine of them hopefully

00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:13,979
it may bump the slide ahead one sorry

00:07:09,469 --> 00:07:17,009
zoe is is is definitely a flagship

00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:19,080
project amongst many here we have at the

00:07:17,009 --> 00:07:21,960
foundation I would really encourage

00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:24,740
everyone to take a look at the all the

00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:27,529
projects we're hosting these are all

00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:30,240
vendor-neutral they're open governance

00:07:27,529 --> 00:07:32,339
and they're all opportunities for

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,069
anybody in the community to get involved

00:07:32,339 --> 00:07:36,870
and helped add more sustainability into

00:07:35,069 --> 00:07:38,460
the mainframe world definitely check

00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:41,219
that out open mainframe project at org

00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:43,050
slash projects and particular I want to

00:07:41,219 --> 00:07:46,560
call it one of our newest projects which

00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:49,110
has made quite a splash is on the COBOL

00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,879
front we launched a COBOL programming

00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:54,469
course is a new incubation project back

00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:57,569
last month and it is taken off why like

00:07:54,469 --> 00:08:01,500
wildfire on this programming course

00:07:57,569 --> 00:08:03,149
alone has attracted people across github

00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:05,219
I think 1,400 stars and github which is

00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:08,069
a ridiculously high number for such a

00:08:05,219 --> 00:08:09,509
new project numerous issues numerous

00:08:08,069 --> 00:08:10,860
contributions coming from the mainframe

00:08:09,509 --> 00:08:12,569
community and beyond

00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:15,300
and we're already even seeing some new

00:08:12,569 --> 00:08:17,939
innovation happening there and helping

00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:19,110
support different IDE environments and

00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:22,169
then sort of building out that course

00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:24,509
work over time as a part of that

00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:27,629
announcement there is also a call for

00:08:24,509 --> 00:08:29,159
cobalt talent out there as you recall

00:08:27,629 --> 00:08:35,849
back in some time

00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:37,469
a prolific Ovid crisis you know really

00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:40,680
in its roots there that many of these

00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:42,930
systems did not have the talent needed

00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:44,880
to sustain them and we saw more than

00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:48,240
1,600 individuals

00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:50,250
quickly come together and volunteer

00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,980
their efforts and a number of those are

00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:53,339
being connected to opportunities

00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:57,089
globally

00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:58,410
and we've established a Q&A forum for

00:08:57,089 --> 00:09:01,019
the Cobo community to communicate

00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:02,760
collaborate you know talk about best

00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:04,769
practices ideas starting just to create

00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,070
this focal point of what this is all

00:09:04,769 --> 00:09:07,769
about

00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:10,649
take a look more about this on our

00:09:07,769 --> 00:09:14,250
website under our projects entitled

00:09:10,649 --> 00:09:16,290
cobalt rain course and last but at least

00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:19,589
I wanted you know one of the things that

00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:21,690
we well we're definitely a host of

00:09:19,589 --> 00:09:26,430
projects we recognized that this space

00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:29,670
is very broad you know and we want to

00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:32,610
make sure that space is recognized

00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:34,829
appropriately out there and along with

00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:38,519
that the larger commercial ecosystem

00:09:34,829 --> 00:09:41,640
that is building upon these offerings to

00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:44,370
really pull that together so you know

00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:48,779
with our driving force a pair of being

00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:51,420
that sustainable engine to help support

00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:53,420
this ecosystem the open mainframe

00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:55,620
landscape which you can check out at

00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:56,790
landscape that open mainframe project at

00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:59,040
org or if you don't feel like typing

00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:01,230
landscape ball out you can just type out

00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,600
L dot open a mainframe project at org

00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:05,790
it's a great way to understand what this

00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,230
full landscape looks like everything

00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:10,380
from the open-source projects that are

00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:13,320
very specific to the area projects that

00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:17,100
are having broad support of the s 390x

00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:19,949
in mainframe community along with the

00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:21,890
Linux distributions the companies that

00:10:19,949 --> 00:10:24,960
are driving zowie conformance solutions

00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:27,870
and just the vendors that are providing

00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:29,760
you know fiduciaries support go check

00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:32,310
this out it's also a community resource

00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,200
so we encourage you to include this in

00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:37,020
any presentations anytime you're talking

00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:39,560
with customers partners vendors and if

00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:42,810
you see things that are missing up here

00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:44,970
there it's it's all up on github so it's

00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:46,320
a pull request away from adding and

00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:48,570
we're happy to work with you to help get

00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:52,470
that going but definitely check out the

00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:55,320
landscape so with no further ado I want

00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:56,520
to move forward here - what is zoning

00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:00,690
I'm gonna hand it off to Peter fanned

00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:03,690
out all right thank you John for that

00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:06,330
intro so now on to another intro

00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:09,720
specifically introducing what is Joey

00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:13,110
so Joey is an open-source software

00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:16,770
project under the open mainframe project

00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:19,290
which is in is also under the Linux

00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:21,900
Foundation Zoe was released to the world

00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:24,570
in February of last year with initial

00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:27,870
contributions from Broadcom IBM and Ryan

00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:30,420
software the impetus for Zoe's creation

00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:32,730
was the need for an open modern and

00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:35,850
standard platform for application

00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:37,100
development on the mainframe next slide

00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:41,000
please

00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:44,100
so what is OE it is an integrated and

00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:47,610
extensible open-source ecosystem for

00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:51,420
z/os with a coherent and curated set of

00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:52,020
user and programmatic interfaces next

00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:55,500
slide please

00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:59,100
those interfaces provide consistent

00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:01,860
access to z/os systems and services they

00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:04,320
leverage industry standard methodologies

00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:06,480
and standards which are or should be

00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:09,890
familiar to the vast majority of today's

00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:12,030
developers and this is the part that is

00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:15,060
what we're hoping to achieve with

00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:18,210
success with Zoe is to have those

00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:20,160
interfaces become commonly accepted as

00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:25,110
the standard way of getting into the

00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:27,480
mainframe by the community so Zoe is

00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:30,990
delivered as a binary download which is

00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:33,300
a very important detail because we we

00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:35,070
want to make it easily consumable so

00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:36,210
that the consumer does not need to have

00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:38,670
to figure out how to build it themselves

00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:40,710
and this binary download

00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:43,350
comes with a set of applications built

00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:45,990
on top of that framework and together

00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:49,050
they deliver a cloud-like integration

00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:50,900
experience that is intended to unify the

00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:56,000
organization's IT infrastructure and

00:12:50,900 --> 00:13:00,600
application delivery next slide please

00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:03,450
the end-users that are targeted by Zoe

00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:06,360
are those at the bottom of the screen

00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:08,940
there so DevOps engineers application

00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:11,760
developers fist Prague's or systems

00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:15,120
administrators and operators responsible

00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:17,250
for the health and monitoring of the

00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,410
mainframe operating system itself and

00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:23,790
mainframe subsystems and enterprise

00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:27,150
applications like db2 etc next slide

00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:30,090
please so in terms of components there

00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:33,290
are four main sub projects or component

00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:38,370
groups within Zoe next slide please

00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:40,920
so closest to the z/os systems

00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:43,710
themselves you have the API mediation

00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:46,500
layer and a set of built in micro

00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:48,900
services so the API mediation layer

00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:51,990
actually go back for a second beat the

00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:55,500
API mediation layer back backwards

00:13:51,990 --> 00:14:00,030
thank you the API mediation layer acts

00:13:55,500 --> 00:14:03,990
as a reverse proxy to any number of

00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:07,320
clients to it so it provides a unified

00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:12,050
single point of entry to any number of

00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:15,060
consumers with single sign-on and

00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:18,000
authentication so that you don't have to

00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:20,430
do that over again for all the consumers

00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,280
so the consumers of the API mediation

00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:26,760
layer if you could go to the next slide

00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:29,760
are first the CLI sub project now this

00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:34,220
is a command line interface primarily

00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:36,690
used for DevOps that enables the user to

00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:40,530
chain together

00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:45,180
commands into z/os that do things like

00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:48,330
CI CD build automated test and whatnot

00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:51,410
and those are backed by the micro

00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:52,499
services next slide please

00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:54,779
another

00:14:52,499 --> 00:14:57,059
a major component this is actually was

00:14:54,779 --> 00:14:58,769
not in the original Zoey and it has

00:14:57,059 --> 00:15:01,049
proved extremely popular I think with

00:14:58,769 --> 00:15:03,869
the largest number of downloads we call

00:15:01,049 --> 00:15:08,099
simply the Zoey Explorer and this is an

00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:10,739
infrastructure and a an extension today

00:15:08,099 --> 00:15:13,409
it's only an extension to BS code but it

00:15:10,739 --> 00:15:16,139
may entail extensions to other

00:15:13,409 --> 00:15:19,469
applications in the future and what it

00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:23,219
enables the user today of v/s code to do

00:15:19,469 --> 00:15:26,039
is in their in their vs code environment

00:15:23,219 --> 00:15:28,579
and they have the extension gives them

00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:33,019
the ability to work with open manipulate

00:15:28,579 --> 00:15:35,579
mainframe datasets next slide please

00:15:33,019 --> 00:15:37,999
and then you have the applications

00:15:35,579 --> 00:15:41,719
framework the application framework

00:15:37,999 --> 00:15:44,729
outwardly most visibly it presents a

00:15:41,719 --> 00:15:48,509
user experience a visual user experience

00:15:44,729 --> 00:15:50,579
that is akin to the desktop on your

00:15:48,509 --> 00:15:52,649
Macintosh or your Windows where you've

00:15:50,579 --> 00:15:54,599
got a launch bar at the bottom and you

00:15:52,649 --> 00:15:56,279
can launch multiple applications and

00:15:54,599 --> 00:16:00,269
each application can have many windows

00:15:56,279 --> 00:16:02,909
and they're all on a desktop however the

00:16:00,269 --> 00:16:05,970
difference is that that entire desktop

00:16:02,909 --> 00:16:09,119
experience is residing inside of a web

00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:13,099
browser and it has the same single

00:16:09,119 --> 00:16:16,529
sign-on capabilities so it's very secure

00:16:13,099 --> 00:16:19,079
and then lastly next slide please

00:16:16,529 --> 00:16:22,289
actually before I need to embellish this

00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:24,689
so each one of these major sub

00:16:22,289 --> 00:16:26,759
components the CLI the Explorer and the

00:16:24,689 --> 00:16:29,639
application for work they all come

00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:32,249
built-in with plugins that enable you to

00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:34,439
do certain things so for example the CLI

00:16:32,249 --> 00:16:37,259
comes with a Kicks plug-in the

00:16:34,439 --> 00:16:40,049
application framework comes with a 3270

00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:44,609
emulator so they come with existing

00:16:40,049 --> 00:16:47,939
plugins and then next slide and then if

00:16:44,609 --> 00:16:51,329
you are a developer you can then extend

00:16:47,939 --> 00:16:52,979
by adding additional homemade plugins

00:16:51,329 --> 00:16:54,959
that you either use within your

00:16:52,979 --> 00:16:57,779
organization or you could publish them

00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:59,909
and submit them for inclusion in in five

00:16:57,779 --> 00:17:02,999
is OE community and all these plugins

00:16:59,909 --> 00:17:06,480
are often backed by additional micro

00:17:02,999 --> 00:17:10,380
services at the back end

00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:13,650
next slide please and then finally all

00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:17,400
of the api's all of the micro services

00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:21,620
that are exposed via the API mediation

00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:27,319
layer can be called directly by the user

00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:27,319
and that in a nutshell is what is doing

00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:33,990
all right thanks Peter

00:17:30,419 --> 00:17:38,000
this is Bruce Armstrong what I'll talk

00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:41,130
about now is what the significant

00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:44,250
significance is of the long-term support

00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:48,690
release we have announced

00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:52,740
so there's I'll say two major aspects of

00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:56,669
this the first one here is on the

00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:59,220
packaging and install process that we've

00:17:56,669 --> 00:18:03,000
adopted so those of you that might be

00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:09,330
familiar with what we did originally was

00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:12,750
Zoe was delivered as a packs file so you

00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:15,630
know conceptually a zipped up file that

00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:18,380
that you would install in your z/os

00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:22,280
environment we've clearly got feedback

00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:25,020
back that you know that is adequate for

00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:27,120
especially a dev test environment where

00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:29,990
people were wanting a quick and easy

00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:33,870
install to be able to play with Zoe

00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:36,929
however the feedback was and those of

00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:39,630
you that are very familiar with z/os

00:18:36,929 --> 00:18:42,210
install and packaging kind of the de

00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:47,309
facto standard is what's called SPE

00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:50,850
format so one key aspect of what we've

00:18:47,309 --> 00:18:53,429
done as a lead-up to declaring a

00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:58,070
long-term support release is we did

00:18:53,429 --> 00:19:01,860
support this de facto standard for

00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:03,809
packaging of an SPE format now there's

00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:07,470
more going on here than just the format

00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:11,370
right what this now provides is a vendor

00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:14,490
neutral way so that anyone can get a

00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:16,860
copy of Zoe install it in their

00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:20,250
environment our base assumption is that

00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:22,820
you would have one instance Pernell par

00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:26,640
to be able to take advantage of the

00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:29,430
single sign-on a single API catalog and

00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:31,290
such there is the option of being able

00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:35,010
to install more than one instances

00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:38,220
depending upon your circumstances the

00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:41,970
other aspect of this packaging and it's

00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:44,250
more the configuration process was we

00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:47,850
reworked some of the configuration

00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:50,880
placement so that as we do software

00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:55,710
updates of zowie the configuration files

00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:58,560
for not only the Zoey components but

00:19:55,710 --> 00:20:02,850
also any extensions that might be

00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:06,420
provided were in a protected place in

00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:09,360
the install environment such that we

00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:14,580
could update the code without impacting

00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:19,310
the configuration information the I'll

00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:23,100
say the configuration process has gotten

00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:27,690
smarter with each release we do provide

00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:31,530
a way to selectively start some of the

00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:33,660
backend services so that you have what

00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:36,930
used to be hard prereqs they're optional

00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:40,950
or or softer prereqs so that you can get

00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:43,950
Zoey up and running quick quicker and

00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:46,260
easier than some of the prior releases

00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:49,320
we do acknowledge that we've got some

00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:51,810
more work to do right we're working now

00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:55,140
on how do you know that you've got a

00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:58,470
genuine Zoey release regardless of where

00:20:55,140 --> 00:21:00,960
you've gotten it and we are looking at

00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:03,750
the next generation of install and

00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:07,170
configuration packaging on the z/os

00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:09,120
platform as well so bottom line is you

00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:11,430
would have seen this previewed and

00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:14,130
releases and now that we've gotten this

00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:16,170
piece of work done that is a key aspect

00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:18,480
of what we're declaring in a long term

00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:23,090
support release if you go to the next

00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:28,770
slide please the other aspect of this is

00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:32,880
we've now declared what we call the

00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:34,260
active long-term support release and we

00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,419
have declared

00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:41,429
the open community will do for

00:21:36,419 --> 00:21:43,620
supporting the interfaces in Zoey so for

00:21:41,429 --> 00:21:47,340
those of you that are writing extensions

00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:49,130
or making use of the interfaces whether

00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:53,010
that's through the desktop or

00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:56,480
command-line interface or API mediation

00:21:53,010 --> 00:22:00,809
layer we we are declaring those as

00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:03,870
stable interfaces going forward now the

00:22:00,809 --> 00:22:07,049
the terminology that we're using here is

00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:11,220
something that we I'll say have borrowed

00:22:07,049 --> 00:22:13,100
from the nodejs community what you can

00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:18,929
think of what we've done over the past

00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:21,210
year since February of 2019 we were in a

00:22:18,929 --> 00:22:23,580
current phase where we were doing

00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:25,590
development we were enhancing the

00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:28,260
capabilities but during that current

00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:30,650
phase we weren't quite ready to claim

00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:33,570
that the interfaces were all stable as

00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:36,030
of the long-term support release that we

00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:38,040
have now delivered we've entered what we

00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:40,679
call the active long-term support

00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:44,280
release so the interfaces are stable

00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:48,059
people can make use of the active aspect

00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:51,120
of this is we are going to continue to

00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:53,160
make enhancements but those enhancements

00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,530
will be in such a way that they don't

00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:58,530
break any of the existing interfaces

00:22:55,530 --> 00:23:01,679
they may enhance some of the inter inter

00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:04,020
the existing interfaces and you as

00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:06,720
exploiters of the infrastructure of Zoey

00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:09,299
will have the option of taking advantage

00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:13,200
of those enhancements but we've we're

00:23:09,299 --> 00:23:17,190
saying the interfaces themselves will

00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:20,400
not change and we're saying that it's

00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:24,510
roughly a two-year window where we will

00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:28,410
continue the support of those interfaces

00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:31,770
now there is a point in time and and the

00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:34,559
graph here implies it's roughly halfway

00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:37,470
through the two-year period it might be

00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:40,950
longer than that but there will come a

00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:44,549
time when we will declare a maintenance

00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:47,480
long term support which from that point

00:23:44,549 --> 00:23:49,760
forward will be changed it will be

00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:53,180
fix's only and not necessarily

00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:57,560
enhancements the other takeaway of from

00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:59,420
this slide is we will look at what we're

00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:02,540
needing to accomplish based upon

00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:05,180
feedback and we will make a decision on

00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:08,360
an annual basis as to whether we think

00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:12,260
we need to reversion a reversion would

00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:14,750
imply possible breaking changes but

00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:17,270
again we would give the open community

00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:20,180
plenty of notice of that we would go

00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:24,740
through another current phase that B

00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:27,410
that anybody could work with the newer

00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:28,760
generation code give us feedback on what

00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:31,520
they like and what they don't like

00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:34,610
but you'll notice through the graphics

00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:37,400
here there will only be one active long

00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:40,790
term support release at a time that will

00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:43,970
have the both enhancements and fixes

00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:47,780
going on and as I say we don't have any

00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:51,290
plans right now to reversion but we said

00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:54,680
that we kind of reserve the right on an

00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:59,180
annual basis to revisit whether we need

00:24:54,680 --> 00:25:01,730
to introduce changes let's go to the

00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:05,000
next couple slides I've already talked

00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:05,990
about this right so this is here for

00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,330
your reference

00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:11,720
you will also see that this is on the

00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:14,060
Zoe Doric website so we may consider

00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:16,340
reversion each year but there's no

00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:19,580
guarantee that we will right now we

00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:21,620
don't have a reason to reversion next

00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:26,180
year but we've still got you know six

00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:30,200
months or so to go in this year as we

00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:32,240
said the current release typically would

00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:34,940
take six to nine months where we're

00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:37,370
testing it giving a preview in the

00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:40,250
community you could argue that this

00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:43,070
first version took longer than that but

00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:44,270
this was our version one release so it

00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:46,490
took us a little while to get

00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:48,620
comfortable with claiming the stable

00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:51,500
releases and I've already talked about

00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:56,080
active and and the maintenance so if you

00:25:51,500 --> 00:26:00,800
go to the next slide please the

00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:03,830
long-term support is just that we are

00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:07,130
to provide support through the open

00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:09,680
community and you may ask what fixes

00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:12,320
when we in the enter the maintenance

00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:15,260
release would we say that's documented

00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:17,810
on Zoe's org and we're going to talk

00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:20,330
next about the conformance program so

00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:23,660
those of you that may have gotten

00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:26,960
conformance on the 2019 level of the

00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:29,330
code you'll see that we have updated our

00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:31,400
conformance criteria and our badging

00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:34,490
process to now

00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:37,130
encourage folks to use this long term

00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:40,520
support release the interfaces that are

00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:43,460
there now and as I mentioned the way we

00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:47,210
do the install and configuration of the

00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:51,290
code has changed slightly and may one

00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:53,690
more slide please yes and here I'm just

00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:55,370
pointing folks to the additional

00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:58,970
information that I didn't get through

00:26:55,370 --> 00:27:01,130
you can go to zoe dot org if you scroll

00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:04,490
down you'll see a section called release

00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:07,730
timeline and you can learn more and it

00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:10,610
spells out our our description of

00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:13,310
long-term support release both active

00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:16,730
and maintenance and that's there for

00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:19,250
your reference so with that I'll turn it

00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:22,330
over to Rose to talk about the

00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:22,330
conformance program

00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:28,140
great thanks Bruce hopefully everybody

00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:30,870
can hear me hi everyone

00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:32,850
great to be with you today Rosi catches

00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:34,620
John mentioned I'm Broadcom product

00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:37,890
manager responsible for see a bright

00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:41,790
side Zoe CLI and I'm the Zoe onboarding

00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:43,770
squad scrum master and in addition to

00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:45,630
encouraging and facilitating the

00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:50,160
onboarding process for new Zoe

00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:53,640
contributors we also help to formalize

00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:55,620
and support the Zoe conformance program

00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:57,690
so what I'm gonna do is I'll quickly

00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:59,790
review the conformance program in

00:27:57,690 --> 00:28:01,559
general and also share some of the

00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:04,290
modifications we made specifically

00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:06,990
around the long term support release so

00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:09,840
stay on this slide for me May let's

00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:12,240
start with what is conformance as Peter

00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:15,600
mentioned earlier the Zoe framework is

00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:17,520
extensible by design and as such we

00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:20,340
encourage and welcome clients and

00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:22,500
vendors interested in extending Zoe with

00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:24,809
their own plugin or as Peter mentioned

00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:27,809
their you know homegrown or homemade

00:28:24,809 --> 00:28:29,490
contributions but of course we needed to

00:28:27,809 --> 00:28:32,580
put a program in place to ensure that

00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:35,160
extensions enhance Zoe without

00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:37,530
compromising it on any level and with

00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:40,290
this in mind the Zoe conformance program

00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:43,350
was developed by the Zoe community this

00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:45,510
is an optional program for extenders the

00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:49,290
program consists of a set of guidelines

00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:52,020
in the form of test criteria for each of

00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:55,470
the extensible components those

00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:58,200
components currently include api's CLI

00:28:55,470 --> 00:29:01,590
plugins and plug-in apps for the app

00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:04,080
framework the criteria is a minimum set

00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:06,570
of requirements the extender must meet

00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:10,290
in order to ensure conformance is

00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:14,690
achieved in a sense this is sort of

00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:19,860
serves as a you know a quality gate

00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:21,780
next slide moving on to why conformance

00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:24,210
so the program was developed by the Zoe

00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:26,820
community as I mentioned as a means to

00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:29,220
ensure that each plug in and extension

00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:31,500
associated with a given Zoe component

00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:33,299
has met a minimum set of requirements

00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:36,480
that enable them to deliver

00:29:33,299 --> 00:29:39,809
functionality threaded throughout the

00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:43,260
Zoe ecosystem and the requirements could

00:29:39,809 --> 00:29:45,720
be as simple as naming standards or they

00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:48,590
could be more complex like security

00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:52,410
requirements that enable single sign-on

00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:55,410
the requirements are designed to provide

00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:58,620
interoperability amongst in-between the

00:29:55,410 --> 00:30:00,990
Zoe components to demand and sustain a

00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:04,020
high level of quality through best

00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:07,530
practices and to ensure the user has a

00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:08,340
similar very comfortable and expected

00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:12,090
Zoe

00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:14,820
experiment experience it's important to

00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:16,950
recognize that the program offers value

00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:19,049
to both the providers you know the

00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:21,960
vendors who provide the extensions

00:30:19,049 --> 00:30:25,830
themselves and customers that consume

00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:29,150
them and let me explain how as an

00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:31,740
extender of a Zoe conformant application

00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:34,020
the conformance ensures that the

00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:37,049
application will behave is designed in

00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:39,390
the Zoe ecosystem it helps to maximize

00:30:37,049 --> 00:30:41,669
the value of the application it helps to

00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:44,669
ensure that other applications will not

00:30:41,669 --> 00:30:47,309
break my extension and at the same time

00:30:44,669 --> 00:30:50,070
mine won't break others and the

00:30:47,309 --> 00:30:52,980
conformance badge demonstrates thought

00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:55,710
leadership partnership and general

00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:58,320
commitment to Zoe in earning the badge

00:30:55,710 --> 00:31:01,500
allows me to market my application using

00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:03,840
the Zoe brand on the consumer side or

00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:06,510
the end-user side of a Zoe conforming

00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:08,130
application as a consumer I'm able to

00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:10,169
leverage a common stack of

00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:11,280
infrastructure across multiple vendor

00:31:10,169 --> 00:31:13,950
applications

00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:15,990
I'm granted a level of operational

00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:18,450
confidence meaning I can trust the

00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:21,870
extension will work with the designated

00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:23,929
release or releases of Zoe and there's

00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:27,120
also a high level of quality assurance

00:31:23,929 --> 00:31:27,480
gained knowing that the extension has

00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:31,430
been a

00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:36,330
exposed and vetted with the community

00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:37,530
next slide so how do we revise the

00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:39,480
conformance program with the

00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:42,720
introduction of the long-term support

00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:45,210
release of Zoe in general we revise some

00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:47,190
foundational pieces of the program we

00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:50,280
made some general program updates

00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:53,940
including modifying the contents and

00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:56,490
format of the test criteria itself that

00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:59,540
is features that were specifically

00:31:56,490 --> 00:32:02,100
introduced with LTS needed conformance

00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:05,340
specifications so the list of criteria

00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:08,720
got longer one area as Bruce mentioned

00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:14,640
was the change in the z/os installation

00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:17,250
we also change the format of the the

00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:20,160
testing criteria it originally was just

00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:23,130
a general word document we changed that

00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:28,470
to a table table format and we added a

00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:31,320
tag to each entry I put in a snapshot of

00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:33,590
that table format on this slide on the

00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:36,120
right hand side there so you can see

00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:39,600
this hopefully will make it easier for

00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:43,260
extenders to know what and when a new

00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:47,310
canoe conformance criteria was added to

00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:49,770
that checklist and then we also migrated

00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:52,140
the forms to github for safekeeping and

00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:55,740
and streamlining the change process

00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:58,170
itself we modified the terms and

00:32:55,740 --> 00:33:03,030
conditions to allow extenders to retain

00:32:58,170 --> 00:33:05,340
badges we also owe the prior the prior

00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:07,650
terms and condition gave the extenders a

00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:09,990
limited window of time in which they

00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:14,340
could apply for the latest conformance

00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:16,830
and we we heard back from from a few of

00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:21,240
the extenders through the onboarding

00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:24,420
squad that that was something that was

00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:26,910
not achievable nor desirable so we we

00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:28,890
allowed we changed the conformance

00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:34,230
criteria to enable folks to retain those

00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:36,690
badges also this not not having a

00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:39,480
specific time line allows extenders to

00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:41,260
apply for the latest conformance in this

00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:42,940
case it would be v1

00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:47,500
on their timeline whenever it's

00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:50,020
convenient for them so the extenders who

00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:52,179
had earned their zoe wand otto through

00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:54,400
1.8 i guess we'll call it conformance

00:33:52,179 --> 00:33:57,820
badge which we marked with the 2019

00:33:54,400 --> 00:34:01,929
badge will continue to retain those

00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:05,620
badges and then finally we we always are

00:34:01,929 --> 00:34:08,760
looking to improve the conformance

00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:10,899
process and will continue to revise

00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:15,669
throughout the active

00:34:10,899 --> 00:34:18,879
LTS phase but we will do so by

00:34:15,669 --> 00:34:21,700
indicating in the conformance test

00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:29,200
criteria itself as new features come

00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:32,080
along next slide okay so essentially you

00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:35,230
know any software vendor can build zoe

00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:39,909
conformant offerings the process is very

00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:43,570
straightforward you can apply for

00:34:39,909 --> 00:34:46,260
conformance for a new extension we also

00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:49,720
recommend that you apply for v1

00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:54,760
conformance for any existing 2019

00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:57,580
conformant apps simple straightforward

00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:59,800
three-step process prepare test and

00:34:57,580 --> 00:35:04,570
submit that's that would be the

00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:06,760
responsibility of the requester step

00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:08,580
four is the responsibility of the open

00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:13,090
mainframe project when they will review

00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:15,460
and approve your application the open

00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:18,730
mainframe project is involved they keep

00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:20,740
the process vendor neutral and they

00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:24,900
provide an unbiased assessment and

00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:28,300
certainly ensure confidentiality the Zoe

00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:30,190
community and the onboarding squad in

00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:32,859
particular determines presents and

00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:35,290
maintains the conformance criteria and

00:35:32,859 --> 00:35:37,810
the test evaluation guides as well as

00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:40,600
terms and conditions and we do all this

00:35:37,810 --> 00:35:43,140
in conjunction with the open mainframe

00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:43,140
project

00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:52,540
okay the conformance page at Zoe org

00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:55,420
this is sort of a snippet of that page

00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:58,450
probably displays all of the Zoe one dot

00:35:55,420 --> 00:36:01,780
o through 1.8 Zoe conformant apps with

00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:04,540
the 2019 badge you can expect to see the

00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:06,640
Zoe view on LT s conformant applications

00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:11,170
on the updated conformance page showing

00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:11,950
v1 conformant components with the v1

00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:16,420
badge again

00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:19,270
aligning with the v1 LTS release and

00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:23,109
then finally I believe I have one more

00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:25,390
slide here yeah so you are going to want

00:36:23,109 --> 00:36:29,650
to go ahead and plan to earn your view

00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:32,830
on LTS conformance match especially if

00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:36,099
you have an existing 2019 badge again we

00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:40,420
have a few more requirements added to

00:36:36,099 --> 00:36:42,369
the testing criteria and here's some

00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:44,980
suggestions to sort of help you get

00:36:42,369 --> 00:36:48,180
started go ahead and go out and review

00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:51,940
the conformance program details now the

00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:54,550
the forms have been updated they are in

00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:58,180
table format and they do reflect the LTS

00:36:54,550 --> 00:37:01,570
criteria print them make sure that all

00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:04,900
of the required entries in those forms

00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:06,880
align with your technical plans and do

00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:11,050
you know if you can't submit right away

00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:14,770
have a plan and target a date to submit

00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:16,660
for your conformance and certainly the

00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:19,960
open mainframe project and the Zoe

00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:22,210
onboarding squad is available for you if

00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:23,890
you need any assistance or have any you

00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:27,089
know comments questions what have you

00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:27,089
we're happy to help

00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:32,360
back to you Peter

00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:40,740
okay Thank You rose so be again Peter

00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:44,150
fan Dell I'm here to talk about how Zoe

00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:48,150
is enterprise and production-ready and

00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:50,880
the themes here of this presentation are

00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:54,890
security resilience and scaling and

00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:59,210
serviceability however the previous two

00:37:54,890 --> 00:38:02,910
presentations by rows and by Bruce are

00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:04,740
critical components of making a software

00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:07,680
enterprise in production ready they

00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:09,869
mostly address quality and stability and

00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:14,580
giving the reassurance that that those

00:38:09,869 --> 00:38:18,080
remain so and also the making it a good

00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:21,270
user experience for download and install

00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:23,339
are all parts of those projects no I'm

00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:24,960
going to be talking about other aspects

00:38:23,339 --> 00:38:26,849
of enterprise and production ready

00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:29,640
security resilience scaling and

00:38:26,849 --> 00:38:31,710
serviceability so customers who want to

00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:35,339
build offerings on top of Zoe or who

00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:38,880
want to use Zoe based products need to

00:38:35,339 --> 00:38:43,050
have these reassurances that that we

00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:46,050
need all of these feature goals before

00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:48,270
they go ready go into production so

00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:50,540
that's what this is all about so next

00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:50,540
slide please

00:38:51,349 --> 00:38:59,099
so in terms of security all of the Zoe

00:38:55,740 --> 00:39:01,260
components today support SSO this is

00:38:59,099 --> 00:39:03,359
both for that net stands for single

00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:05,280
sign-on so both for interactive support

00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:07,380
so for example in the virtual desktop

00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:11,760
when you do a login that single sign-on

00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:16,020
and also via the api's through java web

00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:18,510
tokens all of the transport the

00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:21,839
communication transports end-to-end for

00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:25,740
all Zoe components support HTTP and are

00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:27,930
at the level of TLS 1.2 and then the

00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:30,330
last part that is covered by all three

00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:34,010
components is all Zoe components do

00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:37,859
access through SAS and there is a

00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:40,920
neutral ESM abstraction layer or that's

00:39:37,859 --> 00:39:42,930
enterprise security management systems

00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:45,330
and we have coverage for the three

00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:47,560
primary ESM's in the market rack F

00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:49,670
top-secret an ACF to

00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:52,580
with respect to multi-factor

00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:54,890
authentication that is supported today

00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:57,200
in the application framework which

00:39:54,890 --> 00:40:00,500
includes the virtual desktop and it's

00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:02,240
coming very soon for the CLI and with

00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:04,790
respect to role based access control

00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:09,010
that is today supported in the

00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:11,600
application framework next slide please

00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:16,220
so with respect to resilience and

00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:19,220
scalability so the app API mediation

00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:21,200
layer and the CLI inherently support

00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:24,650
resilience and scalability because they

00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:27,050
are of stateless design for the

00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:30,890
application framework that is in

00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:33,560
development right now to support high

00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:35,390
availability and fault tolerance and

00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:37,490
this will also include eventually

00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:42,070
sysplex support probably towards the end

00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:45,920
of q3 and then for all of the z/os

00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:50,150
components of zoe it is planned to have

00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:54,320
them be dock right docker izybelle by

00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:57,160
the end of q3 and this also addresses

00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:59,330
resilience and scalability due to other

00:40:57,160 --> 00:41:02,990
technologies like docker swarm that

00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:06,170
enables you to have many docker

00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:08,300
containers working in concert the only

00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:11,720
exception to this in terms of docker

00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:17,270
support would be the the back-end z/os

00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:19,760
specific micro services next line and in

00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:22,840
terms of serviceability a lot of that is

00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:25,340
handled by the LTS are in cupid's

00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:30,380
projects that were discussed by bruce

00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:33,050
and in addition we have API support for

00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:34,850
viewing log output and setting the log

00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:36,980
trace level dynamically this is

00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:39,650
supported today in the application

00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:44,090
framework and the CLI and it's on the

00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:45,859
roadmap for the API mediation layer and

00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:47,420
I believe that's the last slide is that

00:41:45,859 --> 00:41:50,770
right or is there one more that is the

00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:50,770
last slide thank you

00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:10,800
John you're unmute sorry

00:42:07,890 --> 00:42:13,440
double double mute here well thank you

00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:16,350
everyone for participating in today's

00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:20,250
webinar and ever all the the great

00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:21,360
panelists that we've seen here we do

00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:23,880
have a little bit of time for questions

00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:25,530
here at the end if you are in the

00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:29,940
background if you have some questions

00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:34,100
you can either hit the chat or probably

00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:37,710
preferred is if you could use the Q&A

00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:41,580
feature here that's on the in the bottom

00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:44,760
panel here where you can ask any

00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:46,440
questions here so if you have that

00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:49,410
please go ahead and queue those up in

00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:51,150
the background here I guess while we're

00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:53,460
getting some of those questions in here

00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:55,410
just to close you know there are a lot

00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:57,360
of different ways that you can

00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:59,660
participate not only in zowie but just

00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:03,780
really any of the projects hosted here

00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:06,690
and you know these are all very great

00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:08,790
ways that are to get engaged in the

00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:12,270
technical discussions from the mailing

00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:15,120
list to looking at events which as you

00:43:12,270 --> 00:43:18,480
know if you those are around events that

00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:20,070
are going virtual looking at some of the

00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:22,740
development updates from our technical

00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:26,160
communities and our blog we have a very

00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:27,870
vibrant select channel the zoe project

00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:30,330
is very active there and i would really

00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:32,820
encourage you to check that out and then

00:43:30,330 --> 00:43:34,140
also look at meetups and forums and even

00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:37,320
if you're interested in starting one

00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:39,000
we're happy to work with you on that one

00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:40,920
other check we want to have here is on

00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:45,060
the open mainframe summit which is

00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:48,090
coming up in September the call for

00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:50,340
papers is still open it's getting ready

00:43:48,090 --> 00:43:52,130
to close here very soon so if you have a

00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:54,720
call for paper that you're interested in

00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:58,130
please go ahead and submit it and you

00:43:54,720 --> 00:44:01,620
can also register for it as well and

00:43:58,130 --> 00:44:02,460
last it's certainly not least keep up

00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:05,640
with the project

00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:09,030
we're on LinkedIn and Twitter you can

00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:11,280
follow us we post a number of updates a

00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:15,030
day from things happening around the

00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:16,560
industry things happening within our

00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:18,330
we really try to put a lot of that first

00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:21,390
and foremost and some of the great

00:44:18,330 --> 00:44:22,170
stories that are happening inside of our

00:44:21,390 --> 00:44:24,360
communities

00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:28,680
definitely check both of these out both

00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:30,420
on LinkedIn and Twitter and with that I

00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:34,290
gave everyone a chance to ask some

00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:39,890
questions I don't see any popping

00:44:34,290 --> 00:44:42,450
through at the moment if anyone has any

00:44:39,890 --> 00:44:44,880
maybe I'll give it a moment here again

00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:49,500
use the Q&A chat panel that's at the

00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:55,230
bottom of your screen to ask any

00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:57,120
questions that you might have but I have

00:44:55,230 --> 00:44:58,590
to say I mean I think what we're seeing

00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:01,080
here from the Zillah community if I look

00:44:58,590 --> 00:45:04,080
at some of our other projects here at

00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:05,790
the Linux Foundation you can definitely

00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:09,330
tell that this project is taking a

00:45:05,790 --> 00:45:10,950
really big step up here establishing an

00:45:09,330 --> 00:45:14,730
LCS and really honing into the

00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:16,590
conformance program for maturity and we

00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:18,270
see a lot of projects they say start to

00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:21,480
get into this phase of thinking about

00:45:18,270 --> 00:45:23,970
the downstream quality and making sure

00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:26,190
that there's a solid ecosystem being

00:45:23,970 --> 00:45:28,410
built these are the steps that we're

00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:30,870
starting to see and this is what opens

00:45:28,410 --> 00:45:33,540
it up for different vendors to be able

00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:35,700
to build products off of this or

00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:37,920
leverage this in their products and end

00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:41,040
users and customers to be able to take

00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:42,900
this technology internally to really

00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:45,630
help reduce a lot of your internal costs

00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:47,130
so I gotta say this is this is a really

00:45:45,630 --> 00:45:49,320
really impressive

00:45:47,130 --> 00:45:52,830
position that we're in at the moment

00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:56,250
here and it's a lot of hard work from a

00:45:52,830 --> 00:45:59,790
large community that is putting hours

00:45:56,250 --> 00:46:02,670
and hours days and days months months

00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:08,090
weeks weeks of just tons of effort into

00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:12,390
this just as a reminder this entire

00:46:08,090 --> 00:46:14,430
webinar will be recorded as an attendee

00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:17,760
you'll get a notice when that happens

00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:20,160
and it'll be up on our YouTube page for

00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:22,740
people to preview later and especially

00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:24,000
as you want to share it across some of

00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:27,630
your colleagues and other parts to your

00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,890
organization well I don't see any

00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:32,100
questions that have came in

00:46:28,890 --> 00:46:33,540
so I'm gonna say that maybe we wrap up

00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:35,520
for today

00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:38,370
and I want to thank all of the panelists

00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:40,490

00:46:40,490 --> 00:46:44,820
fantastic and you really showed a lot of

00:46:42,770 --> 00:46:46,410
showed how this community is really

00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:49,970
becoming much more broader and

00:46:46,410 --> 00:46:49,970
sustainable so thank you so much
