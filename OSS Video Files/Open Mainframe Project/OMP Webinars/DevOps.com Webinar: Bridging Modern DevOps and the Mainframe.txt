I worked a lot on tools for the Eclipse

00:03:53,629 --> 00:03:58,400
Foundation and helping to bring those to

00:03:55,970 --> 00:04:00,650
the mainframe I've worked with the Java

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,840
community process helps to bring those

00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:06,049
to the mainframe and we need so I get

00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:08,930
about being part of zoe alright great

00:04:06,049 --> 00:04:11,209

webinar is the first in a series of two

00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:23,419
webinars we're going to be having on

00:04:20,299 --> 00:04:24,919
mainframes and the project Zoe so our

00:04:23,419 --> 00:04:27,440
second webinar is going to be more of a

00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:30,139
technical deep dive and it's going to be

00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:33,259
held on April 11th

00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:35,870
and we'll be having Joe returned for for

00:04:33,259 --> 00:04:38,210
that webinar as well as invite Michael

00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:41,270
Bauer from Broadcom to join us so

00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:43,550
hopefully you guys will be able to join

00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:45,439
us for that webinar as well for a little

00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:48,439
bit more as I said technical deep dive

00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:51,229
so with that we'll go ahead and get

00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:54,229
started on today's information though

00:04:51,229 --> 00:04:58,159
and and want to start by pushing out a

00:04:54,229 --> 00:05:01,999
poll to you guys and you'll see it pop

00:04:58,159 --> 00:05:04,189
up on your screen here but the question

00:05:01,999 --> 00:05:07,400
is so what is your experience with the

00:05:04,189 --> 00:05:09,889
mainframe you can select from you're

00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:13,669
using it now you've used it in the past

00:05:09,889 --> 00:05:15,169
or you have limited to no experience

00:05:13,669 --> 00:05:18,169
with the mainframe so I'll give

00:05:15,169 --> 00:05:22,339
everybody a few seconds here to go ahead

00:05:18,169 --> 00:05:25,189
and submit your answer and then we'll

00:05:22,339 --> 00:05:27,379
put will close out the poll and push it

00:05:25,189 --> 00:05:29,539
out and then we'll get started with our

00:05:27,379 --> 00:05:32,089
conversation here

00:05:29,539 --> 00:05:35,180
so do want to remind the audience also

00:05:32,089 --> 00:05:36,500
that you know at any time during the

00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:38,960
presentation if you've got a question

00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:42,110
please just use the GoToWebinar control

00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:44,900
panel and submit your question and looks

00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:46,490
like we have a good majority of folks

00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:49,279
who have voted so I'm going to go ahead

00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:51,860
and close out today's this first of four

00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:53,659
polls and share the results here

00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:58,849
looks like the majority of folks are

00:05:53,659 --> 00:06:00,800
using mainframe systems now so that

00:05:58,849 --> 00:06:02,870
should be a great way to kick off

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,479
today's discussion I'm going to go ahead

00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:08,120
and hide the results here but our first

00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:13,279
you know the one thing I'd like to start

00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:15,830
out with is the you know just the idea

00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:19,669
that that mainframe has been kind of

00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:21,139
isolated is especially apart from DevOps

00:06:19,669 --> 00:06:25,339
so why do you guys think that it has

00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:26,839
remain kind of that isolated platform in

00:06:25,339 --> 00:06:30,879
terms especially in terms of the

00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:33,680
application development and operations

00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:34,639
I'll let whoever wants to start the

00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,690
conversation here

00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:40,669
I can jump in Charlene so from from my

00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:43,370
own experience important from what I've

00:06:40,669 --> 00:06:44,330
seen from our Broadcom customers and in

00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:47,180
my opinion there

00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:50,000
there's a combination of reasons why the

00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:53,560
platform has remained isolated or and

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,569
sometimes we refer to it as being siloed

00:06:53,560 --> 00:07:02,360
separated out from from the other types

00:06:56,569 --> 00:07:04,370
of technologies and I see this for

00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:07,219
several reasons there's a cultural a

00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:10,430
technical and in somewhat of you know

00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:13,909
the nature of how applications are being

00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:17,060
maintained that play into it and from a

00:07:13,909 --> 00:07:19,639
cultural perspective you know many years

00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:23,810
ago organized organizations aligned

00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:26,509
their application teams by the business

00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:29,000
that they supported and at one point in

00:07:26,509 --> 00:07:32,150
time you know all of the applications

00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,180
were mainframe and so the teams all

00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:37,400
consisted of developers that supported

00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:39,289
for example you know a deposits

00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:41,539
application or a loans application or a

00:07:39,289 --> 00:07:44,840
credit card application and they were

00:07:41,539 --> 00:07:47,270
all mainframe developers but as the

00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:49,479
technology progressed and as we moved

00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:53,330
away from mainframe centric applications

00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:56,479
in over to say client server and now

00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:59,629
cloud and mobile you had to sort of

00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:02,169
interject newer skills in different

00:07:59,629 --> 00:08:04,819
skills and they weren't necessarily

00:08:02,169 --> 00:08:08,839
joining the teams at the time so you

00:08:04,819 --> 00:08:13,610
started to have disparate teams that

00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:17,289
contributed to a single application and

00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:20,210
then you know with with as time went on

00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:23,210
I think the team started to become more

00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:26,900
segregated based upon their skills and

00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:29,449
it naturally sort of supported that

00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:33,140
segregation that the mainframe skillsets

00:08:29,449 --> 00:08:36,829
were within fell within a different

00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:38,779
group of people and so we wound up with

00:08:36,829 --> 00:08:41,089
what we have I think in the majority of

00:08:38,779 --> 00:08:43,190
our customer sites where we have you

00:08:41,089 --> 00:08:45,140
know a single application change

00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:49,399
requires the combination and

00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:52,540
coordination of multiple teams to

00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:55,850
implement and and the nature of

00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:57,980
outsourcing I think has also added to

00:08:55,850 --> 00:09:00,910
the the geographic display

00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:03,400
and isolation of some of the mainframe

00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:06,680
developers and skill sets as well

00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:10,430
interesting all right great Joe John you

00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:11,990
guys have thoughts on this yes I think

00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:15,830
what yeah growth is absolutely spot-on

00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:19,070
about the kind of DevOps you know

00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:21,260
isolation and the kind of of mainframes

00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:22,640
will in companies and from a historical

00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:24,170
perspective that's really led us to

00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,750
where we are today with our cousins and

00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:28,670
I think we can disappoint for the next

00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:30,110
slide as well so we threw some sound

00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:32,390
bites onto this chart a lot of people

00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:33,470
think of the mainframe as being dated it

00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:35,390
perhaps something like that you know

00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:36,950
that one of their parents worked on or

00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:40,700
they learned about from sort of a

00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:42,490
history of IT it that is absolutely not

00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:44,690
the case you know Moore's law has

00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:48,080
propelled a lot of the computing power

00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:50,480
of the mainframe and you know well into

00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,490
the where it now sits you know we're

00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,010
still in the 21st century and just a few

00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:59,000
I won't go into how fast it is but a few

00:09:55,010 --> 00:10:03,230
stats about the effectiveness of it 70%

00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:05,780
of the world's data you know vast fast

00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:08,300
computing platform so the challenge rose

00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:11,030
was absolutely spot-on is how do we make

00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:13,850
it so the platform is thoroughly modern

00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:14,330
thoroughly fast thoroughly reliable and

00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:16,070
resilient

00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:18,130
how do we make people who have created

00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:22,180
an infrastructure and organization

00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:25,460
perhaps over the last half-century

00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:26,470
you know keep up with more modern DevOps

00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:29,300
practices

00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:31,280
yeah I mean just almost summarize a

00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:32,720
little bit with Joe saying there I don't

00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:35,480
think any of us could have got to this

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,130
point in our day without a mean if you

00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:39,730
went and bought a cup of coffee at

00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:42,980
Starbucks this morning if you happen to

00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:44,830
get on a plane to go somewhere if you

00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:48,440
went and checked your bank account

00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:50,570
that's thanks to a mainframe and I think

00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:53,210
because those things while they're so

00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:55,730
central and court of our society

00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:58,000
they're often just sort of the Givens if

00:10:55,730 --> 00:11:00,530
those go away we as a society collapse

00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,140
and I don't mean to make it so start but

00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:04,730
it is a huge impactive of who what we

00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:08,810
are and these are the machines that sort

00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:10,460
of keep those central pieces going the

00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:11,720
trend that if I look across a lot of

00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:13,700
technologies the

00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:15,590
we that have gone over time and you know

00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:18,200
cloud different architectures and

00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:19,970
whatnot I think two things are

00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:23,120
interesting one is the menu choices is

00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:25,580
increased you know no you know if you go

00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,260
back 30 years ago you had a handful of

00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:29,600
vendors you got your technology from you

00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:31,100
had a handful of technology choices you

00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,580
picked one path that's what you went

00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:34,760
with

00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:39,020
now the top organizations out there are

00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:40,730
heterogeneous by default either they've

00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:42,760
chosen to be there actually either or

00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:45,440
they've chosen to be there or

00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:47,150
acquisitions and other software choices

00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,520
may be before them put them there but

00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:52,310
they see that as a competitive advantage

00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:53,930
and it really helps position the

00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:57,590
opportunity for what a mainframe can

00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:59,060
deliver as something unique but a lot of

00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:01,010
that message just hasn't as God is

00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:03,950
clearly out there and it also hasn't

00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:06,710
kept up with the times of where modern

00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:08,900
development is and perhaps as we learn

00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:12,620
more about Zoe maybe that helps bridge a

00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:15,230
little to that gap alright great so I'd

00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:17,000
like to throw out a couple more polls

00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:19,750
just to kind of take the pulse here to

00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,970
see where companies stand in relation to

00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:25,300
you know the mainframe adoption so I'm

00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:28,190
gonna push out the first one right now

00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:30,620
so the question is how integrated is

00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:33,560
mainframe into your enterprise devops

00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:37,690
program fully integrated highly

00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:40,820
integrated moderately integrated limited

00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:44,480
integration or no integration whatsoever

00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:47,120
so guys go ahead and submit your answers

00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:49,100
and give I'll give everybody a few

00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,530
seconds here and then we'll go ahead and

00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:54,620
push out the results and then we'll do

00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:59,230
another poll all right after that so as

00:12:54,620 --> 00:13:02,120
you are submitting your answers also a

00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:03,980
reminder again if you have a question at

00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:06,580
any time just use your GoToWebinar

00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:13,580
control panel and submit your questions

00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:15,800
we will let's see we will go ahead and

00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:18,560
close it out looks like we have a

00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:21,740
majority of folks who have submitted

00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:23,750
their their answers so let's share the

00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:24,790
results it looks like we have the

00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:28,390
majority of

00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:31,060
have had no integration or have no

00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:34,720
integration and and followed closely by

00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:37,780
limited integration so guys this this is

00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:40,960
I'm sure it's this is level setting the

00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:44,380
conversation here but keeping those

00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:49,030
results in mind let's go ahead and take

00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:51,160
a look at our other poll that launching

00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:52,750
right now which is how big a problem is

00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:55,000
lack of integration between the

00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:58,930
mainframe and devops program was almost

00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:04,150
like we knew that the answer would be no

00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:06,580
integration so good you can see your

00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:08,560
answers here that you can choose from

00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:11,080
it's a major problem is and it's hurting

00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:15,160
the business it's a minor problem is in

00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:18,700
it has limited business impact it's not

00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:24,580
a problem or it's not applicable so go

00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:25,990
ahead and submit your answers and a few

00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:28,960
more seconds here and then we'll go

00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:32,080
ahead and close this one out take a look

00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:35,830
at the results and then we'll get resume

00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:38,650
our conversation here ok let's go ahead

00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:40,780
and close this one out and I'll share

00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:43,360
the results here looks like the majority

00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:46,090
folks say that it's kind of a minor

00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:49,810
problem but they followed pretty closely

00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:54,160
by it being a major problem so very very

00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:57,330
interesting to think about those those

00:14:54,160 --> 00:15:04,660
results there for both of the polls and

00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:05,890
you know I had conversations about Zoe

00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:07,870
not withstanding in the end the

00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:10,540
mainframe but do you guys see kind of

00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:13,660
the limited impact or the the major

00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:17,590
impact does the seem odd to you that

00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:19,000
that businesses are answering that with

00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:21,820
the fact that there are so many that

00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,270
have no integration whatsoever I'm just

00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:28,060
curious

00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:31,810
I mean if it's it's it's a it's a

00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:33,760
negative so I'm surprised I mean even as

00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:35,980
I seem to talk to sometimes customers

00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:37,600
and partners in the area you know

00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:38,120
Gartner yours is a definition of mode

00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,939
one

00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:42,499
Oh to i.t you know mode one being like

00:15:40,939 --> 00:15:44,059
these are the people to keep

00:15:42,499 --> 00:15:47,120
business-critical stuff up and going

00:15:44,059 --> 00:15:50,089
mode 2 is more the experimental kind of

00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,980
the the fast-moving agile piece there if

00:15:50,089 --> 00:15:55,730
you get into an organization that has

00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:58,459
mainframes you have a mode 1a and 1b you

00:15:55,730 --> 00:16:00,740
know one is all of IT 1b is the main

00:15:58,459 --> 00:16:03,230
framers and they're just kept

00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:05,660
differently their organisations or put

00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:06,860
together differently and yeah you just

00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:09,259
there's a very there's a cultural thing

00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:12,620
which I think both rose and Joe spoke to

00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:13,970
that exists there that again hopefully

00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:17,509
projects like this might be in a

00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:19,759
position to bridge okay all right great

00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:22,279
roasted did you have a comment about it

00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:25,639
as well I know I couldn't agree more

00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:27,290
with with John all right great

00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:29,959
so let's go ahead and move on then

00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:32,449
because I'd really like to hear a lot

00:16:29,959 --> 00:16:37,129
about the open mainframe project and and

00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:37,899
Zoe so tell me about it who wants to go

00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:40,490
first

00:16:37,899 --> 00:16:42,740
so maybe maybe I'll set the stage here a

00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:44,420
little bit and then I love for you know

00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:46,999
Joe especially being in the community

00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:49,730
and Rose being with a member Broadcom to

00:16:46,999 --> 00:16:52,220
kind of share some perspectives here and

00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:55,699
maybe skipping ahead of slide might be a

00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:58,610
little bit useful here so the open

00:16:55,699 --> 00:17:02,779
mainframe project was founded a few

00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:05,029
years ago with the idea of how can how

00:17:02,779 --> 00:17:07,010
could we bring together the various open

00:17:05,029 --> 00:17:10,339
source efforts that are happening around

00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:13,279
the mainframe into a cohesive group to

00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:15,829
drive together open source is not new to

00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:17,120
the mainframe if you know we've the

00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:18,890
Linux Foundation we like to trace

00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:22,010
through the genealogy of open source

00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:25,069
through the decades and we can go back

00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:27,110
to 1955 with the founding of share and

00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:32,289
for those of you new to the the

00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:35,840
mainframe parlance share is a technology

00:17:32,289 --> 00:17:38,600
group and event that was founded

00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:41,570
basically for mainframe ministers and

00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:44,090
operators to collaborate they would

00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:46,130
share code back together thus the term

00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:47,960
it's an event that still exists today

00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:49,159
there was just a share event in Phoenix

00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:51,240
there's another one in Pittsburgh this

00:17:49,159 --> 00:17:53,580
summer but

00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:55,080
those are sort of the roots of sharing

00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:56,490
collaborating within this community so

00:17:55,080 --> 00:18:01,170
the spirit has always been something

00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:03,380
that has been a part of it add to that

00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:05,970
that you know as we discussed earlier

00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:07,200
mainframes a critical technology you

00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:09,480
know mainframes have been around for 50

00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,610
some years and you know when this

00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:13,500
project is being formed while there was

00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:15,420
open source efforts coming on I mean

00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:18,150
open source and Linux has been on the

00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:19,980
platform since the late 90s early 2000s

00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:22,770
and and you know growing and growing in

00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:26,880
usage the efforts were very dispersed

00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:28,830
they were a very vendor led and there

00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,050
wasn't a lot of collaboration happening

00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:32,400
between different organizations and and

00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:34,710
the experience we have AG Linux

00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,780
foundation when you start to get that

00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:40,890
collaboration happening when you start

00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:43,050
to share that R&D effort when vendors

00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:46,290
have an opportunity to collaborate in a

00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:48,750
vendor-neutral way technology flourishes

00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:51,870
and we've seen this over and over and

00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:54,240
again in industry after industry cloud

00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:55,800
industry around kubernetes and some of

00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:59,070
the web dev technologies their

00:18:55,800 --> 00:19:01,500
automotive industry with the rise of the

00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:03,600
infotainment system within vehicles I

00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:06,510
was talking with presenters earlier here

00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:08,490
in the motion picture industry projects

00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:10,410
underway there to collaborate on the

00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:13,260
tools use for visual effects when you

00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:15,570
when you see this happen it helps this

00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:18,240
industry flourish it helps bring new

00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:21,000
people to the table and it helps drive

00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:23,100
unique technology things that no one

00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,650
vendor can do because no one vendor has

00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:27,570
all of that talent together but all of

00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:30,030
them can equally benefit and and that's

00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:32,550
really the thrust of what the main open

00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:36,240
mainframe projects purpose in this world

00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:39,210
is within there we saw an opportunity

00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:41,429
brought to us by a few companies that

00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:44,850
were big in this space here see a

00:19:41,429 --> 00:19:47,730
Broadcom IBM and rocket software that

00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:51,390
said hey you know we see this as a venue

00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:53,460
as a host for an area of how can we do

00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:56,190
something unique here on the z/os

00:19:53,460 --> 00:20:00,120
platform really kind of one of the

00:19:56,190 --> 00:20:02,130
first-ever z/os launched open source

00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:04,920
projects like open source launched on

00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:08,040
z/os natively how

00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:10,020
we do this to help bring a greater

00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:12,000
audience around here and really just

00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:13,950
drive industry collaboration provide a

00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,860
way for their partners their customers

00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:19,350
other key vendors in the space to all

00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:23,190
work together to all help share a common

00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:24,570
goal of providing a modern framework for

00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:26,850
interacting with the mainframe and

00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:28,260
that's that's really the background here

00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:30,510
in the milkman a friend project hosts

00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:33,030
other efforts in this area such as the

00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:35,940
anomaly detection we have new ones that

00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:37,740
are also coming around the CBM and and

00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:40,620
other space as well and helping support

00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:42,240
other open source on the platform along

00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:44,790
with helping just sort of drive new

00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,500
trends in the industry such as diversity

00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:48,810
and driving more women and

00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:51,180
underrepresented minorities along with

00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:53,190
students and younger you know kind of

00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:55,440
helping you a lot of that generational

00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:57,720
gap so again it's it's an effort you

00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,950
know open mainframe project an effort to

00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,210
sort of bring that community together in

00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:03,780
a under neutral way

00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:07,770
zoe is the a technology collaboration

00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:10,320
here for really driving a modern way to

00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:12,660
engage with your mainframe and the many

00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,250
z/os tools there and kind of addressing

00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:16,650
that thing we just saw you know in that

00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:18,360
poll their limited integration this is

00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:19,830
what Zoe's here to do so anyways I'd

00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:25,800
love to have the technical experts

00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:26,760
comment yeah so yeah so if I can go next

00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:29,610
to it I'm sure

00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:32,430
I just want to little a little story and

00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:36,540
so when I joined when I joined the

00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:38,670
mainframe at IBM my background was I was

00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:40,860
a PC developer I use languages like

00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:43,350
Visual Basic and several Pascal and and

00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:45,900
a small token I knew nothing about the

00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:47,310
mainframe nada zip zilch but I've been

00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:50,070
at IBM working on the technology when I

00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:51,720
joined the mainframe I was kind of a

00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:53,730
little bit terrified by it walking

00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:55,260
around my office it was a bit like

00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:56,730
watching an episode of The Matrix you

00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:58,470
know when Keanu Reeves you know when

00:21:56,730 --> 00:22:00,270
there's lots of green on black scrolling

00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:03,000
you know I wasn't a chosen one I wasn't

00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:04,650
you know lots of three or five like the

00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,220
rack bonus I found it quite a difficult

00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:10,800
environment to adaptors so I was 30 then

00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:13,920
I'm a little bit older now I guess you

00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:14,830
can see in the webcam so 32 maybe at the

00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:18,309
most rate

00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:24,009
[Laughter]

00:22:18,309 --> 00:22:25,690
so a lot of my so so so and CA and you

00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:27,609
know rocket who in this space as well

00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:29,559
and many other ISPs I talked to we're

00:22:27,609 --> 00:22:31,929
all we're all trying to address this

00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:35,859
problem so that we're trying to make the

00:22:31,929 --> 00:22:37,989
mainframe not special a lot of customers

00:22:35,859 --> 00:22:39,070
come to come to me and others as well

00:22:37,989 --> 00:22:41,769
and say they want to make them to be

00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:44,320
nondescript it so it's my background at

00:22:41,769 --> 00:22:45,759
the time with PC tools I wanted to be

00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,359
able to bring what I was familiar with

00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:51,309
at the time and work the mainframe and

00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:53,649
that song is still playing but it's

00:22:51,309 --> 00:22:56,559
playing at faster speed and a higher

00:22:53,649 --> 00:22:58,749
bandwidth now so right now if you look

00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:00,429
at what the what people want from DevOps

00:22:58,749 --> 00:23:03,249
they want to be able to hook up you know

00:23:00,429 --> 00:23:05,349
Jenkins and get and you know and all of

00:23:03,249 --> 00:23:06,879
these tools out there that people can

00:23:05,349 --> 00:23:09,159
durst and they're very fast evolving

00:23:06,879 --> 00:23:11,499
very fast and they want to attach all of

00:23:09,159 --> 00:23:13,119
these and dock them around the main

00:23:11,499 --> 00:23:14,200
space from an operational and

00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:16,239
development point of view and that's a

00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:18,729
challenge that's being faced now what's

00:23:16,239 --> 00:23:24,070
really interesting about working with

00:23:18,729 --> 00:23:26,379
John and others at the LMP is that what

00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:28,960
I did IBM was I worked with a lot of

00:23:26,379 --> 00:23:31,509
very smart people and we adapted some

00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,249
technology based upon eclipse so it's

00:23:31,509 --> 00:23:36,789
towards the mainframe and stuff but we

00:23:33,249 --> 00:23:38,769
never we still created a very less

00:23:36,789 --> 00:23:40,929
imperfect customer experience because we

00:23:38,769 --> 00:23:44,080
did that other it was pitiable still

00:23:40,929 --> 00:23:46,119
vendor lock-in to the stack so we wanted

00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,229
other ISPs to participate in what we

00:23:46,119 --> 00:23:49,419
were doing and they said I'm not going

00:23:47,229 --> 00:23:50,950
to do that because you IBM when they

00:23:49,419 --> 00:23:53,229
look down their technology stack they

00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:55,599
would see their debuggers and their

00:23:53,229 --> 00:23:57,190
their technology on top and they would

00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:58,960
say but IBM owns a piece of the

00:23:57,190 --> 00:24:00,279
technology stack we're not going to play

00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,499
with you because even though you're

00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:03,940
really friendly today we don't know

00:24:02,499 --> 00:24:06,489
what's going to happen tomorrow or we

00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:08,349
can't pay someone you know in a Friday

00:24:06,489 --> 00:24:10,830
night and get it fixed quickly so there

00:24:08,349 --> 00:24:13,179
was still a problem so lots of companies

00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:15,460
created their own technology stack and

00:24:13,179 --> 00:24:17,950
they didn't share its what's basically

00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:19,629
undifferentiated heavy lifting which was

00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:22,029
happen I get a really good set of modern

00:24:19,629 --> 00:24:24,009
api's a really good framework for

00:24:22,029 --> 00:24:26,200
extending being able to dock all of

00:24:24,009 --> 00:24:30,009
these open source tools and a really

00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:31,570
good extensible framework and that's

00:24:30,009 --> 00:24:38,229
where we are now but anyone

00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:40,570
since I weighed my hands a lot I just

00:24:38,229 --> 00:24:42,190
want to add you know from you know

00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:43,809
there's a quote out there that that goes

00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:46,629
something like and I don't think anyone

00:24:43,809 --> 00:24:49,529
has taken credit for this so none of us

00:24:46,629 --> 00:24:52,629
is as smart as all of us and you know

00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:54,820
open source really is is the epitome of

00:24:52,629 --> 00:24:59,919
that and you know Zoe being the first

00:24:54,820 --> 00:25:03,100
open source project on on gos it for me

00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:05,830
as a lifelong main framer it just

00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:08,519
changes the game it makes it that much

00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:11,019
more interesting that much more exciting

00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:13,299
gives us all the opportunity to be a

00:25:11,019 --> 00:25:15,399
part of history if you will and you know

00:25:13,299 --> 00:25:18,460
here's and I'm gonna throw a couple of

00:25:15,399 --> 00:25:20,879
these out as we go through but it here's

00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:24,789
in my opinion here's an awesome Zoe fact

00:25:20,879 --> 00:25:27,549
when when the engineers at SIA Broadcom

00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:29,830
started to work on this this wasn't

00:25:27,549 --> 00:25:32,979
something that anybody asked them to

00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:35,799
work on this was natural this was this

00:25:32,979 --> 00:25:38,200
was organic innovation at its finest

00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:40,330
these folks were trying to solve a

00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:43,149
problem these engineers saw an

00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:45,549
opportunity to improve the way they

00:25:43,149 --> 00:25:49,450
worked and they went about it in a very

00:25:45,549 --> 00:25:51,879
organic way and you know we produced our

00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:54,690
contribution to Zoe is the the command

00:25:51,879 --> 00:25:57,129
line the CLI in the API mediation layer

00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:59,710
bringing you know command line which is

00:25:57,129 --> 00:26:02,799
very cloud like very very modern very

00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:06,309
non mainframe ish if you will to the

00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:09,729
mainframe and we also brought you know

00:26:06,309 --> 00:26:11,979
API first type of thinking to the

00:26:09,729 --> 00:26:13,929
mainframe as well in in collaboration

00:26:11,979 --> 00:26:17,320
with you know our partners at IBM and

00:26:13,929 --> 00:26:20,229
rocket so the fact that you know our

00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:22,749
engineers and in the contributors to Zoe

00:26:20,229 --> 00:26:24,309
are truly just trying to solve a problem

00:26:22,749 --> 00:26:26,590
and they're doing it naturally and

00:26:24,309 --> 00:26:31,019
organically I believe just you know

00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:34,059
changes the game alright great so other

00:26:31,019 --> 00:26:36,399
is there anything about those OE

00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:40,230
framework specifically that we should be

00:26:36,399 --> 00:26:43,779
discussing that you guys want to go over

00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:45,370
before we kind of talk more about the

00:26:43,779 --> 00:26:51,700
mainframe and DevOps

00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:54,280
in general I could cover the framework

00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:55,480
really quickly just I saw a few

00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,950
questions in the channel where some

00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:59,290
people have said you know get to the

00:26:56,950 --> 00:27:00,790
meat of the talk about yourself so maybe

00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:03,760
we should do that and open the Q&A a

00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:05,590
little bit for and so we provide we've

00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:09,100
decided to organize this up in three

00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:11,290
ways and I think the most important

00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:13,470
thing that any computing platform has is

00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:18,070
api's application programming interfaces

00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:20,230
so we have if we read this chart upside

00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:22,780
down from the top down so we have an

00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:24,760
architecture and we use a technology

00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:28,330
that actually comes from Netflix it's

00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:31,690
Netflix tool as we said that was donated

00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:34,000
by Broadcom to the deserving project of

00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:37,540
Ch slash World Cup so it's a very good

00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,250
industry standard API gateway there's an

00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:43,270
API mediation there we put around that

00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:45,010
what that means is we provide within the

00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:46,390
bet we provide that within the base and

00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:50,590
we provide a number of services within

00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:53,559
the base so you can get a job files you

00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:55,450
can you know you can submit jobs you

00:27:53,559 --> 00:27:58,290
know you can query say you know issue

00:27:55,450 --> 00:28:00,550
TSO command issue

00:27:58,290 --> 00:28:03,250
NBS operate to come on through this

00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:06,070
regretful api swagger defined restful

00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:07,420
api now behind that there are some micro

00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:09,280
services and we can go into the tech

00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:12,010
later if people want but the values of

00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:14,500
that gives you have a single a single

00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:16,390
server to connect to if you don't have

00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:18,280
that if you're building a client service

00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:19,750
multiple client server applications

00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:22,240
connecting to different backends you end

00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:25,720
up with what I got yelled at once by

00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:27,490
vice president of a company he said you

00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:28,960
know I hate what he didn't say I hate

00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:31,690
you he said to do other things but he

00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:33,070
said my experience for my guide on the

00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:35,200
mainframe is choppy

00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:37,450
everything is choppy they do a piece of

00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:40,000
work and then they switch to another one

00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:43,240
and they have to rely on start the

00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,920
second application absolute reserve ask

00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:47,290
them to put this place back to where it

00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:48,670
is initial point about the DevOps if we

00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:50,770
trying to find all these tools together

00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:52,900
they must go through a single end point

00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:54,610
you must be challenged with a single

00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:57,429
certificate you must be authenticated

00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:59,200
once you know so building all of this

00:28:57,429 --> 00:29:02,049
from the bottom up is very

00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:04,510
to do then we split into two ways after

00:29:02,049 --> 00:29:07,600
that we have a web desktop and the

00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:11,260
command line now interestingly the web

00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:13,090
desktop is a and they both go to the

00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:16,059
same set of API the web desktop is

00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:17,590
because people want things with a zero

00:29:16,059 --> 00:29:19,870
install client you know you're in the

00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:21,909
Air Force lounge you know as long as

00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:25,389
you've got VPN access for something you

00:29:21,909 --> 00:29:27,940
can access you know front ends

00:29:25,389 --> 00:29:30,190
Gumi front ends if you or i log onto

00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:31,779
most of our business commerce

00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:33,460
relationships we have with anybody like

00:29:31,779 --> 00:29:34,899
that we're going through the web but you

00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:36,130
can do emails through the web you can do

00:29:34,899 --> 00:29:39,010
your mortgage through the web and things

00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:40,960
like that so we have a web UI we have

00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:42,850
base function and it's expensable

00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:45,309
and then we also have a command line

00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:47,320
interface and the command line interface

00:29:45,309 --> 00:29:48,720
is interesting some people criticize

00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:51,159
there we and they say it's not modern

00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:53,230
because it's a command line interface

00:29:51,159 --> 00:29:55,710
they say you've gone back in time but

00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:59,230
actually it is the universal adapter

00:29:55,710 --> 00:30:01,299
because it reminds me of the arguments I

00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:04,179
remember when the web first came along

00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:06,970
but the web is backed by HTTPS that's a

00:30:04,179 --> 00:30:10,419
hypertext Transfer Protocol and the web

00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:12,519
ships text it's a really poor client

00:30:10,419 --> 00:30:14,620
server interface technically it's just

00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:16,450
right there are much better program to

00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:19,360
program communication but it's so

00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:21,760
Universal because any server said I'm

00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,980
just serving HTML we've got an HTTP

00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:25,389
backbone any client can attach to it

00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:28,389
where you have this incredible

00:30:25,389 --> 00:30:30,070
multiplicity of clients to service also

00:30:28,389 --> 00:30:30,309
a single place which is the World Wide

00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:33,760
Web

00:30:30,309 --> 00:30:35,260
so effectively that's the kind of

00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:38,289
architecture that we've got here it's

00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:40,480
very extensible you can plug in micro

00:30:38,289 --> 00:30:44,049
services at the backend you can plug in

00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:46,120
new command line modules

00:30:44,049 --> 00:30:48,880
it's a node package sorts of different

00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:58,600
backends and you can plug in new web you

00:30:48,880 --> 00:31:02,470
ice no it's great I think it's I think

00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:04,269
it's a great introduction to to you know

00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:06,100
the the value that Zooey brings

00:31:04,269 --> 00:31:10,929
definitely to the mainframe but but you

00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:14,049
know moving along into kind of you know

00:31:10,929 --> 00:31:15,999
the the major topic of DevOps in the

00:31:14,049 --> 00:31:17,169
mainframe I because I know it's kind of

00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:19,149
a hot-button issue for a lot of

00:31:17,169 --> 00:31:21,159
companies so let's talk a little bit

00:31:19,149 --> 00:31:22,719
about you know what companies need to

00:31:21,159 --> 00:31:24,039
think about maybe when they're adopting

00:31:22,719 --> 00:31:26,080
some of these tools I mean do they have

00:31:24,039 --> 00:31:28,539
it there you have any best practices or

00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:32,619
use cases or tool sets that you like to

00:31:28,539 --> 00:31:36,399
you know that you like to to tell folks

00:31:32,619 --> 00:31:40,330
about or you know just what what what

00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:43,450
advice can you give basically let's go

00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:45,879
first yeah I can take that Charlene so

00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:48,549
maybe the best way to respond to that is

00:31:45,879 --> 00:31:52,599
to sort of talk about who we're finding

00:31:48,549 --> 00:31:56,979
is is using zoe we're still obviously in

00:31:52,599 --> 00:31:59,710
the early days we just introduced 1.0 in

00:31:56,979 --> 00:32:02,559
in addition to being widely used by our

00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:06,549
own developer development teams and

00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:08,619
engineers in our collaborators we have a

00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:11,049
growing set of early adopters we also

00:32:08,619 --> 00:32:13,839
have other mainframe vendors outside of

00:32:11,049 --> 00:32:16,839
the Zoe founders who are using Zoe for

00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:18,609
their own development and that's sort of

00:32:16,839 --> 00:32:21,729
a clear signal to the

00:32:18,609 --> 00:32:25,539
that that Zoe is is starting people are

00:32:21,729 --> 00:32:27,940
starting to see some value in Zoe you

00:32:25,539 --> 00:32:30,269
know and from our perspective you know

00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:35,440
having the ability and wanting to use

00:32:30,269 --> 00:32:39,969
you know things like task runners having

00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:45,729
access to automated test tools bringing

00:32:39,969 --> 00:32:49,509
mainframe in to see ICD pipelines this

00:32:45,729 --> 00:32:53,679
this is really you know in thinking

00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:55,509
about you know companies trying to get

00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:59,739
into this game and thinking about

00:32:55,509 --> 00:33:02,200
adopting Zoe this this is this is true

00:32:59,739 --> 00:33:04,239
open source and and what's nice is that

00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:09,609
anyone can go ahead and start using it

00:33:04,239 --> 00:33:14,259
at no cost the process is extremely

00:33:09,609 --> 00:33:16,749
transparent you can see what's going on

00:33:14,259 --> 00:33:20,259
both with with the vendors contributing

00:33:16,749 --> 00:33:22,629
or individual contributors and you know

00:33:20,259 --> 00:33:23,750
we have customers that are struggling

00:33:22,629 --> 00:33:26,929
with okay

00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:28,549
what use case is is best for us so where

00:33:26,929 --> 00:33:31,850
do we begin

00:33:28,549 --> 00:33:34,280
the nice nice part about the whole

00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:36,140
open-source world again is that you have

00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:38,299
the freedom to choose to start where it

00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:40,280
makes sense maybe you have a high

00:33:38,299 --> 00:33:42,590
visibility project that needs more

00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:45,169
testing for example and you don't know

00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:47,690
how to start to introduce more testing

00:33:45,169 --> 00:33:49,220
into your mainframe section of your

00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:51,440
application or maybe you're

00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:53,929
short-staffed and you need to transition

00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:57,530
an area that traditionally would be

00:33:53,929 --> 00:34:01,070
staffed by a person to a service like as

00:33:57,530 --> 00:34:03,890
an example maybe provisioning CICS

00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:06,320
readings or something like that

00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:09,619
and this is one of the reasons why at CA

00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:12,800
Broadcom we are offering workshops to

00:34:09,619 --> 00:34:15,320
customers to help them grasp

00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:18,080
you know the concepts of it and in where

00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:23,869
where they might be best positioned to

00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:27,290
start leveraging Zoe add a little bit

00:34:23,869 --> 00:34:28,399
onto that you know and I think Rosie did

00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:29,839
a good job of sort of very much

00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:31,879
articulating sort of the product use

00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:35,179
case you know why do you adopt it as a

00:34:31,879 --> 00:34:37,790
use you know an interesting thing and

00:34:35,179 --> 00:34:40,099
and one of the really the key moments I

00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:45,980
remember from when Zoe was announced

00:34:40,099 --> 00:34:48,020
back in last August was telling the

00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:52,550
audience and talking to the people there

00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:55,760
that you know this isn't a Broadcom CA

00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:57,349
or Broadcom IBM rocket project I mean

00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,510
they can they develop the technology

00:34:57,349 --> 00:35:01,130
they initially contributed it and I

00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:03,710
think the entire open-source communities

00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:05,270
extremely grateful about this but it's

00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:08,599
really a project for the community as a

00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:10,190
whole and that there and of itself I

00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:12,230
remember sitting you know if I if I'm

00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:14,150
talking to your probably Charlene your

00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:15,890
typical DevOps audience that's sort of

00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:18,339
an expectation right there

00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:20,930
they're used to looking at tools like

00:35:18,339 --> 00:35:22,609
you know Gradle and puppet and things

00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:23,810
like that that they they have a seat at

00:35:22,609 --> 00:35:24,950
the table what they know that they're

00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:27,140
not only the users but did their

00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:28,940
contributors to it this is a little bit

00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:32,480
of a different thing that I think that

00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:35,530
world hadn't really thought about and

00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:37,790
you know we want to be really clear here

00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:40,410
definitely use it but

00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:42,180
part of part of this being out an open

00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:43,530
source is so that you have a seat at the

00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:46,500
table of directing where this goes and

00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:48,240
bringing your use cases in there and you

00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:50,700
as a vendor saying hey man that this is

00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,990
this is part of what we're doing already

00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:53,490
why don't we align and leverage this

00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:58,380
technology and contribute some of our

00:35:53,490 --> 00:36:00,530
great skills talent expertise to this

00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:03,090
effort here so it's a very

00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:05,130
transformative yes on the technology

00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:06,660
side but also just how this community

00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:10,290
comes together and sort of changing a

00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:12,570
little bit of that mantra there where

00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:13,770
it's you know sort of waiting in a lot

00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:15,020
of times for vendors to solve the

00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:16,980
problems

00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:19,590
everybody's community has a way to do it

00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:20,790
and the devops world I'm sure you know

00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:21,990
the average DevOps her she was probably

00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:24,090
raising their hands in the air and

00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:25,380
saying hallelujah we've been waiting for

00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:27,260
this to happen for a long time because

00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:29,520
this is how the rest of the world works

00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:34,110
this is the mainframe community coming

00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:35,820
along alright great so yeah I wonder

00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:39,810
then what what are some of the mainframe

00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:45,180
services that Zoey accesses that's going

00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:46,830
to be helpful for folks yeah yeah I'm

00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:48,780
thinking about looking at so by the way

00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:50,880
apologies if people we're getting some

00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:53,010
of this is there is a very detailed

00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,840
webinar on the 11th when we're going to

00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:57,390
deep dive more so this one is pitch a

00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:59,190
little bit more high-level web web dev

00:36:57,390 --> 00:37:00,870
ops II so I'm gonna I'm going to try and

00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:06,120
geek out and deep diving again with my

00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:11,010
hands up waving cookie so so we access

00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:13,680
we access jazz we access the NBA file

00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:15,840
system data set PD SES except we have

00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:18,540
REST API through all of that we arrest a

00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:20,130
judge the UNIX file system pretty much

00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:23,100
everything you can the way I like to

00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:28,440
sell it the mainframe is we can also we

00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:30,810
also have api's to issue the command

00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:33,390
interfaces but here so commands MBS

00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:37,800
commands and stuff we have a good set of

00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:39,480
core based function in there within we

00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:42,660
also have a command line interface that

00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:45,480
lets you access all of that and we also

00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:47,490
have GUI we have a plugin for visual

00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:48,950
studio code that lets you just work

00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:50,520
directly with data sets

00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:53,730
members

00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:55,890
so you can add in you know plugins for

00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:57,839
COBOL or source languages linters for

00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:59,579
whatever you want to do so so we brought

00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:02,480
it up to that level we're adding a lot

00:37:59,579 --> 00:38:04,559
more in we're adding support in for

00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,150
getting the UNIX file system working

00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:07,890
more with Visual Studio code and

00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:08,549
submitting jobs the more life cycle that

00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:10,289
you fix them

00:38:08,549 --> 00:38:11,430
we also within the web desktop that I

00:38:10,289 --> 00:38:13,859
talked about we have a couple of

00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:15,809
explorers we call an MBS USS and jet

00:38:13,859 --> 00:38:17,789
explorer so I'd like to sell it to

00:38:15,809 --> 00:38:22,049
people or describe it to people as

00:38:17,789 --> 00:38:24,619
imagine ispf 3.4 but in a browser GUI

00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:27,720
imagine ICS 3.17 in a browser GUI

00:38:24,619 --> 00:38:29,190
imagine SPSS in a browser GUI you know

00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:30,750
that's the direction we're heading into

00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:33,210
so the people who need to manipulate

00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:37,170
those subsystems can come along and they

00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:39,329
don't have to be you know like neo in

00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:40,799
the matrix that right or any way but

00:38:39,329 --> 00:38:42,480
they don't have to understand the green

00:38:40,799 --> 00:38:45,000
screen world they can drive it from and

00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:46,950
they can plug in their own plugins now

00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:50,670
it's not that we're all so that's our

00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:52,410
base but we're not closed so there are

00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:53,730
plugins remember I had that architecture

00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:55,710
diagram the Microsoft I was still

00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:57,270
showing now so you can if you're an

00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:59,640
endeavour customer and you have

00:38:57,270 --> 00:39:02,160
endeavour at the back end you can get in

00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:03,390
deadline endeavour as web api and then

00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,740
they come up through the command-line

00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:06,599
interfaces but you can work well with

00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:09,839
endeavour you don't have to move across

00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:13,950
you can bring this world forward there

00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:15,930
are plugins to work with kicks where you

00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:17,819
can go to the command interface that you

00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:19,529
can query kicks transactions and program

00:39:17,819 --> 00:39:22,170
new copies and fade and there are

00:39:19,529 --> 00:39:24,630
plugins for db2 where you can do DevOps

00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:25,740
commands there are other ones I don't

00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:26,760
want to get in trouble by announcing

00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:28,559
something that hasn't been announced yet

00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:30,210
I think there's one coming for IMS we've

00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:32,549
discussed that publicly so that's in the

00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:35,010
pipeline there are many others coming

00:39:32,549 --> 00:39:36,089
and iBM has made various statements and

00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:38,010
they've brought some have in the past

00:39:36,089 --> 00:39:39,900
about shifting a lot of their tooling

00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:42,900
across so people that have existing

00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:44,730
tooling will find over time that more of

00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:48,390
those will be accessible through the

00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:50,670
gateway through REST API and then you'll

00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:52,559
see those bubbling up into plugins for

00:39:50,670 --> 00:40:00,690
the command-line interface and plug into

00:39:52,559 --> 00:40:03,990
the web desktop that okay after you're

00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:04,800
in doing good hands because I worked for

00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:06,840
IBM where

00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:10,020
we have a lot of subsystems that run a

00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:11,910
lot of work we have tools as well see a

00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:13,680
Broadcom have a lot of tools rocket have

00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:16,950
a lot of tools and we're all moving

00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:20,220
towards this as a unifying bit of tech

00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:22,500
that's awesome there really is and and

00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:24,570
with that actually it's a great set

00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:27,930
because I want to push up the last poll

00:40:24,570 --> 00:40:30,990
that we have which deals with the tool

00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:33,960
areas that folks would like to see

00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:35,760
hopefully so I just put push the pull

00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:37,940
out which is in which tool area would

00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:42,750
you most like to integrate the mainframe

00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:46,550
so are the selections are source access

00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:51,230
task runners build tools test automation

00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:54,930
see ICD or infrastructure management and

00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:57,810
go ahead and submit your answer and then

00:40:54,930 --> 00:41:01,920
we'll take a look at those answers and

00:40:57,810 --> 00:41:03,810
then I would love to at least for a

00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:09,600
minute or two talk about the topic of

00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:12,720
security and you know how systems of

00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:14,550
Records you know and security standards

00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:18,330
and and how they how they all work

00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:20,130
together so let's I'll give this a

00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:21,660
couple more seconds and just a quick

00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:23,010
reminder if you have a question please

00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:27,480
go ahead and use your GoToWebinar

00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:31,320
control panel and we will get to as many

00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:32,670
questions as we can okay so we are we

00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:34,170
have a majority so I'm gonna go ahead

00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:36,390
and close out the poll and push the

00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:38,160
results out so it looks like the

00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:42,090
majority of folks are looking for see

00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:45,690
ICD is a tool area to integrate with the

00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:48,740
mainframe followed by looks like test

00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:52,790
automation is the second highest so

00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:55,770
that's that's really an interesting

00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:57,540
selection I think infrastructure

00:41:55,770 --> 00:42:00,900
management test runners build build

00:41:57,540 --> 00:42:03,690
tools and source access or the the final

00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:06,240
ones so okay guys um so let's talk a

00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:07,890
little bit about security because we

00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,660
know that that's you know definitely one

00:42:07,890 --> 00:42:13,310
of the big advantages of the mainframe

00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:15,510
over of other systems but you know so

00:42:13,310 --> 00:42:18,450
what happens here I mean how does

00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:20,190
opening the mainframe coexist with

00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:22,170
you know a lot of the security standards

00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:24,510
that folks think about when they think

00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:27,210
of the the system of record applications

00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:29,880
it's got to be kind of a conundrum there

00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:31,920
so Rose do you want to start us off with

00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:33,480
that one store sure I can you know it's

00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:35,119
it's interesting I was at a customer

00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:37,799
site earlier this week and Inever

00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:41,299
inevitably the question around security

00:42:37,799 --> 00:42:43,470
does come up with respect to Zoey and

00:42:41,299 --> 00:42:48,420
see a bright side our commercial

00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:50,069
offering and what it's from my

00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:52,770
perspective it's really quite

00:42:50,069 --> 00:42:57,900
straightforward the command line the

00:42:52,770 --> 00:43:00,750
plugins rely on AP is the API is require

00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:04,440
mainframe authentication they completely

00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:06,390
uphold mainframe security if you've got

00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:11,220
a mainframe security package package

00:43:06,390 --> 00:43:15,319
running on your system then those

00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:18,750
security rules are in play and they are

00:43:15,319 --> 00:43:20,809
absolutely supported and then you know

00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:26,520
the off host communication leverages

00:43:20,809 --> 00:43:29,190
HTTPS so it really you know it's it's as

00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:32,040
its as straightforward as ensuring that

00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:38,280
you know the security is in play on your

00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:40,170
mainframe ok and John do you do you have

00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:42,329
any comments that you want to add yeah I

00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:44,460
mean I I mean I'm not gonna add much

00:43:42,329 --> 00:43:49,260
more to the mainframe as secure I mean

00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:52,470
if I had a longer line here of mainframe

00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:56,010
to me in leatheran they could go on days

00:43:52,470 --> 00:43:58,230
and days about mainframes they've never

00:43:56,010 --> 00:44:00,210
been hacked pervasive encryption all of

00:43:58,230 --> 00:44:03,180
the technology yada yada in it here's

00:44:00,210 --> 00:44:05,730
the thing I will add what the trends you

00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:09,089
see out there is that if you are looking

00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:11,190
to develop more secure technology and

00:44:09,089 --> 00:44:13,500
software you're doing it through open

00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:17,400
source which if you would roll back the

00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:20,280
clock a decade or two that would be it

00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:22,410
would not make any sense but I guarantee

00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:24,510
you know this audience here who is a

00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:26,010
DevOps audience probably has been around

00:44:24,510 --> 00:44:27,299
open-source quite a while and they're

00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:29,849
probably all shaking their heads right

00:44:27,299 --> 00:44:31,319
now so it's a very it's a very natural

00:44:29,849 --> 00:44:32,130
thing right I mean even have the source

00:44:31,319 --> 00:44:33,749
available

00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:35,190
you can see the holes you can see what's

00:44:33,749 --> 00:44:37,199
behind the black box you understand

00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:39,299
what's going on you have more experts

00:44:37,199 --> 00:44:41,369
there involved and one thing that the

00:44:39,299 --> 00:44:44,309
Zoe Project has has really took it upon

00:44:41,369 --> 00:44:46,859
themselves to do as a part of being in

00:44:44,309 --> 00:44:49,380
the open mainframe project is achieving

00:44:46,859 --> 00:44:51,749
the core infrastructure initiative best

00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:53,279
practices badge and I don't know how

00:44:51,749 --> 00:44:55,109
much your audience is familiar with that

00:44:53,279 --> 00:44:57,269
that's a core infrastructure initiative

00:44:55,109 --> 00:45:00,029
is a another foundation here within the

00:44:57,269 --> 00:45:01,769
Linux Foundation which really focuses on

00:45:00,029 --> 00:45:04,680
best practices and open source to help

00:45:01,769 --> 00:45:06,420
create more secure software part of them

00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:07,920
going to that rigorous process is to

00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:11,190
make sure that they have the best

00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:13,109
practices in place to deal with security

00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:15,900
issues making sure they can be a team

00:45:13,109 --> 00:45:17,969
and have those folks on board so this

00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:20,749
projects take that seriously and they're

00:45:17,969 --> 00:45:28,559
doing it open source and your dog agrees

00:45:20,749 --> 00:45:31,729
100% security security well that would

00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:34,079
be me so Joe any final thoughts on this

00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:36,859
yeah I love the dog we have to have the

00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:40,410
dog coming in the room or something and

00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:43,049
absolutely so a couple of so rosandjohn

00:45:40,410 --> 00:45:44,969
fantastic answers there is no back door

00:45:43,049 --> 00:45:46,769
available so we won't be done we're

00:45:44,969 --> 00:45:48,839
running over HTTPS we're actually just

00:45:46,769 --> 00:45:51,180
stepping on security TLS levels up and

00:45:48,839 --> 00:45:53,039
uh next really there is no back door we

00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:55,650
we couldn't wear your Center gates we

00:45:53,039 --> 00:45:58,469
staff the security manager Rockettes off

00:45:55,650 --> 00:46:00,390
to QA tf2 so this is not an attack

00:45:58,469 --> 00:46:02,099
sector for the platform okay we are not

00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:03,690
creasing this back service in anything

00:46:02,099 --> 00:46:06,269
as John said with we're reducing the

00:46:03,690 --> 00:46:07,529
attack surface because this single from

00:46:06,269 --> 00:46:09,989
the point of view of somebody and a

00:46:07,529 --> 00:46:13,469
corporate Enterprise opening up the you

00:46:09,989 --> 00:46:17,239
know the only port that anybody needs to

00:46:13,469 --> 00:46:20,400
access is we want to converge on the API

00:46:17,239 --> 00:46:22,499
gateway and that is support and then

00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:24,180
that all of the micro services behind

00:46:22,499 --> 00:46:26,099
them at the communication that occurs

00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:29,819
with those those thoughts don't need to

00:46:26,099 --> 00:46:31,319
be surface any more so actually looking

00:46:29,819 --> 00:46:33,449
at that architecture it is actually a

00:46:31,319 --> 00:46:36,209
more resilient architecture to the head

00:46:33,449 --> 00:46:39,059
towards now some people have weighed

00:46:36,209 --> 00:46:40,559
some concerns I would share in Phoenix

00:46:39,059 --> 00:46:41,519
with a lot of interest there's a couple

00:46:40,559 --> 00:46:43,380
of things that they're bothered about

00:46:41,519 --> 00:46:44,820
and I'll try and address them quickly to

00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:48,180
do with open source

00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:50,520
is can anybody go into the open source

00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:52,590
and have a look at the code and from

00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:55,980
that code work out some sort of attack

00:46:52,590 --> 00:46:57,510
vector so or could they worse than that

00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:59,760
could they sort of late at night you

00:46:57,510 --> 00:47:02,220
know deliver some code into a bill that

00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:04,980
introduced a vulnerability the other

00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:08,550
those do question is No so we have

00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:10,530
secure engineering practices in place we

00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:14,400
have a lot of governance about who we

00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:16,470
allowed to commit code we run a lot of

00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:18,570
builds within our pipeline so we adopt

00:47:16,470 --> 00:47:21,090
DevOps practices as well as helping the

00:47:18,570 --> 00:47:24,420
mainframe community to do that we're

00:47:21,090 --> 00:47:26,100
always looking to increase that we pay a

00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:28,830
lot of attention towards that so we're

00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:30,810
very aware some people have said they

00:47:28,830 --> 00:47:32,490
don't want to go to Zoe org

00:47:30,810 --> 00:47:34,440
to just download something that they've

00:47:32,490 --> 00:47:36,300
stolen to their surprise so when I

00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:38,220
Broadcom recently just announced the

00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:42,480
fact that they would provide enterprise

00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:43,890
support for that and without pre

00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:46,290
announcing or getting in trouble with my

00:47:43,890 --> 00:47:48,090
IBM superiors and you know that's again

00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:50,040
something that we're looking at doing or

00:47:48,090 --> 00:47:52,260
what collaborating with Broadcom because

00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:54,480
what we don't want is we don't want

00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:57,120
somebody that has a commercial product

00:47:54,480 --> 00:48:01,100
with open source underneath to see that

00:47:57,120 --> 00:48:03,450
as some sort of weakness in terms of if

00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:05,070
if an issue comes with a commercial

00:48:03,450 --> 00:48:07,470
product that's found in the open source

00:48:05,070 --> 00:48:09,240
how can they deliver that and have the

00:48:07,470 --> 00:48:10,920
same warranty that's a commercial

00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:12,480
product set on top providers so that's

00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:15,000
something we're addressing we're looking

00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:17,370
to create an SMP installer we're looking

00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:19,380
to do that in a way with Broadcom in the

00:48:17,370 --> 00:48:22,020
community as well so that we don't end

00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:24,390
up fragmenting multiple installs on the

00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:26,040
platform because that is the opposite of

00:48:24,390 --> 00:48:27,780
what we want to do so there's lots of

00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:30,720
things in play here but we are not

00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:33,410
increasing the attacks it's positive the

00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:36,390
mainframe is anything we are reducing it

00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:38,580
all right great and shortly yes

00:48:36,390 --> 00:48:40,560
sorry I just I just want to reinforce

00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:43,590
the point Joe thanks thanks for making

00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:45,750
it you know we have Broadcom we

00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:47,400
understand that our customers feel

00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:49,860
there's a natural inherent risk

00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:52,410
associated with using open source right

00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:55,320
and where we're mitigating that risk by

00:48:52,410 --> 00:48:57,960
offering that 24/7 support for all Zoe

00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:58,530
components we recognize the need we've

00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:01,200
heard it

00:48:58,530 --> 00:49:03,810
customers we are committed to Zoe we are

00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:05,400
committed to supporting Zoe and we're

00:49:03,810 --> 00:49:08,970
happy to help you feel confident that

00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:12,300
you can commit to it too so just want to

00:49:08,970 --> 00:49:14,790
reiterate that great great I'm sure that

00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:16,380
that's a real load off a lot of folks

00:49:14,790 --> 00:49:18,600
Minds when it comes to open source in

00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:21,630
the mainframe so and security is

00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:24,450
definitely a main pain point that

00:49:21,630 --> 00:49:26,550
they're trying to address so awesome

00:49:24,450 --> 00:49:28,530
awesome stuff well we are looks like

00:49:26,550 --> 00:49:30,390
we're on just about ten minutes to the

00:49:28,530 --> 00:49:33,660
top of the hour so I want to go ahead

00:49:30,390 --> 00:49:36,900
and just kind of push us forward where

00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:42,200
folks want to learn more where do they

00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:45,540
need to go let me go home we don't know

00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:48,110
you very well and from there you will

00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:51,420
find links to everything that you need

00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:53,790
yeah we and everything we do we do in

00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:54,210
the open we have a calendar all of our

00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:56,100
meetings

00:49:54,210 --> 00:49:59,550
anybody can dial into them here what

00:49:56,100 --> 00:50:00,720
we're planning we have a slash channel

00:49:59,550 --> 00:50:02,400
as the fix of a slack channel we have

00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:05,340
made in this we really can't go there we

00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:06,840
double and start from there Jonas I mean

00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:09,510
does that concur with what do you think

00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:10,080
you could go into Baton get involved in

00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:12,660
the community

00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:14,610
everything wire is there we encourage

00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:17,430
you to check out the technology provide

00:50:14,610 --> 00:50:19,140
feedback on the technology even share

00:50:17,430 --> 00:50:22,080
with us if how you're using it like if

00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:22,860
you have a cool story like we had one

00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:26,010
folks

00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:29,640
a gentleman from Viacom infinity made it

00:50:26,010 --> 00:50:31,550
Amazon Alexa clone he carried around

00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:34,170
think in a box it was it was great

00:50:31,550 --> 00:50:36,960
that's built on Zoe's you could talk to

00:50:34,170 --> 00:50:39,090
your mainframe you know we want to hear

00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:41,340
stories about that so as you have this

00:50:39,090 --> 00:50:43,140
we've shared with the community although

00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:44,820
that to me that would be a little too

00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:46,410
close to Hal I think you know when

00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:52,620
you're talking to your mainframe like

00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:54,270
that and I would also encourage everyone

00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:56,070
to check out some of the other efforts

00:50:54,270 --> 00:50:58,860
we have at the open mainframe project

00:50:56,070 --> 00:51:00,870
open mainframe project org Zoe is

00:50:58,860 --> 00:51:03,630
clearly one of the flagship projects

00:51:00,870 --> 00:51:05,760
that is a part of the the foundation but

00:51:03,630 --> 00:51:07,710
we have a number of other ones a number

00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:10,830
of other efforts and just also efforts

00:51:07,710 --> 00:51:12,120
for for those of you here who think of

00:51:10,830 --> 00:51:16,490
main framers and main

00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:19,320
- pictured people like Joe and Rose

00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:22,200
there's more just like them new young

00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:23,670
old all over the place and we have a

00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:25,530
whole even series that just talks about

00:51:23,670 --> 00:51:27,300
that and unless you learn a little about

00:51:25,530 --> 00:51:29,700
them so definitely encourage you to

00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:32,100
check that out all right all right great

00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:33,600
well we've gotten a couple questions and

00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:36,090
so I want to make sure that we're able

00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:38,820
to get to them so let's go ahead and

00:51:36,090 --> 00:51:41,460
just dive right on into those first

00:51:38,820 --> 00:51:43,620
question is see a bright side the CLI or

00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:45,330
is it more than that it was just

00:51:43,620 --> 00:51:48,030
described as a commercial offering but I

00:51:45,330 --> 00:51:54,810
thought the CLI was available as OSs in

00:51:48,030 --> 00:51:57,900
Zoe so yes so see a bright side does can

00:51:54,810 --> 00:52:01,830
does contain foundational Zoe components

00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:04,980
the CLI as well as the API mediation

00:52:01,830 --> 00:52:08,160
layer but there are also additional

00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:12,600
components included in the commercial

00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:15,720
offering you can find details at CA comm

00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:18,840
slash bright side we have articles their

00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:24,330
technical blogs videos lots of great

00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:26,580
information there ok great we have

00:52:24,330 --> 00:52:29,460
another question here where does Zoe

00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:32,310
where is Zoe in the lifecycle is it

00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:36,960
available for production and when was it

00:52:32,310 --> 00:52:41,760
launched it's a little background thank

00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:44,070
you think that one show on February 8th

00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:48,140
and I remember that day because I think

00:52:44,070 --> 00:52:50,310
working late on the ferry the different

00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:53,820
people to make that happen

00:52:50,310 --> 00:52:56,760
um so Zoe what we so from a historical

00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:59,730
point of view I think CA IBM and rocky

00:52:56,760 --> 00:53:02,190
got together sometime last early last

00:52:59,730 --> 00:53:05,820
year we very quickly wanted to go to

00:53:02,190 --> 00:53:06,960
visa program beta beta to validate what

00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:09,750
we were doing with our customers we

00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:12,090
hadn't opened with a closed one with

00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:14,940
perhaps 20 customers we started in March

00:53:12,090 --> 00:53:17,430
we ran through till about August then we

00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:20,460
went to an open beta and we had a lot

00:53:17,430 --> 00:53:23,070
more feedback and interaction and if we

00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:24,990
create it what's important about the ga

00:53:23,070 --> 00:53:25,290
release first of all all of the code in

00:53:24,990 --> 00:53:27,660
there

00:53:25,290 --> 00:53:29,550
is on david org it's all released under

00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:31,590
what's called eclipse public to license

00:53:29,550 --> 00:53:35,190
I won't nerd out on what that means but

00:53:31,590 --> 00:53:36,720
it means you're in good hands John

00:53:35,190 --> 00:53:38,310
Kander about and like this money

00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:39,780
it's all under me BB it was all open so

00:53:38,310 --> 00:53:41,670
there's a bit of a we're stressed to

00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:45,150
make sure that everything was open

00:53:41,670 --> 00:53:46,890
source on February 8th we launched it

00:53:45,150 --> 00:53:48,870
and yeah I've just come back from cher

00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:51,390
in Phoenix lots of excitement and buzz

00:53:48,870 --> 00:53:53,160
around that it's available many

00:53:51,390 --> 00:53:54,810
customers have downloaded it we have a

00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:56,370
lot of interesting with those customers

00:53:54,810 --> 00:53:58,320
we're making improvements all the time

00:53:56,370 --> 00:54:01,260
one of the big ones is getting more

00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:03,810
Enterprise SMT e-type installing and the

00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:05,070
delivery mechanism for PCs and a cards

00:54:03,810 --> 00:54:07,110
and making sure we do that in a good way

00:54:05,070 --> 00:54:09,150
so absolutely so many doubles I found

00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:13,320
those you can get a driver we have

00:54:09,150 --> 00:54:15,270
documentation and if you should be able

00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:16,650
to install it fairly quickly a buddy of

00:54:15,270 --> 00:54:19,170
mine called and asked it was very

00:54:16,650 --> 00:54:22,680
popular talk it share about installing

00:54:19,170 --> 00:54:24,840
Zoe Stan is like 20-something and he has

00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:27,300
very little mainframe I didn't want to

00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:30,170
what he's getting experience but he

00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:34,130
managed to get it up and running so yeah

00:54:30,170 --> 00:54:37,710
yeah one danau introduced in February

00:54:34,130 --> 00:54:42,270
1.1 is now available came out in early

00:54:37,710 --> 00:54:45,330
March by monthly so we're planning to

00:54:42,270 --> 00:54:49,200
release a new a new PDF release every

00:54:45,330 --> 00:54:52,650
month ok great

00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:55,680
so let's see you next question will Zoe

00:54:52,650 --> 00:55:05,070
work with other mainframe third-party

00:54:55,680 --> 00:55:06,930
tools so it talks about a particular

00:55:05,070 --> 00:55:08,460
company and said will it work with this

00:55:06,930 --> 00:55:12,030
company's products it says will it work

00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:13,620
with file aid so I I cannot answer that

00:55:12,030 --> 00:55:17,010
question that question has to be

00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:21,890
presented to the vendor their own file

00:55:17,010 --> 00:55:21,890
aid which in this case is its Compuware

00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:27,780
they're very personally company where

00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:30,690
ever aware of this product I had some

00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:33,600
good discussions at as a conference it

00:55:30,690 --> 00:55:35,680
is our intention to try and we will do

00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:38,220
everything we can to welcome and make

00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:40,809
the environment so that other tools can

00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:42,190
collaborate with this even within IBM

00:55:40,809 --> 00:55:44,020
though there are products that are

00:55:42,190 --> 00:55:45,760
already on it was on a release cadence

00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:47,500
and when you have a limited number of

00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:50,260
developers and committed resource and

00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:52,630
for them to change that vector towards

00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:54,970
OE they need to get the timing right for

00:55:52,630 --> 00:55:57,250
their customers and their businesses but

00:55:54,970 --> 00:55:59,890
many of those companies including come

00:55:57,250 --> 00:56:02,170
to where are telling us what they would

00:55:59,890 --> 00:56:03,550
need for us to be you know for when they

00:56:02,170 --> 00:56:06,730
ready to do that

00:56:03,550 --> 00:56:08,650
some companies we're so so we are doing

00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:13,180
everything we can to kind of bind with

00:56:08,650 --> 00:56:15,700
those companies were the only very good

00:56:13,180 --> 00:56:16,900
answer yeah yeah I mean yeah I think

00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:18,940
you're teed that up really well I think

00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:21,040
the one thing I will add is one of the

00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:22,390
things the community is really focused

00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:27,430
on now that it's really got past a

00:56:22,390 --> 00:56:29,380
wonder release is how can it means

00:56:27,430 --> 00:56:31,480
certainly any open source project

00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:34,750
anybody can download it anybody can use

00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:36,250
it anybody can put it into a product you

00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:38,530
know subject to the terms of the eclipse

00:56:36,250 --> 00:56:40,540
public license to that Joe mentioned it

00:56:38,530 --> 00:56:42,730
was under what I think the community is

00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:45,069
working on doing is building out a

00:56:42,730 --> 00:56:47,799
conformance program and the focus point

00:56:45,069 --> 00:56:49,150
on that is you know just for the vendors

00:56:47,799 --> 00:56:51,099
there out there that are saying hey this

00:56:49,150 --> 00:56:52,690
is a great starting point we'd like to

00:56:51,099 --> 00:56:54,609
build an application on top of this we

00:56:52,690 --> 00:56:57,099
want to take advantage of the growing

00:56:54,609 --> 00:56:58,540
ecosystem of I think last I here close

00:56:57,099 --> 00:57:02,589
to 40 applications that are already

00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:04,000
leveraging so in some way or another how

00:57:02,589 --> 00:57:05,650
can we be a part of how can we make sure

00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,510
that we're interoperating with it how

00:57:05,650 --> 00:57:10,119
can we make sure that if a customer is

00:57:07,510 --> 00:57:13,049
coming in and they're saying hey Zoe is

00:57:10,119 --> 00:57:15,970
our standard for how we're doing inter

00:57:13,049 --> 00:57:17,349
integration how can I make sure my app

00:57:15,970 --> 00:57:19,569
plays with that as well so that is

00:57:17,349 --> 00:57:22,119
something to community is been actively

00:57:19,569 --> 00:57:24,460
working on if you're a vendor in this

00:57:22,119 --> 00:57:25,690
space and you're like boy this Zoe thing

00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:27,720
seems like would make my life a lot

00:57:25,690 --> 00:57:29,890
easier I'd want to get on that train

00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:31,480
this is the time to get on board because

00:57:29,890 --> 00:57:33,220
that program is coming together and

00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:35,589
you'd have an opportunity at the front

00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:38,980
end of that so definitely let joe or

00:57:35,589 --> 00:57:40,569
even myself know and just to add you

00:57:38,980 --> 00:57:43,210
know to that you know if you're if

00:57:40,569 --> 00:57:45,190
you're a customer and and you're working

00:57:43,210 --> 00:57:48,720
with one of these vendors ask them what

00:57:45,190 --> 00:57:50,430
their plans are with Zoe please

00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:53,280
let's get them talking about it and get

00:57:50,430 --> 00:57:54,960
them on board all right great

well we are about three minutes to the
