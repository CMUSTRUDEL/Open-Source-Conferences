Title: Ambitus Project Webinar
Publication date: 2021-03-17
Playlist: OMP Webinars
Description: 
	In this webinar, we will compare and contrast the open-source environments between Linux on Z, and z/OS. You will learn how much overlap, especially with containerized environments.



We will also discuss the Ambitus project, which helps users with open source workloads specifically on z/OS:
- A set of containerized workload examples that run on z/OS today
- Common example tasks for running native (non-containerized) z/OS open source workloads.
- Z Markup Language: a language-agnostic macro description format and tooling to generate high-level language specifications for control blocks that currently only have assembler bindings.
