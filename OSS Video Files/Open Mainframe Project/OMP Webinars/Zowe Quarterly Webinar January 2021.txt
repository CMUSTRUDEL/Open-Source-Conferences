	00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:08,160
hello everybody and welcome to

00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,480
the omp monthly webinar today we've got

00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,400
the

00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,000
zoe team with the quarterly updates and

00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,799
with that i'm going to hand it over to

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,960
rose

00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:16,240
rose take it away hey chris thank you

00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,880
can you hear me okay

00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,560
i can hear you great awesome okay well

00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,359
good day everyone and welcome to our

00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,400
second

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:27,279
zoe quarterly webinar we actually hosted

00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:29,920
our first webinar back in october 2020

00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:31,519
and we plan to host these webinars once

00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,559
per calendar quarter

00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:37,600
this will serve as our q1 2021

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:40,320
webinar so i'm rosa cache

00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,360
from the zoe on boarding squad and i'll

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,160
be kicking us off

00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,960
and wrapping us up we've got a full

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,160
agenda

00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:51,520
in just under 60 minutes so

00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:53,680
here's our plan uh we'll review the

00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,360
overall intent of these webinars since

00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,640
this is just our second wanted to give a

00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,120
quick overview

00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,920
uh we'll we'll dig into uh this

00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,480
quarter's

00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,920
focus topic which is containerization of

00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,760
zoe components

00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,159
uh that will be followed by a deeper

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,159
dive on a specific zoe squad and this

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,040
month we'll be featuring the zoe doc

00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,119
squad

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,040
and then we'll have sort of a sub topic

00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:18,240
focus off of that

00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,920
on the updates to zoe.org

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,680
before we end we'll list out some

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,360
important events and dates

00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,439
and share some links with you so you can

00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,479
continue to stay in touch with the zoe

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,720
community

00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:31,040
time permitting will open it up for q a

00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,960
but please do feel free to type in any

00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,320
questions you may have along the way and

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,759
we'll work to address

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,960
those questions as we go then we'll

00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,840
close it out

00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,840
for another quarter

00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,720
okay let's get right into the series

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,640
overview again just a recap

00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,000
to make you all aware of what our intent

00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,600
is for this webinar

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,920
it's a series our goal is to ensure that

00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,920
the zoe community offers a forum for

00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,399
open exchange of information

00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,840
ideas and affords both the members of

00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,320
the community

00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,320
and those beyond the community insights

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,600
into what's happening with the zoe

00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,759
project

00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,640
again our plan is to host these four

00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:13,680
times a year

00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,599
once per quarter we went over the fact

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,800
that we'll feature a technical topic

00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:20,879
at least one zoe squad and we'll use the

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,760
form to help bring awareness around

00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:25,920
upcoming and in some cases prior events

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,080
such as our project planning in our

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,800
iteration demonstrations and things like

00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,160
that

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,000
and then finally we're hoping to

00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,640
leverage it as a means to collect

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,319
feedback from all of you and from a

00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,959
wider audience

00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:40,480
and any party interested in all things

00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,040
zoe

00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,239
okay so now i'd like to turn it over and

00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:49,840
introduce

00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:52,800
sean grady for our focus topic

00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,360
thank you very much so um hi i'm sean

00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,720
grady

00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,720
the leader of the uh zoe app framework

00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:02,319
squad i also participate

00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,120
in the tsc and zlc so you may have seen

00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:07,120
me before

00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:09,360
but today i'm here to talk about a new

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,480
alternative download option to get the

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,760
zoe servers

00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:16,800
which is using containers

00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,800
in this case docker

00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:23,280
so uh just a brief uh summary

00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,720
about containerization a lot of people

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,159
have heard of it but maybe

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,239
have not tried it and so you're

00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:31,680
wondering what is this how do

00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:35,280
i use it what's the reason to use it

00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:38,000
what i would say is that

00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,799
containers have similarities to virtual

00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,080
machines

00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:45,360
but are used for practical reasons

00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:48,000
of delivery of a program so

00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,360
the concept is that you basically have

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,319
what is called an image

00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,680
instead of a virtual machine and it's a

00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,159
lightweight standalone

00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,519
executable that's consumed by something

00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:01,599
like docker

00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:02,560
and the idea of the image is that it's

00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,599
read only

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,200
so you can make multiple containers from

00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:10,799
the image and that is the

00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:12,720
running copy of your software now

00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,400
the important difference between

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,120
containers and virtual machines

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,040
is that virtual machines have an entire

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,600
operating system within them

00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:24,240
whereas in the case of containers it's

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:27,360
using the host operating system

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,199
but just kind of sandboxing the program

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,560
that you care about

00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:37,520
so effectively this will

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,520
make it so that it's it's lighter weight

00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,680
and it's also reliable because it's

00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:45,280
sandbox you have

00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,960
your repeatable behavior but most of all

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,280
a lot of people use containers because

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:52,000
they're easy all the dependencies

00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,520
are included so in in the case of

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,960
something like the zoe servers where

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,320
there's

00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,680
quite a few dependencies that part of

00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,800
the install

00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:05,280
is you know that the pain is greatly

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,280
reduced

00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:13,759
now uh if we if we look at zoe today

00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,759
these are sort of all of the pieces that

00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:19,120
make up zoe as a whole

00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:21,520
and on the upper side you'll see the

00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,800
client facing things like the desktop

00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:27,520
and the cli and the vs code

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,360
extension and they're all powered in

00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,560
some way by content coming from the

00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:36,840
mainframe

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:39,759
now in the traditional zoe server stack

00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:41,759
everything lower in this diagram from

00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,120
the blue boxes up top

00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,880
all of those things would be running on

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,880
z os but

00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,039
basically what we have done with this

00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,800
docker container is we looked at each of

00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:56,160
these pieces running on z os

00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:58,560
and said must these things run there

00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,360
do they need to run there and we realize

00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,160
that

00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,160
only a few things must run on z os those

00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,440
are the things that actually talk to the

00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,479
lower level

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:10,080
portions of the mainframe but everything

00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,560
else is kind of network level

00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,080
so we said okay these things can run

00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,840
anywhere else

00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,759
they can run on z os they could run on

00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,280
windows they could run on linux so he

00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:23,280
said okay docker

00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:27,039
gives us a way to put those things

00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:30,319
into one install and put them

00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:32,400
on any computer we want really so

00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,960
that's what we did with this first

00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,759
iteration of containers for zoe is we

00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,120
took

00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:42,000
all of the zoe servers except zss

00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,440
and zis and put them into one docker

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,240
image

00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:48,560
and since they're the same servers the

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,639
behavior is very similar it's just now

00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,360
you have flexibility about where you can

00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,759
run these

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,759
things

00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,919
so um people might be wondering okay how

00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:03,199
does this change the z os

00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:06,479
story zoe is still a zos

00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:09,599
focused thing so you know

00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:13,280
what what should someone do with

00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:14,000
docker and zoe and what i would mention

00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,680
is that it's

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,599
really the same user functionality um

00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,880
what you're going to notice at runtime

00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:24,080
is that there's less

00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:26,080
processes on the mainframe because now

00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,360
they will be running on some other

00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:31,599
machine like

00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:35,199
like linux this results in

00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:37,360
a lower run time cost since you're not

00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:40,000
consuming mips on the mainframe as

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,960
much there still is some zoe running on

00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,199
the mainframe but

00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:49,360
it's it's greatly reduced um

00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:51,360
now the docs for z os

00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,599
how you get those z os parts on the

00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:56,400
mainframe that stays the same

00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:58,319
so when it comes to the documentation

00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,960
you'll notice that there's actually

00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,599
phases one and two phase one is what

00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,840
everyone

00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:06,400
has been doing all along which is

00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:10,879
install zoe on z os

00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:14,080
um but installing on docker

00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:15,840
which i hope we'll see is pretty

00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,639
straightforward

00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,680
now one thing that i'll note here on the

00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,800
zos story

00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:25,840
is when you install everything on z os

00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,720
today there are some servers that

00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:30,000
communicate

00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:32,479
only within the mainframe but

00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,440
when we're moving things partially out

00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,200
of the mainframe

00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,360
now they have to cross this network

00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,399
barrier from the mainframe

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:43,120
to the linux machine so

00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:45,519
when we start to do that with docker

00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:49,120
there is one small change for z os

00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:53,120
which is that the zss server

00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:55,519
has an optional ability to use httls

00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,920
this becomes mandatory in the docker

00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:01,200
world because you really don't want to

00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:03,360
open up zss for external use without

00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,760
having tls applied to it

00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,279
so that part of the dock that you may

00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,760
have seen about how to set up

00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:11,120
attls that really becomes a requirement

00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:15,519
for docker

00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:19,839
we have plans to utilize gs kit

00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:22,080
so that https becomes automatic

00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,440
but that's a little bit farther down the

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,760
road so

00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,279
the container story is still evolving as

00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:31,360
as we'll see

00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:31,360
but this is just the as is right now

00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,000
now um i pointed out in the document

00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:40,640
earlier

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,279
that the servers have basically moved

00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,519
out

00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:45,680
we didn't change the amount of servers

00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,600
or their roles we just moved them

00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,839
so people might be wondering well do

00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,480
they behave differently is the content

00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,839
different

00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,640
and i would say not really and here's

00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,279
why

00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:59,360
what you see on the screen here is the

00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:02,560
steps that we take to build our

00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:05,680
docker container or our docker image

00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:08,320
and basically what we do at

00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,959
the very top of this screen cap is we

00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,320
take

00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:15,519
the zoe convenience build packs file

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,040
and we copy it to a linux system and we

00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:21,120
extract it

00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:22,079
then what we do is we go down the list

00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,800
of files

00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,680
that are absolute and we convert them

00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,720
into ascii

00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,320
because the linux machine can't handle

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,920
ebcdic

00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:36,000
and there are a few z os tools that

00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:39,120
don't exist on linux

00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,279
and there are a few java parameters that

00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,839
are specific to z os

00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:45,600
so what we do is we just modify our

00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,839
shell scripts a little bit

00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,040
to either get rid of parameters that

00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,839
have no equivalent

00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:54,399
or substitute them for different ones

00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:57,120
like you'll see here

00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,160
x quick start is z os specific so we

00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,839
just remove that

00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:04,560
um uh at the bottom um

00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,440
we don't have ibm's java we have open

00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,360
jdk

00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,600
but they're equivalent in functionality

00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:12,720
for our purposes so we just substitute

00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,399
the the names um

00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,760
and then there are scripts that we had

00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,320
such as oper command

00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,320
for for doing operator commands that

00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,120
doesn't exist on linux so we kind of

00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,880
stub it out

00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,040
by making a script where when you call

00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:28,800
it it just does nothing and says

00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:30,880
i've succeeded so basically

00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,000
nothing really changes in the servers

00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,839
we're just wrapping them

00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,200
in ways that they'll become compatible

00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,959
with linux so

00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,360
it's it's pretty straightforward what

00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:43,839
you get in the convenience build

00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,839
is what you'll get in the container

00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,959
now uh the one thing that does

00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,120
change in the docker world is

00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:54,320
configuration

00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:57,600
and that's just because uh

00:11:54,320 --> 00:12:00,240
there's docker docker-isms involved so

00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,920
just to recap what is zoe server

00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,000
configuration today

00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,120
zoe has what you would call a root

00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,440
directory which

00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,959
is where you install zoe and then you

00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,760
have a key store

00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:14,240
directory where your settings about keys

00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:17,040
and certificates are stored and you have

00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,560
an instance directory where your

00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,800
configuration about

00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:24,000
which plugins you have what ports you're

00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:27,839
using and what servers you're running

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:31,360
that's where that settings are stored

00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:33,200
so um all of these

00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,880
notions in the key store and the

00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:38,399
instance directory

00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:40,480
remain the same but how you

00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,560
point to a keystore directory and how

00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,680
you point to an instance directory

00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:48,000
that changes because you do it in the

00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,519
docker way uh the other thing that i'll

00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,079
note here is that

00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,519
uh when you go to start zoe on z os you

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:56,639
have two ways to do it

00:12:53,519 --> 00:13:00,160
jcl or shell script

00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:03,680
jcl doesn't exist on linux so

00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:05,600
you you still have the shell script but

00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,040
what we'll see is that there's actually

00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,480
a docker way to start things

00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,480
so we're going to do that instead

00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:17,440
now just getting more into that

00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,440
configuration

00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,440
there is a concept of mounts in docker

00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,519
and

00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,200
if you've ever dealt with network mounts

00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:28,560
on the mainframe

00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:32,240
or really any other system uh nfs

00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:34,240
sifs uh the concept of uh network mounts

00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,600
is basically what docker amounts are

00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,800
which is

00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:40,399
the docker image is read only so you

00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:43,279
don't want to put your settings

00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:44,560
into it because it will it will taint

00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:48,079
the image

00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:50,800
but instead you mount files

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,760
in and you can mount them as read-only

00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,160
or read write

00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,279
it depends on what you're trying to do

00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,360
but you basically

00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:58,639
have the instance directory and the

00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,800
keystore directory

00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,639
and you mount them into the docker

00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,560
container so that the docker container

00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:07,120
can read them

00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:09,600
at run time the zoe code is doing the

00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,680
same exact stuff as it always was

00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,959
it's just a matter of how you get those

00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,199
directories

00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:17,839
visible to the zoe code and that's via

00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,839
docker mounts

00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,560
now one of the benefits of doing this as

00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:26,160
well by having them

00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:28,880
externally mounted is you can use

00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,079
one zoe image to spin up multiple

00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:33,600
containers

00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:36,880
for redundancy which will come in handy

00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,800
when we fully support high availability

00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,160
but the other thing is it keeps your

00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:43,120
configuration safe

00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,600
during upgrades we'll talk more about

00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,480
that

00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,480
in a few slides

00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,839
now i did mention a bit about the

00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:55,760
keystore directory

00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:56,959
um this is one of the things that i need

00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,079
to point out about

00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:04,480
this being a technical preview

00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:08,320
the zoe docker tech preview

00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:10,240
is uh you know it works well

00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,000
but the reason why we consider it a tech

00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,560
preview is not because there's bugs or

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,639
anything

00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:18,560
but there are certain

00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:19,839
capabilities for zoe that are z os only

00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,880
that we don't have

00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:25,120
linux equivalents of yet and

00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,800
docker has many ways to do the same

00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:30,240
thing so

00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:32,240
there's a user experience

00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,000
concern where we're just trying to make

00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,320
sure that

00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,600
everyone is getting the experience that

00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:41,279
they want

00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,160
before we consider this fully supported

00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,399
right now it's just

00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:46,560
tech preview because we're looking for

00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,240
user feedback to make sure that we have

00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,480
everything that's needed

00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,440
so here's what's different about the key

00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,720
store

00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:57,759
um on zos

00:15:54,720 --> 00:16:02,000
you can have saf key rings which

00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:04,880
has uh some icsf control

00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,680
that none of these things exist on linux

00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:09,040
so

00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:11,680
the concept of a keyring does exist

00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:13,040
but there might be different linux

00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,759
programs that do

00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,399
keyrings and this is this is what we

00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,680
want

00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:22,160
people's opinion on if you know of

00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:24,000
a program for securely managing

00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:26,480
certificates on linux

00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
and you want us to use it in the zoe

00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:32,000
docker

00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,880
let us know what you can do today in the

00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,320
tech preview

00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:38,639
is you can you can use files

00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,920
for your keys and certificates zoe

00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:43,519
supports

00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:46,399
p12 pfx and pem files

00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,519
in the case of p12 and pfx they can be

00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:51,120
password encrypted

00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:53,519
so it's still pretty good security but

00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,120
keyrings would be best and so we're

00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:58,000
looking to figure out how

00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,000
we can do that

00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:07,199
now uh the next thing that you're going

00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:09,679
to be interested in is

00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:11,600
how do you get this um if you go to

00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:14,079
zoey.org

00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,959
you can find the convenience build for

00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:17,120
the servers

00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,480
and the smpe build but if you scroll

00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:21,679
down a little bit farther

00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:24,000
you'll find our tech preview section and

00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,199
this has a little bit of a description

00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,199
on what this

00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,400
is and why you might want it but

00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:32,080
ultimately

00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:35,120
there's two ways to get docker uh

00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:38,720
images one is docker hub

00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:42,240
this is docker's official

00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,919
cloud download place and so you can get

00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,760
things from docker hub and one of the

00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,160
nice things that you'll find on docker

00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:50,240
hub

00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:51,039
is there is the ability to get previous

00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,400
releases

00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:54,559
so if you don't see something on the

00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,320
main page you can always get an older

00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,799
version because docker hub's going to

00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,840
have

00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:00,160
all of the versions that we've ever

00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:03,120
released

00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,679
but you'll also notice that you have a

00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,760
direct

00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:09,039
download option where you can download

00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:11,280
it directly from zoe.org

00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:12,799
docker has a concept when you're using

00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,200
the command line

00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:16,160
that you can either download from the

00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,200
cloud or

00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,760
you can give it a file that's local to

00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,039
your

00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,760
computer so by doing the direct download

00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:26,640
option

00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,120
you can get the image on your computer

00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,360
and just

00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,320
load it up docker doesn't care where it

00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,440
came from

00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:36,559
so this means that additionally

00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:40,080
apart from just direct download from us

00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:42,240
if someone were to have an

00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,120
intranet and kind of store curated

00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,799
versions

00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:47,039
they can do that too you know docker

00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:49,520
allows you to get these images

00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:51,280
however you want it's just these are the

00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:54,240
options that you'll find from us

00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:56,000
the docker hub option and the zoe.org

00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,640
direct download

00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,280
what you'll also notice is that there's

00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,799
two direct

00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:06,480
download options amd64

00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:07,679
and s390x docker works on multiple

00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,960
platforms

00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:13,520
and so we need to compile for each

00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:17,039
platform that we want to support

00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:20,720
amd 64 is just the code word for

00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:24,400
intel and amd x86 systems

00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:27,760
so if you have a kind of plain old linux

00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:31,200
that's what you would get s390x

00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:32,400
is z linux so if you want to use zoe on

00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:38,480
z linux

00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:40,880
that's the download option for you

00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,520
after you've downloaded what do you do

00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,880
then

00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,679
um well you can go to docs.zoe.org as

00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:49,039
always

00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:52,000
and read the install steps and

00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:53,120
it's basically going to tell you if

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:58,000
you're going to use

00:19:53,120 --> 00:20:00,400
zss you need to install that on zls

00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,280
so it's going to take you through the

00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,559
steps

00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:07,600
for installing on z os either smp

00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:10,559
or pax once you do

00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:12,480
have zoe installed on z os you can

00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:15,840
configure zoe to turn

00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,960
off the servers that would be running in

00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,679
docker instead

00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:22,320
so that you don't have duplication so it

00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:23,760
would just be zss and zis that you would

00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,960
need to be running on z os

00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:30,159
at most however if you

00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:32,880
are just um if you're using

00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:34,000
very specific features like just the

00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,120
mediation layer

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,159
without client side certificates you may

00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,880
not even need

00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,600
zoe on z os at all so it really depends

00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,960
on your needs

00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:46,159
but what i would recommend is if you

00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,200
already have

00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,679
zoe installed on z os you're halfway

00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,520
there

00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,880
already because all you have to do is

00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:56,240
reconfigure it

00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:58,799
and then install the docker portion so

00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,480
after you do that you get the you get

00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:02,400
the docker image and you start

00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,240
configuring that

00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,600
hey sean there's about eight minutes to

00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,559
the top of the hour

00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,600
okay um i think i'm more than halfway

00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:12,799
through here

00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:16,159
so configuration um

00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:17,360
i i mentioned mounts a little bit um i

00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:20,480
think

00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:21,440
i would just like to show a web page for

00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,159
that

00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:27,200
so or or maybe just move to my demo so

00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:30,559
i'll skip this slide

00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:33,600
um upgrading so images

00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:35,919
are the read-only portions of

00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,960
of docker and basically what you do for

00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:40,559
an upgrade

00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:43,679
is you just point your configuration to

00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:44,400
a different image whenever you get an

00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,600
image

00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:49,600
it has a name associated so uh this one

00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,159
that we're talking about is omp zoe

00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,840
slash

00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:57,120
server bundle and when you download an

00:21:53,840 --> 00:22:00,799
image that has the same name

00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:04,320
it basically assigns that name

00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:06,960
to that latest version and

00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,760
if you have multiple copies of the same

00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,520
name

00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,880
you'll see in the screenshot here the

00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,840
oldest one becomes

00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:16,480
unnamed but it's still there and you can

00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:18,400
find it by looking at its image id

00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,600
which you can compare to the website so

00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,720
you can see

00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:24,320
one e52 would have been an older version

00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,039
and and the current version that we have

00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:28,640
is this

00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:31,760
236 up on the top right so

00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:34,240
the short story of upgrading is you put

00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:37,440
your configuration to one side

00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,400
you get a new image shut down your

00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,840
container

00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,840
and restart it

00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,520
now plugins you know zoe is still

00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:50,320
extensible even in

00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,880
docker the thing that i would point out

00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,600
is

00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,080
mounts you want to mount your content

00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,480
into

00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,120
the image so that the image isn't

00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,039
altered

00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:01,120
but the zoe code can make use of the

00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:04,000
plugins that it sees

00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,480
if you have all of your app framework

00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,600
apps

00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:10,799
in one folder called

00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,520
root zoe apps on the docker container

00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:14,240
side

00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:16,159
it will attempt to zoe will attempt to

00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,480
automatically install them

00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:19,360
although you can manually install them

00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,960
at any point

00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:24,000
as well however before you go using

00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,640
plugins

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,480
check with the vendors to make sure they

00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,880
are docker compatible

00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,559
ultimately we will need to make a

00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,679
conformance program around

00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:36,080
docker to guarantee this but the one

00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,440
thing

00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:43,760
that we are trying to get perfect

00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:46,880
is the issue of ebcdic versus ascii

00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:50,080
it turns out that while you can

00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,720
tag files as either ebcdic or ascii on z

00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,480
os

00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:57,200
linux can't read tags so in order to

00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,480
successfully run a plugin inside of

00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,120
docker

00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,880
it needs to be an ascii and so you just

00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:04,720
want to check with your vendor

00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:07,760
is it an ascii or do you have an

00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,760
alternative download

00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:14,559
zoe has tools to do automatic conversion

00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:14,960
but automatic conversion is never as

00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:18,480
good

00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:21,520
as something done

00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:24,880
explicitly so again

00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,880
always check with their vendor

00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:33,600
uh so i just wanted to point out again

00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:34,159
this is just a tech preview so if you

00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,919
try it

00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:38,000
and you think that there's room for

00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:40,720
improvement let us know

00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,279
but we're not just going to wait around

00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,919
either

00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:44,880
we have some uh steps that we're going

00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:48,320
to do next

00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:50,799
so the next thing is orchestration

00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,520
you know how to use kubernetes open

00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:55,120
shift

00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:58,240
uh with uh the containers that we have

00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:59,120
uh we might be shifting to a model by

00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,240
which

00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:04,480
every server of zoe is its

00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,440
own image rather than having one image

00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,440
that contains

00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,600
all of the servers that will make it

00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:13,360
easier for orchestration

00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:16,080
um when it comes to platforms

00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:18,240
apart from linux and z linux we would

00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:21,200
like to have a version that supports

00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,240
zcx and then there's the matter of

00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,440
content

00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:29,039
the container that we have doesn't have

00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:32,640
the cli or the vs code explorer but

00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:33,360
it is possible to make containers with

00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:37,520
those

00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:39,600
so there's so many things that we can do

00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:41,919
and what we're really looking for is

00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:44,720
feedback to help prioritize what we

00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:44,720
should do next

00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:52,799
so um if i have a minute or two

00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:55,279
um i'd like to attempt to

00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:56,000
show a demo although demos are always

00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:59,679
kind of uh

00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:02,080
risky but um if we have the time

00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:03,520
then this might make more sense sean i

00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,679
think there's agreement that you can go

00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:07,919
till five after and you're currently

00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:08,880
uh three minutes to the top of the hour

00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:11,200
so go for it

00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,880
okay eight minute demo you got it sean

00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,840
thanks

00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,840
i'll stop sharing

00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:25,360
over to you okay can you see my screen

00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:26,240
not yet i do font size is very small

00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:29,120
hard to read

00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:31,919
okay let me try to make it larger for

00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,919
just a moment

00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,840
um

00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:55,279
okay is that a little bit better uh

00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:56,559
you gotta squint it's a little better

00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:59,679
but

00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:03,279
i can make it even larger just wanna

00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:03,279
make sure people can see what i'm doing

00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:09,440
here

00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:11,600
okay so yes that's better now

00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,600
the folder that i'm in right now is the

00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,679
folder that you'll find on github so you

00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:19,120
can see exactly how we

00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:20,720
made our docker image but

00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,960
what you're going to want to do on a

00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,720
linux system is you have the docker

00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:27,760
command line tool

00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:31,279
and with that you can do things like

00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:31,279
list the images that you have

00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:36,399
so you'll see here that among the images

00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:39,840
that i have

00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:42,320
here is my amd64 omp zoe

00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,880
server bundle image that's the one that

00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:46,840
i want

00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:50,480
for linux and

00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:54,000
the zoe docs will actually tell you

00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:58,399
that the quick start for docker

00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:01,520
is to get the instance directory

00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:02,320
set up and to get a start script for

00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:05,039
docker

00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:06,000
because unlike starting jcl on the

00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:08,080
mainframe

00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,840
you need a start script for docker

00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:12,960
something that basically says

00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:14,840
run this image and run it on a certain

00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:18,720
port

00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:22,240
and um you know make it accessible to

00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:23,520
my browser so uh we actually have a

00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,720
sample script

00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:30,399
on how to start the docker container

00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:32,080
inside of the docker container itself so

00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:33,600
we have a command here that says zoe

00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,760
start zero

00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,520
that basically allows you to run the

00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:40,159
container without starting anything

00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:42,559
which gives you the opportunity to copy

00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:44,720
out the sample script and to copy out

00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:47,760
the sample instance directory

00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:49,919
so that's the quick start that i would

00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:52,399
recommend people do

00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:52,960
and what you'll see inside of that start

00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:56,480
script

00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:57,679
is essentially a lot of these parameters

00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,840
that help

00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:01,120
tell the docker container how to find

00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,520
the mainframe

00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,240
and how to find the right certificates

00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:07,279
and what

00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:10,559
ports to use now just to

00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:13,159
save on time i've already done this

00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:14,640
i copied it out and made my own

00:29:13,159 --> 00:29:17,919
customizations

00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:21,279
um one of the things that you'll see

00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:22,000
in the one that that comes inside of the

00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:25,279
container

00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,159
is this section which basically just

00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:28,720
says

00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:29,919
uh where is my where's my mainframe to

00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:33,120
find zeosmf

00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:34,559
and zss what components of zoe should i

00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:38,240
be starting

00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:40,720
and what port should i be using and

00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:44,960
up top here i've just defined the ports

00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:48,000
and the host name of my own system

00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:49,679
so here's the demo part that

00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:55,840
you know it's always risky to do these

00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:55,840
live but let's let's try it out

00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,559
um hold on my font is too big to

00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:09,840
actually

00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:09,840
see what i've done here

00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:24,080
oh okay i need to specify the image name

00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:25,039
at the end so i'm just putting amd64 at

00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,120
the end of my thing

00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:28,720
okay so what we're going to see here

00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,080
again the text might be small because i

00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,080
just reduced it but

00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:34,000
uh what's going to print on the screen

00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:36,720
is just zoe starting up

00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,520
so if you've ever looked at your jcl

00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,159
output

00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:41,440
uh this is the same thing um there might

00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:43,520
be some

00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,880
zos specific things that aren't going to

00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:47,200
be in this log

00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,880
but the log is going to look very

00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,960
similar to the one on z os

00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,080
and uh since this is printing to my

00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:55,200
terminal

00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:56,000
i could have redirected the output to a

00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,799
log file

00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,399
you know this is this is where people

00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:01,200
might want to customize their install a

00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:04,080
little bit

00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,960
but i'm going to give this just a moment

00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:08,320
to

00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:10,000
start up um i think it takes about 30

00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:13,919
seconds to get fully ready

00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,919
and then i'll hop over to my web browser

00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:20,320
so i guess the one thing that i'll point

00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:24,000
out on the doc site

00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:27,840
is uh once again

00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:30,960
we have a pretty good flowchart here

00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:33,919
on how to install so if you've never

00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,559
installed zoe on z os before you're

00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:37,760
gonna

00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:41,200
you're gonna want to do these stages one

00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:42,960
two and three but if you already have

00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,640
zoe on z os installed

00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,799
you can basically skip all the way down

00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,679
to stage five here and just get started

00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:49,840
with docker

00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:50,960
and and these are all links that go to

00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:54,320
the

00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:57,840
specific parts the documentation so

00:31:54,320 --> 00:32:00,000
check it out okay so

00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,880
it looks like it's running so i'm going

00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,480
to hop over

00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:09,120
to port 12391

00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:09,120
which is the api gateway

00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:14,000
okay maybe i need to give it a few more

00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:18,399
seconds to start

00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,399
up we'll check back in a moment

00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,600
i'll just go over to one of the other

00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:31,519
ports to

00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:34,640
see if that's running

00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:36,320
okay that's running so it might just it

00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:39,039
there we go yep it was just taking a

00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:43,360
moment to start up so

00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:46,240
now we can try logging in

00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:47,440
and here we are in zoe so once we're

00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:50,320
here

00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,720
everything is really the same i can

00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:54,000
still

00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:57,440
access my favorite files

00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:00,720
i can still uh look at

00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:04,080
whatever jazz content i have which is

00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:05,919
i guess not very much at the moment um

00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:08,640
but it's it's really the same zoe

00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:10,399
desktop it's the same mediation layer so

00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:12,080
there's not much that i can show here

00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:13,919
that people haven't already seen

00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:15,600
because that's that's the point it's the

00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:19,120
same stuff but now

00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:22,399
you can put it on different platforms

00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:24,320
and all of the prereqs are included

00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:27,039
into the container so it's a pretty

00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:27,039
quick install

00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:34,240
and that's it so i guess we can

00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:37,200
move on to the focus squad

00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:39,840
awesome thanks sean let me take it back

00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,840
real quick

00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:49,440
and turn it over to

00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:52,240
ashley from our doc squad

00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,120
okay thanks joe's can't hear me yes we

00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:56,000
can okay

00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,799
great yes thank you and also thanks john

00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,519
for the great

00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:01,279
presentation demo about docker yeah so

00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:03,840
everyone hi river i'm ashley

00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:06,159
and i'm the dog squad lead so in the

00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:09,520
next couple of minutes and want to talk

00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:10,800
about the zoe dock itself as well as our

00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:13,919
dark squad focus

00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,800
in the current pi one improvement we are

00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:17,919
working on now

00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,879
is to better onboard different personas

00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:21,599
on the dark side

00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:23,119
so um this also aligns with the zoe dot

00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:26,320
work refresh work

00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:27,919
on that our designer elia um who will be

00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,679
talking about that later

00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:31,839
um and we'd like to take this

00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:32,960
opportunity on this car today to seek

00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:35,599
any feedback

00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:37,520
on these enhancements or any other

00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:40,720
challenges you are experiencing

00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:42,480
when you consume zoid content okay

00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:45,200
so before i start talking about the

00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:47,359
enhancements so for toy dogs i want to

00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:49,440
briefly introduce the dark squad and zoe

00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:49,679
dark basics if you are not familiar with

00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,879
it

00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:55,040
yet um the dark squad creates and

00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:56,879
publishes documentation for zoe

00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:58,560
and we also work on improving the

00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:01,040
content experience

00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:04,480
especially by acting on user feedback

00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:07,440
and also analyzing content metrics

00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,920
also um helping people getting involved

00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,800
in the

00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,839
zodiacs and the community to make

00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,960
contributions

00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:18,160
is one of our focuses as well

00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:20,000
so like most open source stocks toy docs

00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:22,720
are now available on github

00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,040
and published online um and you might

00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:26,000
have

00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:28,240
seen it when sean demoed the

00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
installation dock for docker

00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:32,320
we also have a slack channel where

00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,920
people discuss dog issues and get

00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:36,800
get quick updates so next let's take a

00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:39,040
look at the

00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,480
zoe dock site um you have seen it

00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:42,560
previously

00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:44,000
but zoe dogs not only provides online

00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:46,240
documentation it also

00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,680
provides other formats of documentation

00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:52,079
that you can download

00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:54,160
such as pdf formats and zip formats

00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:55,359
and you can also use the search box in

00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:58,880
the header section

00:35:55,359 --> 00:36:01,119
to search docs within the dark side and

00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:03,119
you can also navigate to the sections

00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:04,720
such as the getting studies section and

00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:07,200
contributing section

00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:09,440
um these sections all provide many

00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:11,440
useful content for you to be successful

00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:14,560
this with this project

00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:17,760
okay so moving to the next page the

00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:18,480
um as you know that the zoe community

00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:21,119
members

00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,240
have been tirelessly creating many new

00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:24,640
zoid dogs

00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:25,839
and you can find them on the dark side

00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:28,400
and here i'm

00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:29,440
listing a range of reference materials

00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,000
that might be

00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:33,040
helpful especially when you use an

00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,160
extension

00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:36,720
such as the zoe command line reference

00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,920
guide

00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:41,760
the zoid sdk reference guys as well as

00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,400
the api reference guides that were

00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,520
published

00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:48,400
not long ago okay next i'm

00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:50,640
going to shift back to the focus for

00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:52,800
this pi for the dark squad

00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:54,000
um as i mentioned we are making some

00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,640
enhancements to the

00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,960
overall user experience and these

00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,760
enhancements are actually based on some

00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:02,960
feedback

00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:06,079
we received previously um as you might

00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:09,280
know um zoe consists of many components

00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:11,359
so um just imagine what if you want to

00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,400
find information now about only one

00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:15,520
component

00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:17,119
such as the zos component or the zoid

00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:19,599
coi component

00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:20,480
um what you do now is that you have to

00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:23,520
navigate to the

00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:25,200
dark side to find

00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,800
relevant information for different

00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,720
components and this

00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,480
information might be scattered in

00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:32,880
different sections

00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:34,160
um so in order to resolve that user

00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,640
experience issue

00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,200
what we are doing now is to allow you to

00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,920
select

00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:41,839
the component of interest or the intent

00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:44,000
of visiting the dark side

00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:45,680
and then we will suggest a list of

00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,480
relevant resources to you

00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,880
to just to help you get studied quickly

00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,040
and

00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,880
as shown on this screen now there will

00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:54,560
be two new sections

00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:56,160
and the first section allows you to

00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:59,359
select your intent

00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:02,240
of visiting site and the second allows

00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:04,720
you to select one specific component

00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,839
and here we are going to take the api

00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:08,320
mediation layer

00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:09,200
think for example after you click this

00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:12,720
link

00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:15,560
it will bring us to the next page and

00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:17,520
you will be directed to a topic named

00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:20,800
information.map

00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:22,880
so each component or area will have a

00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:26,240
similar topic like this

00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:29,440
and this kind of topics is um like an

00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:30,400
information hub where you can find all

00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,280
the resources

00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,920
that you need for one component or

00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:36,880
fulfills

00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,520
one instant or goal of limiting sites

00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,440
and

00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:42,560
this kind of informational map will

00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:45,599
cover topics from fundamentals

00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:46,000
or introduction to more advanced topics

00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:49,040
like

00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:52,640
configuration as well as security or

00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:54,960
onboarding one api so basically um

00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:57,599
it will consolidate the dark side topics

00:38:54,960 --> 00:39:00,480
specific to one component

00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:02,000
and at the same time it goes beyond that

00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:05,200
by adding some great

00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,560
social resources and as you notice we

00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:09,520
are adding blogs

00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:10,079
on the zoi medium sites which is

00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,960
relevant

00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:13,680
to these specific components as well as

00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,680
videos

00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:17,520
and some other information like the

00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:19,119
slack channel information and the squad

00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:21,520
meeting information

00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:23,599
um so this will help you get started

00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:27,040
with one component

00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:30,720
okay i'm moving to the next page there's

00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:32,640
another quick update from the dark squad

00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:34,720
as you see on the screen now we are

00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,680
adding some popular topics on the home

00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:38,000
page

00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:40,480
and the goal of adding this kind of

00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:43,839
links on the homepage is to help people

00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:46,880
discover frequently ready topics just

00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:49,839
more quickly and easily and

00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:52,560
how we did that actually we gathered a

00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:53,599
list of popular topics based on the page

00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,839
views

00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:57,200
in the past year using the google

00:39:55,839 --> 00:40:00,240
analytics tool

00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:02,720
and basically the higher the page view

00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,920
the more popular the topic is so here we

00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:06,960
listed about

00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:10,079
10 to 11 topics here just to help people

00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:13,119
quickly discover it on the home page

00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:15,839
okay so next um if you

current navigation experience on the

00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:44,079
site

00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,800
now we have a lot of topics and as you

00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:48,400
might have

00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:50,400
noticed so we want to refactor that

00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:52,800
and provide better navigation experience

00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:55,359
to help people discover topics

00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:56,240
and we also plan to provide some more

00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:59,280
content for

00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:02,160
onboarding new users and contributors um

00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:04,880
such as some key concepts chapter that

00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:07,760
will explain the zoy basic terms

00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:08,800
and also better contribution doc where

00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,640

and in the months to come we also plan

00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:19,119
to

00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:21,599
improve the docs infrastructure ui

00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:22,880
and search to address some feedback and

00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:25,599
i noticed that there is

00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:26,720
one question in our q a channel so if

00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:28,720

yeah um so those that's all for my

00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:37,359

the onboarding squad with feedback from

00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:04,560
quite a few users and members

00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,680
of the zoe community have been working

00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:08,720
on refreshing

00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:10,480
zoe.org while i'm sure we all

00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:13,119
love the homey feel that it has right

00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:15,440
now we are looking to make it a place

00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:18,640
where we can really confidently direct

00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:21,200
new zoeans and make sure that they

00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:22,240
depending on their various standings

00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:24,480
within their teams

00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:25,280
and what it is that they want to do get

00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:28,560
to the right

00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:29,680
place on the site so more concretely we

00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,119
aim to provide users with the

00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:32,240
information they need to progress their

00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:33,839
engagement with zoe

00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:35,440
and we want to improve it in three ways

00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:37,359
we want to be much more consistent

00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:38,880
we want to make sure that somebody who

00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:40,240
hits the site is very likely to get

00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,839
where they need to go

00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:44,079
we want to make sure it happens

00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:46,079
efficiently so they don't need

00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:47,040
to get external support unless that's

00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:47,680
the specific thing that they were

00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,880
looking for

00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,960
they should be able to find what they

00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,240
need and they should be able to do it

00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,760
quickly they shouldn't have to click

00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:55,119
around the site for a long period of

00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:57,839
time

00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:59,280
the dog squad as shown by the excellent

00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:01,920
work that ashley just showed

00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:04,160
has been working on uh enhancing this

00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:05,839
onboarding experience and getting

00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:08,000
people's minds wrapped around zoe and

00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:10,560
making it the most welcoming place

00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,440
possible for main framers the way we

00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:14,480
like to think of it

00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:14,960
is that zoe.org is kind of the pretty

00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:17,520
face

00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:19,280
on the documentation beautiful mind

00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:21,040
documentation is a beautiful thing

00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:22,640
documentation can often be scary

00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:24,720
although it's made much less scary

00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:26,000
by the updates that ashley just made and

00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:27,359
we want to make sure that we shepherd

00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,599
people into the right place

00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:31,599
based on what they need next slide

00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:33,599
please

00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:34,960
so when we're thinking about which

00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:36,640
members of the zoe community we're

00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:38,880
looking to help primarily

00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:40,319
we did a persona study and there's lots

00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:42,800
of different kinds of users

00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:44,240
for zoe but here are the five that we

00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:46,560
thought we could help most

00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:48,560
in brief we've got an experienced zos

00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:50,240
developer looking to extend zoe

00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:52,400
and early 10 years at os developer

00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:54,880
looking to learn about both zoe

00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:56,319
and mainframe a systems programmer or

00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,680
somebody who's working specifically with

00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:59,760
the devops tool chain

00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:02,400
who needs to figure out practically how

00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:04,000
zoe works and start maintaining zoe apps

00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:06,079
a business decision maker who doesn't

00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,240
want to poke around in code so much

00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:10,160
but really wants to understand the

00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:11,280
business value of zoe and whether or not

00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:12,960
this is something that could work in

00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,920
their organization in the first place

00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,520
and lastly

00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,960
like many of you listening the community

00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:18,800
contributor somebody who

00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:20,240
is looking to get started uh

00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:24,400
contributing to zoe

00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:24,400
and wants to know how they can do that

00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:28,240
so when we think about what we want to

00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:30,240
help these people

00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:32,079
do what we want to help our humans do

00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:34,560
it's primarily one of four

00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:35,119
things um we want them to be able to

00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:37,839
learn

00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:38,800
which the dog squad is um portraying

00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:40,000
beautifully but

00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,359
we want them to be able to educate

00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,720
themselves on what zoe is why it's

00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:43,760
beneficial how it's used and the

00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:45,200
supporting knowledge

00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:47,040
we want to be supported in actually

00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:48,400
getting started with using zoe with

00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:50,400
consuming it

00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:51,920
for those who are either looking to

00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,680
extend zoe and

00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:55,359
think about building on top of zoe we

00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,920
want them to know all about how to do

00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:58,160
that

00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:59,040
and also somebody who might be looking

00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:02,319
on

00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:03,280
uh looking for vendors who are already

00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:04,960
on top of zoe

00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:06,480
they should be able to find this and

00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:08,880
lastly contributors uh

00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:10,319
anybody should be able to know how they

00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:11,920
might contribute to zoe and how they can

00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:12,560
get involved with the community on calls

00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:15,839
like this

00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:15,839
among the many other avenues

00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:21,040
so moving forward uh this is the landing

00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:22,560
page imagine this is one scrollable

00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:24,480
asset i just put them side by side to

00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:26,720
make sure that they're both visible

00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:28,480
so the because of some of the great work

00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:30,079
done by a member of our zoe community

00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:31,440
named andrew troydell

00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:33,200
we are going to be able to have some

00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:35,119
live metrics that are going to sit

00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:36,640
on the front of the zoe site uh along

00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:40,560
with the announcements at the top

00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:42,319
uh and uh a new intro video that both

00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:43,440
ashley from the doc squad and joe from

00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:45,680
the onboarding squad

00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:47,040
have been working on um so this should

00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:48,400
be able to give somebody who doesn't

00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:50,560
know anything about zoe

00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:52,240
an overview of what it is and why it's

00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:55,200
beneficial

00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:56,240
depending on who of our five users we

00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:58,640
are looking to help

00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:59,280
um these stats these six stats that you

00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:01,359
see up here

00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:03,440
are all going to link to different

00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:04,880
things that are going to

00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,480
allow them to get to where they need to

00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:07,280
go quickly if you're interested in

00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,640
vendor products

00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:10,560
it's going to send you to a place where

00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:14,160
you can search that if you're interested

00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:15,359
in like the the actual downloads it's

00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:17,200
going to take you to that page

00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:18,640
and the community aspects are also going

00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:21,119
to be linked

00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:22,720
we're going to have initially images but

00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:24,800
then hopefully over time

00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:26,079
small videos for each of the components

00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,640
in the second screen you see on the

00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:29,920
right

00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:32,400
and that are going to show somebody

00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:34,079
exactly what using each of the

00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:35,599
components might look like

00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:36,960
so if they're interested in a specific

00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:38,160
part of them you'll notice that there

00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:41,119
are three links

00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:42,640
for each of these components there's a

00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:43,920
case study for our business

00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:45,440
decision makers and people who are

00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:46,960
interested in practical application

00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:48,079
there's the documentation which will

00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:51,119
link to the relevant

00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:53,040
place in the docs and uh the place where

00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:54,480
you could find the code and that squad

00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:56,880
on github

00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:58,319
finally at the very bottom you see what

00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:59,760
would you like to do with zoe

00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:01,440
and this is where we again give an

00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:04,000
opportunity for a new user

00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:04,880
to um figure out where on the site they

00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,280
need to go

00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:07,920
um of course you can see in the top bar

00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,440
as well but

00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:11,200
we think that a direct call to action

00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:14,400
like this will really help

00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:14,400
sort a new user out

00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,760
the learning page is something that is

00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,559
new to the zoe site and that we want to

00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:22,400
add

00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:23,839
there are plenty of amazing zoe

00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:25,599
resources that are around

00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:27,440
but the issue is that they are around

00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:29,680
and we want them to be together

00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:31,760
there are so many different things that

00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:32,720
you can learn about zoe from from the

00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:35,760
zoe github

00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:36,960
to z trial to our great medium blog the

00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:40,400
omp

00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:42,400
youtube youtube channel the docs

00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:43,440
the slack all of these should be in one

00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:46,000
place

00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:47,680
so that a user can select for themselves

00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,559
exactly what it is that they would like

00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:50,720
to learn from

00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:52,000
we of course push the docs at the top of

00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:54,319
this and also

00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,559
throughout the new website because this

00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:58,400
is the lifeblood of information on zoe

00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:59,599
and it's taken care of really well and

00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:02,000
constantly adapts

00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:03,839
to user needs at the bottom we have an

00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,520
idea of supporting resources

00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:07,440
while these resources aren't necessarily

00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:09,839
to do with zoe directly

00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:11,599
they can help either experience

00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:13,359
mainframers who are new to more

00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:16,240
contemporary development practices

00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:17,040
or developers who are new to mainframe

00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:18,720
and zoe

00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:20,880
fill in the gaps in their knowledge be

00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:22,880
that gaps with mainframe or

00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:23,920
gaps in let's say modern development

00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:26,480
paradigms

00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:27,440
these are blockers that both sides

00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:28,559
experience and

00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:30,960
we think that we can provide some

00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:32,160
helpful links that will let our users

00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,520
know what they don't know

00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:35,839
and get them started on the learning

00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:35,839
journey

00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:40,559
with respect to extension this is

00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,440
something that might not come

00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:44,000
intuitively

00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:45,680
to those who are landing on the zoe.org

00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,520
page and we want to fix that

00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:49,599
this page is just meant to explain

00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:52,079
exactly what it means to extend zoe

00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:53,839
link to extending documentation and also

00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:55,599
explain what the zoe conformance program

00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:56,880
is and if they want to learn more

00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:58,160
they can go to the zoe conformers

00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:59,200
website because it has a separate

00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:01,440
dedicated website

00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:03,280
for it at the bottom here you see

00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:05,680
current badge holders and

00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:07,280
this is something that is going to allow

00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:09,839
us allow somebody to

00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:10,880
search for different products that are

00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:13,760
already sitting

00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:15,440
on top of zoe so if somebody is

00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,400
interested in what the ecosystem

00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:17,760
currently looks like

00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:20,640
they're going to be able to find it

00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:20,640
right here on the site

00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:25,200
the download page is going to stay by

00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:26,160
large the same but of course it will be

00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:31,200
updated

00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:31,200
based on new parts of zoe that come out

00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:35,680
finally we want to talk a bit about a

00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:38,079
new contribution page

00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:39,440
this is kind of a hub for the zoe

00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:40,240
community and we've got a really

00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:42,720
welcoming

00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:44,240
engaged and multi-faceted community and

00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:46,000
the idea here is again

00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:47,760
to put it all in one place so that

00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:51,200
somebody knows how they can

00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:51,599
engage with zoe so um at the top you've

00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:54,559
got

00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:55,200
slack the omp a couple of good starter

00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:57,040
channels

00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:58,240
the open mainframe project calendar and

00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:01,280
the github

00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:03,280
um a quick rundown of upcoming events

00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:04,559
and how where they can be found and how

00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:07,440
they can be participated in

00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:09,200
and finally a table that encourages

00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,920
people to join a squad call that's a

00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:12,800
great way

00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:13,920
to get involved with zoe now for each

00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,720
squad we're going to have a brief

00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:17,440
description

00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:18,720
a link to their github uh a link to

00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:20,640
where

00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:22,480
when their meetings are and also how you

00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:23,760
can join that squad's meeting

00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:26,319
and finally a little link that says

00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:27,680
submit a meeting topic still ironing out

00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:32,240
the details on this a little bit

00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:33,920
but the idea here is that if somebody is

00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:35,760
wants to join the meeting instead of

00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:36,000
joining cold turkey they're going to be

00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:39,040
able

00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:41,359
to radio ahead and say who they are

00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:43,119
what they want to talk about uh this not

00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:45,280
only will break the ice for them

00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:46,160
um and make joining the meeting easier

00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:48,319
we hope

00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:50,240
but we'll also give a heads up to the

00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:51,920
leaders of the squads

00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:53,839
that there might be somebody dropping in

00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:55,520
on their meetings allowing them to

00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:57,920
shift timelines around and generally

00:51:55,520 --> 00:52:00,160
organize better making

00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:04,800
accepting visitors a more welcoming

00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:06,880
experience on both ends

00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:08,079
uh so that's about it for the refresh we

00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:09,200
want to keep it simple and we want to

00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:12,319
make sure that we

00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:13,119
address user needs and at the end lower

00:52:12,319 --> 00:52:15,200
people to

00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:16,480
the right place either in the community

00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:18,160
or in the docs

00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:20,079
because we know that users can be

00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:21,680
greatly supported if that initial

00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:23,760
barrier can be overcome

00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:25,359
so in terms of what's next we want to

00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:26,720
finish and implement this website in the

00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:28,400
coming few weeks

00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:30,400
monitor website statistics and adjust

00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,960
based on learnings just as the doc squad

00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:33,359
has done

00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:35,040
we want to see um which pages if any are

00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:37,599
causing a user's problems

00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:39,119
get feedback from this community both

00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:40,800
quantitative and qualitative

00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:42,640
uh and lastly we're going to be

00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:45,040
maintaining a list of

00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:46,800
features to come but the one that's top

00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:48,160
of mind uh that won't be in this release

00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:50,240
but hopefully in a future one

00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:51,359
might be enabling community editing of

00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:53,920
learning resources

00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:55,040
as the community happens upon resources

00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:56,720
that could be helpful

00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:58,319
they should be able to contribute them

00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:00,960
to the supporting resources

00:52:58,319 --> 00:53:02,319
page in some capacity this will not be

00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:03,760
implemented in this release

00:53:02,319 --> 00:53:06,480
but there has been some enthusiasm for

00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:07,200
this and we hope to continue that work

00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:09,119
forward

00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:10,720
lastly as with everything else in zoe

00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:12,160
it's whatever suggestions you may have

00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:14,319
we'd love to hear your feedback we love

00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:15,680
to hear your ideas you're the users and

00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:16,720
the purveyors of this community after

00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:18,240
all

00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:21,359
so yeah thank you for listening and i

00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:21,359
hope you're as excited as we are

00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:28,559
fantastic thanks ilya

00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:31,680
so um i guess with just six minutes

00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:34,720
left we'll just do the upcoming events

00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:38,480
and ongoing commitments essentially the

00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:38,480
the wrap up here um

00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:42,640
so as a means to collect your feedback

00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:44,720
without

00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:45,760
overburdening you with with too many

00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:48,319
surveys

00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:50,319
uh that zoe collectively as a community

00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:52,640
we've agreed to limit our surveys to

00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:56,319
just two times per year

00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:59,599
we've got one that we just launched um

00:53:56,319 --> 00:54:02,000
and that will be our january survey

00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:03,040
and we're planning the other in around

00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:06,720
uh the june

00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:06,720
time frame um

00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:13,119
as you know the survey is open right now

00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:13,599
and we plan to run it through the end of

00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:15,920
next

00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:18,240
week so we ask that you please consider

00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:21,440
completing the survey as soon

00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:24,960
as you can preferably after this meeting

00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:28,880
if you have just 20 minutes to spare

00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:30,640
your feedback is so important and we

00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:33,119
really really appreciate you taking the

00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:33,520
time i believe bruce did include the

00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:36,480
link

00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:38,960
to the survey in the meeting chat so if

00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:42,000
you could take a look at that

00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:42,000
that would be great

00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,960
also this is a great opportunity for all

00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:48,640
of you

00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:51,359
on the call and anyone listening to the

00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:55,280
recording to join in on our next

00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:57,920
zoe planning we have a next iteration

00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:59,119
that is actually occurring next week

00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:02,160
it's called

00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:03,599
program increment or pi planning as we

00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:06,640
call it

00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:09,920
we also can share a link in the chat

00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:12,799
i think ashley's going to do that

00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:14,720
for information on when the meetings are

00:55:12,799 --> 00:55:16,079
happening there'll be meeting links in

00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:18,799
there

00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:19,359
we highly recommend that you consider

00:55:18,799 --> 00:55:21,760
joining

00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:23,920
at least the opening meetings on each of

00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:25,280
the days so that you'll get a feel for

00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:28,799
how the meetings are run

00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:31,760
and you'll also gain an understanding of

00:55:28,799 --> 00:55:33,280
when the various squads will be breaking

00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:35,839
out into meetings with

00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:36,319
with more details so do consider joining

00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:39,359
our

00:55:36,319 --> 00:55:39,359
pi planning

00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,680
also since we're about to begin a new

00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:49,839
program

00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:52,880
increment essentially the next quarterly

00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:54,799
session worth of work for zoe

00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:56,799
wanted to just list out the tentative

00:55:54,799 --> 00:55:58,880
dates that we have scheduled for what

00:55:56,799 --> 00:56:01,920
we're calling system demos

00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:04,559
these are usually held i believe at 9 00

00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:06,400
a.m on mondays and the intent is to

00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:09,599
review the details of

00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:11,599
the upcoming and planned releases as of

00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:15,440
right now we have these three

00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:18,559
planned and scheduled although they are

00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:18,559
subject to change

00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:25,200
also wanted to make you all aware that

00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:28,839
we do have

00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:30,000
venues that continue to host zoe content

00:56:28,839 --> 00:56:31,680
um

00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,839
right in front of us is the share

00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:36,799
virtual march event

00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:37,839
that's the i guess it's typically the

00:56:36,799 --> 00:56:41,200
the spring

00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:45,040
share conference which will be virtual

00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:48,079
again last falls and i guess

00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:50,240
i guess the spring and fall were virtual

00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:52,880
we're we're going to be doing that again

00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:53,920
this this year and as you can see there

00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:56,880
are many

00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:58,960
tracks with references to zoe so do

00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:02,240
consider joining that

00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:05,359
in addition devops.com typically hosts

00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:08,559
events and webinars that feature zoe

00:57:05,359 --> 00:57:13,839
there are several from last year that

00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:13,839
were recorded and available for replay

00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:19,119
i think just about everyone on this call

00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:21,280
mentioned medium.com this is the

00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:23,839
area where you will find a lot of

00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:24,319
educational materials related to zoe we

00:57:23,839 --> 00:57:26,799
have two

00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:29,599
areas within medium.com that many of the

00:57:26,799 --> 00:57:33,520
zoe community members post to

00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:36,880
it's medium.com backslash zoe medium.com

00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:40,000
backslash modern mainframe so please do
