good afternoon good morning good evening

00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:05,520
wherever in the world you happen to be

00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,040
today

00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,599
uh i want to thank all of you for

00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,960
joining this open house

00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,280
uh it's the first time we've really done

00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,160
an open house uh really virtually like

00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,160
this i think

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,080
virtual is really the norm for all of us

00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,520
um over the past year

00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,279
we're hoping to get towards that point

00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,600
we'll be able to be in person here

00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:26,080
soon um but we hope you and your

00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,320
families are all safe and well

00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,080
um so that we can meet you in person

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,280
here at a future event

00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,480
um for today's open house really we're

00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,399
gonna have a pretty

00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,840
simple structure here i want to give a

00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,239
little bit of context from the project

00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,920
and

00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:41,440
we just did a news announcement i linked

00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,960
to it in the chat um

00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,719
i would encourage you for the people who

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,640
are attendees um please if you want to

00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,239
introduce yourself in the chat

00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,680
um you know let us know who you're from

00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,960
let us know some of your interests that

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,719
would be really great

00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,640
um so we'll talk a little bit about the

00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,440
project what's new

00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,000
we have a great set of panelists that

00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,480
are joining

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,640
us here today um from a number of our

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,479
member organizations but also

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,400
um one of our mentees the past here and

00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,040
they're gonna really help give you some

00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,799
insight

00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,720
of what the project's about where the

00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:13,200
value has been for them

00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,960
and um why they see this is an important

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,720
thing for the mainframe community

00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,320
um and then we really want to open a lot

00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,040
of the questions to you and

00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,880
learn a little bit more about um what

00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,600
questions you have about the project

00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,159
it's no holds barred we want to hear any

00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,080
questions

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,360
any feedback and anything you've ever

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,079
wanted to know we are

00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,320
a very transparent open group and we'd

00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:37,680
love to share

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,520
so the open mainframe project um

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,880
it's going to have its 6th anniversary

00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,960
here coming up

00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,560
and it was created with the concept of

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,600
being this focal point

00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,840
for open source in the mainframe and you

00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,439
know it's been an amazing six years here

00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,600
um and you can certainly see a lot of

00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,880
our presentations we've done on this but

00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,640
i think one of the things that we're

00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:00,960
really seeing coming together

00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,680
is a focus of what our organization is

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,360
about

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,200
what this community is about and really

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,000
where it's driving forward

00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,679
and as i talk to folks in the open

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,840
mainframe project

00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,680
these four belief principles are things

00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,400
that i just continue to hear here more

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,000
and more

00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,599
and i'm hoping this probably resonates

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,920
with a lot of you in the audience too

00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,280
you know that leading organizations are

00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,720
leveraging their technology

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,760
infrastructures that competitive

00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,160
advantage

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,560
the mainframe design principles are

00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,640
really important to these organizations

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,080
and the key is is how do we make all of

00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,480
this interoperable

00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,360
and this is something that happens

00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,200
through open source

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,640
and i have the privilege of working with

00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,400
a lot of different communities

00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,480
from different technology sectors

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,319
different verticals and horizontals

00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,760
and we see this over and over and over

00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:49,040
again we're really

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:51,440
achieving these huge opportunities

00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,760
and these huge things it's not one

00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,280
organization it's not one person

00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,800
it's a group of people it's a group of

00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,239
organizations that come together that

00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,159
make that possible

00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,080
and this is what the vision is we

00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:03,360
believe this is a thriving open source

00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,959
ecosystem

00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:10,000
and together it delivers that value

00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,280
such that that becomes the standard for

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,440
open modern

00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,040
enterprise class systems infrastructure

00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,280
and applications in the mainframe

00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,040
in other words these the technologies

00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,159
that are put together here and built

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,599
together here

00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,360
they're the ones that are

00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:26,720
interconnecting mainframe

00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,159
back into that larger enterprise world

00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,840
and this really aligns with exactly what

00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:31,280
the mission is of this project

00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,959
build that open source community and

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,920
drive that adoption of open source in

00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,360
the mainframe

00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,599
by eliminating the barriers

00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,200
demonstrating the value strengthening

00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:41,360
the collaboration points

00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,959
and really finding those open source

00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,799
projects and efforts

00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,080
that help really align and drive that

00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,080
vision forward

00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,680
and we've really done this very

00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,200
successfully here and this is testament

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,280
to the community that has come together

00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,159
in this project over the last nearly six

00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,400
years

00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:57,920
18 different projects and working group

00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,720
efforts have come together

00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,360
across the landscape of linux on z

00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,280
cobalt

00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:07,280
zvm zos definitely with zoe in there

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,480
we've seen just a really huge uptake and

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,560
we've really seen this community come

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,959
together in very unique ways

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,000
and these are the efforts that have come

00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,360
from it

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
and you can learn more about all these

00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,479
efforts on our website

00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,359
openmainframeproject.org

00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:22,320
projects and really most importantly

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:25,120
it's not just about

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,080
having projects it's not just about

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,600
having

00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,120
people but it's also about

00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,040
sustainability and

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,360
if i talk with anybody in the mainframe

00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,160
world sustainability is the number one

00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,440
thing that is on

00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:40,880
everyone's mind how can mainframe

00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:44,800
a technology that is decades old

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:47,199
and has decades of legacy and

00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,720
meat behind it how does that carry

00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,040
forward from decades to come

00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,320
and that's not just with the open

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,520
mainframe project with the linux

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,759
foundation as well

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,160
this is what we focus on we enable

00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,919
sustainable innovation so the projects

00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,919
and the areas we're focusing on

00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,759
they're brought into the market through

00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,919
vendors end users

00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,759
and those end users and vendors are

00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,600
contributing back into those projects to

00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,680
keep that circle going around

00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,280
and the reality is is the successful

00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,080
projects that come from here

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,360
it's because they're things that the

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,759
market adopts

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,440
and they're game changers to the market

00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,440
and you know many of you are familiar

00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,199
with technologies like zoe and that's

00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,199
probably been the quintessential one

00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,039
really for this foundation here

00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,320
um that's what we're here to do we

00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,880
enable sustainable

00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,160
innovation so we've got some cool things

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,160
that we just announced today i put a

00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,919
link in the chat there about a press

00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,280
release and a press announcement um we

00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,000
just did today it's our quarterly

00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,000
announcement

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,840
and and really wraps up what's happening

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,039
in q1 gives us sort of a look to the

00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,720
future here

00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,320
the first thing is we want to announce

00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,280
the open mainframe summit which many of

00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,320
you attended

00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,919
it's coming back for 2021 um it's going

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,919
to be a virtual event again which

00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:57,120
um we are saddened a little bit by but i

00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,199
think the state of the world

00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,520
really sort of dictates that but our aim

00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,120
is to be back in person in 2022.

00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,840
um this is a virtual event it's going to

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,160
be the end of september the 22nd and

00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,080
23rd um

00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,160
and this event here if you didn't if you

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,639
didn't take part in it last year

00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,680
this brings together everybody in

00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,080
mainframe

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,840
that has that focal point of open source

00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,039
and it's really that intersection that's

00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,919
coming together

00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:23,280
so last year we saw amazing talks from

00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:25,039
people that are building interesting

00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,560
projects on the mainframe

00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,080
that might be you know looking at

00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,800
adopting broad open source in the

00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,560
mainframe

00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,919
how businesses are looking at the

00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,000
intersection of open source in the

00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:36,479
mainframe and we even brought in some

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,160
outside speakers that really really hit

00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,360
a lot of those points home

everyone walked away with a really

00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,240
amazing experiences we're going to do it

00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,400

registration

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,919
in the meantime if you as an

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,440
organization um see a lot of value in an

00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:55,199
event like this there are sponsorship

00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:58,560
opportunities available um and you can

00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,560
learn more at the link there below

00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,039
we also recently announced embat our

00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,199
ambassador program

00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:07,039
and the really the aim here is that

00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,080
there are some great individuals in our

00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:11,599
community that are just

00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:13,919
passionate about this technology and

00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,639
this program is recognizing and enabling

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,880
them

00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:19,360
and if you look at the 10 names there

00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,720
those are probably names that if you're

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,800
around mainframe right now you're

00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,280
recognizing and recognizing those faces

00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,400
there

00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,479
and you're going to be seeing more of

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,199
them in 2021 we're working with them to

00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,000
get them

00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,720
you know blogging more on social at

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,560
events

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,960
if you're doing events and you really

00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,560
want a ambassador and someone great in

00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,000
the mainframe world

00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,360
let us know these are the people that

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,039
you should be talking to and we can help

00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,039
make those connections

00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,960
um so this is a really cool program

00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:48,000
we've got going here

00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,599
we've also had a great announcement of

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,560
some new momentum coming into the

00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:54,879
project we're really excited that asg

00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,720
technologies bmc software and high

00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,960
school technology services

00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,800
all have joined as members of the open

00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,520
mainframe project and

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,280
this is really a big thing and asg and

00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,240
bmc are sure names that everybody

00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,160
recognizes

00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,160
in this community here probably two of

00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,680
the largest many of the largest vendors

00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,639
in the space and i think it starts to

00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,720
cement

00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,720
that the large vendors in the mainframe

00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,919
world are seeing the future as open

00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,479
source and they're

00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:22,400
bringing this focal point together we're

00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:24,240
also excited that two new projects

00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,319
we're announcing today one is cobalt

00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,599
check and this is a unit testing

00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,440
framework for cobalt

00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:31,680
and is bringing chess driven development

00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,039
practices into cobol

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,640
um this is definitely one should check

00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,760
out if you're if your organization uses

00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,279
cobalt at all

00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,800
this is a really interesting framework

00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,000
to pull in and they're working on

00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,880
bringing some interesting

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,159
um new technologies into there such as

00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,839
mocks and really some of the

00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,600
more forward-thinking ways of doing test

00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,480
driven development so check that out

00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,000
and council zoo is a front end to zvm

00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,000
and you know the provisioning of those

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,320
systems there and it provides a nice web

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,920
interface and we'll end up having hooks

00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,959
to some of our other projects over time

00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,160
as well so

00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,080

00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,000
impression and you know hopefully we

00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:59,040
will talk about some of the good

00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,480
good stuff that is happening and uh it

00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:04,480
is happening here len and john to thank

00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:07,360
for keeping us organized

00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,880
um salazu if you just want to tell the

00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,040
listeners a little bit about

00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:14,160
your role and where you fit and what

00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:17,760
you've been involved in the project

00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:20,800
all right so hello everyone my name is

00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:22,800
ali so i'm a medical student actually

00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:26,639
but i participated in

00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:29,360
omp mentorship program in the year 2020

00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,920
so i worked on the projects smf stroke

00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,320
rmf

00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,680
person engine which we simply like to

00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,000
call zebra

00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,800
so that's how i'm involved with this

00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,360
community

00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,639
so thank you very much fantastic thank

00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,399
you for joining us and thank you for

00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:45,680
joining us late in the evening

00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:47,680
so really appreciate it so so

00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,959
just ready to get the conversation going

00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,680
here i'll just sort of

00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:53,600
really uh kind of pick on a few people

00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:56,000
so maybe david i'll get you warmed up

00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,760
that i'm going to pick on you first

00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
you mentioned a little bit in your

00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:02,959
introduction what what does the project

00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,959
mean for a software vendor such as

00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:07,040
broadcom what's it meant

00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:08,880
to you and your organization to be

00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,920
involved in the open mainframe project

00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:13,279
over the last

00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:16,720
five or six years so so for us the

00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:19,440
it's it's it's about remaining relevant

00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,240
and the sustainability of the products

00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,360
and the direct

00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:26,000
you know of of the our products the

00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,680
sustainability of the mainframe

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,600
and and the value proposition for for

00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,839
the customers by by

00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,600
working with the open mainframe project

00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,759
especially through the zoe project

00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,440
that has given us opportunity with many

00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:40,639
of our products to integrate them

00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:42,880
with other vendors uh in ways and

00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,160
and lan and develop a set of open

00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,000
standards and behaviors

00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,360
it enables us to integrate our products

00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,279
in ways that we were probably never

00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:52,959
going to be able to do if we didn't

00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:54,959
join and form an open source community

00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:56,079
it gives us the opportunity to engage

00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:58,399
customers

00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:00,240
um engage users engage developers in a

00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,279
much more meaningful way and extend them

00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,000
into

00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:05,120
into really the the paradigm that people

00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,079
want to work in today

00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,199
open source is is undeniable and and i

00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,800
think

00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:12,480
you know bringing mainframe it's new to

00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,320
us even though the mainframe is

00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,240
is one of the has been around for for

00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,040
many decades open source is new to the

00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,199
mainframe and

00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,959
and it's given us an opportunity to

00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:23,680
think and find new ways

00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:25,360
to to extend our products and to to

00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,199
engage users

00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,360
so david i'll pick on you again and ask

00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:31,519
a supplementary question

00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,440
and for some of the other isps that are

00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:35,759
listening in those mainframe vendors

00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,839
that maybe have been in this space

00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:39,040
what would you say what was the tipping

00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:41,279
point for

00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:43,199
ca and ultimately broadcom to sort of

00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:45,199
join the project what's been that

00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:46,399
kind of key value you've got from it

00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:50,720
that's that you would

00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:53,440
recommend to others i think it's it's

00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,519
if you have if you were if you're not in

00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,279
the mainframe community

00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:59,040
and you have a technology that you think

00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,480
is relevant to

00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,240
some of the largest customers in the

00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,160
world then extending the value

00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,280
proposition of that product to the

00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,199
mainframe

00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,319
makes sense what may be a differentiator

00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:11,039
for your product

00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,600
or technology or offering and then

00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:13,760
working

00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:15,199
you know if if i bring that to the open

00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,959
mainframe project

00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,319
and specifically the zoe project that

00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,839
gives you an opportunity to integrate

00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,799
that and work with vendors and people

00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,480
who know

00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:24,240
the technology and develop the standards

00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,000
and ways to integrate those things so so

00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:30,080
that becomes valuable to you as a

00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:32,240
as an isv or you know technology vendor

00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,600
and len i'll pick on you now with a

00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,679
question

00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,720
a lot of the people on the call will be

00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,200
thinking kind of

00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:41,440
why should i join how's this going to

00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,840
help me i've got a sales metric

00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,919
to hit you know my job is to talk to

00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,280
customers my jobs to grow the top line

00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:49,760
revenue

00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:52,080
i know this is not obviously focused

00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:55,200
from a sales perspective but has that

00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:58,840
helped vicon through your involvement in

00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:00,080
the project from purely just that sales

00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:03,120
lens

00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:06,880
well actually it has been

00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:10,080
quite helpful to uh

00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:14,799
finding new opportunities uh

00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:18,480
in helping shape um

00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:22,320
open source software that normally would

00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:25,280
be ignoring the mainframe

00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,679
to pay attention to the mainframe which

00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,160
then

00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,880
helps drive more business to the

00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,880
mainframe

00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,240
that otherwise might not have happened

00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:35,440
so being

00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:39,760
part of that team to help shape what

00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:43,120
is to come is a very important

00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:46,240
aspect of being a member of this

00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:49,360
group and you know if you

00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:52,880
are not the lead dog

00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:56,080
the view never changes and being

00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:59,919
able to lead and be able to help

00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,919
where ever it makes sense

00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:06,880
for these projects for

00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,880
issues that arise for

00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:15,120
software vendors clients who

00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:18,240
don't believe speaking from

00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:21,919
this seat is a lot

00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:25,280
more credible at times than speaking

00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:28,720
from a vendor's seat

00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:32,320
and also having those

00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:34,480
resources that are sitting alongside of

00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:37,120
me that you see here on this panel and

00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:40,160
those that are not here on this panel

00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:42,799
all working together and

00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,000
uh growing in the same direction it

00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:46,400
really makes a difference

00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,400
as far as i'm concerned that's a

00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:51,919
fantastic perspective on it

00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:53,760
javier maybe going to you you bring that

00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:55,200
open source perspective that's your

00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,919
background

00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,919
what are you seeing as that kind of role

00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:02,000
to how should people think about

00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,360
the level of commitment to get involved

00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,919
in this project do they need to be

00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,159
hands-on

00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,280
every minute can they step back dip in

00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:09,679
once a month

00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,120
you know what just calibrate some of our

00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:12,720
people on the call here

00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,760
of kind of what the commitment and

00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:17,679
investment required

00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,840
yeah one of the things with with open

00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,840
source is that

00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,880
everyone feels really passionate about

00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,520
open source uh

00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:27,360
developers that you know start small and

00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:31,280
and they open source uh

00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:34,559
you know just a small script a library

00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:37,840
a small tool uh

00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:40,720
they open it and and they might get

00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:42,320
one or two or more uh people using it

00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:45,840
following or forking or

00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:47,679
or just starting to to provide some

00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,000
feedback right and and the next thing

00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,840
you know

00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,240
you might have some pull requests asking

00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,760
you with recommending some improvements

00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,720
or some enhancements or

00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:58,240
or bulk fixing so all of a sudden can

00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:02,000
can really grow

00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:05,039
um you know it can can grow really

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,480
rapidly or you can manage that when you

00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:09,520
become part of uh

00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,480
uh an open uh foundation if you become

00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,960
part of a

00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,159
open mainframe project then you have a

00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,480
lot more structure

00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:18,880
right and that's the point where you

00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:21,280
know you you really have people from

00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,039
uh different backgrounds different

00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:26,159
perspectives different companies

00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:27,280
that will go on and help out on on that

00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:30,080
project so

00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,559
you know people can dedicate you know

00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,480
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:33,600
of their time on on a project or they

00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,000
can work on their

00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,960
pers all personal time a lot of the open

00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,280
source and actually

00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,400
an anecdote on that a lot of the open

00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:43,280
source

00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,799
happens on on your own time right we

00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,760
were measuring a previous company we

00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:47,600
were measuring

00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,200
measuring the number of pull requests

00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,559
and not only the number of pull requests

00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,640
but we were measuring

00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:54,480
the time at what time those were those

00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,240
pull requests were coming in

00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,640
and we noticed that a lot of that was

00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,159
happening late at night and on weekends

00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,320
and and i said well what's going on here

00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:04,000
well it was just the passion for open

00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,799
source and people working on their own

00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,360
time

00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:09,520
uh late at nights or on weekends trying

00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,320
to to contribute to the to the project

00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,200
so

00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,799
um it gets it gets contagious people

00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,480
gets excited about this and this is

00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:18,000
great right when you start collaborating

00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:21,679
and getting more feedback from

00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,679
for more uh contributors

00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,679
that gives me a perfect intro to youtube

00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,440
you've sort of

00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:28,880
come into the project recently through

00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,120
our mentorship program

00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,640
can you give us your perspective of what

00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:35,600
it's meant to be involved in the open

00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,600
mind crime project

00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:39,440
[Music]

00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:42,400
actually from my uncle i would say it is

00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:45,120
nice to get involved with the community

00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,159
in the first part is as a student in my

00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,480
own case

00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:50,799
i normally worked alone but when i

00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:53,120
started i started working with my mentor

00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:54,799
he was able to guide me through how to

00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,720
even get started

00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:57,840
write good project plans and other

00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,480
stuffs like that

00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:02,080
and subsequently there are other members

00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,720
of the community that came into the

00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,760
project

00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,039
an example is uh len santalucia who has

00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,559
been very helpful

00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:10,960
on the project that we are currently

00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:13,600
working on so i think

00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,320
joining our open mainframe project is a

00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,280
very

00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:18,480
good step in starting to build nice

00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:22,960
projects

00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:26,480
thank you

00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:29,919
really quick if i could you know uh

00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:33,520
with a with a mentee intern like celasu

00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:34,720
it was easy i uh i feel he's probably

00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:37,120
one of the best

00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:39,679
we've ever had come through the project

00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:43,360
under the internship program

00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:47,679
and he just really picked up the ball

00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:50,640
and ran with it and alex and i were just

00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:52,080
amazed on how well and how how well he

00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,159
adapted and

00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,120
learned everything and and produced what

00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:57,520
he did in

00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:59,520
in the project so i i had to say that

00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:02,840
because salisu was very modest

00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:05,840
and i didn't want that to go beyond

00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,840
today

00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:12,480
i mean i think that's been one of the

00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:14,400
key things throughout the project

00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:17,039
over the last few years bringing through

00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:20,400
students and bringing and connecting

00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:21,760
students to the sort of isds and the

00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:25,520
vendors in the space

00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:28,480
and some of the clients i mean

00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,200
what while you say i'll go to you david

00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,600
what value

00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,279
would you see in sort of that connection

00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,480
point between some of the students and

00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,440
some of the younger members of the

00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,360
community

00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,039
and then coming through and some of the

00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:41,679
connection points we've made what would

00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:41,679
you see there

00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:45,600
well i would say it gives us an

00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:49,200
opportunity to to demonstrate

00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:51,440
to everyone to customers to our own

00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,240
internal management team that it gives

00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,360
you know

00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:57,919
that anyone can learn mainframe that you

00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:00,960
can work on this platform regardless

00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:02,320
of uh you know of whether you've been

00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,320
you don't have to have been around this

00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,840
for 30 years to be effective on it

00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,440
that that there is an exciting

00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,640
opportunity here to work there there are

00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,840
technology towns

00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,480
challenges and their career

00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,480
opportunities

00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:18,960
yes it exposes it

00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:20,480
exposes the the mentees to opportunities

00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:23,840
that customers as well as within

00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:26,080
the isvs yeah i think that's

00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,440
i think getting that pipeline of skills

00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,440
and talents been

00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,520
sort of crucial for this platform over

00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,200
the last sort of five to ten years so

00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,279
making some of those connection points

00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,360
and having that happening

00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:38,880
in a community way it's certainly been

00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,960
one of the high points for me in the

00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,480
project

00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,880
john i'm just thinking if we got any

00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,480
questions i mean how long

00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,000
where do we want to go from here is

00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,159
there anything particularly you wanted

00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,760
to highlight to the panelists

00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:53,600
yeah though i think it's i think you're

00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,919
hitting it really good here

00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,760
um you know maybe a couple things that

00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:00,000
um it might be useful because i noticed

00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,919
some of the the folks who are attendees

00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,080
um you know they're not as sort of

00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:05,520
familiar with the workings of the

00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,799
project maybe they're considering

00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,880
their organizations getting more

00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:12,400
involved um

00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:15,760
i guess maybe two questions um

00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:17,520
for the panelists what was and whoever

00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:20,320
wants to take this first

00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,919
what was that tipping point as you're

00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,360
looking into this community

00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:24,640
and you're seeing what it's all about

00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,760
and you're understanding sort of where

00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,600
the future

00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,799
of the present really i don't even say

00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,200
the future the present

00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:32,960
of the mainframe is open source what was

00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,559
that tipping point for you

00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,000
and then as you sort of look back and

00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:38,080
you maybe for

00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,600
a few of you and i know david and len

00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,600
you were you know very much involved

00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:44,159
since the early days here

00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:46,159
what have you really seen as that really

00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:48,400
top benefit and maybe something that

00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:50,840
maybe even surprised you a little bit of

00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,080
getting involved with an effort like

00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:55,200
this

00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:57,039
so i guess i i can i can

00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,520
jump on that i think the the tipping

00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:01,600
point you know

00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,559
when it started it was focused on linux

00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:05,760
and z and then the

00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:06,880
the the evolution to sort of the

00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,120
traditional z os

00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,880
software and the openness and readiness

00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,840
and and willingness of the entire

00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,720
community

00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,279
both customer and vendor to embrace open

00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,360
source

00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:19,039
an open source model and build the

00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:21,120
community

00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:22,399
was surprising and and i think it's it's

00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:25,039
it's you know

00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:26,880
i don't think there was i think vendors

00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:28,640
coming together was the tipping point

00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,080
um i think we we had all been circling

00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:33,360
the problem for a while

00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:34,000
ourselves rocket ibm um to start with

00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,320
and now you see

00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,120
the you you see the other vendors in

00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,240
here as well

00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:43,279
um bmc and asg joining

00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,159
most recently um and we have microfocus

00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:47,120
as well

00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:48,080
um and i know there's a longer list of

00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,240
others that have

00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,919
that have engaged in this project i

00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,440
think that's that's really what open

00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:54,640
source is about is community

00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,360
and because there have been attempts at

00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,960
open source in the past before

00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,480
um but i think this is really a

00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:03,279
recognition of of

00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,960
a maturity of how to approach a project

00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:06,559
like this committing engineering teams

00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,159
building community around it for

00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:10,320
engaging customers

00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:11,600
it's not just push it out there and and

00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,600
hope people come

00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:16,000
there's real effort and and meet behind

00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,679
it from all of the vendors

00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,480
um as well as a lot of the customers

00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:22,240
that are involved as well now

00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,640
john you set me up with a question and

00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,480
i'd like to flip back on to you

00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,080
and maybe some of the listeners are

00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,000
thinking kind of

00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,200
what what is this thing how's it

00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
structured

00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,960
what are the main sort of working groups

00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,760
can you just give us

00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:45,840
a brief overview of the various sort of

00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:45,840
centers of gravity within the project

00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:52,480
and we're back how about that um for and

00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,760
the open mainframe project um for those

00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,840
of you on the phone you're very

00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:57,760
familiar with how linux foundation

00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:00,720
projects are set up

00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:01,360
you know we certainly have a very open

00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,159
vibrant

00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:06,960
transparent technical community which is

00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:09,360
led by our technical advisory council

00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,039
that really focuses on not just the

00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,559
technical direction but also the

00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:14,399
projects and the working groups that are

00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:16,399
coming in and helping

00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:18,559
accept them build a life cycle make sure

00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:19,760
that they have the the pieces needing to

00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:21,760
support them

00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:24,840
um and continue to be a resource for

00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:27,840
them throughout time

00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:29,760
um all of the projects within the open

00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:32,240
mainframe project and this is

00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:33,440
everything from zoe to the projects we

00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,360
just announced today

00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,799
they're all completely autonomous um we

00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,240
don't get involved in the decision

00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:39,600
making of them

00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,600
we provide the space for them to

00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:44,000
collaborate um and we provide

00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:46,640
best practices um i work with all of

00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,960
these projects in a very hands-on manner

00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:50,480
to help ensure that they can be

00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,520
successful because oftentimes this is

00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,559
the first time some of these

00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,799
organizations

00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:56,080
have collaborated before um in an open

00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:57,279
source way so we try to

00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,520
we try to go in there and bring our

00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:01,039
expertise as part of that

00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,880
the other side of the house is the

00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:03,679
business side of the house and this is

00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,640
where

00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:07,600
um corporate membership is a piece of

00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:10,399
that

00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:11,919
puzzle there um you know we have a

00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:14,080
governing board which really focuses on

00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:15,679
the fiduciary and budgetary side

00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:17,520
we have a marketing committee which is

00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:19,679
focused on outreach

00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,880
um and really being setting up

00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:22,880
evangelism

00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,320
for our projects and we don't market the

00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,279
open mainframe project for the sake of

00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,440
marketing it

00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:29,120
our goal is to get the 18 hosted

00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,559
projects and working groups

00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,480
out there and out in front of the

00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:34,799
collective consciousness

00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,559
and we work tirelessly to make that

00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:38,480
happen and

00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:39,840
many of these projects have just seen a

00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,600
lot of great uptick

00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,679
because of that happening and that's

00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,159
that's part of what we look to bring

00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:46,880
here

00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:48,320
um with the projects that we support um

00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,520
but everything the technical side of the

00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,640
community if you're on the call and you

00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,799
just want to understand

00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,559
how some of the projects work you can do

00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:56,640
a jump on any technical community

00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:57,919
meeting right now we have a tac meeting

00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,360
in two days um if you

00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:01,440
have technical folks that are really

00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:03,440
interested in that that's something you

00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,880
join up you can get more involved in and

00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,320
you can sort of learn about

00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:08,080
some of the workings that are happening

00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:10,399
there or any of the projects

00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,519
um you know when your organizations to a

00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:14,640
point where they're saying

00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:16,720
we are more interested in really

00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,919
making a statement for ourselves that's

00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,559
sort of where the business side of the

00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:20,320
house is

00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:22,399
and both of those hides work

00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:25,039
independently one other one doesn't

00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:25,600
one doesn't report to the other um at

00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:28,000
all

00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,440
um they work you know autonomously but

00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,159
they also work in conjunction with one

00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,399
another

00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:34,559
for sort of the best interest of the

00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:36,080
entire community as a whole and it's

00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:38,240
so far for six years it's worked out

00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:40,880
pretty darn well

00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,519
john maybe just sort of double click on

00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,519
that

00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:45,760
from how do we how does somebody get

00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:47,840
involved what are the various sort of

00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:49,679
i'm an individual contributor and i want

00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:51,039
to get involved i'm a student i want to

00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:53,039
get involved

00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:55,039
i'm looking after the corporate

00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:56,399
interests of my sort of company and i

00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:58,480
want to get involved

00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:00,640

00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:03,679
tiers and kind of how do i

00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:05,760
get involved we've got a few sort of new

00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:08,240
people to the project still on the court

00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:09,279
how would they get involved so the

00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,720
easiest way

00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:12,399
if you want to check out any of the

00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:16,320
projects that we have

00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:18,559
go to open openmainframeproject.org

00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:20,480
projects here and since um i have my

00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:22,159
screen up actually

00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:25,039
i'll just bring this up here in front of

00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:28,720
everybody so you can just see this live

00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:30,159
um this here is a list of all of the

00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,840
projects and working groups that you

00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:33,679
know we currently have out here

00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:35,360
we have landing pages you can learn

00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:35,840
about each one of them what they're

00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,720
about

00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:40,320
what their um focus is on you can get

00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,039
access to their mailing list their

00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,640
github

00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:44,399
all those pieces where their slack

00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,200
channel is in the open mainframe project

00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:46,399
slack

00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,320
all of their communications all the

00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:49,519
proceedings completely open so you can

00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,360
go check it out

00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:52,640
many of these projects also hold very

00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,799
regular meetings

00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:56,480
and all of those are completely open too

00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:58,399
so that's an opportunity you can jump on

00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,159
one of those calls and just learn about

00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:02,080
what's going on and reduce yourself you

00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:03,360
know talk about maybe what's of interest

00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,720
to you in this area

00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:06,640
um all of that any individual

00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,039
contributor can take a part of and

00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,039
that's

00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:10,799
that we see is usually the easiest way

00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:14,320
to kind of get started

00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:17,120
is just explore learn use and just

00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:18,880
you know get involved um the other half

00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,760
of it is you know as your organization

00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,640
you know if you're part of an

00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,880
organization

00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,240
and you're starting to see hey there's a

00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,519
couple different

00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,120
projects that are becoming really

00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:28,880
important to us maybe we're using them

00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:31,200
as a part of our products

00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,559
maybe uh we're using internally as a

00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,880
company maybe we just see them just

00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:36,640
really valuable over there

00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,840
then you know that's an area where you

00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,960
can learn a little bit more about what

00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:41,519
corporate membership

00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:43,440
um is all about there um and that is

00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:45,760
another area on our page here

00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,880
as well which i'll bring up here and it

00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,799
walks through just kind of some of the

00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,799
benefits and what that looks like

00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:52,480
um not only the open mainframe project

00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:54,399
but also you know you get to be part of

00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:56,159
the larger linux foundation member

00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:57,440
family as well and that has a number of

00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:59,919
amazing benefits

00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:01,200
um in addition to it so those are really

00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:02,320
i think the two big paths i really

00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,679
always when i talk with folks i

00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,320
encourage them check out the projects

00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:05,760
first

00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,600
you know get involved with it i mean

00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,960
it's the you can you

00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,639
you don't like to refer to as the try

00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,320
before you buy but really this is what

00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:14,639
the most important thing is that we see

00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:17,440
here and if your organization then sees

00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:18,240
um these really valuable the investment

00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,480
of the membership

00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:21,520
is often sort of what comes from that i

00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,280
don't know if that sort of hits after

00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:26,800
where you're going at they're stephen

00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:28,879
yeah exactly exactly so um

00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:31,200
can i add just one thing there uh

00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:31,200
stephen

00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,800
i get this question a lot especially

00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:37,760
when i go and talk to other open source

00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,359
communities

00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:41,200
you know and i talk about you know them

00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:43,440
extending to to

00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:46,000
to our platform right so not just to

00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:48,000
make it available on on x86

00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,440
and and then they get the question that

00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,879
i'm getting a lot is

00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:53,040
well but i don't have access to a

00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:54,399
mainframe right and that's another area

00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:57,280
where we can help here

00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:57,760
yes and that's that's a big piece and

00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,560
and

00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:02,400
um you know we we can definitely

00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:04,240
facilitate that and if they ever want to

00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,880
open source their project we we can help

00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,359
them with

00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,960
with that that that aspect and and i get

00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:10,560
that question a lot and i said well look

00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,240
we have the open member project we can

00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:14,079
definitely help

00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,920
yeah we help get mainframe access for

00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:16,800
all of the projects that are hosted here

00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:20,000
whether it's

00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:21,119
z linux whether or it's z os which i

00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,720
know is

00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:24,400
could be a challenging one because of

00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,359
just getting access to the hardware and

00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,680
pieces like that

00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:29,200
so all of our projects we have great

00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:31,280
partners in the community

00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,320
marist college viacom infinity and a

00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,760
number of other folks

00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,920
step forward and they volunteer some of

00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,520
their infrastructure for us to use in

00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:39,599
our projects to use

00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:41,760
um and that's what we see is often just

00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:43,440
a tremendous value for these projects

00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,880
because you're exactly right javier the

00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,320
sometimes the hardest thing is getting

00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:49,200
um access to the hardware and that's

00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,200
something we can help with

00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:52,880
so i mean you've done a lot in that

00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,640
space

00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,320
with giving people access do you want to

00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:58,160
sort of double click on the points that

00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:01,280
john's just made there and

00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:04,560
sort of maybe expand a little

00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:07,200
sure you know uh folks i think

00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:08,880
john what do we got like about six or

00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:11,119
seven of them now

00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:13,359
on our z yeah i think about that many

00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:14,240
yeah yeah and uh you know some of them

00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:17,280
aren't zos

00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:20,400
some of them are on linux on z uh

00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:22,480
and you know they have access to it

00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:25,200
you know 24 hours a day seven days a

00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:27,920
week and uh it really makes

00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,960
a big difference for them because they

00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,960
don't have to go hunting

00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,560
that kind of stuff down and a few of the

00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:35,200
guys on the team

00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:36,320
volunteer and help them if they have a

00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:39,119
user

00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:40,000
id problem or you know a little

00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:43,040
technical problem

00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,480
it's usually pretty good it's really

00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:47,680
working out pretty well

00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:50,800
and i have seen

00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:53,200
uh people who were really struggling

00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:56,720
trying to find some place

00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:58,400
now able to get some real work done and

00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,920
it has made a difference for their

00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:02,480
projects and

00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,200
advancing the project to becoming

00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,040
something

00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:07,040
in a way a very useful open source to

00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:10,480
the community so

00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:13,760
stephen it's been uh very satisfying

00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:17,599
and also some of the students like

00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:21,040
salsa you used our z right didn't you

00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:22,880
i do yeah yeah so you know

00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:25,839
another thing with uh some of the

00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:29,200
interns such as salusu giving them

00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:31,760
access and getting actually having real

00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,880
system experience like that my goodness

00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,400
um

00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,880
at this point in my life is probably one

00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:40,000
of the most important things i can do

00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:43,119
is helping bring on the new

00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:46,480
people to z uh and doing it

00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:47,839
uh with real hands-on just you know that

00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:52,160
wasn't really possible

00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:55,599
uh not too long ago so

00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:58,400
uh and probably one of the most

00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:00,000
uh heartwarming and satisfying things is

00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:03,359
working with

00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:06,480
the interns and seeing them

00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:09,760
fly away into some very nice positions

00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:11,280
i know dr cameron say would be

00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:13,119
jumping on that right now if he wasn't

00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,720
having some technical issues here

00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:17,119
because

00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:18,480
we talk about that all the time he

00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:21,599
helped teach the

00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:25,680
stuff like cobalt in his classes at ecu

00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:27,760
and so on uh leveraging the mayor system

00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,960
so i hope i answered your question

00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,640
stephen you

00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,800
indeed as always then thank you very

00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:34,640
much for that i mean i'm conscious john

00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,920
we've got a couple of people here

00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,760
i wonder if there's any sort of

00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,960
questions from the group that are still

00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,480
with us

00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:42,480
yeah yeah i'm just trying to look and

00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:44,079
again if you have questions um in

00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:46,480
the audience there um i know we're

00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:48,800
rattling on here a little bit um

00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:50,000
you got some passionate people um but

00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,720
please add

00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,240
uh questions here into the chat we can

00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:57,520
relay those

00:38:54,240 --> 00:39:00,079
off to the audience and sort of let them

00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,880
know you know potential ways we can help

00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:02,240
here

00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,320
one thing maybe i just always like to

00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:06,079
get a little bit of an insight um

00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,359
and and i guess david i want to pick on

00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:10,160
you all at broadcom

00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:11,920
um i mean i know you you have teams and

00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:13,040
teams of teams that are working on zoe

00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,880
and i know one of the

00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:16,320
the big pieces in there was

00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,240
transitioning some of your

00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:20,000
development methodologies and working in

00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:22,640
more of that open format

00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,760
um and i know that's actually then since

00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:26,400
zoe that's actually turned

00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:27,680
more of a focal point for you all um

00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,000
what is just kind of give a little

00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,200
insight

00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,960
is there might be some folks in the

00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,480
audience that are thinking oh geez we

00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,839
develop products internally

00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:36,720
like you know and now we're going to

00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:38,800
start working in the open like is that

00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:40,640
what is that like is that a huge deal is

00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:42,480
that a no deal um tell us can you give

00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:44,160
us a like insight of just

00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,680
good things bad things you know some of

00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:48,960
what you've seen so

00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:50,480
so the good things you know it get it

00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,920
exposes people to other

00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,920
other people on other teams and other

00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:56,880
companies other ways of thinking

00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,920
um other other ways to approach a

00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:01,040
problem

00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:01,520
uh and you know there are a lot of smart

00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,359
people

00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,640
that work for many of these companies so

00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,920
it gives you the opportunity to work

00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:07,839
with some of the best and brightest not

00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:10,480
just within your own organization

00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:11,680
but collaborate with them and there is a

00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,440
true sense of community and

00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,640
collaboration that exists around these

00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:17,040
projects

00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,680
i don't think anybody really comes to it

00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,520
with uh

00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:21,040
with its my way or the highway you can't

00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,880
come to it that way

00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:24,400
regardless of the size of your

00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:26,960
organizational or or

00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,640
or the influence that we found you know

00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:30,400
working with ibm with rocket

00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:32,960
and many of the other other vendors on

00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:35,839
here and other partners

00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:38,400
have been very collaborative regardless

00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:39,040
of where we started in our journey on it

00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,200
so

00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:42,480
i think that has been really really one

00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,240
of the the exciting things

00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:46,319
they've been proud to work on the pro

00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:47,280
project you know it's public it's

00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:48,800
visible

00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,800
um they're proud to make their their

00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:53,040
commits to it um

00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:54,640
and and engage with all the other it

00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:56,079
gives other kinds of leadership

00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:58,800
opportunities as well for

00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:59,839
for the individuals that are involved um

00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:02,000
it's it's something

00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:03,839
to really talk about and because people

00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,880
will understand what open source is more

00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:06,560
so the mainframe

00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:08,160
what mainframe is the time so so it's

00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,680
it's it's even more

00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:11,280
provides even more common ground for

00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,800
them um

00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:15,040
to talk about their their their journey

00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:17,520
in their career um

00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:19,520
you know on on the negative side it's

00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,480
it's almost the the mirror image of of

00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:22,079
all this great thing you're

00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:24,000
working with other people but it means

00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:24,800
you have to to compromise and you have

00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,200
to collaborate

00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:28,720
and you don't get everything you want so

00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,359
yeah we may have engineering teams that

00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,280
we can direct

00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:33,040
and have them build a certain way and do

00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,640
things a certain way use specific tools

00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:36,880
or standards

00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:38,480
that you know but there will have to be

00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,400
compromises

00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,839
and but the nice thing is when you make

00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,440
those compromises and built right and

00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:44,640
it's designed properly that's going to

00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,920
make its way through

00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:48,000
all of your products and then that

00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:50,160
becomes the standard so so it's it's

00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,240
it's an evolution and it's been a lot of

00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,839
fun in that i mean david

00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:55,599
david there's one sort of thing in what

00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:59,119
you're saying there that i think's worth

00:41:55,599 --> 00:42:01,520
in expanding obviously

00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:04,079
you know become just our organization's

00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:05,200
ibm and broadcom we compete fiercely in

00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:07,440
this market

00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:09,359
but then we jump on course like this and

00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:11,839
we're collaborating together

00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:13,119
how does that be dynamic being sort of

00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:16,160
fierce competitors

00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:18,160
one minute collaborators on a project

00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:20,079
and working together the next has that

00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:22,079
sort of dynamic work

00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:23,200
uh we we've we've lived it since we've

00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:25,680
been on the platform

00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:28,160
uh you know even back in the ca days i

00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:31,680
mean that is from from its birth i mean

00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:34,800
uh it's it just is a reflection of

00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:38,880
of what the market has always been to us

00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,880
so so maybe as ibm that was new to you

00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:43,599
good one good one i like it i suppose i

00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:45,599
set myself up for that with the first

00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:46,240
competitor's comment so i'll take that

00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:48,800
one

00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:50,400
but now i mean i think i mean the piece

00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,400
that's been interesting for me there is

00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,200
just watching the zoe community come

00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:56,480
together

00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:58,160
we all compete for that mainframe tools

00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:00,480
kind of space fiercely with our

00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:02,240
commercial offerings but watching so we

00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,839
grew up over the last two and three

00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:06,800
years as a project and

00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:08,319
you know the collaboration you see the

00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:10,160
panels you see the

00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:12,560
people presenting and share and the

00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:13,440
various events together i think it for

00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:15,680
me is

00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:17,520
kind of the proof of the pudding if you

00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:19,839
will around the project that there can

00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:23,520
be a panel with rockets and

00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:25,040
with um broadcom and with ibm and with

00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,680
some of the new members that are coming

00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,920
in

00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:30,720
you know we can all be there talking

00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:32,560
proudly about the solely project and how

00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:34,160
you know that's coming forward so i mean

00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:35,839
that's been the big thing for me for

00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:38,079
sure would you agree david

00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:39,200
i i agree because there's no and i don't

00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:41,760
feel like it's fair

00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,960
you know you you look at a product in

00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:44,800
within your organization

00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:46,400
you say oh our team built that or our

00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,960
group built that or an individual built

00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,200
that

00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:50,160
around zoe there is a genuine sense you

00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:52,400
know it's not

00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:53,760
hey we built this regard you know this

00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:55,599
is a really a

00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:57,680
you know as a community as a group we

00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:59,359
this is this is a shared effort

00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:01,359
um and that is something special and

00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:03,280
unique that i don't think exists in

00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:06,640
traditional software projects within

00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:09,599
within you know your an organization or

00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:10,079
or vendor um it is something special

00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:12,400
about

00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:14,640
collaborating and and and giving you

00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:16,480
know giving birth to this

00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:18,720
i think that comes through for me that

00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:20,000
kind of general community

00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:21,599
you you want to add something there

00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,480
potentially i was i was just going to

00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:26,000
add another

00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:27,200
huge benefit is that when you are coding

00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,280
in the open

00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:30,319
you try to do a good job because your

00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,839
code is out there

00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:34,640
right and mary's at least you can

00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:36,160
confirm that our developers developers

00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:37,680
and we're talking about here

00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:39,359
zoe right developers from three

00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:41,119
companies or more

00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:43,040
they don't they don't want to look bad

00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:43,440
they want to look good with their code

00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:46,800
right

00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:49,440
and nicely coded nicely

00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:50,880
integrated and they put an effort and i

00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:53,520
actually had experience where

00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:54,240
where we had you know closed source code

00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:57,119
and we were

00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:58,720
getting ready to open source and i was

00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:00,480
like why it's taking so long that's

00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:01,599
because everyone was making their best

00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,280
efforts to make it look

00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:04,640
really really good before they open

00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:06,800
their code right

00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:08,319
uh maybe it's at least you can comment

00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,800
on that but you'll definitely improve

00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:11,119
your

00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:13,680
your as a man if if anyone here is a

00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:15,599
manager and has developers working for

00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:18,560
you know believe me you open source and

00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:20,640
they're going to do a much better job

00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:22,079
do you agree with that did you sort of

00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:23,920
have to up your game

00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:26,079
coming into an open source community

00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:30,240
like this

00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:33,040
yes actually what he said was right

00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:34,640
so you do a good job and at the same

00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:36,800
time you're looking at those that are

00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:38,720
trying to contribute you're comparing

00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:41,119
their skills with yours

00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:42,960
and there will be a point whereby you

00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:43,680
definitely need to upgrade your own

00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,280
skills

00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:46,960
like currently i'm working on an

00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:49,440
incubator project

00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:51,760
so we're working together with other

00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:52,720
developers that are more professional

00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:55,040
than i am

00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:55,920
so i'm trying to study more and catch up

00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:58,960
with the game

00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:01,359
so that's absolutely true yeah this is

00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:02,079
that transparency leads to everybody

00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:05,599
having to up

00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:07,520
their game i would imagine yes

00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:09,280
so john we've got any other questions i

00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:11,839
want a different view here is there any

00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:13,760
other questions

00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:15,760
i have not seen as many other questions

00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:17,440
coming through um i'm gonna i'm gonna

00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:19,440
kind of pose another one of mine

00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:20,480
here on the audience and and javier kind

00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,040
of look at you because this is something

00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:23,440
we've been

00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:25,200
uh collaborating a little bit on is

00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:27,200
looking at sort of this landscape of

00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:28,160
open source that supports the mainframe

00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,920
here and

00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:31,960
i would encourage if you get a chance i

00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:33,280
mean head to this url or

00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:35,680
landscape.openmainframeproject.org

00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:36,640
what's really fascinating about this is

00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:38,720
this is

00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:40,079
been a growing landscape over the last

00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:42,560
six years and

00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:44,560
not only have we just seen folks within

00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:46,400
the community you know i can look at

00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:49,119
projects here like openstack and

00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:50,960
kubernetes and cloud foundry and

00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:52,640
many of the hyperledger technologies as

00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:54,240
we've had direct impacts

00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:56,400
but then also we've seen secondary

00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:57,200
impacts from many of our members who

00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,720
have then

00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,920
um with this project with this effort

00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:01,040
then use this as an opportunity step

00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,880
forward so it's not

00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:04,880
you know it's not just a you know we're

00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:06,079
we're building sort of our own yard here

00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:08,319
in our own garden

00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:09,680
but we're out there trying to help all

00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:10,000
of these other communities that are

00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:12,160
seeing

00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,839
this platform being able to leverage it

00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:15,200
and um i don't know javi if you want to

00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:17,200
speak to any of that

00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:18,960
yeah and this is this is very close to

00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:21,599
to my heart because i've been uh

00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:23,040
trying to promote uh you know our

00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:26,240
platform the mainframe so

00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:28,800
s390x across all communities

00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:29,680
right and you know we have great great

00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:32,800
uh

00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:35,200
uh projects i mean zoe the one example

00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:37,680
where you can use zoe to integrate with

00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:39,920
so many other things right uh but also

00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:40,720
to invite all these open source software

00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,640
to

00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:44,960
to be multi-platform and i try to

00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:46,640
position it like that right so

00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:48,480
don't don't just make your software

00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:51,040
available for one platform

00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:52,000
try try the others and by the way uh

00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,599
here with the mainframe

00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:56,000
we have the largest enterprises in the

00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:58,400
world using that this platform and

00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:00,720
and it just keeps growing right this

00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:01,680
this is just a small representation of

00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:05,440
the available

00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:06,000
open source software that runs on on ibm

00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:10,079
z and

00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:13,920
linux one uh yes the majority here

00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:16,400
are more on linux uh than than z os

00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:17,920
uh and i have a few more there i've been

00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:20,000
trying to for the last couple of months

00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:22,800
to add more logos here i have a list i

00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:25,839
believe there are like 97 98 logos

00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:27,359
i have a at least another 12 to 15 that

00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:31,040
that i'm gonna add

00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:33,760
that i now can confirm that you know

00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:35,359
it's available it works in some cases

00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:36,000
every version of the open source

00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:39,359
software

00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,160
already comes with the with the build

00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:43,359
available

00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:46,400
for for for the mainframe which is great

00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:47,200
right in some cases you know it just

00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:49,359
works

00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:53,040
uh some of the work that has been done

00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:55,280
you probably heard about all this um

00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:56,800
hybrid cloud and trying to containerize

00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:57,760
everything so a lot of the work that has

00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:01,119
been done

00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:02,079
to to to have all everything that runs

00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:05,599
on containers

00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:08,160
everything that runs uh with kubernetes

00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:09,920
openshift and so on uh that also has

00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:13,040
helped us to to bring more

00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:16,160
more software to to the mainframe right

00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:18,400
so adding things like k native that

00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:20,079
that it's for serviceless well in that

00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:22,319
runs and it has been tested then it's

00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:23,440
you know it's going to be offered uh

00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:25,359
where there's going to be even a

00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:26,000
commercial offering at some point very

00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:29,119
soon

00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:30,720
so um i'm you know going out there on

00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:33,359
the communities and i keep invited

00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:33,760
everyone working and and giving a try

00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:35,280
and

00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:36,800
you know going back to my previous point

00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:39,119
on on giving giving them

00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:41,440
access to the infrastructure uh you know

00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:43,920
we try to facilitate that so so we can

00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:45,520
keep increasing this and by the way

00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:47,040
every time i show this what you're

00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:50,559
seeing there on the screen

00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:52,079
most people uh most people are surprised

00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:53,680
it's like oh i didn't know that we had

00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:55,920
all this stuff

00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:57,440
available right so so i think it's good

00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,800
and it's going to continue to grow

00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:00,240
absolutely and all these folks are

00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,720
directly and directly supported by the

00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:02,319
project

00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:03,680
and if you out there have an open source

00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:05,119
project that you're working with or

00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:06,800
working on a port of

00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:08,559
let us know because we have resources

00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:10,800
here to help you

00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:12,640
get it upstreamed in all those bits but

00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:14,160
um yeah it's really good stuff anyways

00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:16,240
back to you stephen

00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:18,240
no i mean it's a good point to mention

00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:20,960
we talked about technical resources

00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:23,040
before we talked about system access

00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:24,960
we talked about like-minded individuals

00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:25,440
who can sort of help you with the task

00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:27,680
of

00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:28,640
onboarding code so if any of the people

00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:30,800
still out there and

00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:33,040
listeners have you know wanting to

00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:34,559
onboard their code onto a mainframe

00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:36,400
you know there's certainly a community

00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:38,319
of people here who can help

00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:40,319
but i think we've kind of hit all the

00:50:38,319 --> 00:50:41,920
big topics here john so

00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:44,000
i'll kind of pause just quickly if

00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:45,920
there's any last minute questions

00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,920
and ramble a little bit to let people

00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:50,000
type but i think

00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:51,440
we've covered today kind of what the

00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,920
project's about

00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:55,680
what the various stakeholders get from

00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:57,359
being part of this project

00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:58,720
if you've got any questions after this

00:50:57,359 --> 00:51:01,680
session and you

00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:03,599
are wanting to know more myself and john

00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:04,800

00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:07,359

00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:08,000
