identified and may is getting them all

00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:38,139
set up as panelist which is really

00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:39,400
exciting so so just so we have every

00:03:38,139 --> 00:03:41,829
enough time we have three teams gonna be

00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:44,579
presenting today so we'll go ahead and

00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:47,109
get started again welcome everyone to

00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:51,159
this webinar here which is going to

00:03:47,109 --> 00:03:57,090
cover a few of the teams that submitted

00:03:51,159 --> 00:04:00,430
a entry into the Zoe virtual hackathon

00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:04,810
and we announced this back a few months

00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:07,379
ago with the idea of helping the Zoe

00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:10,090
ecosystem get some new additions

00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:11,799
enhancements you know see examples of

00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:15,519
innovation of building projects on top

00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:16,479
of Zoe or even helping build out a

00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:20,370
future

00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:22,419
Zoe conformant offering from this

00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:25,570
definitely there was a lot of interest

00:04:22,419 --> 00:04:27,970
around you know the entire mainframe

00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:30,789
community and so we're really excited

00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:33,310
today to see what has come of this on

00:04:30,789 --> 00:04:36,909
some of the offerings we have a series

00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:40,389
of esteemed panelists from across the

00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:42,880
Zoe community here that will be helping

00:04:40,389 --> 00:04:44,349
evaluate the solutions so with no

00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:48,520
further ado I want to turn over to Jean

00:04:44,349 --> 00:04:50,860
Louie okay thank you John so welcome

00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:54,849
everyone and congratulations for

00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:58,750
participating to to this first the way I

00:04:54,849 --> 00:05:01,270
guess on we have had experience of

00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:05,020
running åkesson for the way in our

00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:07,690
various organization in the IBM rocket

00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:11,110
abroad come and from a bodkin

00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:16,000
perspective we saw tremendous success in

00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:18,370
in doing so and and we thought that and

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,340
that's a reason why we decided to bring

00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:24,009
it to the community so you know we could

00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:27,280
have at the committee level the

00:05:24,009 --> 00:05:29,770
opportunity to run a chasm and running a

00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,060
hackathon and I'm doing a project as

00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:34,360
though a project in the context of

00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:38,080
Akutan may mean you know you're working

00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:39,849
on extension of Zoe and a for instance

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,180
one of the outcome of a previous a

00:05:39,849 --> 00:05:44,710
Katherine is a mobile application

00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:47,560
interface to Zoe so that's an extension

00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:51,879
of Zoe and that's became incubator

00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:54,159
project within the way it could be you

00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:56,169
know leveraging if you're not is we are

00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:58,449
leveraging you know Zoe with your

00:05:56,169 --> 00:06:01,120
products providing API command like a

00:05:58,449 --> 00:06:03,460
face or web interface and supporting a

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:06,400
new kind of use case your product

00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:09,009
couldn't be doing B before and knows

00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:13,229
thanks to you Zoe you have this

00:06:09,009 --> 00:06:17,500
opportunity to address this new use case

00:06:13,229 --> 00:06:20,020
it can be working on creating complete

00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:23,620
new service leveraging Zoe technology

00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:26,349
that we could be the basis for a future

00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:30,099
commercial frame so it can be many

00:06:26,349 --> 00:06:33,069
things around Zoe and the purpose of

00:06:30,099 --> 00:06:35,860
these akka stands is to you know show

00:06:33,069 --> 00:06:37,719
your creativity on things you know you

00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:40,779
you think you could you know you could

00:06:37,719 --> 00:06:43,629
be achieving thanks to the way so having

00:06:40,779 --> 00:06:46,779
said that I think I would now leave it

00:06:43,629 --> 00:06:57,339
to the floor to the teams may do you

00:06:46,779 --> 00:06:59,909

since we made a blog we submitted a

00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:17,710
block but we want to talk over

00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:19,779
representation so that you can follow

00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:27,849
Howard's picture for this integration

00:07:19,779 --> 00:07:31,560
within Zoe but I'm disabled can you me

00:07:27,849 --> 00:07:31,560

00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:02,710
perfect

00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:05,010
okay her fat hello everyone welcome from

00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:07,600
the automation team I literally meaning

00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:12,790
amazing automation experience

00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:16,300
it's Federica and okay

00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:18,820
it's Federica and I'm a Texas for IBM

00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:20,830
she worked at scheduler here in the same

00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:23,770
team with me double-deck analysis and

00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:26,670
Dava biryeo who our software engineer

00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:30,190
developer for IBM's II work at scheduler

00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:33,400
so to talk about something real in our

00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:37,030
days in democracies you know problems

00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:40,090
flow to the surface so government

00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:42,010
healthcare and the insurance industries

00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:44,680
are encountering a problem that is the

00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:47,950
legacy system skill gap in particular

00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:49,750
this is super mainframe platform so the

00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:52,240
solution to mainframe skill get past

00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:55,080
three primary component in our mind new

00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,820
talent mainframe skills and better tools

00:08:55,080 --> 00:09:00,490
all of this component are behind the

00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:02,800
integration project Enzo we for IBM Z

00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:06,780
workload scheduler from now I will call

00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:09,100
it as EWS I did a press is an automation

00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:11,740
scheduling solution that allows to

00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:15,250
control and manage automation process in

00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:17,380
a hybrid environment using a single

00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:20,380
point of control that is a very modern

00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:23,020
web interface it optimized were called

00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:26,170
execution leveraging on predictive

00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:29,850
analysis on intuitive verdict simulation

00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:33,760
it includes a wide set of out-of-the-box

00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:36,460
integration such as ICP people saw for

00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:39,220
data page and many more to fully

00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:41,950
automate and integrate business

00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:44,740
processes across different platform

00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:47,080
across different system so keeping in

00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:51,040
mind the primary component of skill gap

00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:54,250
problem I did a blue ass exposes its own

00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,680
integration in so we first to facilitate

00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:58,600
the access of workload automation

00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:01,000
resources also to

00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:04,029
new talent with few skill around the

00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,459
mainframe traditional tools and seconds

00:10:04,029 --> 00:10:08,829
to enable the web scenarios allowing the

00:10:06,459 --> 00:10:11,709
integration with most common mainframe

00:10:08,829 --> 00:10:14,680
application modern source code the

00:10:11,709 --> 00:10:16,600
management tools and offering the most

00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:19,600
important things the possibility to

00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:21,610
easily create and automate integration

00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:25,089
tests in an a breed environment

00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:27,610
now the Vita will dip dive about AI z SS

00:10:25,089 --> 00:10:32,790
integration in the wing da vida can you

00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:36,759
enable your speech yes thank you very go

00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:37,110
so as Faria was saying just few moments

00:10:36,759 --> 00:10:41,459
ago

00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:45,310
modernizing mainframe is a mission that

00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:47,350
IBM were cross camera sharing with other

00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:50,110
stakeholders in Zoe community

00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:52,899
about three years ago we released a

00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:55,720
complete set of recipe is providing

00:10:52,899 --> 00:11:00,160
commands to interact monitor and modify

00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:02,199
is EWS resources those recipe eyes are

00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,810
now exposed within the API mediation

00:11:02,199 --> 00:11:08,050
layer allowing to leverage the complete

00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:10,870
set of eyes EWS functionalities in Zoe

00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:12,670
and provide ease and providing obviously

00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:15,279
a single point of access to all

00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:18,730
integrated mainframe services truly

00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:21,550
gateway and swagger documentation for SD

00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:26,079
eyes is available in the API catalog as

00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:28,959
well moreover as EWS provides a plugin

00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:31,149
for there's always here line and this is

00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:34,269
a way to provide a relevant subset of

00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:38,040
recipe.i its commands in a very easy CLI

00:11:34,269 --> 00:11:41,680
format this CLI integration is

00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:44,529
appreciated by our customers since it is

00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:47,980
a simpler way to interact with a zws

00:11:44,529 --> 00:11:52,180
than using recipe is the set of commands

00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:54,490
provided with with the CLI is the result

00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:56,829
of a collaboration with our customers as

00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:59,230
part of design thinking and transparent

00:11:56,829 --> 00:12:01,810
development programs we collaborated

00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:04,029
with them to identify the first set of

00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:07,089
commands to be included in the CLI

00:12:04,029 --> 00:12:10,439
plugin and we were also on the best

00:12:07,089 --> 00:12:12,280
command syntax to facilitate their usage

00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:15,880
so

00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:18,760
the ICW f CLI plug-in provides commands

00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:22,840
to list and retrieve objects like jobs

00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:26,160
on mainframe submit mainframe processes

00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:28,350
and update resources that has in the

00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:31,000
interdependencies with those processes

00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:33,310
all read all the responses can be

00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,370
provided in a human readable format

00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:39,670
obviously intended for I use from the

00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:43,750
CLI directly or adjacent format that is

00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:46,270
easily treatable last but not least we

00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:50,170
exposed a set of the revival commands in

00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:52,960
the exact command and this even do i zws

00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:55,540
users and unlimited access to a zws

00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:59,320
resources and to the action to run

00:12:55,540 --> 00:13:02,560
against the same this set of commands

00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,980
leverages on a particular IDW official

00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,250
called

00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:08,380
waffle through which users can perform

00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:11,800
complex actions that are not available

00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:15,580
with other commands exposing the CLI or

00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:19,180
from recipe I see interface as well I

00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:21,010
just would like to add that both the CLI

00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:22,660
plugin and the API mediation layer

00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:25,210
integration game that's all we can

00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:26,830
Foreman badges and now weather will

00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:29,940
introduce a use cases of our

00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:29,940
integrations away

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:54,129
I'm Adam are you able to to a mute

00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:06,130
okay I think that Anna's having problem

00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:08,650
with the Witter connection so I will try

00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:14,770
to talk over his part in the in the

00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:18,070
meantime so I BMG worker schedule a

00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:19,450
plugin is in a tube key figures in the

00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:22,060
mainframe landscape

00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:23,800
first of all application developer who

00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:26,230
can execute and create several

00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:28,900
integration tests and to validate their

00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:32,560
application in a develop scenarios by

00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:37,480
integrating w8 on months with modern

00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:39,100
tools and operators who are responsible

00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:42,700
for the deployment release and

00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:45,310
monitoring god of applications an

00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:47,230
operator provides full support for

00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:49,420
scheduling and maintaining application

00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:51,880
and manage tickets for problem

00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:53,740
resolution so let's see a typical

00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:56,710
scenario for an operator for the

00:14:53,740 --> 00:15:00,880
automatic management and resolution of a

00:14:56,710 --> 00:15:03,370
ticket critical situations require daily

00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:05,920
effort for operators in problem

00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:09,250
resolution and ticket management such as

00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:11,410
run a recovery procedure rerun of

00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:14,860
application with new input file provided

00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:18,160
within the ticket submission of

00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:21,280
application in all stages for which the

00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:24,160
submission is triggered for example by a

00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:27,070
time dependency or another kind of

00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:30,670
external condition and obviously ticket

00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:33,280
closure let's see our work with

00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:35,770
automation command exposing the Zoe CLI

00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:41,530
allowed to automate the lifecycle of a

00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:43,270
ticket so in this first example we see

00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:45,550
how the operator can automate the

00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:49,150
process world incoming tickets for

00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:51,220
submission by using a script that read

00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:53,430
the information of the application to

00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:57,190
submit directly from the ticket form

00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:59,920
compose the work admission commands to

00:15:57,190 --> 00:16:02,740
submit the job stream with all the

00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:05,770
conditions required and to monitor the

00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:07,900
result of the submission once the task

00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:09,880
is completed discrete managed to move

00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:12,640
the ticket from in progress through

00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:13,240
closed status as you can see in this

00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,130
case

00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:17,020
application is submitted on old said

00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:19,660
also waiting for an external trigger

00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:22,630
that for instance could be the promotion

00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:26,649
in production of a batch procedure that

00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:29,740
these application runs using a similar

00:16:26,649 --> 00:16:31,990
process as the example before the

00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:34,050
operator can close all the tickets that

00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:40,390
requires the release of an application

00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:43,660
in this case you will use exact Whopper

00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:47,440
command or by DWS plug-in to execute

00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:51,010
this command that perform the release of

00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:54,070
the entire application or of a single

00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:56,620
job within it once the action is

00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:59,260
completed and the result is verified the

00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:02,800
script closes the ticket the operator

00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:05,319
can use way W a comments to quickly

00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:08,920
verify some application properties such

00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:11,439
as its status which jobs are included in

00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:15,100
it and which is the helper for the

00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:16,959
execution using W recommend the operator

00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:19,329
can automate the complexion of a ticket

00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:23,579
in few seconds this is a task that

00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:27,490
usually requires several minutes so as

00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:29,740
previously told the ID WS CLI

00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:31,809
integration in though we offers an easy

00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:33,940
way to integrate and now to make

00:17:31,809 --> 00:17:37,240
processes in the mainframe ecosystem

00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:45,990
allowing a fast access to the ICW s

00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:45,990
resources so I I have finished

00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:56,760
much great thank you so much for your

00:17:53,160 --> 00:18:00,270
presentation here so we do have some

00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:03,150
esteemed members of the Zoe community in

00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:05,640
the Zoe leadership or on the line here

00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:07,800
Michael Sean and Elliot and we

00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:10,590
definitely want to open line for you to

00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:13,350
ask any questions for those in the

00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:16,110
audience you can also ask questions the

00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:17,490
best way to do that is at the bottom of

00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:20,520
your screen there should be a little

00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:23,550
button it says QA and you can ask your

00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:26,760
questions that way and may can help

00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:30,750
relay those to the audience so I'll open

00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:34,010
back to the floor here - Michael Sean

00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:34,010
Elliott any questions you might have

00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:40,110
yeah so this is Mike Bauer um so he said

00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:42,630
I squad leader I'll kick it off with

00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:45,090
with a question to get us get us started

00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:49,470
how this looks very well done very well

00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:51,960
thought out at once you had your api's

00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:54,870
created and possibly already integrated

00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:57,270
with the zoe api mediation there could

00:18:54,870 --> 00:19:00,180
you expand upon your experience in

00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:06,300
leveraging the Zoe CLI technology to

00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:11,460
build this solution yes I will I will

00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:14,400
answer this question so from my

00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:17,190
experience I was together with ever the

00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:21,870
other developer we were the two

00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:23,940
developer for the CLI plugin and we we

00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:27,390
leveraged obviously on the imperative

00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:30,750
framework that was very well explained

00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:35,970
and with the clear documentation so it

00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:41,940
was pretty easy also for me that I'm I'm

00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:45,780
not so used to the program in typescript

00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:50,610
and it was really easy to me to to start

00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:54,270
my project and and work with with the

00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:56,520
integration with as a whistle I so the

00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:59,730
the imperative framework was the main

00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:02,630
the main tool that we use them was very

00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:02,630
very good

00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:11,540
very cool thank you

00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:15,920
you want to maybe just a follow-up

00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:21,290
question I get very well thought out how

00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:25,880
did the how did the hackathon enable you

00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:27,830
to maybe you know have time to develop

00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:30,850
this solution like I'm just wondering

00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:33,620
how the hackathon helped with the

00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:42,850
opportunity to develop this solution

00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:46,490
could you speak a little bit to that yes

00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:51,680
but the egged on it was great location

00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:54,470
for us to to share our our plugin and

00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:58,520
our integration with with the zoo with

00:20:54,470 --> 00:21:03,680
Zoe Project and Zoe community and it's

00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:08,360
important for for us as as a product to

00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:10,370
be involved in this community to to keep

00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:16,700
pushing on modernizing mainframe

00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:19,580
solutions and I think that we can we can

00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:22,940
add some values to the Zoe Project and

00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:27,530
obviously this is in both direction

00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:31,220
because so we add a great value to to

00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:35,480
our to our solution on mainframe and the

00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:38,980
Agathon is just the best way to show

00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:42,740
this kind of integration and it could be

00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:45,740
I hope that it could be inspired for

00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:48,040
other teams to to be involved in the Zoe

00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:48,040
Project

00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:53,270
all right thanks thank you very much and

00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:56,420
thanks again for hacking with the with

00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:58,850
the Zoe CLI technology I'll give an

00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:59,360
opportunity for my colleagues if they

00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:01,520
want to answer

00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:03,200
however ask additional questions but

00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:07,010
that's it for me thank you very much

00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:08,150
thank you yeah I would I would Shawn if

00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:10,760
you like my I would I would have a

00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:13,100
question if I if I can jump in at this

00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:14,940
at this moment so so thank you very much

00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:17,509
so my name is Elliot Elliot

00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:21,149
I'm a squad Lee for the for the API

00:22:17,509 --> 00:22:23,009
mediation layer and great to see that

00:22:21,149 --> 00:22:26,580
you know everything you've done is Zoe

00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:29,309
conformance so so that's a big plus

00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:32,129
so maybe just to follow up a little bit

00:22:29,309 --> 00:22:33,239
on Mike's question earlier you know you

00:22:32,129 --> 00:22:35,340
know what you're showing is very

00:22:33,239 --> 00:22:38,159
impressive was was all of this achieved

00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:39,929
you know within within the hackathon or

00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:43,200
whether certain parts that were done you

00:22:39,929 --> 00:22:45,629
know you know previously it's it's hard

00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,460
for me to understand you know what was

00:22:45,629 --> 00:22:51,149
actually coded as part of the actual

00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:53,369
hackathon itself yes political speaking

00:22:51,149 --> 00:22:55,559
let me let me say that to the

00:22:53,369 --> 00:23:01,679
integration in the authority the blue s

00:22:55,559 --> 00:23:03,539
was already a plan since we we wanted to

00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:06,119
be part of the Zoe Project

00:23:03,539 --> 00:23:08,879
since we know that some of our customer

00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:12,509
are moving they're exploring its away

00:23:08,879 --> 00:23:15,809
open-source platform they they are

00:23:12,509 --> 00:23:19,470
trying to get familiar with it so it was

00:23:15,809 --> 00:23:23,820
a good chance for us to be involved in

00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:26,009
Zoe the a katana we we were at Sherrod

00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:28,710
this this year on February and the

00:23:26,009 --> 00:23:33,950
Academy we heard about the a patent

00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:38,369
error and it was another let me say

00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:41,129
another pushing the two to develop this

00:23:38,369 --> 00:23:44,820
CLI in this way with with a lot of

00:23:41,129 --> 00:23:49,320
comment because most of this comment can

00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:53,609
cover all the functionality of I DWS so

00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:57,539
this was really a good input for us to

00:23:53,609 --> 00:23:59,549
to develop for this kind of silly even

00:23:57,539 --> 00:24:02,059
if it was in the planet to have our

00:23:59,549 --> 00:24:06,559
integration in the way

00:24:02,059 --> 00:24:10,369
I see so so the the CLI the command

00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:12,889
group that you built for the CLI was was

00:24:10,369 --> 00:24:14,899
what what you have worked towards as

00:24:12,889 --> 00:24:16,549
part of the spawn of the hackathon and

00:24:14,899 --> 00:24:21,379
is that would that be a correct

00:24:16,549 --> 00:24:24,080
interpretation yes it is part they were

00:24:21,379 --> 00:24:27,460
developed as part of the hackathon but

00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:30,529
for sure it was in our plan to do this

00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:35,299
this project even if the Academy would

00:24:30,529 --> 00:24:39,739
have not acura I mean this was in our

00:24:35,299 --> 00:24:42,649
plan but once we when we were updated

00:24:39,739 --> 00:24:46,039
about the akhaten event then we decide

00:24:42,649 --> 00:24:50,960
that the to develop or diesel i-40

00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:52,969
akhaten date okay okay okay great I and

00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:55,369
one more question before I had over to

00:24:52,969 --> 00:24:58,009
Sean I was interested in your in your

00:24:55,369 --> 00:25:00,109
use case around ticket management you

00:24:58,009 --> 00:25:02,719
know I think it'll really good and I'm

00:25:00,109 --> 00:25:04,759
just wondering how how many how many of

00:25:02,719 --> 00:25:06,679
the tickets that the operator tick

00:25:04,759 --> 00:25:08,869
typically sees how many of those

00:25:06,679 --> 00:25:11,269
actually fit into that automation

00:25:08,869 --> 00:25:13,269
paradigm I am assuming that there'll be

00:25:11,269 --> 00:25:15,799
a certain percentage and then there's a

00:25:13,269 --> 00:25:18,619
certain number that just you know needs

00:25:15,799 --> 00:25:22,759
some user interaction and probably also

00:25:18,619 --> 00:25:27,049
for for for automation right yes let me

00:25:22,759 --> 00:25:30,529
say have not really really good answer

00:25:27,049 --> 00:25:35,089
for this question I suppose that about

00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:37,700
30 percent of the ticket can be so bad

00:25:35,089 --> 00:25:40,429
for sure using the automation process

00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:42,529
for it zws because there are some

00:25:40,429 --> 00:25:44,389
standard procedures that you have to run

00:25:42,529 --> 00:25:47,229
to solve some tickets while some other

00:25:44,389 --> 00:25:50,899
one yes required manual intervention but

00:25:47,229 --> 00:25:54,950
in many cases ticket contains so the

00:25:50,899 --> 00:25:59,119
information can let me say can provide a

00:25:54,950 --> 00:26:01,129
file with the some input parameter to

00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:04,029
solve a problem and I did address this

00:26:01,129 --> 00:26:07,849
able to take an input this a file and

00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:10,729
process the recovery procedure described

00:26:07,849 --> 00:26:13,339
it in the ticket this is something that

00:26:10,729 --> 00:26:15,140
we verified yes for something and not

00:26:13,339 --> 00:26:20,450
for all of

00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:24,519
yes I can share my personal experience

00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:28,730
with the consumers just a few months ago

00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:31,250
they were asking for a way to to

00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:34,460
automate some process about ticket

00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:37,159
closure because they had an entire team

00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:40,549
dedicated to handle these kind of

00:26:37,159 --> 00:26:42,500
tickets but all the information were

00:26:40,549 --> 00:26:45,500
present directly in the ticket so they

00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:49,789
they were they were looking for a way to

00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:53,990
automate this process so our customers

00:26:49,789 --> 00:26:56,720
have really a thousand ten thousand of

00:26:53,990 --> 00:27:01,250
tickets per month to to be solved that

00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:04,039
can be automated fully automated so this

00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:05,600
is great discussion here and certainly

00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:07,090
if there's more questions people might

00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,960
have you can put them in the queue a

00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:11,179
just-in-time since we have two more

00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:14,299
teams to present I'd love to shift

00:27:11,179 --> 00:27:17,750
forward to the next team and I believe

00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:20,080
Wu song with the IBM shiny team is up

00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:20,080
next

00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:31,760
yes can you hear me

00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:38,450
if we can hear you okay today Misha I

00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:41,240
must agree I think you have to enable me

00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:44,000
to share my screen I've got a one

00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:47,570
message it to me that is about the

00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,620
attendees screen sharing we just paid

00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:54,639
you a co-host

00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:54,639
can you try now okay let me try

00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:31,370
is that is that working for you song are

00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:34,380
you running into other technical issues

00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:37,590
yes I think I have to accrete in the

00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:41,550
meeting first since I have not yet

00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:42,210
enable zoom to customize your codeine so

00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:45,510
okay

00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:46,770
I wonder should we should we maybe move

00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:50,040
to the next group engage us come back to

00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:53,780
you is that okay yes yeah perfect thank

00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:57,030
you so thank you so I think next we have

00:28:53,780 --> 00:29:00,030
the I think jelly I think you're doing

00:28:57,030 --> 00:29:03,390
the next presentation puzzles to you the

00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:09,300
puzzles - yeah I will try to share my

00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:11,070
screen yeah I'm also disabled all right

00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:22,170
let's see if you have we gave you one

00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:27,120
permission let's see if yours work can

00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:29,429
you see my screen yes perfect so hello

00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,660
everyone so my name is Jessie and ponen

00:29:29,429 --> 00:29:32,460
Baron and I'm here with my teammate

00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:35,460
actually your shadow unkosher will not

00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:37,920
be speaking today it'll just be me so we

00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:40,470
will talk about Zoey out the interactive

00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:43,040
learning experience so just a brief

00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:45,900
introduction Michelle and I are

00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:48,090
mainframe developers so we started our

00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:52,559
career developing mainframe solutions

00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:55,340
using the 3270 terminal so for me I've

00:29:52,559 --> 00:30:00,450
always been fascinated by the idea of

00:29:55,340 --> 00:30:02,490
coding using a terminal so for me this

00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:04,620
coding new single terminal is a very

00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:08,130
old-school and uncommon it it always

00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:10,559
made me feel so special and I remember

00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:11,880
this one one time that there was an

00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:14,010
announcement from our system

00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,650
administrator that they have installed a

00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:16,750
new

00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:20,110
of Kabul and I really thought to myself

00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:21,430
that Wow there are people actively

00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:25,870
enhancing Kabul

00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:26,830
so that actually triggered my thought

00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:31,090
wishes

00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:34,390
what's more out there firming frame so

00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:37,180
as years passed by we ended up here in

00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:40,510
Broadcom and we are are in the engineers

00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:43,360
now for the Zoe Project so everybody

00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:45,550
knows that Zoe's and hosted by opening

00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:47,560
project and it offers modern interfaces

00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:50,050
to interact with address and the goal

00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:54,520
for this project is to make mainframe

00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:56,980
open so through the fascination of the

00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:58,660
3270 terminal I was able to witness

00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:01,330
different kind of technologies being

00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:02,950
developed in this project we know that

00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:06,180
there's a REST API is there IDs

00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:08,680
CLI web desktop and even the mobile

00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:10,690
application so now my fascination

00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:14,140
evolved into something different and

00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:18,280
again I asked this question what's more

00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:22,330
out there for me frame now that I'm

00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:23,890
moving into a senior position the

00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:26,320
thoughts that I have is for the next

00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:28,240
generation of name framers so this next

00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:30,430
generation of developers just like me

00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,890
when I was starting out have new

00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:34,780
knowledge a new perspective and they

00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:38,410
will join soon the mainframe community

00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:41,290
so how can this next generation of

00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:44,560
mainframe workers help improve this

00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:47,050
platform and make it better but moreover

00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:49,450
how can I help how can I help them

00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:49,960
achieve that goal so that's where we

00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:52,570
thought of it

00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:56,650
we thought about Zoe out the interactive

00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:59,380
learning experience so what is it Zoe

00:31:56,650 --> 00:32:01,150
out allows you to learn more about me

00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:02,980
frame so the concept is that it will

00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:05,620
teach you about the different Zoe

00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:08,260
components like what I said the sky deep

00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:09,790
a musician layer the web desktop so the

00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:11,800
vs code extension in the mobile

00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:14,500
application it is in the form of a game

00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:17,140
where there is a self-paced interactive

00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:19,540
tutorial course it's a hands-on

00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:22,240
experience it has step by step guide

00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:25,150
with checkpoints it include links to

00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:26,950
tutorial videos and other resources as

00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:31,029
you can see in the picture

00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:33,669
here it is inspired with the kubernetes

00:32:31,029 --> 00:32:36,279
game of pods and the goal will the goal

00:32:33,669 --> 00:32:42,100
that we have is to make it into a fun

00:32:36,279 --> 00:32:47,710
game and let you ask this question what

00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:50,169
more can I do with mainframe so the

00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:53,799
technology behind this is that we are

00:32:50,169 --> 00:32:56,619
using the ionic framework and the

00:32:53,799 --> 00:32:59,109
angular code base to create the UI in

00:32:56,619 --> 00:33:01,690
the UX for the web application we have

00:32:59,109 --> 00:33:04,029
integrated a different areas API such as

00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:07,299
the YouTube API to access this on online

00:33:04,029 --> 00:33:09,489
videos that is included in the tutorial

00:33:07,299 --> 00:33:11,230
and we plan to integrate or incorporate

00:33:09,489 --> 00:33:14,409
the docker containers to start the

00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:16,330
server's further set SMF mock EP ice so

00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:18,070
basically you have a web web app that

00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:21,220
connects to the docker container and

00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:24,669
it's fired all by EP ice the way pass in

00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:30,820
the YouTube API is I can show a firt

00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:34,929
demo if that's okay so I hope you can

00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:37,169
see the home page that we have so this

00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:40,690
is the home page for the Zowie out and

00:33:37,169 --> 00:33:42,489
in here you have cards and it shows you

00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:43,929
the different components that you can

00:33:42,489 --> 00:33:46,059
learn so for example you want to learn

00:33:43,929 --> 00:33:48,489
the Zowie Explorer so the concept is

00:33:46,059 --> 00:33:51,009
that you have different tasks here and

00:33:48,489 --> 00:33:54,039
you can you have instructions so this is

00:33:51,009 --> 00:33:56,559
my instruction and I will click on it so

00:33:54,039 --> 00:33:58,480
when I'm done for example I will give

00:33:56,559 --> 00:34:01,179
the profile image for example test and

00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:03,850
when I click verify it will fire the

00:34:01,179 --> 00:34:06,669
smoke API stat we would integrate in the

00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:10,629
Indus containers and then if it's ok it

00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:13,059
will activate the next card and so you

00:34:10,629 --> 00:34:15,460
can continue on with your training and

00:34:13,059 --> 00:34:17,349
if you need help we you can click on

00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:19,839
this video and it was now called the

00:34:17,349 --> 00:34:22,530
YouTube service that we have and connect

00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:26,409
you to YouTube so for example this video

00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:33,309
so that's that's the main concept of

00:34:26,409 --> 00:34:35,020
this product so moving forward what will

00:34:33,309 --> 00:34:37,179
be the next furnace project so this

00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:39,280
project is now currently discussed with

00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:40,750
our education team regarding the hosting

00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,760
or regarding the hosting and

00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:44,470
implementation of fresh powder so

00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:46,540
basically we will improve the UI and the

00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:48,370
UX it doesn't look like the game of pads

00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:50,290
that I have showed you earlier so

00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:52,990
hopefully we will be able to improve it

00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:54,639
to make it look like into a very fun

00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:56,110
game and of course the integration of

00:34:54,639 --> 00:35:00,520
this docker containers to start the

00:34:56,110 --> 00:35:04,210
server of this psmf mock api's but to

00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:08,050
summarize what we have what we have

00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:10,330
created is a game for learners and it

00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:13,090
shows you that mainframe is a powerful

00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:15,780
platform and we can really make it even

00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:20,020
more powerful if we combine it with the

00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:22,630
technology that we have 2d in training

00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:25,450
such as such as - as the Soviet can help

00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:27,970
boost that process so I am very excited

00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:30,550
to see what you can come up with when

00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:33,940
you ask this question to yourself what

00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:35,320
more can I do with mean free so that's

00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:39,370
it for my presentation and I would like

00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:42,570
to end it with a short um video that we

00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:42,570
have created for this product

00:35:50,910 --> 00:36:01,900
hey Joey we can't hear the interior so

00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:05,890
maybe I just shared and I don't know how

00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:08,530
to to change it though you could share

00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:11,410
the my recommendation maybe would be to

00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:13,900
share the link in the chat and then

00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:16,990
pause for maybe the appropriate amount

00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:19,360
of time and then you could play yours

00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:23,200
without sound and folks could just click

00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:25,150
the link on that b1 recommendation for I

00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:30,100
will just share the link in the chat

00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:32,260
wait where am I so maybe I'll just stop

00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:33,910
sharing and then I could we could

00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:41,890
continue with the questions while I

00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:48,150
share the link does anyone have any

00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:49,770
questions for this team judges

00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:54,450
shouldn't you want to go first this time

00:36:49,770 --> 00:37:00,420
oh so I'm kind of curious about the

00:36:54,450 --> 00:37:02,160
behind-the-scenes details of what I

00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:04,530
guess two points

00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:06,360
number one is I saw in there that you

00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:10,770
had a doctor container that said fake

00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:13,650
z/osmf and I was kind of curious how far

00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:15,480
you took that idea how did you how did

00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:20,040
you make such a thing and what are its

00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:23,100
capabilities so that docker container

00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:26,540
was inspired from the Zoey hackathon

00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:29,790
that we have from with actually now also

00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:33,020
donated to Zoey so one of our colleagues

00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:35,940
PETA created this Zoey on the her and

00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:41,010
because of that we were he was able to

00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:44,030
create zsm affixed at SMF api's and from

00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:47,040
that we were inspired as well with

00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:49,380
Heroku app and we know that we can

00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:51,870
create mock api's and using his

00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:54,690
technology for putting Zoey in the car

00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:57,660
you can combine this this technology

00:37:54,690 --> 00:38:01,250
and/or this idea to make this to

00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:04,410
integrate it into what we have right now

00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:07,200
right because I guess my point is that I

00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:11,340
see I see a future in doing more of that

00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:13,890
we have some interns currently and not

00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:16,170
all of them have mainframe access as of

00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:18,360
today and so having that sort of thing

00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:23,850
is a great idea I think we should do it

00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:28,200
for every piece of Zoey or z/os that

00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:32,040
that people can't get quick access to so

00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:35,160
the other question that I had was about

00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:39,830
the front end so in in the video that I

00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:43,470
saw you had a bunch of clickable links

00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:45,030
and I guess the video didn't really show

00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:47,430
that much about what was in the links

00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:50,040
but can you can you go over like the

00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:56,990
feature set that you had done so far and

00:38:50,040 --> 00:39:01,280
and how much you wanted to do if you had

00:38:56,990 --> 00:39:03,440
continued the project so

00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:06,080
our work we are playing with the ionic

00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:10,520
framework and so far what we have

00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:12,320
created are our ion cards

00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:20,570
so this ion cars just like what you have

00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:24,260
seen I can I can share it again so these

00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:29,090
eigen cards um that is part of the ionic

00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:32,500
framework but basically what with what

00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:38,870
we did is that it is incorporating

00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:41,930
angular conditions so I know how to

00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:44,660
explain but anyways but we what we have

00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:46,730
done is that when when I when I think

00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:49,900
it's already put there ng comments

00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:53,180
that's that's incorporated there and

00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:56,620
what I just have done is that create a

00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:59,960
condition where if I sub I submit this

00:39:56,620 --> 00:40:02,420
verify that it will it will then disable

00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:06,800
the next card but so far we have been

00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:11,870
playing with the UX and stuff cool so so

00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:13,670
like what what's the scope that you've

00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:17,660
done so far like we've got the Explorer

00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:20,450
here and we've got four items how much

00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:28,930
coverage do you think you have of Zoe so

00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:31,490
far so we have Zoe expire for for now

00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:36,020
regarding this one so we focus on just

00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:39,830
one component and hopefully you will be

00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:42,200
able to focus on more in the future yeah

00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:44,420
yeah that would be my thought is it

00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:47,510
looks like you might have the beginning

00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:50,090
of something that could be I don't know

00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:53,240
maybe crowd-sourced that I could imagine

00:40:50,090 --> 00:40:57,110
a documentation team working with the

00:40:53,240 --> 00:41:00,800
developers to whenever a new features

00:40:57,110 --> 00:41:03,440
added add a new item to this list so

00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:08,630
that could be I could see a good feature

00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:11,120
in that yeah we are yeah we for me

00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:13,700
personally I wanted scenarios as well to

00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:15,109
I wanted to let's say what do you said

00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:17,959
crowdsource or two

00:41:15,109 --> 00:41:20,089
gather more scenarios and then we could

00:41:17,959 --> 00:41:21,799
we could create like from the four

00:41:20,089 --> 00:41:24,109
different personas like for application

00:41:21,799 --> 00:41:25,759
developers there is a specific one that

00:41:24,109 --> 00:41:27,859
they are going to do or meet for a

00:41:25,759 --> 00:41:31,400
couple developers I don't know but yeah

00:41:27,859 --> 00:41:38,089
what would you say this skirt cool okay

00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:39,650
so that's all of my questions yeah Mike

00:41:38,089 --> 00:41:43,099
if you don't mind I think I might just

00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:45,680
jump in here I so so I think it looks

00:41:43,099 --> 00:41:48,890
great I love I love the the the sense of

00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:50,809
fun that you've tried to inject into

00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:53,380
this in the sense of you know sort of

00:41:50,809 --> 00:41:57,109
gamifying it and and trying to sort of

00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:58,999
make that that learning process sort of

00:41:57,109 --> 00:42:02,390
more entertaining I think there's a ton

00:41:58,999 --> 00:42:05,359
of potential here I'm interested in and

00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:06,769
you touched on it very briefly when in

00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:09,259
your previous answer to Sean I'm

00:42:06,769 --> 00:42:12,529
interested in in the persona here and in

00:42:09,259 --> 00:42:15,799
who you're actually targeting this at so

00:42:12,529 --> 00:42:17,959
it's you you talk about a learner you

00:42:15,799 --> 00:42:20,239
know in your presentation so so I wonder

00:42:17,959 --> 00:42:22,249
if you could if you could expand a

00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:23,930
little bit on that and just just just

00:42:22,249 --> 00:42:26,630
talk a little bit about sort of the

00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:29,269
level of experience that the person will

00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:31,880
be required as they jump into this and

00:42:29,269 --> 00:42:35,779
and sort of where you think they'd get

00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:38,420
to you know once they complete it and

00:42:35,779 --> 00:42:41,449
also linked to that is is there an idea

00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:44,779
of a of progression I'm you know so in

00:42:41,449 --> 00:42:45,979
in most games you often start easy and

00:42:44,779 --> 00:42:48,109
then it gets harder and harder and

00:42:45,979 --> 00:42:50,089
harder and I and I wonder if if you gave

00:42:48,109 --> 00:42:50,509
that some consideration here for what

00:42:50,089 --> 00:42:53,959
you've done

00:42:50,509 --> 00:42:58,099
yes definitely so the first initially

00:42:53,959 --> 00:43:00,410
the idea that we have is that it will

00:42:58,099 --> 00:43:03,829
target new developers or it will target

00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:05,690
this next generation of main framers

00:43:03,829 --> 00:43:07,519
that they wanted to learn mainframe but

00:43:05,690 --> 00:43:09,829
they can use they can learn easily

00:43:07,519 --> 00:43:14,269
through what i went connecting to me

00:43:09,829 --> 00:43:17,420
frame but because of what happened to to

00:43:14,269 --> 00:43:20,420
the Cobble corset or how how it expanded

00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:23,180
now for me that's why I said learners is

00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:26,119
that it's not limited to new generations

00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:29,319
but it's it's for everyone for everybody

00:43:26,119 --> 00:43:29,319
who wants to learn

00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:35,340
so it's for beginners or for mainframe

00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:41,250
experts who wanted to try out this

00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:44,160
modern mainframe interface and it I like

00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:48,330
the idea because it gave it gave me a

00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:50,750
very wide range of audience and a very

00:43:48,330 --> 00:43:54,420
wide range of personas as well and

00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:57,240
scenarios that I can tackle and I like

00:43:54,420 --> 00:44:00,150
what what your question so we have

00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:05,370
thought about it so one thing that we

00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:07,740
wanted is like this achievements so yes

00:44:05,370 --> 00:44:10,800
I agree with you with in terms of

00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:13,290
progression like for you have this

00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:15,690
levels like level one level two and when

00:44:13,290 --> 00:44:18,330
when you finish a level you will go to

00:44:15,690 --> 00:44:20,640
the next level like maybe there's a boss

00:44:18,330 --> 00:44:24,120
battle I don't know but there will be

00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:27,000
like achievements or badges so similar

00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:28,890
to for example duolingo that if you

00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,480
finish one level you can have a badge

00:44:28,890 --> 00:44:32,790
that you have finished this one and then

00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:35,670
you can next you can go to the next path

00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:38,250
so that is something that we surely have

00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:41,100
thought about and have been planning for

00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:43,140
the future in the gaming world that's

00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:45,450
that's critical to sort of drive the

00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:47,400
virality of a game and also to increase

00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:49,110
the engagement with users so so

00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:52,830
definitely something to consider yeah

00:44:49,110 --> 00:44:54,120
yeah but great job thanks cool well

00:44:52,830 --> 00:44:56,250
thank you all for the feedback again if

00:44:54,120 --> 00:45:01,380
you've sought questions you can chime in

00:44:56,250 --> 00:45:03,480
to the QA we want to switch over here to

00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:05,280
our last presenter who's song I don't

00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:10,470
know if you've got your stuff all

00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:12,720
situated yes can you pay me now yes and

00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:14,490
it looks like you're presenting so

00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:18,200
that's or at least we see you're see you

00:45:14,490 --> 00:45:18,200
we don't see your screen yet

00:45:31,110 --> 00:45:38,530
you see my screen ah yes looks great

00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:42,280
hey let me introduce some of our ideas

00:45:38,530 --> 00:45:45,840
actually our do you is it true creative

00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:49,830
and get you plugging in for SMU let me

00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:53,350
have a look at the idea background uh as

00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:57,820
mu means services IBM service Emily main

00:45:53,350 --> 00:46:00,460
unite use of my IBM free product with

00:45:57,820 --> 00:46:04,030
the user custom customizable modern web

00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:07,240
- a web dashboard actually it will

00:46:04,030 --> 00:46:09,520
consume data from many given up in

00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:11,590
products for example see tomorrow

00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:16,210
meeting uncommon wooden table scheduler

00:46:11,590 --> 00:46:20,590
and maybe net view actually SME are be

00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:26,050
integrated with the zoey 101 years ago

00:46:20,590 --> 00:46:28,270
but it is indeed integrator as a three i

00:46:26,050 --> 00:46:30,250
from prag in nasa either cannot and

00:46:28,270 --> 00:46:33,550
every day both offer three features for

00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:35,740
example native user experience

00:46:33,550 --> 00:46:36,840
application to application communication

00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:39,880
[Music]

00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:42,160
the third point is that he is a very

00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:46,060
easy implement you know a very

00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:49,150
compressed way firstly it is a piston -

00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:51,070
and I eat a different components usually

00:46:49,150 --> 00:46:54,670
implemented in different APIs such as

00:46:51,070 --> 00:46:57,880
the some is implemented in chat ve dojo

00:46:54,670 --> 00:47:03,850
and garages others may be implemented

00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:06,130
based on TDI that is awesome my and it

00:47:03,850 --> 00:47:09,300
also only suffered a career as you know

00:47:06,130 --> 00:47:13,500
it only can consume curiously API so

00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:16,270
based on this laser we want to implement

00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:18,880
did you do you plug in for some you

00:47:16,270 --> 00:47:25,630
actually we've already implemented to a

00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:26,560
point the first point is that we have to

00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:30,160
create one

00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:34,210
configurable angular UI widget based on

00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:37,420
IP ma carbon and Apogee each has these

00:47:34,210 --> 00:47:41,079
most of user wanted functions of

00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:45,369
customer the customer customisation page

00:47:41,079 --> 00:47:49,710
so we have we have to create one UI

00:47:45,369 --> 00:47:52,270
widget and I've already not first

00:47:49,710 --> 00:47:55,720
actually we've already creature four

00:47:52,270 --> 00:47:58,299
with five five widgets the first two

00:47:55,720 --> 00:48:01,359
either people with the pagination pice

00:47:58,299 --> 00:48:05,700
heart nice hot bachata and also auto

00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:09,069
refresh the timer second away implement

00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:11,859
its main that you plug in prototype with

00:48:09,069 --> 00:48:14,500
the following with some features for

00:48:11,859 --> 00:48:17,980
example we we can customize the horror

00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:22,599
horror page via Jason convenient file

00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:26,140
and of it and then we also implement

00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:30,520
some plug-in to plug in communication to

00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:34,020
the tag and also can consume some data

00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:37,690
from I see an uncommon actually we

00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:40,240
indeed the Pratap we can consume three

00:48:37,690 --> 00:48:44,920
kind of three credit we can take her

00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:47,559
some metadata from different given in

00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:51,130
place for example REST API career stem

00:48:47,559 --> 00:48:54,730
query yesterday API maybe um idea and

00:48:51,130 --> 00:48:56,770
also just in fire also in a club and I

00:48:54,730 --> 00:48:58,900
see the support you know our idea

00:48:56,770 --> 00:49:04,930
so we've already implemented this kind

00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:08,770
of a Pratap per type they say happen

00:49:04,930 --> 00:49:12,700
okay I think of each other here this is

00:49:08,770 --> 00:49:15,130
the file which it get a package of

00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:18,630
either with us either can be current

00:49:15,130 --> 00:49:22,210
configure mais oui

00:49:18,630 --> 00:49:25,270
Jason we ingest and fire the second one

00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:27,970
is the SME to meet you they were the

00:49:25,270 --> 00:49:30,579
literature as impure plugin pages that a

00:49:27,970 --> 00:49:35,349
creator with the jason community fire so

00:49:30,579 --> 00:49:40,780
user can create a buncha fire and there

00:49:35,349 --> 00:49:44,020
are some descriptions descriptions in

00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:47,920
the file for the pages and now along

00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:50,980
with the widget which is then after he

00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:53,820
start we started the plug-in or

00:49:50,980 --> 00:50:02,010
is i refresh the with the new completion

00:49:53,820 --> 00:50:02,010
so let's have a look at the is that

00:50:02,339 --> 00:50:07,560
Casey please deliver is me applying in

00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:18,180
detail and she I'll just be here

00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:21,640
actually our switches and fire critic

00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:23,859
could be here we could read my new PG

00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:33,970
first of reaching the time later Justin

00:50:23,859 --> 00:50:38,460
fire and also I week we copy one your UI

00:50:33,970 --> 00:50:38,460
are here and a picture in death sauce

00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:49,570
then clock then copy some some correct

00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:53,530
some properties to describe the water

00:50:49,570 --> 00:50:58,150
which it to be display here see with the

00:50:53,530 --> 00:51:02,160
fire and then loading we load in the

00:50:58,150 --> 00:51:11,260
plugin you can find one page is created

00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:15,819
with the new widget we also continue the

00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:18,849
which widget on the art for example we

00:51:15,819 --> 00:51:22,589
are the which column and which hero the

00:51:18,849 --> 00:51:22,589
visitor will be displayed

00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:43,740
you can find it at the fidgety either

00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:46,550
mooch move down this we'll move on to

00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:49,560
next page here we are display how to

00:51:46,550 --> 00:51:52,800
what are we implemented for application

00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:56,300
to application communication fun little

00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:59,190
page did however look at other that

00:51:56,300 --> 00:52:03,839
first day we launched first as meal plan

00:51:59,190 --> 00:52:06,300
as immunity plugin then we click APB to

00:52:03,839 --> 00:52:08,940
AVP - naughty another one

00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:13,500
it is a plugin we are launching another

00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:17,550
page in first plug-in the veggies on gum

00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:20,369
plugin you can found when you pee on

00:52:17,550 --> 00:52:34,920
your PT Omega minion you launched in the

00:52:20,369 --> 00:52:37,950
first plug-in so this arm for our ideas

00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:40,550
he suggests a one for type of our for

00:52:37,950 --> 00:52:40,550
our ideas

00:52:45,369 --> 00:52:51,460
any comment great thank you so much

00:52:49,109 --> 00:52:53,380
judges we'll have a few moments for you

00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:55,210
to all chime in I just want to remind to

00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:57,219
everyone that all of these recordings

00:52:55,210 --> 00:52:59,739
will be up on YouTube in the next couple

00:52:57,219 --> 00:53:01,089
days so you can watch them in there as

00:52:59,739 --> 00:53:02,710
well but I wouldn't open to the floor to

00:53:01,089 --> 00:53:04,359
the judges for a few minutes for any

00:53:02,710 --> 00:53:09,279
comments and and anything else to share

00:53:04,359 --> 00:53:10,619
via the QA okay okay do you mind if I go

00:53:09,279 --> 00:53:15,359
first

00:53:10,619 --> 00:53:19,690
go ahead okay so this is pretty cool

00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:22,119
what I'm curious about is what was SMU

00:53:19,690 --> 00:53:29,259
written in before you started to convert

00:53:22,119 --> 00:53:32,019
it to angular sorry can you do Christian

00:53:29,259 --> 00:53:36,039
so right now you're making a Zoey native

00:53:32,019 --> 00:53:39,089
angular app what was SMU before that was

00:53:36,039 --> 00:53:43,630
it like dojo or react or something

00:53:39,089 --> 00:53:48,479
actually I think a week let me go to go

00:53:43,630 --> 00:53:54,910
back after my last actually SMU is a

00:53:48,479 --> 00:53:58,390
implementation given the tech spec based

00:53:54,910 --> 00:54:00,219
on - some party is implementing to you

00:53:58,390 --> 00:54:02,979
and another party is implementing

00:54:00,219 --> 00:54:10,509
angularjs and some other party is

00:54:02,979 --> 00:54:15,329
implemented in assembly 9 so yes many so

00:54:10,509 --> 00:54:18,369
so basically you are not only making a

00:54:15,329 --> 00:54:20,650
native desktop application in angular

00:54:18,369 --> 00:54:24,210
but you're also sort of cleaning up the

00:54:20,650 --> 00:54:25,839
codebase by making it all annular now

00:54:24,210 --> 00:54:32,859
right uh-huh

00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:37,599
that's that's pretty cool so what sort

00:54:32,859 --> 00:54:39,910
of app tap communication do you envision

00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:45,369
for the future I saw your demo where you

00:54:39,910 --> 00:54:48,119
had app tap communication for two of SMU

00:54:45,369 --> 00:54:50,829
but do you think that there might be

00:54:48,119 --> 00:54:53,400
features that you would want people to

00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:55,809
use an SMU that you would publish

00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:57,869
documentation saying if you do this call

00:54:55,809 --> 00:54:59,620
SMU will display this thing for you

00:54:57,869 --> 00:55:02,710
actually

00:54:59,620 --> 00:55:06,400
actually yeah if we want to implement

00:55:02,710 --> 00:55:09,100
that in our feature that way we are

00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:10,420
leveraging the application to

00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:12,670
application communication features

00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:14,350
provided by the Lee to launch it

00:55:12,670 --> 00:55:21,550
different I do apply the interest such

00:55:14,350 --> 00:55:26,020
as TM 323 to 770 and maybe I said maybe

00:55:21,550 --> 00:55:29,770
what would happen and maybe JSA Explorer

00:55:26,020 --> 00:55:34,170
I might see his profile from an SME sure

00:55:29,770 --> 00:55:36,490
I think if we can launch it done

00:55:34,170 --> 00:55:38,650
according the current chair can have two

00:55:36,490 --> 00:55:41,920
data I think I use a very very

00:55:38,650 --> 00:55:44,440
meaningful for user another thing I'm

00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:47,740
curious about is as you are improving

00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:51,850
the front end the back end

00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:54,670
SMU server have you have you had any

00:55:51,850 --> 00:55:56,920
thoughts around getting it registered

00:55:54,670 --> 00:56:00,310
with the mediation layer or making it

00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:07,630
work with us or so yes we plan to the

00:56:00,310 --> 00:56:11,020
dead cool so yeah this is it looks like

00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:12,910
you are finding the right ways to do

00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:16,210
things in the desktop which is good news

00:56:12,910 --> 00:56:17,950
I like what I see here but I guess I'll

00:56:16,210 --> 00:56:22,060
turn it over to others for more

00:56:17,950 --> 00:56:26,010
questions yes yesterday I think that the

00:56:22,060 --> 00:56:30,000
most customers I want like the custom

00:56:26,010 --> 00:56:34,630
customization the PD customization

00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:36,640
features so we either way when to that's

00:56:34,630 --> 00:56:40,150
the reason why we created this kind of

00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:43,560
idea and I created I'm implementer one

00:56:40,150 --> 00:56:43,560
prototype for that

00:56:45,859 --> 00:57:09,680
I maybe have a question here so the

00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:11,660
other looks I'll echo what Sean said it

00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:12,200
looks quite impressive what you've done

00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:14,299
here

00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:16,400
I just just wondered I mean there was

00:57:14,299 --> 00:57:21,890
there's a lot you could have done how

00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:23,989
did you when you started at the

00:57:21,890 --> 00:57:26,420
beginning of the hackathon how did you

00:57:23,989 --> 00:57:31,670
come to a decision around the scope and

00:57:26,420 --> 00:57:33,709
what you would focus on we what are we

00:57:31,670 --> 00:57:37,160
focused on you suggest accreta

00:57:33,709 --> 00:57:42,729
one prototype prototype and to verify

00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:42,729
what whether our idea is in either

00:57:42,849 --> 00:57:51,229
perceptible by a managed many many human

00:57:46,069 --> 00:57:52,519
team what would be your next step where

00:57:51,229 --> 00:57:56,180
do you see it where do you see

00:57:52,519 --> 00:57:59,749
yourselves taking this next our next

00:57:56,180 --> 00:58:03,910
step or maybe we talked about it with

00:57:59,749 --> 00:58:09,619
the management team and asking them to

00:58:03,910 --> 00:58:13,069
margarita the you attached to the trip

00:58:09,619 --> 00:58:15,529
is on Louie and atop of a single tech

00:58:13,069 --> 00:58:18,039
stack for example angular angular

00:58:15,529 --> 00:58:18,039
angular

00:58:24,089 --> 00:58:31,019
thank you for your presentation thanks

00:58:28,439 --> 00:58:34,469
I'll just maybe ask one more question I

00:58:31,019 --> 00:58:35,939
guess I'll be the question or bookend so

00:58:34,469 --> 00:58:39,089
I asked the first question I guess I'll

00:58:35,939 --> 00:58:41,369
ask the last one here so could you just

00:58:39,089 --> 00:58:46,709
elaborate on your experience in

00:58:41,369 --> 00:58:49,439
leveraging Zoey and how you found how

00:58:46,709 --> 00:58:51,660
you how difficult it was sort of to

00:58:49,439 --> 00:58:54,869
integrate with the Zoey application

00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:58,969
framework and you know get integrated in

00:58:54,869 --> 00:59:04,519
the Zoey solution I think he's not

00:58:58,969 --> 00:59:08,189
sincere we are developer and adopts the

00:59:04,519 --> 00:59:12,299
being modern languages not unlike some

00:59:08,189 --> 00:59:18,209
guy on the West so we don't think he's

00:59:12,299 --> 00:59:20,789
not a certificate of us to true you tend

00:59:18,209 --> 00:59:25,229
to Zoey and are you implemented some

00:59:20,789 --> 00:59:27,239
ideas on the Wii platform all right

00:59:25,229 --> 00:59:36,119
excellent thank you and thank you for

00:59:27,239 --> 00:59:37,259
your presentation y'all become great

00:59:36,119 --> 00:59:39,329
well thank you all very much for

00:59:37,259 --> 00:59:43,319
attending I see we're just passing into

00:59:39,329 --> 00:59:45,059
the hours so like I mentioned all of

00:59:43,319 --> 00:59:46,739
these recordings will be up on YouTube

00:59:45,059 --> 00:59:50,160
here within the next couple days and

00:59:46,739 --> 00:59:52,739
we'll send links out and follow-ups to

00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:54,209
all the attendees and registrants to let

00:59:52,739 --> 00:59:56,549
them know what that's live and also look

00:59:54,209 --> 00:59:58,709
on our social channels for links as well

00:59:56,549 --> 01:00:01,469
thank you everybody thank you for the

00:59:58,709 --> 01:00:03,660
panelists thank you for all the teams

01:00:01,469 --> 01:00:06,049
