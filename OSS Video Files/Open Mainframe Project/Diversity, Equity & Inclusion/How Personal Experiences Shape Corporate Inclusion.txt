Title: How Personal Experiences Shape Corporate Inclusion
Publication date: 2021-04-30
Playlist: Diversity, Equity & Inclusion
Description: 
	When we join companies, we bring our experiences—societal, cultural, spiritual, familial— with us. These experiences then create personas within the company that contribute to the collective personality of the organization.

In this video,  you'll hear personal stories and histories of colleagues across the mainframe community to reveal how experiences influence “company culture” and shape corporate inclusion. Panelists include:

- Ashley Peterson, product marketing manager, IBM Z and LinuxONE, IBM
- Jeff Henry, vice president, Product Management and Design, Mainframe Software Division, Broadcom
- Sharra Owens-Schwartz, inclusion, diversity and equity senior director, Rocket Software
- Jerry Chuaypradit, manager, IBM Z Enterprise Networking Solutions, IBM
- Moderator: Dr. Gloria Chance, president/CEO, The Mousai Group

diversity equity and inclusion the

00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:45,520
collaboration is inspired by a question

00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:48,480
to mainframe leaders about diversity

00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,559
what are you doing about it we kicked

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,079
off this initiative with our 2020

00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:53,760
webinar

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,360
frame executives are investing in

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,879
diversity and inclusion

00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,199
and today we're continuing the

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:01,280
conversation featuring the diverse

00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,800
personal stories of colleagues in the

00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,439
mainframe community

00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,600
revealing how we each influence company

00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:09,760
culture

00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,640
one collective takeaway that we can

00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,760
share today

00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,920
may i suggest is this that challenging

00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,720
the biases we see in each other

00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,880
is the first step to real inclusivity

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,159
unlocking the potential of people

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:26,000
and therefore our teams and companies we

00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,159
are thrilled for you to meet our special

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,920

00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:33,040
like to turn this over now to dr

00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,759
gloria chance dr chance hi

00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,600
lisa thank you so much and good morning

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,640
good afternoon to everyone

00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:43,119
and welcome to our second panel on how

00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,720
personal experiences shape culprit

00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:47,119
corporate inclusion

00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,119
and today as lisa mentioned we are

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:52,720
continuing the conversation

00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:56,000
uh revealing how each of us influence

00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:58,000
our company culture hello again i'm dr

00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,399
gloria chancher moderator i'm a

00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,680
psychologist and founder and ceo of the

00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,399
moosai group

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,799
and i think we'll all agree that we're

00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,080
in an intense state of transition and

00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,800
change today

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,599
not just from a global from a country

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:16,640
organizational perspective but also

00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:17,760
a personal and individual perspective

00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,160
and i think

00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,400
you will agree that we all realize that

00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,280
this diversity equity and inclusion

00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,760
journey

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,879
it's not a light switch that we can turn

00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,280
off and on

00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,640
it's an actual journey and our sponsor

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,080
companies today

00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:35,920
rocket software ibm broadcom

00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,319
mainframe the broadcom mainframe

00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,720
software team virtual z

00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:42,160
tech channel and the open mainframe

00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,959
project are each

00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,879
on their individual company journeys and

00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,120
honoring the fact

00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,959
just like we're here today you know on

00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,480
the panel representing it that it's not

00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,040
where you start

00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,959
but that you start this dialogue and the

00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,440
journey wherever you are

00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:01,519
and so this panel today is produced to

00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,080
help leaders and others

00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,959
understand how lived experiences

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,760
influence

00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,840
culture and i stand and i believe that

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,800
the panelists and the sponsors stand

00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,680
with me in this middle space to create

00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,879
empathy

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:19,599
learning hope and regeneration

00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,400
in how we think about and behave on this

00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,440
topic

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,480
of inclusivity what does being included

00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,879
mean

00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,080
it means that individuals feel that they

00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:31,440
belong

00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:34,720
that they're involved integrated

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,879
incorporated embraced

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,680
and taken in by the company and

00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:42,879
organizations that they support

00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,280
a may 2020 report from mckenzie company

00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,400
found

00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:49,680
that while overall employee sentiment on

00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:52,959
corporate diversity was 52 positive

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,840
and 31 percent negative the sentiment on

00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:57,120
inclusion

00:03:53,840 --> 00:04:00,319
was markedly worse at 29

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,519
positive and 61 negative and what does

00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,439
this mean

00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,280
this means that while companies are on

00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,560
the journey of getting diverse

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,360
representation

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,400
into their organizations it's not going

00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,920
to work

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,840
if people do not feel included if you

00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,239
not if you do not feel included then you

00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,199
will leave the organization

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:22,400
and why because culture is built by

00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,479
people

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,360
culture is a way of life for groups of

00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:29,840
people it's the way we do things

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,520
and it's an integrated pattern of

00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:35,280
knowledge belief

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:37,120
our outlooks our attitudes values goals

00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,199
and customs that we share and

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,560
unfortunately for some of us

00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:45,440
we're not a part of that sharing and so

00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,560
we know in psychology that behavior and

00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,840
thinking

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,759
drives climate so where do our attitudes

00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,440
and behavior come from

00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,759
many people don't know that they come

00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,840
from our personal mythology

00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,840
and personal mythologies are stories

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,800
that we tell ourselves when we're

00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,680
growing up

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,440
to make sense and meaning in the world

00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,160
it's the story that we live

00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,000
out through our human experience and we

00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,560
get our messaging from our parents

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,120
and our grandparents and the societies

00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,759
that we grew up in as children

00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,800
and it becomes our mindset that drives

00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,840
our decisions

00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:25,360
our thinking and our behavior within

00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:27,280
organizations and most of the time

00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,600
you know one of our panelists said i

00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:32,639
think it was ashley she said so greatly

00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,720
in her story in her story card she said

00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:37,520
you know this year there have been less

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:40,240
there has been less separation from work

00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,720
and family life than ever before and the

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,880
re

00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,639
the reality everyone is that there's

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,039
never been a separation

00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,039
because how do we bring part of us to

00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:51,039
work and leave the other part at home

00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,320
and that's why in a lot of ways we're

00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,240
inauthentic

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,759
and we're also unconscious about the

00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,680
ways that we're treating people and

00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,560
we're making people become

00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,080
included and so today our panelists

00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,680
they've done their work

00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,600
they've gone on a journey with me to

00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,479
understand their unconscious bias in

00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:11,199
their personal mythology to understand

00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,400
how their personal lived experiences

00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,800
have created

00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,319
who they are at work in their

00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,000
organizations and how that

00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,240
impacts whether or not they feel

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,479
included excluded

00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,000
and how they can make a difference in

00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:27,199
their organizations

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,720
by focusing more on inclusion so let's

00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:31,919
get let's get started

00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:34,080
by meeting our esteemed panelists and

00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:36,080
why don't we go ahead and acknowledge i

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,440
want to acknowledge that these panels

00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,440
are very brave

00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,360
and i want to commend them for sharing

00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,560
their stories because i have to ask the

00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:46,240

and togetherness through their personal

thank you shara jerry jeff and ashley

00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,759
and so now

00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:03,680
let's let's begin our storytelling by

00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,840
sharing some of the basics so we already

00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,280
established a personal myths or stories

00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,960
that we tell ourselves

00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,440
to make sense of the world and they're

00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,960
formed early in our childhood and from

00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,680
our experiences and

00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,000
what's happening in society at the time

00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,840
so

00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,680
these are the stories that begin to

00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,000
create our mindset so let's start with

00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,919
you

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,560
jeff tell us a little bit about your

00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:26,479
early background and how you grew up

00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,560
yeah i was lucky enough to grow up in

00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:29,919
the northern virginia area at least from

00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,560
like 8th grade on

00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:34,320
and before that i had moved from western

00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,120
maryland and northern virginia is much

00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,200
more diverse

00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,240
more transient i mean just in our

00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,240
cul-de-sac

00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,240
it's a black family up the street a

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,560
couple of jewish families a hispanic

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,200
family an asian family around the corner

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,920
transplants from philly from the midwest

00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,959
just a real

00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,880
mix of backgrounds in fact our our

00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,640
probably highlight was when the

00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,080
all-pro safety for the washington

00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,959
football team moved in

00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,399
and was the last person on my paper

00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,480
route so i got to

00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,160
meet all of them personally and it just

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,880
opened up my mind and more of my

00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:09,519
curiosity to diverse thought

00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:12,000
that's pretty cool um ashley your

00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:14,800
background though contrast with jeff's

00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,160
how so yeah so i actually grew up in

00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,760
michigan in the midwest

00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,600
um until i was about 10 and then moved

00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,519
to northern illinois and then my family

00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,480
moved to the south to north carolina

00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,680
where i'm based today so my perspective

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,600
being from kind of

00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,040
the rural midwest and then suburban

00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,120
south i just had

00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,640
not a lot of exposure to diversity and

00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,480
inclusion it wasn't something that i

00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:37,600
really thought about or had exposure to

00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:39,680
so um i didn't really in influence that

00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,279
or have any um opinion on it until i

00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,360
went to college and met more people who

00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:45,519
had different perspectives than me

00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,000
thank you ashley and jerry from the

00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,959
midwest experience of ashley and the

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,519
southern

00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:53,680
of jeff and some of ashley you're from

00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,880
new york city so share your upbringing

00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,560
and background

00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,920
yeah thanks uh yeah let me take you on a

00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:01,440
journey to the northeast

00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:04,320
um i'm very proud of my roots i was born

00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,320
in the bronx new york spent a good part

00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,000
of my childhood there and my family

00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,760
moved us to a town just north of the

00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,720
bronx called yonkers new york when i was

00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,720
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,480
and i'm proud of of where i'm from

00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,800
because i was able to grow up in

00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,839
essentially what is the melting pot of

00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:22,240
of america but yet like most immigrant

00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:24,480
families my parents wanted to be

00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,399
around folks who looked like them who

00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,560
spoke like them who sounded like them

00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,680
so i grew up in a relatively insular

00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,040
community

00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,360
but you know being in that part of new

00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,320
york um my parents could only shelter me

00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,480
for so long and

00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,360
as you can imagine i had friends

00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,279
neighbors from

00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,480
all walks of life different backgrounds

00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,079
different races

00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,560
it was a very formative upbringing for

00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:46,240
me and i'm thankful for it

00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,680
oh thank you for that jerry and i'm from

00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,519
brooklyn and i don't know if you know

00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,880
this but yonkers the people in brooklyn

00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,920
don't really consider that like

00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,200
new york per se but i'm just saying

00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,600
yeah a lot of people said like why are

00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:00,320
you moving upstate it's like exactly

00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,079
into the next town up exactly and

00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,880
finally thank you for that jerry finally

00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:06,480
shara

00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:09,600
i'll share your background please uh yes

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:13,120
i also grew up in in the northeast um

00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:16,160
except i grew up in boston and

00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,279
in contrast if anyone knows the boston

00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,640
area

00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:23,519
they know that the communities in boston

00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,000
are really segregated and they continue

00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,560
to be

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,480
to today um with the exception of

00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,480
gentrification that's happening now

00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,920
growing up there were places in the city

00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,360
where

00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:39,279
i just was not welcome i grew up in a

00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,519
political family with a strong

00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:44,800
orientation toward justice

00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:46,560
inclusion equity and

00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,839
i understood how important

00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:51,200
representation

00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:53,519
was my parents made sure that i was

00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,680
equipped with the tools to navigate as a

00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:58,240
black girl who would then grow up to be

00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,760
a black woman that meant that

00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,480
conversations about

00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,720
race racism and all the other inequities

00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:08,240
were staples in my family

00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:10,079
and i not only had a strong family

00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,279
that supported me and gave me what i

00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:14,160
needed

00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,720
i was also loved and guided by extended

00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,600
family

00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,760
and community um where i lived which was

00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:22,480
predominantly black

00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:25,040
um you know i expected to be corrected

00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:28,800
by my friend's mama down the street

00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:32,000
and i felt as if people believed in me

00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:35,279
and wanted the best for me and

00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,079
in my village of my family

00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:39,040
where i lived my extended family i felt

00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:42,560
a real

00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:44,399
sense of safety sure and that's a really

00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,160
interesting perspective and i think all

00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,800
of the pamslet panelists thank you for

00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,880
sharing

00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:51,360
very different backgrounds some

00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:53,360
similarities some differences and

00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,639
part of the this journey that we all

00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,600
went on uh

00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,800
together and individually it also you

00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,440
know sort of uh

00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:03,600
called out the fact that most people

00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,519
don't fit the stereotypes

00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,040
that people have in their minds about

00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,760
people um

00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,800
so when we look at some experiences that

00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,959
you've had jeff

00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,720
growing up can you share a little bit

00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,880
about um

00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,920
some of the unconscious bias and things

00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,760
that you

00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:22,639
um experienced growing up you know you

00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:26,399
did you described being isolated

00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:28,240
uh uh somewhat uh

00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,320
based on the fact that you were in a

00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,639
pretty diverse environment

00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,680
sure happy to uh so i mean even in the

00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,760
diverse environment i

00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,920
grew up in i was once chased in high

00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:40,320
school simply by a bunch of white kids

00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:43,519
just because i had a black friend

00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:46,240
and to me this was very odd i was

00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:48,399
surrounded by different backgrounds

00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,839
they folks brought a different way of

00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,160
thinking that made me expand

00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:54,320
my thoughts i wanted to surround myself

00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,120
with that to submerge myself into that

00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,160
that learning

00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,040
expand my thinking and for example is

00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,639
you know i would go to

00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,320
different concerts certainly different

00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,120
than what my parents grew up listening

00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,920
to

00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,120
i would go and then be invited to family

00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,920
gatherings or

00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:13,440
or picnics church picnics where i was

00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:15,040
one of a handful at most of white people

00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,519
and i remember you know i would be

00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:19,199
teased maybe bullied a little bit at

00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,760
least at some of the concerts

00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:23,600
but i remember thinking wow this must be

00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:26,079
what it feels like

00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,120
the difference being i was there for

00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,880
entertainment

00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,199
i was there for a couple hours of my

00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,760
life i had to step back and think about

00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,639
it that

00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,920
this is the way that some of you feel

00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:37,680
all of your lives

00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,000
this is what you feel like in the

00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,279
education environment that you go to get

00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,680
an education

00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:45,440
where you go to get a job it was really

00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,560
humbling to me to really step back and

00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,399
think about it from a different

00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,920
perspective

00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:52,320
thank you for that jeff so you had a

00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:54,399
choice so you're saying that in your

00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,920
isolation feeling or your isolated

00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:57,839
feeling that you had a choice

00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,959
you could step in and step out of that

00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:02,399
environment

00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:04,399
uh when as you wanted to but char

00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,320
you had a similar experience of

00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,560
isolation but it wasn't

00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:11,040
you didn't really get to choose can you

00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:14,959
share more about your experience

00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:17,600
yes absolutely so my parents did

00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:18,680
a brilliant job of preparing me for what

00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,680
to expect in

00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:25,199
interpersonal interactions and engaging

00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:28,240
with systems and institutions

00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:31,440
yet all of that preparation didn't

00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:33,440
prepare me for what i experienced in

00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,000
high school

00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,279
i was in a classroom with a group of

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,560
white kids

00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:44,240
there was one asian girl they began

00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,639
using very derogatory language when they

00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:49,040
were

00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:52,160
referring to the black kids in school

00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:56,240
i was absolutely incredulous

00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:59,199
i spoke up and i said to them i said

00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,560
you all realize that i'm sitting right

00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:03,040
here

00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,079
and you also realize that i'm black

00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,120
right

00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:09,600
and so one boy responded by saying

00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,880
oh no char you're not like them you're

00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,320
different

00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,519
and what he did not realize is that that

00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:19,040
was not

00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:22,240
a compliment i was in shock and and just

00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:24,560
so hurt by this experience

00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,920
because these were people that i

00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:29,440
regarded as

00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:33,120
friends and for an instance

00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:36,560
i met eyes with the asian girl and

00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:39,839
she quickly diverted and

00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:42,880
i understood in that moment

00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:44,240
that she understood just how horrible

00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:47,519
this was

00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:52,000
and at the same time i knew that she

00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:55,680
struggled herself to find her footing

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:59,120
as a teenager as being

00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:01,199
an other right in a predominantly white

00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:04,720
space

00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:08,640
and in that time during that time

00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:11,120
i felt invisible as if they'd

00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,439
erased me while i was right there in the

00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,439
room

00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,000
wow being erased while you're in the

00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:20,799
room is pretty profound

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,480
um and thinking from you know at the

00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:24,000
beginning of that story that you were

00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:27,039
included

00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,559
and being erased in the moment

00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,559
and trying to get your footing is

00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:33,120
something that i think many as you

00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:35,520
you know shared with the asian woman

00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:39,039
about the asian woman that we all

00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:41,919
at some point feel and share um

00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:42,799
jeff shara's comments reminds me of your

00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,880
story

00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:47,679
or an important part of your story when

00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:50,960
you started shifting your mindset

00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:52,799
uh because oftentimes uh the

00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,240
people the majority say when they're

00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:57,120
colorblind

00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,160
that that is actually another way of

00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,200
make erasing

00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:04,480
us and making people of color

00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,880
become invisible you had a moment where

00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,760
you

00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,880
started to shift your mindset in your

00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:12,000
story

00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,880
about seeing color can you talk about

00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,880
that

00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,799
sure i mean if i just simply look at the

00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,960
past few years personally

00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:21,039
the events you know as a society that

00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:24,640
we've all been exposed to

00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:27,120
i found that i was proudly colorblind

00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,679
i was raised to not think or treat

00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,360
people

00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,799
differently based off of the color of

00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,080
their skin i mean the color of their

00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:34,960
eyes the color of their hair

00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,320
any of that right everybody was equal

00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,919
what i didn't realize

00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,960
and i didn't really give enough thought

00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:44,000
to was that's really not the point

00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,559
society brings with it a history and if

00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,039
we don't

00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:51,760
face and change by being color aware

00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:52,799
then we won't actively evolve what our

00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,840
history

00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:58,799
what the history is that we're creating

00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:00,000
so that simple shift has really expanded

00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:02,480
my thought to much

00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,360
more of being color aware and how i look

00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,960
at the world

00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,640
how i look at my friends and family

00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,960
around me and how i work at the

00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,679
look at the work environment and what

00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,039
people bring

00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:15,039
to the table with diverse thought just

00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:17,120
uh spend a little bit more time on what

00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:18,400
color aware means for to you so that

00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,520
maybe others

00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:23,120
um and who think that way can uh you

00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,280
know get some advice on how to

00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,480
think more deeply about being color

00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,720
aware

00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,640
yeah when i think of color aware versus

00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,320
color blind i think about

00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,160
people bring something to the table

00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:36,160
based off of their background

00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,440
in some instances sure the color of

00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,559
their skin brings with a

00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,880
culture brings with it a history brings

00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,480
with

00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:45,520
it you know who they are as a person

00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:47,919
what shaped them as a child

00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,600
understanding how they're viewed from

00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:52,880
society and the historic

00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:55,039
history that society brought with it

00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,559
is the only way we're ever going to get

00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:58,880
to truly

00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:59,919
including people and including that

00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,960
diverse thought

00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:04,559
into you know the teams that we build

00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,960
the history that we set for ourselves

00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:08,720
moving forward so it's not that we're

00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,080
just simply looking at everybody being

00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,240
equal but it's actually

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,720
understanding what made them who they

00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:19,200
are the society that we all live in the

00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:20,960
biases we all bring with us as well

00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,520
thank you jeff that thank you for that

00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:26,400
uh more deeper thinking

00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:28,640
you know jerry as as as jeff mentioned

00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,080
you know we bring our histories with us

00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,480
and i think that's one of the challenges

00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:34,320
we've had in diversity equity inclusion

00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,799
is that we try and pretend that oh

00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:39,600
because you work here we're all equal

00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:42,080
and that is just outright not true and

00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:45,039
so stories become really complicated

00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,360
even for those who are sharing them and

00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:48,400
and

00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:49,039
you know unfortunately history repeats

00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,919
itself

00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:54,159
if we do not resolve it and or face it

00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,799
and jerry as an asian american you've

00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:57,679
experienced

00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:59,760
we all know what's going on today in not

00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:01,440
just those cultures but in all people of

00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,000
of color and we don't have enough time

00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,080
to explore

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,760
any of those things today because we're

00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,960
talking about inclusion but jerry you

00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,919
have a story

00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,799
around how you were impacted as an asian

00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:13,520
america

00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:14,159
american and and that has impacted your

00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,039
mindset

00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:19,120
in how you lead today can you talk about

00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:21,200
that experience growing up

00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,039
yeah sure uh yeah i appreciate the the

00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,520
opportunity to do that and uh

00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:28,080
you know certainly the concepts the

00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:30,159
invisibility that both shara

00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,520
and jeff spoke of are going to be

00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,679
included here as well

00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,760
um it's not an easy story for me to tell

00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:36,640
um but i believe it's an important one

00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,480
to hear

00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,000
so growing up in around new york city

00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,480
you know i never would have expected to

00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,039
be met

00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,000
with racist violence but when i was

00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:46,960
about 16 years

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,520
old a group of my sunday school friends

00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,039
we were all

00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,960
asian american specifically thai

00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:52,559
american we're all taking a break from

00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,640
sunday school activities

00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:56,720
and wanted to pick up some food there's

00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,240
a taco bell real close so we decided to

00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,640
walk there and

00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,720
along the way a group of white kids

00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,840
drive by and start yelling out racial

00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,360
slurs

00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,600
and so you know we're a group of

00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:10,000
teenagers um we respond by

00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,280
you know curse them out and and we kind

00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,360
of like after we get done

00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:15,360
curse them out we turned around and kind

00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,520
of expected it to all be over and we'll

00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:20,000
just we'll just kind of move on

00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,799
instead they roll up and come at us with

00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,080
bats and

00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:25,200
pipes and hammers um i got i got hit in

00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,400
the head i got cracked in the head by

00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,400
one of those guys

00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,320
managed to you know keep my wits about

00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,400
me and and ran off

00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:34,400
um eventually made it to the taco bell

00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,480
and the folks there saw that i was

00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,080
all bloodied up so they called the

00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,679
police they called an ambulance

00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,120
thankfully i didn't need stitches or

00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:44,159
anything like that i recovered

00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,799
fine from my physical wounds um the

00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,640
police

00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:48,240
you know spoke to us me and my friends

00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,559
they met with our parents

00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,640
uh they told us that they'd take care of

00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:54,720
it right but nothing ever came out of it

00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,240
so nowadays right this this generation

00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,360
would have tried to make that go viral

00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,960
but back then

00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,400
uh our parents were just like ah you

00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,679
know don't don't cause it fuss let's

00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,400
just let's just brush it off let's move

00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,760
on

00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,679
and the problem with this approach is

00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:08,720
that it made us invisible

00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:10,400
right very unfortunate event and

00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,400
in my mind a very unfortunate outcome as

00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,080
well but it did teach me a couple things

00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,919
and it taught me that despite

00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,600
this being the 90s i thought things were

00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:20,240
pretty progressive being

00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:22,559
you know in the new york city area um

00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,159
somehow racism was still real right it

00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:26,320
taught me that and the other thing that

00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:27,039
it taught me was that in order to make a

00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,200
change

00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:30,960
you have to step up you have to speak up

00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,880
your community has to step up for you

00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,480
and your allies have to step up uh

00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,080
because ultimately victims need their

00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,520
voices to be heard

00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,960
and with what's going on now you know

00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,720
it's important to hear those voices and

00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:43,440
stories like mine

00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:46,080
oh jerry my goodness thank you for

00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:49,600
sharing such a traumatic story i mean i

00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:51,520
um know how painful that must have been

00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,200
for you and even in retelling the story

00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:56,720
today so thank you

00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:59,039
for sharing and um actually you have

00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,960
some experience at seeing the asian

00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:02,240
community experience through someone

00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:06,000
else's eyes

00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:08,880
maybe not as traumatic as as jerry's but

00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,760
um how did your experience with your

00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,080
roommate

00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,200
impact how you began to shift your

00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:16,159
mindset

00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,679
around diversity yeah i think it's

00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:19,679
important for us to hear

00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:21,039
like as coming from a privileged

00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:23,360
background it's important to hear

00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:24,480
how bias and racism affects the people

00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,320
we work with and like

00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,480
our friends and family on a day-to-day

00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,679
basis and just understanding that makes

00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,520
it all the more real

00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:32,880
and understand how it affects us

00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,799
systematically so

00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,919
um my roommate in college was actually

00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:38,320
asian american as well

00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:40,000
both of her parents immigrated um to the

00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,640
u.s from china i went to graduate school

00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,159
here

00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,080
and then she was raised in philadelphia

00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:45,520
new york city area so completely

00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,200
different background for me we had

00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,760
completely different perspectives a lot

00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,760
of different

00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,960
things so it was really it was really

00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,400
great to get to know her and we're still

00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,000
really close friends but

00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,840
um some of the things that were really

00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,039
important to her so when she was joining

00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:00,000
organizations or clubs um were things

00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:03,200
that i didn't have to think

00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,200
about so when she would go to class or

00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,720
um decide to join a new club she would

00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,799
be really concerned that

00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,080
um there weren't any other asian

00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:11,760
americans or any diverse

00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,039
people represented in the organization

00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,520
and it was something that i realized

00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:15,039
that

00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,960
i never really had to think about like i

00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:18,640
was always represented in a club or

00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:21,840
something that i wanted to do

00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:23,600
um so getting to know her and getting to

00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:25,840
see how frustrating it was when people

00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:28,159
asked her where she was really from

00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:29,120
after saying she was from philly and or

00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:30,480
people assuming that she was an

00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,480
international student just

00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:35,039
um those kind of things that are really

00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:37,679
demoralizing that made me realize that

00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:38,480
i needed to think about diversity in a

00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:41,840
different way

00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:44,480
than i had previously before yeah and

00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:47,600
that concept of again always having to

00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:50,159
defend yourself right and stand up for

00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:52,880
yourself and explain yourself as a theme

00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:54,840
and and then it combined with isolation

00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:57,200
makes it really tough i think for

00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:58,480
organizations and people within those

00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,520
organizations

00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:03,600
to feel included unless they're

00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:05,520
amazing like our panelists where they're

00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,520
doing their work and understanding their

00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:10,640
story so that they can become

00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:12,640
allies and support people towards moving

00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,799
and feeling more included

00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,880
i want to ask the audience if you know

00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:19,200
that according to the society for the

00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,880
human resource management

00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,760
organization that companies with a

00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:26,880
strong diversity and inclusion lens

00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:29,520
improve their market share by 46

00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,320
and 70 are more likely to capture new

00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,559
markets

00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,760
so we're not just talking about you know

00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:36,880
a sad

00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:38,159
sad song here or sad story we're talking

00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,600
about real impact

00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:42,159
not only things that will change

00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:44,480
people's lives but also that will change

00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:46,960
the lives of organizations and the

00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,600
and will benefit organizations if we can

00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,679
get

00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:51,760
this inclusion piece right i think we're

00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:53,520
beyond diversity which is getting

00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,960
representation in the companies and we

00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:57,520
still have more work

00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,279
to do there but if we are losing people

00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:02,080
as fast as we are bringing them

00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:02,720
on then we are not making progress at

00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:06,080
all

00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:09,120
so uh to that point

00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:10,080
jeff talk about your personal story and

00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:13,360
why

00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:15,840
um this inclusion is so important for

00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:17,520
you as you raise your children

00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,279
yeah i mean two different stories here i

00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,960
mean the first one it's a pretty simple

00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,919
one it's inclusion really from the other

00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,840
way around

00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:25,520
and a friend of mine and i had been out

00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,919
fishing we brought our fish back

00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:29,840
to that family up the street where mark

00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:32,000
lived the black family up the street

00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:34,159
and we were just showing off our catch

00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,760
cleaning our fish in his driveway his

00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:38,159
grandmother comes out just

00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:40,559
completely disgusted she's looking at

00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:43,120
the butchery job that we're doing

00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:44,399
she takes us into her kitchen teaches us

00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,960
how to clean the fish

00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:48,960
teaches us how to pan fry the fish and i

00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,640
stopped back on it and i'm like

00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,960
you know this is a woman who grew up in

00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:56,159
alabama pretty hard times

00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:58,720
she has absolutely no reason to share

00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:02,480
with us any of her learnings

00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:05,200
but because we've gained a relationship

00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,640
with her son she included us she brought

00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,480
us into her house

00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,399
i remember years later sitting at her

00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,600
funeral when one of her family members

00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:14,799
were talking

00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:18,000
and they said grandma would always leave

00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:20,640
all of the doors to her drawers

00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,320
or kitchen cabinets open and then one

00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,720
time they asked her they said grandma

00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:26,640
why do you always leave all your doors

00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:29,360
open and don't close up behind you

00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:31,200
and she simply said i never know what i

00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:33,600
might need

00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,919
and that really stuck with me it's if we

00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,799
could just keep the doors of our minds

00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:38,320
open

00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:40,240
because we never know what we might need

00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:43,279
that diverse thought the way of thinking

00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:45,200
beyond what we do as individuals

00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:47,360
further in life you know years past and

00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,880
my wife and i were blessed to adopt two

00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,720
children of color from

00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,159
different backgrounds different cultures

00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,840
different countries

00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:55,520
you know we kept our minds open and

00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:57,200
that's exactly what we needed at the

00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:59,440
time of family

00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,559
and as a parent seeing the life through

00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,760
their eyes

00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:06,080
gives me a whole new perspective another

00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:08,159
interesting story or example is we were

00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,840
down at the beach we were having lunch

00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:11,760
and we were sitting at this restaurant

00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:14,080
that happened to be owned by a senator

00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:15,840
so one of our state senators

00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:18,000
he comes over he's doing his politics

00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:19,600
around the table and he looks around at

00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,159
my family and you know just gets this

00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:24,720
puzzled looked i mean two white parents

00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:26,000
two kids of color and he points over at

00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:30,640
my son and he goes

00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:33,360
what's he wow now as the dad i was

00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,799
about to fire off a boy what's he look

00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,880
like you know something that was not

00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:39,679
going to provide any help at all

00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:41,039
my wife calmly takes my hand remembers

00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:43,679
you know what we learned through our

00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:45,760
home study programs through adoption

00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:47,600
and just looks at him and says i think

00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,559
what you meant to say was where was he

00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,039
born

00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:53,200
guatemala well as a senator he

00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:55,120
immediately knew what he had done wrong

00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,640
you know he backpedals he tries to

00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,679
actually make excuses you know

00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,279
everything else

00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:01,919
but it was one of those time periods

00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:03,279
where i realized as a parent

00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:05,120
i was going to have to learn things

00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:06,880
completely differently

00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,960
they didn't see my children the same way

00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:11,440
they saw me we weren't coming from the

00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:14,080
same level of privilege

00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:16,080
so it just changed my mechanism moving

00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:17,120
forward to how to look at the world

00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,640
differently

00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:20,840
and make sure that as a parent i could

00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:23,200
understand what they were going to go

00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:24,799
through so jeff i'm curious and the

00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,840
audience may want to know when you all

00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:27,919
made the decision

00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:30,240
only if you're uh willing to share when

00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:33,440
you made the decision to adopt

00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,840
of children of color did you think about

00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,200
some of the challenges that you might

00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:39,039
have oh absolutely and i

00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,559
i'd love to share so you have to shut me

00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:43,039
up i love to talk about

00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:44,240
teenagers now so a little bit different

00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:45,840
time period

00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:48,080
but the first child we adopted from

00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:49,679
guatemala we specifically were looking

00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:52,000
for someone that you know

00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:53,360
was needed at home we didn't care what

00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,200
people look like i already told you

00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,520
about you my diverse friends and family

00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,919
it's

00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:59,360
that made no difference to us but we

00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:01,279
knew some of the challenges we would

00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,640
have bring somebody home from guatemala

00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:05,039
and growing up

00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,840
so when that adoption was about to fall

00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:08,159
through

00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,880
and home study programs or the paperwork

00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:11,120
is only

00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,080
good for two years we reached out to

00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,960
florida

00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:15,919
and we specifically asked for a biracial

00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:19,200
child

00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:21,440
because we didn't want one child to

00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,120
look like us and one child not to look

00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,240
like us we wanted them to have that in

00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,960
common

00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,799
so that has served us well they've

00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,399
joined us in many programs with their

00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:32,399
schools where we talk openly about

00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:33,360
adoption they talk about the differences

00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:35,360
that they see

00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:37,679
but we certainly went into it why eyes

00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:39,600
wide open

00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:40,960
that's really profound and thank you for

00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:44,240
sharing that jeff

00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:47,039
you know shara you have a similar

00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,679
similar uh experiences to jeff and some

00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:50,240
contrast

00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:51,360
to in your story you talk about

00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,159
interracial

00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,640
interracial dynamics and

00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:57,919
intersectionality

00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:59,919
and how that's impacted you can you

00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:01,519
share with us your background and

00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:05,039
experience here

00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:07,440
yeah sure um

00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:08,640
i have to say that in addition to my

00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:11,360
parents doing

00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,000
just such a wonderful job of rooting me

00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:15,279
and who i

00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,960
am and and later that rooting really

00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:20,320
taking place and going to

00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,720
hbcu historically black college um were

00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:23,440
just

00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:24,240
such a wonderful decision a decision for

00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:27,760
me

00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:30,080
um that experience at home

00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:31,120
and going to that historically black

00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:34,559
college

00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:36,480
helped me to thrive and grow and explore

00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:39,600
in an environment

00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:42,480
where for once i did not have to carry

00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:43,600
the burden of questioning if my race was

00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,640
a factor

00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:49,840
in any of my interactions

00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,480
it was so freeing for me and this

00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:54,240
experience

00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:58,240
further rooted me and grounded me in

00:32:54,240 --> 00:33:01,840
my blackness and was wonderful

00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:04,080
and so i think about

00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:05,600
interracial relationships and they're

00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:08,240
not always

00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,440
straightforward people show up with

00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:13,440
their biases

00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:16,399
with their stereotypes and that acute

00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:18,159
experience as a teenager was such a

00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:20,159
pivotal point for me

00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:21,679
i was faced with a situation where my

00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:24,799
peers effortless

00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:27,519
effortlessly were willing to degrade me

00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:28,399
in front of me and this helped me to

00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:31,679
understand just

00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:35,200
how deep and pervasive stereotyping

00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:37,519
and racism is even the even though

00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:40,320
i really thought that i knew it all up

00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:40,320
until that point

00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:45,679
so my experiences in high school

00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:53,120
didn't stop so in the workplace

00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:56,399
the theme of invisibility

00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:58,799
has been pervasive i can't

00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:02,799
tell you the number of times i've been

00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:06,320
called another black woman's name

00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:09,040
one time that stands out for me is

00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:10,320
when a man who i didn't work with

00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:13,679
closely

00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:16,079
called me another woman's name a black

00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:16,079
woman

00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:20,800
and he quote he worked closely with that

00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:23,440
other black woman so it's

00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,159
it's the the realization in these

00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,480
moments

00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:26,480
that

00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,560
not only was i invisible not an

00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:33,679
individual

00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:35,200
not being seen as an individual but one

00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:38,720
of a collective

00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:41,119
but she was invisible

00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:42,320
because he actually had a relationship

00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:46,079
with her

00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:49,760
um and this type of thing is just so

00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:53,119
unconscionable to me so

00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:55,200
dealing with those kinds of things when

00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:59,119
it comes to

00:34:55,200 --> 00:35:02,880
interracial relationships can

00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:03,920
get tricky in this this whole experience

00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:07,119
of

00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:09,280
being invisible um

00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:12,320
happens to me but i know it happens to

00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:15,119
to other people as well

00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,440
yeah um you know it's interesting that

00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:18,079
and

00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:20,400
in diversity research it talks about

00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:22,079
groups sort of in groups so the groups

00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,240
that you feel included

00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:25,520
you know and so that therefore you're

00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,440
more comfortable

00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:30,079
being with them and that's human nature

00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:32,079
and i think attending an hvcu

00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:34,400
particularly in the grounding of feeling

00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:36,720
like to your point you don't have to

00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,560
defend yourself and to ashley's point

00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:40,400
watching her asian friend well

00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:42,240
you know you don't have to question

00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,720
whether or not you're included

00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:46,560
because of your or not or not included

00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:48,400
because of your race or gender

00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,839
those are all really important things

00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,160
and i think jerry

00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:53,920
like shara your story includes this

00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:56,480
concept of being invisible

00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:58,079
also but this sort of acknowledgement

00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:00,000
that in the workplace

00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:02,320
you know even some people who you think

00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,520
are allies or who can help you get ahead

00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:09,200
they actually may be experiencing uh

00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:11,440
um sort of diversity issues or being

00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,400
impacted by not being included

00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,720
themselves

00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,839
can you share a time jerry when you

00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:18,640
talked about

00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:19,200
uh your as you were growing up as a

00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:22,640
leader

00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:24,960
and and what happened to you yeah

00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:26,000
so in a previous role i was met with

00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,560
some barriers to

00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,160
to learning into growth in in my career

00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:32,400
uh because the person who

00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,839
you know i was the person i looked up to

00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,240
i wanted to emulate

00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:37,920
um that person didn't take the time to

00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:39,440
to want to help me learn and grow you

00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,359
know for for some reason or other right

00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:43,520
i can't speculate as to why

00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:45,040
but you know what i did was you know i i

00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:48,000
kind of brushed it off right like

00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:49,680
typical uh typical of me typical what of

00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,760
what my parents would want me to do

00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:53,280
and just try to move on uh believing

00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,000
that that's just kind of how things

00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,400
worked

00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,280
and it really wasn't until you know my

00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,520
allies

00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,800
stood up for me and this is long before

00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:03,680
i even knew where the concept

00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:06,000
and the concept of allies were um so my

00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:07,839
ally stood up for me and in particular

00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,359
a female leader in the organization took

00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:11,760
it upon herself

00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:12,480
to guide me towards growth opportunities

00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,160
because

00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,000
she saw that i was striving to learn

00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,960
more and trying to to grow in the

00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,359
organization

00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:21,440
but i was facing a lot of adversity and

00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:22,560
being met with folks who were stunting

00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:25,359
my growth

00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:26,880
and i believe that that because she was

00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:28,960
a female leader

00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,920
she probably faced similar adversity

00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,720
right and so

00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:34,480
she took what she learned imparted that

00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:36,720
on to me to help me grow

00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:37,680
and now i seek to become an ally right

00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,040
just like her

00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:41,200
and just like the other allies who had

00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:43,359
my back

00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,400
that's so important and learning as we

00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:46,400
go because

00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,400
the important part of this journey

00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:50,960
actually that you talk about

00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,920
is that you know we get to change our

00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,000
story

00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:55,599
you know we can be in the environment we

00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,680
can be whatever kind of leader that we

00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:58,079
want we can have whatever biases that we

00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,480
have

00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:02,000
and most of the time we don't realize

00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,920
the biases that we have

00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,359
but we get to choose whether or not we

00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:08,400
want to go on the journey to

00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:11,760
understand change and grow from that

00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:15,520
realization so ashley you specifically

00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:17,280
um you know represent that as a child

00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:19,520
you are told what to do

00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:21,359
and what to think for the most part but

00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:23,440
we get to learn from our environment as

00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:25,200
adults and we get to choose and change

00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,640
our thinking how how have you changed

00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,640
your thinking

00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:30,480
yeah i think getting to know my roommate

00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:32,160
and other friends that she had in the

00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,200
asian american community just made me

00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,560
realize that

00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,480
a lot of the things that i had thought

00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:38,400
about diversity inclusion were

00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,839
not correct like i think i thought that

00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,079
bias was

00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:42,880
perpetuated by like individual people

00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:45,200
who just

00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:47,200
maybe weren't like up to the times but

00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,079
in reality it's really a systematic

00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,000
issue

00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:51,760
um that will only be fixed by more

00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,040
aggressive corporate and institutional

00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,880
policies so

00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,800
um having those conversations with my

00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:59,440
roommate and with other friends

00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:01,280
just made me realize that uh the things

00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:03,520
that i believed like politically

00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:05,200
and in terms of those corporate policies

00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:07,040
like we were interviewing at the time

00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,960
and looking at different jobs

00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,640
um and i wasn't really thinking about

00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:13,359
diversity inclusion but

00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:14,800
um if other people are being held back

00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:17,119
or not included then that will also

00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,800
trickle down to me as a woman

00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:20,480
in an organization so it was something

00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,880
that became really important to me

00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:24,240
and isn't really important to me now um

00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,960
now that i'm an adult and

00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:28,160
i'm working full-time it's diversity

00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,800
inclusion is something that i really

00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:32,079
value in

00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:33,599
the corporation that i work at that's

00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:34,640
really important ashley thank you for

00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:36,400
that and you know as we

00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:38,240
we've been going on this journey we

00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:40,880
realized as we were

00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:42,400
uh processing that each story has a

00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:44,079
theme you know storytelling

00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:47,280
is so powerful in that it builds

00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:50,480
community it builds a togetherness

00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:52,720
it allows leaders to expand the way that

00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:55,200
they relate to their teams and also it

00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:56,720
creates team cohesion then it brings

00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:59,119
together all the great things that

00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:02,079
diversity does like creativity

00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:03,040
and innovation and so in our story theme

00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:05,680
you know usually in

00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,560
any good story the the protagonist goes

00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,480
on a journey

00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,839
and they're learning something they you

00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,520
know kind of have

00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:13,440
experiences that they share but then

00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:15,920
they come back and they realize oh my

00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:17,920
god this is what was happening to me

00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:19,040
all along on this journey and so at the

00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,599
end of our journey

00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:23,599
there was a theme that each one of you

00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:25,839
identified in your story

00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:26,720
and shari your theme was being your

00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:29,920
theme was

00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:31,200
being rooted rooted in yourself while

00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:34,319
not being seen or

00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:37,599
by not being seen or invisible

00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:39,920
so share what your learning has been now

00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:41,920
understanding sort of the theme of your

00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:45,200
story

00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:46,480
yeah so it's it's so many things and

00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:48,560
it's it's going back

00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:52,000
and and i think i've referenced my

00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:54,160
family multiple times my community

00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,680
and the deep levels of support i've

00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:57,599
received

00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:59,920
and through my college community and

00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:02,319
beyond and how they've helped me

00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:04,319
build a strong foundation because they

00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:05,680
understand the challenges that i would

00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:08,800
face

00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:10,960
and you know they prepared me

00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,160
lifted me up this is a part of the the

00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,520
rooting and the building of the

00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:16,079
foundation

00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:17,440
uh other black people along the way who

00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:20,400
have met and even

00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:23,119
people who i've never met you know one

00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:26,160
of my favorite poems by maya angelou

00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:29,760
is still i rise and

00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:30,400
i've shared some tough experiences here

00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:33,920
today

00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:35,599
and thank goodness i have so many more

00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:39,920
wonderfully elevating

00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:42,960
and positive experiences that fill up

00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:44,880
other parts of who i am i think these

00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:48,079
stories are important to share

00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:51,680
though because people are just

00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:52,640
not one-dimensional when you hear the

00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:55,200
hard stories

00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,920
is when you get to flex those those

00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,920
empathy

00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:59,280
muscles you don't get your empathy

00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:03,599
workout when you

00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:07,520
just um

00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:09,599
look at sort of the facade of people's

00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:11,119
stories and believe that they're going

00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:14,319
through just one thing

00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:16,079
the positive things and at work you

00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:18,480
typically get to experience

00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:20,000
the positive side that people are that

00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,359
they bring with them because that's what

00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,760
they present

00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:24,960
and that means that people are not

00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:28,000
showing up

00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:32,079
as their full selves and

00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:33,920
all of these experiences that i had the

00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:37,359
way i was loved

00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:40,079
the way i was nurtured and supported

00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:42,240
has really shaped how i lead i

00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:45,680
understand that people

00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:49,280
don't show up to work as a blank slate

00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:52,560
just ready to work in in order for me

00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:56,160
to understand how to be inclusive

00:42:52,560 --> 00:43:00,000
which i use as a verb by the way because

00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:03,839
to be inclusive is an intentional

00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:06,560
set of actions um it's a practice

00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:07,599
in order for us to understand how to be

00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:11,280
inclusive

00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:15,280
or what might feel inclusive for others

00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:18,800
we need to have we need to understand

00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:20,800
uh people and who they are

00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:23,119
yes that's chad thank you that is that

00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:25,119
is so profound and you're right that we

00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:27,359
don't we're not one-dimensional

00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:28,160
we have our personal mythology and our

00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:30,480
stories that

00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:33,280
shape the way that we see things and the

00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:35,280
way that we behave and unfortunately

00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,480
even something that we may think is

00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,480
positive for us

00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,599
may actually be a negative impact on

00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,760
someone else

00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:43,040
and that's why it is important to know

00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:46,319
your diversity's

00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:48,400
journey and story uh jerry your theme

00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:51,440
was seeing a different perspective

00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:53,440
within and outside of my group

00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:55,599
share your learning uh through this

00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:58,319
journey about inclusion

00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:59,520
yeah as i mentioned earlier i grew up in

00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:01,760
a relatively

00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:02,800
insular community and i learned at a

00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,480
young age that

00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:06,640
in such an insular group right you can

00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:08,800
get caught up in group think

00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:10,800
and the only way out is to immerse

00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,359
yourself into a more diverse community

00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,359
to

00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:14,480
surround yourself with more diverse

00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:16,079
thinkers

00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:18,079
i was lucky you read i could just step

00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:19,200
out the door and become immersed in

00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:20,640
diversity

00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,839
others have to make an effort to

00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:24,160
understand what it's like to be

00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:26,800
different so you know because of this

00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:28,880
i encourage my teams to listen to ideas

00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:31,280
from all teammates right not just

00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:32,319
the most vocal teammates everyone is

00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:35,440
worthy of having

00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:35,440
their ideas included

00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:40,319
for sure and jeff your theme was diverse

00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:41,760
family friends and seeing the world

00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:44,800
through their eyes

00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:46,240
um explain again how that has impacted

00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:49,280
your approach to

00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:49,760
inclusion as you lead your organization

00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:52,640
or your

00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:54,160
department yeah as we've discussed you

00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:55,119
know today i've been blessed with a

00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:57,119
diverse family

00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:58,400
a diverse group of family and friends

00:44:57,119 --> 00:44:59,839
but i've also been able to you know

00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,760
travel the world and experience

00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:03,599
different cultures etc

00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:05,520
and you know in my experience and quite

00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:09,119
frankly everything that i've read about

00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:10,960
oh the subject a team that is built of

00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:14,240
diverse thinkers

00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:15,359
always creates a better result initially

00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,160
there might be a little bit more

00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:17,920
conflict

00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:19,520
because they don't all see things from

00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:22,240
the same way

00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:22,960
so you're going to have some battles up

00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,880
front

00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:26,720
but that's where the catalyst of true

00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:28,319
creativity comes from that's where you

00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:30,560
see the true innovation

00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:33,440
when we run our design thinking programs

00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:35,680
with external partners and customers

00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:37,760
we intentionally bring people from

00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:38,960
different empathy maps from different

00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:41,040
backgrounds

00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:42,400
it's the way that you you know force

00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,839
creativity to happen

00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:46,240
because you're making sure that

00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:48,079
everybody's open and not just going the

00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:49,119
easy way and picking people that think

00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:51,200
like them

00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:52,640
so to me that's something that we can

00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:56,800
all take on board and

00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:58,720
it's we know it produces better results

00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:00,640
you mentioned forced creativity it would

00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:03,359
be great if we didn't have to force it

00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:05,599
right where we could just come together

00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:07,440
and have it happen because creativity in

00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:10,000
itself is so powerful

00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:11,280
and it's unfortunate when it has to be

00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,800
forced but i think that that is

00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:15,440
something that as we

00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:17,520
do design thinking as we build policies

00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:19,599
as we start to change things

00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:21,440
understanding who's at the table and

00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:24,800
making sure that table

00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:26,960
is represented and by people who have

00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:29,440
different ways of thinking

00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:31,520
will um have an outcome and i think that

00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:34,240
we focus so much on race

00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:36,000
and the idea is that we can have you

00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:37,440
know 10 black people and they all think

00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,720
differently we can have 10

00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:41,520
white women and they all think

00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:42,960
differently so expanding our idea of

00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:47,839
what diversity is

00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:50,480
is also important so that we can get to

00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:52,240
get away from these superficial biases

00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:53,280
and realize that at the end of the day

00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:56,160
we're all

00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,800
human beings so finally ashley your

00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:59,760
story

00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:00,079
is uh your story thing was understanding

00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:03,440
my

00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:06,000
values in the d e and i uh in dni

00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:09,520
starting from little exposure

00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:13,280
uh growing up yeah i would just

00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:14,640
uh echo what i have said before i think

00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:16,560
it was something that i hadn't really

00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:17,760
thought about and then um getting

00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:19,839
meeting more people in

00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:21,920
undergrad um really forced me to think

00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:23,440
about and take take stock of what i

00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:25,280
valued and it was a little bit

00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:26,880
uncomfortable at first but i think i'm

00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:28,000
glad that i put in the time to be

00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:31,359
reflective and

00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:33,040
to think about um how my values matched

00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:34,160
up with who i wanted to be and what was

00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:36,640
important to me

00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:38,880
um in my career and in my personal life

00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:41,520
as well

00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:42,160
so uh ashley you you were breaking up a

00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,599
little bit

00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:45,680
but can you say a little bit you

00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:48,319
mentioned about being uncomfortable

00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:50,160
so what it i think it would be important

00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:53,280
for people to understand because

00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:55,200
really at the edge of your comfort zone

00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:56,160
is where you are going to have a

00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:58,880
transformation

00:47:56,160 --> 00:48:00,480
so what what was uncomfortable and what

00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:02,079
would you say to people about

00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:03,760
pushing through even when you're

00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:06,079
uncomfortable

00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:07,280
yeah i think um when i say i was

00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:08,880
uncomfortable i think it

00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:10,960
had a lot to do with like the political

00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:13,200
conversations that i was having with my

00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:14,800
friends at the time and just things that

00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:16,000
were happening in the world like two or

00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:17,760
three years ago

00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,839
um and just our different opinions on

00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:21,119
that and we didn't always match up so

00:48:19,839 --> 00:48:22,319
it's kind of weird to have you know

00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:25,440
disagreement with your

00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:27,119
with your friend and um think well maybe

00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:28,640
maybe i'm not in the right here maybe i

00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:29,760
need to do more research on this to

00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:31,359
understand like

00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:33,359
what's happening and so i think being

00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:34,319
like humble and really reflective is

00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:37,359
really important

00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:39,280
um in those situations that's really

00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:40,720
true and ashley as we begin to wrap up i

00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:41,440
want to stay with you for a minute

00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:44,160
because

00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:46,480
you know you represent and i almost want

00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:49,440
to apologize on behalf of

00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:50,480
some of my peers because you represent

00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:52,160
generation z

00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:54,160
and you represent the generation that

00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:57,839
we're going to be leaving this world to

00:48:54,160 --> 00:49:00,160
and these organizations too um and so

00:48:57,839 --> 00:49:01,520
you know there's a lot of work to do and

00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:03,280
i think we're all committed to

00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:05,200
continuing to do the work while we're

00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:08,160
here but you're going to inherit

00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:09,520
what we do and what we don't do so as we

00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:12,079
wrap up can you share

00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:13,280
what you see as key values in an

00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:14,960
organization

00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:16,319
that you think will help others feel

00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:18,880
included and what does

00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:21,359
leadership need to do and what would you

00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:24,880
say to your generation

00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:26,880
yeah i think that's a great question um

00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:28,079
i think to leadership or one of the key

00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,680
values for being an

00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:31,760
inclusive organization i think would be

00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:34,160
trust and authenticity so

00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:35,440
i think speaking to leadership and in

00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:37,760
that perspective

00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:39,520
it's really important to make sure that

00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:40,480
historically unrepresented populations

00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:43,359
or minorities have

00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:44,000
opportunities to be doing stretch

00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:45,760
projects or

00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,760
that they can be hard during meetings

00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:49,359
and that everyone's ideas are taken

00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:51,119
seriously and that we all feel like we

00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:51,839
can be ourselves and express ourselves

00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:53,359
at work

00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:54,960
um i think that's really important and

00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:56,640
it boils down to

00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:58,400
leadership trusting their teammates or

00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:59,359
team members and allowing them the

00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:01,680
chance to

00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:02,640
do their work and be themselves um and

00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:05,440
then i think

00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:06,960
on the piece about my generation um i

00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,760
actually think we have an opportunity

00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:10,400
because

00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:12,160
we this generation and this time is so

00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:15,520
much more inclusive than

00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:17,440
the generations before so now like

00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:18,640
my experience at ibm i'm only six months

00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:20,079
into my career but

00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:21,839
my experience so far has been really

00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:23,040
positive and i feel like my leadership

00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:24,800
is open to feedback

00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:26,400
and that ibm is very committed to

00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:27,680
diversity inclusion and that's something

00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,319
that's really important to me and i

00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:31,040
think

00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:31,680
our my generation has an opportunity to

00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:33,040
say

00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:34,319
i only want to work at companies that

00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:35,839
are committed to this and that's

00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:38,240
something i would agree with

00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:40,000
um so we have that option of being like

00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:41,920
we we're only going to work

00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:44,000
somewhere that is committed to this i

00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:44,800
think that's an opportunity even in the

00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,280
midst of

00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:48,880
all of the um things that are going on

00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:50,319
in this time

00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:52,559
yeah ashley thank you for that and in

00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:54,720
the research it does bear out that

00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:55,920
people are leaving companies who are not

00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:58,960
inclusive

00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:59,520
and i want to applaud uh or people who

00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:02,240
do this

00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:04,000
because we all have to step up and raise

00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:05,200
our voices and we have to stand up for

00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,680
people

00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:09,440
all of us on this stage today and you

00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:11,040
know within the sound of my voice we're

00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:13,119
all privileged in that

00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:15,680
we're here in this conversation so we

00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:17,760
have some privilege just in that fact

00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:19,760
and i think it's our responsibility

00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:21,119
along with the generation z and everyone

00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:23,520
to stand up

00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:25,680
for others who aren't as fortunate as we

00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:30,160
are so thank you for that ashley

00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:32,240
um so jerry um obviously you have a

00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:33,119
journey and a story that you've gone

00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:35,200
through

00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:37,440
around diversity equity and inclusion

00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:39,280
and as you reflect on your story

00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:41,760
and what's your advice on how to

00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:44,480
increase inclusion when you speak to

00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:46,240
the leadership community and also

00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:49,200
something that's really important to you

00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:50,160
first generation asians yeah first of

00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:53,200
all shout out to

00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:54,640
generation z and uh a group that ashley

00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:57,440
is a part of right because

00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:58,000
i i spoke to ashley uh you know prior to

00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:00,319
this and

00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,040
and gen z when they see something they

00:52:00,319 --> 00:52:03,680
say something

00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:04,559
and i i really admire that and i wish my

00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:07,040
generation

00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:08,880
had done more of that so yeah i'd like

00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:11,440
to first i'd like to start

00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:12,079
speak directly to first generation

00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:15,119
asians

00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:18,000
um really all children of immigrants

00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:18,640
i feel like our parents preferred for us

00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,400
to be

00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:22,000
somewhat silent right don't be a burden

00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,960
to anyone just just go about your

00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,720
business so

00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:26,160
it's hard for some of us to to tell our

00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:29,119
stories but

00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:30,720
my advice is is that we need to speak up

00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:33,040
we need to tell our stories

00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:34,640
uh we need to speak up on behalf of

00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:36,400
other persons of color

00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:38,960
and we need to step up to we need to

00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:41,359
step up become an ally

00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:43,280
step up and take and ask for prominent

00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:43,920
roles in your organizations because we

00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:45,520
need

00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:47,839
broader representation in our

00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:49,119
organizations and if i could speak to

00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:51,599
the leadership community

00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:52,800
um to the leadership community be an

00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:55,359
ally right show

00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:57,280
solidarity and pay particular attention

00:52:55,359 --> 00:52:58,640
to outside events that that are

00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:00,240
affecting our community

00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:01,760
and i'll get to i'll get back to why

00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:03,680
that's important a little bit later

00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:04,960
um so if you have folks on your teams

00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:07,040
who are moved enough to

00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:08,800
tell personal stories and that's great

00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:09,359
you're lucky that you get to hear from

00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:11,599
them

00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:13,680
but for those on your teams who feel

00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:15,520
more comfortable being silent

00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:18,000
let the events that are shaping our

00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:19,920
world be the personal stories for those

00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,599
who are silent and putting on a brave

00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:22,640
face and they're simply putting on a

00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:24,400
brave face

00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:27,040
acknowledge their experience and be

00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:30,160
there to support them

00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:33,119
well thank you for that jerry um

00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:33,680
so profound and in the same vein shara

00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:35,760
um

00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:38,480
you have talked about existing in

00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:41,520
multiple worlds of intersections and

00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:43,440
how can leaders what messages do you

00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:44,480
have around how leaders can support

00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:47,839
inclusion

00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:51,520
for those who are in different worlds

00:53:47,839 --> 00:53:53,920
of intersectionality and also

00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:55,200
who who would you speak to what message

00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:57,680
would you give to

00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:59,280
either women of color or black women in

00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:02,319
that vein

00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:05,839
yeah so i'll speak to the leadership

00:54:02,319 --> 00:54:09,839
community first i feel

00:54:05,839 --> 00:54:11,040
very fortunate to be able to focus

00:54:09,839 --> 00:54:14,480
primarily on

00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:15,680
inclusion diversity and equity at rocket

00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:18,400
software

00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:19,440
we have such an amazing foundation our

00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:24,480
core values

00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:27,839
our empathy humanity trust and love uh

00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:31,119
which is just amazing and we

00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:34,240
we take these values seriously um

00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:36,839
and these values really support my own

00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:38,559
philosophy and practice when it comes to

00:54:36,839 --> 00:54:41,599
leadership we

00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:44,400
as leaders must be brave enough

00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:45,520
to lead with empathy and to understand

00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:48,640
that people have

00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:49,760
varied experiences which are integrated

00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:51,920
into who we are

00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:53,119
as people and inform how we make

00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:54,960
decisions

00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:56,720
which trickles down into the unique ways

00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:57,839
in which we are contributing to the

00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:00,960
business

00:54:57,839 --> 00:55:03,119
and some of these experiences uh

00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:04,400
that are happening right in front of our

00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:07,680
faces

00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:08,960
at work some of these awful experiences

00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:11,839
that people are having

00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:13,000
and some of us are carrying the load of

00:55:11,839 --> 00:55:16,319
repeated

00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:18,480
microaggressions oppression

00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:21,280
and pushing through all of that and

00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:23,760
still performing

00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:25,680
so in order for us to build true

00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:28,240
inclusive environments

00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:30,480
we need to understand the lived

00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:32,960
experiences of people

00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:34,880
so that we know who we're building these

00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:38,480
inclusive environments for

00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:41,040
and what it looks like right we can't

00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:43,440
yes we can't build inclusive

00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:47,200
environments based on a guest

00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:48,240
or prototype we need to lead with

00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:51,599
empathy

00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:54,960
listen to people see them

00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:58,720
hear them and

00:55:54,960 --> 00:56:00,960
you want to i think ultimately we all

00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:02,240
we all want to see deeply engaged

00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:06,319
employees

00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:08,319
and for me that seems so simple

00:56:06,319 --> 00:56:09,920
see their humanity and then act

00:56:08,319 --> 00:56:14,319
accordingly

00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:17,280
and so for other black women for women

00:56:14,319 --> 00:56:19,200
people of color find your people find

00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:21,040
your community

00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:23,119
those folks who are going to support you

00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:24,480
no matter what that you can be in a room

00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:26,799
with someone

00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:28,240
um with this group of people and you

00:56:26,799 --> 00:56:30,400
don't have to expre

00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:32,640
explain every little detail because they

00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:34,000
get you they know who you are

00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:37,200
these are the people who are going to

00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:39,440
patch you up and send you back out

00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,440
and

00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:44,480
who are also going to tell you the truth

00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:47,680
and help you to stretch

00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:49,440
right and then i would say go beyond

00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:51,359
that group once you have that solid

00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:54,160
foundation go beyond that group

00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:57,359
build allies build relationship create

00:56:54,160 --> 00:57:01,440
new friends across the organization

00:56:57,359 --> 00:57:04,559
um and have a real growth mindset

00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:05,839
you know and not only will you benefit

00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:09,359
from this

00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:11,760
um in in in you know seeking out mentors

00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:13,920
and i always believe in having older and

00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:18,160
younger mentors

00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:21,200
having these mentors who can support you

00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:24,240
but it's not only for your benefit

00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:26,319
in those uh reach outs and in

00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:28,160
building those relationships you also

00:57:26,319 --> 00:57:29,280
give other people the opportunity to

00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:32,000
know you

00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:34,240
and not just you as a member of a

00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:36,160
particular social group

00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:37,359
thank you so much shara and as we're

00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:40,559
coming to a close

00:57:37,359 --> 00:57:42,720
jeff i'm going to give you one minute

00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:43,599
if you could to speak about the

00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:46,720
privilege

00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:50,000
that you have and what would you say to

00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:52,400
leadership and those who are privileged

00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:54,880
yeah i think individually and personally

00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:56,480
we all have to educate ourselves we have

00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:58,160
to learn more about diversity and

00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:59,680
inclusion and we have to see life

00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:02,160
through other people's eyes

00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:03,599
we can't simply you know gather groups

00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:05,520
that are like us

00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:07,920
as corporations we need to be more

00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:08,960
intentional in building teams of diverse

00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:11,680
thought

00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:12,400
to be more inclusive but the key to me

00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:16,079
is to

00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:19,280
listen more and speak less

00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:20,079
we know it drives better results and as

00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:22,079
leaders

00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:23,520
i mean i think it was said earlier it's

00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:26,000
time we all need to be comfortable

00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:27,440
being less comfortable we need to be

00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,319
uncomfortable get into these

00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:29,760
conversations

00:58:28,319 --> 00:58:32,240
it's the only way we'll progress and

00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:34,640
evolve as a society

00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:37,040
absolutely and thank you jeff for coming

00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:39,119
in at the minute time frame

00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:40,640
and unfortunately everyone we are

00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:42,319
running out of time and we are going to

00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:43,280
have to end the conversation but

00:58:42,319 --> 00:58:45,920
obviously

00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:46,480
this is a complex but necessary

00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:48,640
conference

00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:50,480
conversation that we have to continue
