ross mori general manager ibm z

00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:07,440
and linuxone hello everyone and thank

00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,639
you for joining the

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:13,920
2020 open mainframe project summit

00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:15,920
the linux foundation has really been

00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,400
a special part of my 40-year history

00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:21,439
with ibm

00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,640
and it starts all back in january of

00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,920
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:28,400
when ibm announced that we would adopt

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,279
linux and invest a billion dollars

00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,960
for support for our servers our services

00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:34,960
and our software

00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,680
and when we made this announcement i was

00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:41,040
asked to run ibm's fledgling linux

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:43,200
corporate initiative that included

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,200
building from from the ground up a team

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,440
of dedicated software engineers that

00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,640
were to contribute to the linux kernel

00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,120
and that was known as the linux

00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,199
technology center and then

00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,239
along with this came an industry

00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:56,879
initiative

00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,960
and that we formed with other vendors

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,399
that was about mid 2000 and that was

00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,640
called the open source

00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,840
development lab and i was elected the

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,320
first chairman

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:10,080
of the board of directors of the osdl

00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:12,479
and i served as chair for four years

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,119
we had the pleasure of doing many things

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,159
to help

00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:17,200
uh linux programmers we set up automated

00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,360
testing and

00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,759
had other initiatives to help them out

00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,880
uh we named lena's turboles as the first

00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,000
osdl fellow and again many projects to

00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,920
really help open source

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,799
developers and then in january of 2007

00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,360
the osdl and the free standards group

00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,520
merged

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,040
to form the linux foundation and

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,920
narrowed the scope from

00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,640
many open source projects down to linux

00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:46,159
really just focus on promoting linux

00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:48,880
so um fast forward now to 2015

00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,399
and i'm running ibm's z business the

00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,240
mainframe business

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,920
and that's the year the linux foundation

00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,200
announced the formation of the open

00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,320
mainframe project

00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,079
when we talk about ibm z um you know

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,320
it's got a long history

00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,119
but let's focus in on the last 20 years

00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,799
right so

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:10,000
20 years of linux on z um

00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:13,120
five years of linux one in omp

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,879
and now the one year uh

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:19,920
anniversary of red hat openshift on z

00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,560
um we've invested in a lot of open

00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,200
support

00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,920
uh over the years uh we doubled our

00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,840
redoubled our efforts uh recently

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,000
and uh one of the things we did again

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,160
five years ago is we created

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,160
the linux one product line a brand new

00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:37,760
standalone product line

00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:40,400
solely to run linux on the mainframe

00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,720
that's been again an interesting and

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,360
rewarding last five years as we've

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,840
tremendously grown that business

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,120
as you can see in this histogram that's

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,800
on the chart here

00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,200
the last five years you see how those

00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,760
bars go up well that's goes along with

00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,319
the launch

00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,239
of our linux one system and redoubling

00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:01,280
our efforts in open source

00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:04,080
so i'm really proud of where we are

00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,680
as a business and now over half of the z

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,080
clients globally

00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,760
run linux on the platform as you can see

00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,080
from the statistics here

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,840
the ibm institute for business value and

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,040
from idc

00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,000
cloud strategies have evolved today most

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,319
organizations are

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,159
using multiple cloud platforms and

00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,640
almost all have both public

00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:26,400
and private cloud environments as

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,200
businesses continue their journey to the

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,599
cloud

00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,680
the new normal is developing for what we

00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:34,480
call hybrid multi-cloud

00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,599
and using open standards and open source

00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,159
i'm really happy now

00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,840
happy now that uh openshift and red hat

00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:42,480
ansible are also on the z

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,599
platform because that really helps us

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,599
integrate both z

00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:50,480
os and linux in a hybrid multi-cloud

00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:52,319
environment and architecture

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,159
so you know we've got a cloud-native

00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:57,519
experience for developers

00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,080
um with no specialist skills uh required

00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,840
you know

00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,080
linux and cloud native development

00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,720
software processes

00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,840
and architectures run very well on the

00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,000
platform

00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,280
and the you can integrate that with your

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
current uh

00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,680
services and systems and of course with

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,760
your core operations

00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,040
and focused on your customer engagement

00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,120
apps as well

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,040
so there's some differentiated

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,800
capabilities on the platform that we're

00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,600
very proud of i won't go into them all

00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,040
now but

00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,280
when it comes to performance and

00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,919
security i would say that nothing

00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,120
can beat the z platform and linux

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:34,160
together

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,160
ibm has been investing heavily in open

00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,040
in industry standard technologies

00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,440
and for the ibm z platform and z today

00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,000
we're

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:44,240
fully integrated into ibm's hybrid cloud

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,800
infrastructure and strategy

00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,160
full participant in hybrid cloud and

00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,680
have hundreds of clients

00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:53,040
going down this path with us today

00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,960
you know this consistent and

00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,120
standardized approach to development

00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,400
deployment management orchestration

00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,160
automation

00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,520
is bringing new possibilities to our

00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,919
existing clients

00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,000
and opening us us up to getting new

00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:09,039
clients

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,759
so clients like bmp peribar are

00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,600
leveraging z

00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,479
as part of their agile approach to drive

00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,720
efficiency in software and development

00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:18,560
the majority of organizations that use z

00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,600
today have huge investments in

00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,240
applications

00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,919
in their software and primarily this is

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,120
in supporting their core business

00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:27,280
operations

00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,880
so ibm has developed solutions and

00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,720
methods to enable our clients to

00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:33,840
modernize these applications

00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,039
where they reside today which this means

00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,520
they can now leverage

00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:40,320
and extend these workloads and use for

00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,400
use of new digital services

00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,400
furthermore when they're developing new

00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,720
cloud services on other platforms they

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,960
can

00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,120
access the applications and the data

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,360
that resides on z

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,639
via open and standardized interfaces and

00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,039
apis

00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,639
clients such as allied irish bank are

00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:59,440
leveraging the new agility

00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:01,440
to enable new services and functionality

00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,520
this agility helps them

00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,080
aib being one of the first banks in the

00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,800
uk and ireland to meet the milestone

00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,479
set by regulators for open banking one

00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,440
of the things we're also seeing

00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:14,560
um our clients desires and so we're

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,240
delivering on it

00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,960
is they want a choice of consumption

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,800
models and businesses from startups to

00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,880
the very largest enterprises are

00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,759
demanding to have choice of consumption

00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,600
model

00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,800
so we now have choices we have

00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,560
on-premises

00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:32,800
and off-premises in the ibm cloud

00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,160
latest generation of ibm z which is

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,400
known as the z15

00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,400
was designed from the ground up for the

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,600
world's most regulated

00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:44,000
security conscious uh industries

00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,360
and it delivers leadership scalability

00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,120
resiliency

00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,639
and helps them with their compliance

00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,919
standards that they all have to live up

00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,400
to today

00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:53,840
and our focus is just not only on linux

00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:57,039
it's a z os

00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,160
software stack as well that joins the

00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:01,120
open ecosystem

00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,360
through contributions to many different

00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,680
communities but

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,800
products like red hat ansible now are

00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,919
used to automate

00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:12,400
zos workloads uh there's new communities

00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:14,319
being built around technology like zoe

00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,759
which i think is a fantastic new

00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:19,039
interface

00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:22,240
for developers and for administrators

00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:24,160
into z os and it enables a wide range of

00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,400
open source to work just as well with z

00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,599
os applications as it does with any

00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,160
other platform

00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,599
so you know think about kubernetes and

00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,759
jenkins and spark

00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:35,680
all those open standards and open

00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:38,880
software is available today

00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,479
on our platform so linux one brings many

00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,840
of these leading capabilities to the

00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:44,240
linux environment

00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,199
with uh our premiere enterprise linux

00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,520
server

00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,120
and we're making these available also

00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,599
through the cloud through our hyper

00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,800
protect

00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:53,520
services our hyper protect services are

00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,680
really

00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:58,560
confidential computing in an end-to-end

00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,960
manner so you can lock down your data

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,360
you can lock down your applications and

00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,360
no one can access it but you

00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,479
one of the things that we did to get

00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,720
started was

00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:10,639
we created the hyper protect pas

00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,240
services on the ibm cloud

00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,560
and we created a hyper protect

00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,520
accelerator for startups

00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,840
and one of the first startups that

00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:22,319
joined us in the accelerator last year

00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,759
was private key and today i'm joined by

00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,680
pat kelly

00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:28,000
who's the chief revenue officer for

00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,080
private key and again one of the first

00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,120
participants in the program

00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:35,039
welcome pat thanks ross it's

00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,399
great to be here delighted to join you

00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:39,120
on your keynote

00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,560
thanks hey uh nice t-shirt what have you

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,519
got on there

00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:45,200
oh i i wore mine too that's the peace

00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,440
love linux one t-shirt and

00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,959
we didn't coordinate but i guess uh like

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,440
you know great minds think alike

00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:53,440
so tell me the problem that your team is

00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,600
looking to solve with your technology

00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,399
and the solutions you've created

00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,560
sure yeah so private key's mission is to

00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,399
really solve the customer experience

00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,680
challenge when it comes to transaction

00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,600
security

00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,920
when we looked at the transaction

00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,720
customer journeys between services like

00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,760
banks or

00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,320
healthcare e-commerce and their users we

00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,480
saw

00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,000
lots of problems we saw frustrating

00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,080
workflows

00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,680
uh directing users to out-of-band

00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,399
channels cumbersome

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,839
archaic authentication methods and our

00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,880
insight was that if we were able to

00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,680
combine

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,200
modern strong authentication with

00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,519
contextual transaction

00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,560
confirmation we could take what are

00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:37,279
often terrible customer journeys today

00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,760
and turn them into really good uh you

00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,279
know

00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,279
exceptional customer experiences

00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:43,040
tomorrow certainly that's the goal

00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,640
um and so private keys transaction

00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,240
intent verification solution is really

00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:49,839
designed to do just that

00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,519
um and given that ibm's technology

00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:54,560
powers something like 90

00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:56,560
of the world's global transactions we

00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,320
recognize a significant mutual

00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,000
partnership opportunity

00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,760
so just to tell a little back story you

00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,800
know our journey with ibm began two

00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,880
years ago

00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,079
when we integrated private key with

00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,000
bicom infiniti

00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:09,920
one of your uh significant business

00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,600
partners they developed a voice

00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,959
assistant named viva that was designed

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,120
to talk to the mainframe and it was

00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:17,760
built on ibm watson and it would

00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,399
allow an authorized user using private

00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,480
key

00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,519
to speak directly to a mainframe and

00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,240
access highly

00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:26,399
sensitive data and i you know that was

00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,920
really the launch of our

00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,680
you know first step into the ibm

00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,920
ecosystem

00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,600
that's great thanks so um you know so

00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,160
you're currently leveraging the hyper

00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,560
protect

00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,000
pad services i talked about to secure

00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,560
your clients data

00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
you know how's that working out it's

00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,800
good um it's sort of an interesting

00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,959
story on our

00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,800
on our own evolution because we've

00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:50,240
initially launched private key

00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,360
as an on-premise solution on the basis

00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,240
of where

00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,920
our we thought our technology would sort

00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,399
of sit in mission critical

00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,560
stacks and we were concerned that for

00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,040
enterprise clients that they wouldn't

00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,160
trust

00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:06,560
a sas solution with all this very highly

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:09,600
sensitive user data flowing through it

00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:11,040
but our thinking began to change when

00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,440
we discovered ibm cloud with

00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:16,320
hyperprotect and realized that we

00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,959
could in fact build a sas cloud service

00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,640
that

00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:20,959
we believe even the most sensitive and

00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,640
regulated enterprises could trust

00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,320
um you know because hyper protect

00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:27,519
delivers and and

00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,000
computing uh encryption of data and code

00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,480
at rest

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,640
and during processing the whole concept

00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,720
of confidential computing preventing

00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,000
unauthorized operators like ourselves

00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:39,040
running a service

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,519
so that we can't get at someone's data

00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,959
was all very important and with hyper

00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,640
protect and sort of the linux

00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,640
underpinnings it really means and cloud

00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,959
native environment means that

00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,720
for our team deploying private key on

00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:52,560
this environment was really a

00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,920
very incredibly easy you know

00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,040
straightforward exercise

00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,560
you know we love the fact that we didn't

00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,320
need to create any of this security

00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,360
ourselves but simply inherit all the

00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,360
security of the

00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,800
hyper protect platform it's great to

00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,079
hear that you're leveraging all that

00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,680
today so

00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,760
what's the future hold for private key

00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,560
where are you going uh well we're headed

00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,120
to the cloud

00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,839
so we are happy to share that we're

00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,639
launching

00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:15,279
private key cloud as a multi-tenant sas

00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,000
solution

00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:18,800
later this month for many customers we

00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,160
think that i

00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,000
private key cloud will really be an

00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,399
ideal solution for improving

00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,480
their customers experiences around

00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:29,360
transaction confirmation

00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,399
and for other enterprises private key

00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,680
cloud will offer

00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:36,240
at least a really easy and way

00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:38,000
to set up a trial to get started to

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,399
prototype a solution

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,240
with the understanding that they could

00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,959
take that solution

00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,880
to production with private key cloud you

00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:50,240
know protected with hyper protect

00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:52,399
or should they want to move on prem that

00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,440
there'll be an easy path to do that well

00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,160
so with all that

00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,760
please visit privatekey.com sign up for

00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,800
a free trial of the clouds

00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:02,560
of our cloud solution uh we'd love to

00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,800
support your requirements

00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,480
uh your learning and certainly would

00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:09,040
appreciate all the valuable feedback

00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:11,200
that we hope we get

00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,639
thanks pat that's great and and uh we're

00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,839
so thrilled again that you're part of

00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:15,680
our accelerator

00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:17,680
looking forward to your journey and

00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,600
launching your cloud service

00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,040
and watching you grow so thank you very

00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,000
much for joining me here today i really

00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,000
appreciate it

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,519
you're welcome i appreciate the invite

00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,839
so now let's take a look

00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,639
a little deeper at the technology that

00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,800
pat referenced

00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,399
those hyper protect services on the ibm

00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,880
cloud so these hyper protect

00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:37,360
services are built off of ibm's

00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,519
world-class banking technology

00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,519
and in fact our secure enclave

00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,600
technology that's key to this

00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,800
is we've actually been doing r d on this

00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,320
for 10 years and

00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,399
our we just released our fourth

00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,399
generation of this technology

00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,560
and this technology is available today

00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,079
on premises or in the ibm cloud but

00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,720
let's talk about the cloud

00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:58,320
confidential computing is a shift from

00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,800
operational assurance

00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,399
to technical assurance so let me tell

00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:05,279
you a little bit more about that

00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,760
operational assurance really uses trust

00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,240
in the

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,199
visibility and controls and what that

00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,240
means to you

00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:14,160
is that you trust your cloud provider

00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,519
that they will protect your data and

00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,639
they will not allow

00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:21,680
unauthorized use of your data

00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:24,639
but what if your twitter and your

00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:26,320
admins through social engineering give

00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:29,519
up their passwords

00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:33,279
and hackers take over the accounts

00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:34,639
of famous celebrities and uh put bitcoin

00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:36,560
challenges out there

00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:38,480
not that that would ever happen but it

00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:42,720
may have happened in the last few weeks

00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:44,560
so you know unintended things can happen

00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,959
if you look at the capital one breach

00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:51,040
right i mean they were on aws

00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:53,440
and um an aws employee

00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,320
that used to work there ex-employee used

00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,800
to work there

00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,760
knew about a vulnerability in the aws

00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:01,519
firewall

00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:02,560
went in and stole capital one's data

00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,480
and this is gonna be a really

00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,199
interesting case as it comes out in the

00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,839
courts

00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:08,880
can't wait to see it because once again

00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,519
aws

00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,000
was living up to their contractual what

00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,160
they signed

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,600
in the contract to capital one yet

00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,079
capital one's data

00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,680
still got compromised so here's the

00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:21,920
here's the solution to that

00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,600
it's called technical assurance and that

00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:26,480
is there's technology

00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:28,160
that basically enforces that no one can

00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,720
access your data

00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:33,279
so if your data is in the ibm cloud in

00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:35,920
one of our hyper protect services

00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:36,800
and the government subpoenas us and and

00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,560
asks us to

00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,880
take your data and decrypt it and give

00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,399
it to them we physically can't do that

00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:45,680
it's technically protected

00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:48,240
only you can access that data so that's

00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:50,480
what confidential computing is all about

00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,320
and in a digital world you know cyber

00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:55,519
resiliency is a must

00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:57,360
and um i i think i'm pretty sure that z

00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:00,399
is the only platform

00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:03,839
where you can get this this technical

00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:04,639
assurance so that you can keep your data

00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,440
safe

00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:08,399
and you can proactively you know avoid

00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,959
if you would

00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,880
a cyber attack so you know we've been

00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:15,199
also investing in machine learning and

00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:17,199
ai to make sure we understand

00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:19,440
uh the patterns of operation within the

00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:20,800
system so that we can make sure that

00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:24,000
everything's resilient

00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:26,240
we're also really really looking at

00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,600
our transaction processing as you know

00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,079
we deliver the world's greatest

00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,560
transaction processing engines for the

00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:34,560
the banks and the credit cards and the

00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,639
payment systems of the world

00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,839
um but now we're taking that and we're

00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:41,519
making sure that that

00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:44,639
fast high scale transaction throughput

00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:47,040
engine also runs with this

00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,920
technical assurance so that confidential

00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,480
computing

00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,279
at high transaction rates can be

00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,639
completely

00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:56,560
secure yet not affect your

00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,240
your um response times and your

00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,720
throughput so

00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,399
as i started i think we've got the most

00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,360
comprehensive and proven set of

00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,120
solutions

00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,400
for modernizing your existing

00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:09,439
applications

00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,799
and for also keeping them safe

00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,799
as you go through your digital

00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:14,000
transformation journey and your journey

00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:16,240
to cloud

00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,319
and clients across many industries are

00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,839
leveraging these technologies today

00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:21,520
they're proven and they're generally

00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,400
available so i talked about the new

00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,839
normal being

00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:28,079
open and hybrid and with ibm z as part

00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:30,799
of your hybrid cloud you can create

00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:32,880
many new opportunities to drive value

00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:35,440
into your organization

00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,360
ibm and the open mainframe project are

00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,679

00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:42,320
to help you along the way and to help

00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:44,080
you ensure that you get the value

00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,559
