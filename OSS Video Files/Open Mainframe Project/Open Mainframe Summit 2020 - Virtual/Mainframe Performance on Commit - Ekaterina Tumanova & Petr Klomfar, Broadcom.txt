	Mainframe Performance on Commit - Ekaterina Tumanova & Petr Klomfar, Broadcom 

Nowadays digital transformation is picking up steam: the load on data servers increases, number of application changes being deployed to production is growing, while companies are adopting agile practices. At this pace of change it is essential to ensure that IT systems are undergoing sufficient amount of testing, especially performance checks to reduce risk of production downtime. Including performance testing into functional testing suits has been outlined as one of the key trends and challenges for 2020. Mainframe doesn't stand aside, vendors are developing open interfaces to make products part of the continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) process. This presentation provides an overview, example, and a live demonstration of a Mainframe pipeline with automatic detection of performance degradation and issue analysis using Zowe Plugins.
