	An Open Source Delivery and Deployment Model for the Security Conscious - Peter Fandel, Rocket Software

The open source software world is about public involvement, easy access, easy contribution, mix and match, etc. with many benefits resulting in faster innovations, higher quality, and lower costs. The mainframe world is about extreme security, trusted sources, high standards for integration testing, the ability to restore to previous states, and so on, resulting in extreme reliability and extreme information security. A goal that mainframe administrators have struggled to attain is to merge these seemingly contradictory worlds and derive all the benefits of each without losing the benefits of the other. This presentation is on how to leverage conda via secure internet channels and air-gapped file channels to achieve this goal.
