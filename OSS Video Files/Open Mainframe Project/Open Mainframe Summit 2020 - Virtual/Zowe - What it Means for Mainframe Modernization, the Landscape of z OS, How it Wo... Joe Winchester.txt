Playlist: Open Mainframe Summit 2020 - Virtual
Description: 
	Zowe - What it Means for Mainframe Modernization, the Landscape of z/OS, How it Works, What it Delivers, and its Future - Joe Winchester, IBM 

Zowe is the first open source tooling project on z/OS. Since its announcement of open beta in August 2018and GA of version 1.0 in Feb 2019, it has grown in maturity and also in terms of its scope. This talk will cover the technology included with Zowe, with a focus on how Zowe can be extended by Independent Software Vendors and System Integrators. This talk will deep dive on the Zowe Explorer, the Zowe command line interface, the Zowe desktop, and the Zowe API Mediation Layer. How to install Zowe, how to configure Zowe, how to launch Zowe, how to monitor and tune Zowe. The talk will also cover the governance and rules by which Zowe operates, as well as give history into the mistakes that Zowe has made, the successes it has had, and a perspective in terms of the future of Zowe and its relationship to other open source projects on and off the mainframe.

hey everyone good morning good afternoon

00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:05,759
wherever you are in the world um

00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:07,200
so my name is joe winchester that's me

00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:08,559
in the in the in the right-hand side of

00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,920
that picture that's the last

00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:11,599
one of the last conferences i was at

00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,120
with a smiling face with my colleague

00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,120
steve boston and tim castle

00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,320
um handing out t-shirts at an open

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,480
source summit and

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,320
now i'm virtually talking to you all

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,119
about zoe so tell you what it means for

00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,880
the

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,400
mainframe and how it works we're only

00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,439
got 25 minutes so i'm going to try and

00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,199
clip along here

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,640
um so three things i'd like you to

00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:29,840
remember and i'm going to try and

00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,599
use this as the theme for my

00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,120
presentation so it's more than tech it's

00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,719
a community i really want to focus on

00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,280
the community of zoe

00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:39,440
it's open simple familiar those tag

00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,040
lines you'll see we try to

00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,480
try to follow within zoe as our kind of

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,000
sort of ethos

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,360
and also very important with the

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,320
mainframe it's all of the old with all

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,039
of the new when

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,719
we're trying to bring a new uh

00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,800
generation of people a new

00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,719
you know technology that has uh come

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,559
along since the mainframe

00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,840
uh make that work with the mainframe for

00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,520
people who are familiar with that

00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,320
technology but also not leave behind

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,160
people who

00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,520
really understand how mainframes work as

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,119
well so we're trying to

00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:10,159
bring both those two together so zoe

00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:11,840
is um owned and managed by the open

00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:12,400
mainframe project which is by the linux

00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,799
foundation

00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,720
every time i go to linuxfoundation.org

00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,640
i'm astonished by the amount of software

00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,280
that they have and they are the stewards

00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,960
of

00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,400
phenomenal and just have a look there

00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,119
like you know and that's just a few

00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,520
jenkins

00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:27,119
we've got you know open api mocker

00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,159
kubernetes linux obviously

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,920
automative linux zoe uh hyper ledger so

00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,600
so these are they really are the

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,320
stewards and the champions of

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,840
enterprise grade open source tech now

00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,680
why is that important

00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,880
so sometimes when i talk to people about

00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,159
open source they say yeah i've got an

00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,119
open source project and they probably

00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,920
have a repo

00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:47,360
github.com whatever and they made it

00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,079
available under an open source license

00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,280
but then

00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:53,280
does that mean anybody can participate

00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,640
anybody can see what they're doing next

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,280
anybody can get involved in their

00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,320
planning

00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,680
they have an election process you know

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,200
governance and so forth

00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,280
and the answer is probably that's where

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,439
you'll find perhaps others

00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,399
answer that question you know

00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,160
differently

00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,840
that's not the case within zoe so within

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,440
zoe for sure we're open source and you

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,440
can see all of our source

00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,760
um but you can also see all of our

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,440
issues so we can search for our issues

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,480
uh we have a lot of conversations that

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,640
you can search through

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,239
and find it's a very sort of welcoming

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,879
community and not only

00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,160
that you can see raise new issues you

00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:28,720
can see the issues squads are being

00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,800
worked on you can get the zen hub boards

00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,239
um you can pick issues off that one

00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,519
particular one there from the cli is

00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,560
flagged as good first time if you want

00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,519
to get involved and

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,400
participate you can fork the repo fix an

00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,959
issue

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,800
give it back create a pull request and

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:46,640
have it reviewed so you can kind of

00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:48,080
earn open source participation and

00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,120
there's actually a journey to where you

00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,400
might even one day

00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,760
end up becoming a squad leader or

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,239
perhaps a zoe leadership committee

00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,519
leader

00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:58,159
it's a very open welcoming diverse

00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,720
friendly community within the

00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:02,319
documentation itself for example

00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,560
i've got the docs on the left but on the

00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:05,120
right the documentation tells you how to

00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,440
write

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,120
documentation build your own local docs

00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,640
and actually end up fixing it it's quite

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,080
meta that the documentation tells you

00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,519
how to fix the documentation

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,280
and you can just create an issue with a

00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,920
troubleshooting tip anytime you feel

00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,599
like it

00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,080
and a lot of customers do and those get

00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:22,159
in the product we use slack

00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,239
i run it on my phone sometimes i run it

00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,440
on my desktop you can chat to the squad

00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,560
see what's going on

00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,360
ask questions get help um all of our

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,360
meetings

00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,400
squad meetings leadership calls they're

00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,239
all open they're all in zoom

00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,319
you can join them see the calendar the

00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,480
important ones are recorded system demos

00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:43,200
every time a release goes out

00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,640
so uh there's a blog site very

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,720
successful blog site it's going to

00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:51,440
shout out to medium.com you can see

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,000
some great blog authors here uh core and

00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,599
again

00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,040
ecosystem if there's a blog about

00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,439
something that extends though it's part

00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,040
of the

00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,480
ecosystem around zoe you'll see that

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,120
clearly delineated

00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,400
so what i'm going to do now is rattle

00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,680
through each of the four major

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,799
components of zoe

00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,840
command line interface zoe explorer zoe

00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,280
desktop

00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,640
and the api mediation then i'm going to

00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,959
finish up a little bit with some future

00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,959
stuff

00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,959
talk about it's the command line

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:20,400
interface or the cli

00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:22,880
so the serializer is really important so

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,600
sometimes people think it's odd that zoe

00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,759
which is about

00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,199
modernizing a mainframe has a command

00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,680
line interface

00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,520
but um don't be fooled um docker has a

00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,360
very powerful command line interface git

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,000
has a command interface a lot of

00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,280
modern ways that developers system

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,960
programmers interact

00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,240
with software is through a command line

00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:44,000
interface so the zoe cli is really

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,919
positioned to fill that need now this is

00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,680
a zoe architectural diagram

00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,600
and i'll cover this as i go through the

00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,280
technical part of the presentation

00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,800
the cli is sort of in the top right hand

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,280
corner a little box up here which is

00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,440
zoe cli and what i'll talk about first

00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,440
is how the zoe command line interface

00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,199
interacts with zero smf on the back end

00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,400
which is part of cos

00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,520
um operating okay

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,000
after you've installed the command

00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,160
interface which needs node uh

00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,240
when you type commands so you type zoe

00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,000
and it tells you what the cli can do so

00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,479
it reveals the help to you as you type

00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,639
it

00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:18,240
it's based around the concept of groups

00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,400
now the base groups that comes with

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,000
star cos these are some extensions i'll

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,479
cover a little bit later on

00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,680
and you can see we can work with tso

00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:29,360
console

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,960
um jobs workflows um

00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,479
but if the next thing i want to do is i

00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,919
want to work with files i can type cos

00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,160
files so the shorter word of

00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:37,120
files so when i type so we files it will

00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,120
say well hey ho

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,479
now i know you want to do files the

00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,800
response for the

00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:45,039
help is based upon what i've asked it to

00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,639
do it's the information i'm now missing

00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,320
so okay i can do lots of files i can

00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,080
copy i can create i can download

00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,479
i'm interested in listing files so now

00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,120
as i say zoe files list what you'll see

00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,240
is it says

00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,680
well what do you want to do do you want

00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,680
to list members do you want to work with

00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,319
the data sets which is the mvs file

00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,440
system or

00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,000
perhaps want to work with the unix

00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,280
fastest um

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,280
i particularly want to work with data

00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,759
sets and when i say data sets help it'll

00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:10,560
tell me all of the information i can do

00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,280
including samples this is really nice

00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,000
and this is

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,600
not just for the core cli that comes but

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,120
everybody who extends it

00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,639
gets it's built up on a framework called

00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,840
imperative it's a very nice touch

00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:24,240
the zoe cli's got makes it very useful

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,680
now sometimes when i'm showing people

00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,520
cli they say well i can just log on to

00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,960
the mainframe and issue tso command so i

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,199
can log on to the mainframe with

00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,560
ssh and that's i shell or something like

00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,840
that you can

00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,280
but then you're on the mainframe you're

00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,120
on the mainframe as well do you want to

00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,440
you know the acidic mainframe

00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,479
uh with all the software that you've got

00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:45,199
i'm issuing these

00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:48,479
from my mac from my pc from my laptop

00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,840
so i can say zoe files list data sets

00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:52,160
and get my data sets back

00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,120
but because it's on my laptop i can fuse

00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,120
it with tools

00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,319
on my laptop and that's really the power

00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,599
that's the sort of

00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:01,360
familiar tagline in zoe so i can just

00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,840
use grep

00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,360
i can actually get the responses back in

00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,960
in json if i want to

00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,400
which is really neat because then i can

00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,800
actually programmatically manipulate

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,400
that

00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,639
and that's very powerful if i look at

00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,639
tools like automation tools so this is a

00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,720
shell script it's a real shell script

00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,639
i've written by colleague of mine uh for

00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,639
a presentation steve horseman

00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,080
and uh it's it's unique sales group it

00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,280
would be familiar for people who know

00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,280
unix shell script

00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,479
it's a familiar part bringing people to

00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,639
the mainframe that know

00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,319
off-platform languages and off-platform

00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,400
tools and techniques but whenever they

00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,160
want to manipulate their mainframe

00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,680
joe exhaust files create data set

00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:39,440
classic upload

00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,400
um these are not unfamiliar to a unix

00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,840
shell

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,720
developer there are samples in in the

00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,120
zoe's github

00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,879
for for groovy which is very popular for

00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,919
jenkins pipelines there's ansible

00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:53,039
samples

00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,599
uh gosh the symbols are php a pearl r i

00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,479
think uh

00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,960
ruby possibly uh so you can bring people

00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,560
that

00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,840
aren't familiar with the mainframe but

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,919
are familiar with scripting and

00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,440
automation other tools off platform

00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:05,440
to the mainframe and that's really that

00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,360
power that's really that fusion of

00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,800
of the two worlds together so it's

00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,840
really the sweet spot

00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,440
now if you don't know the zoe's help for

00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,360
the command it's got a really cute

00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,360
feature where you type zoe h

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,280
uh that's just hwn it launches all of

00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,960
the help in an online browser

00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,560
uh sort of online browser just in a

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,039
browser on your desktop

00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,720
and you can type and search and if i

00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,160
type the word i think i type the word

00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,960
submit it will say oh great what's up

00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,440
with submit

00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,279
and i can see the syntax and as you get

00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,800
extensions these are all built in here

00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,800
so this online help is a really nice

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,640
touch

00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,399
it's extensible so think back to the

00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,080
games platform the success of the games

00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,399
platform or the coffee pod is

00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,000
what you can get on top of it so within

00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,240
zoe right now

00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,920
i can go to npmjs which is the online

00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,680
registry for node packages

00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,959
and i can see lots of extensions and i

00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,480
can see there's one for z os connect

00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,920
which is an ibm product

00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,240
there's base one so this is a vendor

00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,600
product and broadcom uh have got one for

00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,160
their product called ca bill in fact

00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,600
that's 32 packages

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,440
backing all of this is what's known as a

00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,040
conformance program so each major

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,399
component of zoe has

00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,839
a conformance program this is something

00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,600
really nice that comes from the linux

00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,040
foundation sort of omp stewardship

00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,519
assistant system so

00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,279
if you build something to extend it you

00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:20,320
can get a badge you have to

00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:22,080
fill in a form which is written by the

00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,839
people who sort of know the technology

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,279
that says these are the touch points

00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,200
what it means is that if when you

00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:29,120
download a conformant extension

00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,399
you know it works it's a good citizen it

00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,959
behaves well

00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,640
uh with uh the imperative with the

00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:37,040
online help and single sign-on

00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,320
and things like that as well but it also

00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,760
means when you build a conformant

00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,839
plug-in that the base won't change

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,480
within version one the apis that you use

00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,360
are sort of

00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,880
hardened apis and here is a 22

00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,080
conformant plug-ins so what's really

00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,480
neat let's go back to the

00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,600
architecture diagram so the zoe core cli

00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,839
talks to the

00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,640
base cosm what about those extensions i

00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:58,959
mentioned other that are sort of 32 ext

00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,320
extensions these are just four on the

00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,399
architecture ground there are others

00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,399
that ca endeavor is one ibm zeros

00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:07,600
connect uh rocket

00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:09,200
um i have some db2 tools um phoenix

00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,560
software have one for ejez

00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,800
um these tend to talk sort of kind of

00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,000
one-on-one with their back ends and this

00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,920
works great

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,240
but what you end up with is you end up

00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:22,399
with the sweet spot which is where all

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,399
you need to do is install

00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,920
the zoe command interface on your laptop

00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,279
and install the extension and it works

00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,440
with the back end

00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:31,279
but you have a choppy experience with

00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,240
passwords and ports

00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:35,279
having to be no do you have a

00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:38,079
configuration sort of complexity there

00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:39,040
zoe also has a zos component big

00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:41,200
powerful zos

00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,480
component and if that zos component is

00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,320
stored installed

00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,160
what it does is it changes this slightly

00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,360
because you just connect the command

00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,959
line interface

00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,519
to the api gateway in the uh in the z os

00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,680
component

00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,959
and that does all of the connectivity to

00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,560
the back end that you need to you don't

00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,680
need to know where these are located

00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,480
it can also do things like load

00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:03,360
balancing as well which is quite nice

00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,040
it can also present a single certificate

00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,480
so this certificate was self-signed

00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,000
perhaps or not trusted

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,079
uh you would have a trusted uh

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,160
certificate single certificate from here

00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:14,160
and also which is a very nice feature

00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,880
that was put in 2020

00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,920
because it's um it's an ed server and

00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,480
it's a proxy

00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,320
reverse proxy uh gateway it gives you

00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,079
the ability to do single sign-on your

00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,519
password is only used once

00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,839
and which ultimately gives you the

00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,200
ability to do multi-factor

00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:30,720
authentication

00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,959
okay so the next component i'd like to

00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:36,000
talk about is the zoe explorer

00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:39,680
also it's a vs code plugin so vs code

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:43,200
i think is a number one a popular ide

00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,320
and the so explorer sits conceptually on

00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,600
top of the

00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:49,440
cli so the zoe cli is written in node um

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,200
so not only does it have a command line

00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,720
textual interface it also has a lot of

00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,040
node classes and node packages that do a

00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:58,160
lot of the heavy lifting to do with uh

00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,440
talking down to zeo smf to get the data

00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,639
the zoe explorer

00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,959
uh sits on top of that and uh

00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,240
creates the plug-in to to vs code so

00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,760
architecturally it looks a little bit

00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,120
like that

00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:12,800
um to get the zoe explorer you could go

00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,440
to the vs code marketplace which is

00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:17,040
directly accessible from within um

00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,079
vs code itself you just click this

00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:21,600
little um doohickey right now for

00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:23,120
extensions type in the word zoe and

00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,320
you'll see the server explorer

00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,959
14 000 downloads so when when i last

00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,760
showed this

00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:31,440
um at a conference there it hadn't even

00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,200
passed three thousand downloads

00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,680
i think it did that back in march this

00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,800
year that was um in um in sharing in

00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,639
fort worth in dallas

00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,639
and if i went back time a little bit

00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:44,079
further on february

00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:46,000
uh when zoe version one came out the zoe

00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:47,920
explorer didn't even exist

00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,279
it was actually added in april so one of

00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,200
the nice things that makes

00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,480
me love working in open source is if

00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,880
that if the

00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,720
kitchen has a has the right ingredients

00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,800
and the right cooks and the right recipe

00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,959
and you know lots of open doors for

00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,720
people to to come in and be welcomed

00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,160
um good things happen and this is

00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,440
definitely much a good thing that

00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,480
happened

00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,200
within within zoe's lifetime already so

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,680
he's only

00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,040
about a year and a half old so let's go

00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:17,279
and have a look at the zoe explorer

00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:18,240
uh vs code is is an ide that lets you

00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,079
edit files

00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,720
because it's built on the cli same

00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:24,480
packages it can connect directly through

00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,639
to the data sets

00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,639
unix system services and jobs and i have

00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:32,320
a nice cobol file this is a

00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:33,920
a pds member open directly

00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,920
and i can edit it and say just straight

00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:39,040
back on the mainframe

00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,600
and uh i've got a extension that lets me

00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,199
um

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,279
syntax highlight cobol and because i've

00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,639
got that from the marketplace as well

00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:46,800
those all get blended together and you

00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,480
get this really nice fusion experience

00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,560
so let's look at some of the function uh

00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,000
you have the concept of

00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,600
favorites so you can bookmark your

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,279
favorite uh you know high level

00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,880
qualifiers or you can select them and

00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:57,760
expand them you can connect to multiple

00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,600
systems

00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:03,440
at the back end or work with them

00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:05,279
directly you can create members

00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,880
submit jobs once you submit a job you

00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,079
get a little sort of hyperlink tells you

00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,760
the job and when you click that you can

00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:13,120
actually go directly to the job

00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:15,360
or you can filter jobs and

00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,240
when you open a spool file for a job

00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,079
because it's

00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,600
built within vs code you get this sort

00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:21,279
of thumbnail view that lets you go up

00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,399
and down you can do control f i've done

00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,440
a little search you can see the

00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:26,560
occurrences of this

00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,199
it's a very nice productivity tool you

00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,440
don't have to

00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,320
sometimes in sdsf i'm constantly having

00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,560
to sort of

00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,320
um you know pf uh my way to the right

00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,760
hand side of my screen and do

00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,360
you know find and top and bottom

00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,920
commands in sdsf you can just do this

00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,760
with a

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,120
very familiar sort of control up control

00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,880
down command so you can also work with

00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:46,000
unix files and linux directories

00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:47,839
one of my favorites here is um is you

00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,199
can just upload files and

00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:50,880
you can just upload files straight from

00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:53,920
your desktop straight into

00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:56,399
a uss um directory you don't need to

00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,399
have a separate connection or sftp or

00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,600
or do an scp or anything like that

00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:02,240
that's really quite cute

00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,920
and that goes over https and that will

00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,600
because this is built on top of the cli

00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,120
that has single sign-on and multi-factor

00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,720
authentication you're still having the

00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,199
same authentication credentials and the

00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,839
same

00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:13,120
security that cmf provides on the back

00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:14,800
end

00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,480
so one of the neat things about the zoe

00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,600
explorer is

00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:21,680
where it's used so zoe is part of the

00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,680
open mainframe project and one of the

00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,199
things that the open mainframe project

00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,360
works with some

00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:29,279
collaborators last uh this year to do

00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,759
actually last year at finish this year

00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:33,199
uh github.com open mainframe project at

00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:35,680
cobalt programming course

00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:36,560
the need was recognized to have a

00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:40,000
training course

00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:41,920
um to teach people cobol using using the

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,040
you know the the tools of the day which

00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,800
is vs code

00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,880
and the zoe explorer squad are very

00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:49,040
proud and i'm very proud for them

00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,240
that the uh vs co plug in the zoo

00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,800
explorer is actually featured in the

00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,800
course so

00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,320
so people learning cobol are taught this

00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,240
using the zoe explorer but it's perhaps

00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:59,120
one of the reasons why it's got so many

00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:01,440
you know thousands of downloads this is

00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,959
my buddy uh jeff bisti uh

00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,800
phenomenal uh sort of personality in the

00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:07,120
mainframe community mastermind film is

00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,959
ring his t-shirt proudly there

00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,480
and he uh created a video that was

00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,680
uploaded in the same day that the course

00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,560
was uploaded he was one of the people

00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,120
who worked on the course

00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,240
he's already got 61 000 views so the

00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,320
video isn't called

00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,839
look how cool zoe is the video is called

00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,040
introduction to kerbal training course

00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,959
it's what you find when you go to

00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,320
youtube and you're learning it through

00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,440
the zoe explorer so there's something

00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,920
really nice when

00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,360
the technology of zoe is sold by the

00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,959
problem itself

00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,120
rather than the technology that's a

00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:36,800
really nice thing um

00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:38,240
a little uh on this story we're all

00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,279
in in lockdown and pandemic or

00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,000
whatever's going on in that sort of

00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:41,360
geography

00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,959
that we're at right now when the

00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,839
pandemic happened there was actually a

00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,199
demand if

00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:47,040
i look at job searches there was a big

00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:47,759
spike in the need for cobalt one of the

00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,000
reasons

00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:52,000
was because a lot of transactional uh

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,360
sort of government systems um

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,199
you know supporting people through the

00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,480
pandemic uh was written in kobe on the

00:16:55,199 --> 00:17:00,320
back end

00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:02,720
so uh this uh the course and

00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,600
um by sort of you know reflective glory

00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,480
the

00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:08,000
training course and the zoe explorer got

00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,319
got attention from that

00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,120
and it got eyes ended also within the

00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,400
cobol

00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,919
uh there's something called cobalt

00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,280
fridays that's great and i joined this

00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:18,000
sometimes and what i love

00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,679
is the kobold friday's features the zoe

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,679
explorer on their graphic and

00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,600
there was one i joined just uh just a

00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,039
month ago running a cobalt program

00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:28,079
the whole thing was taught using the zoe

00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:29,440
explorer which is just fabulous

00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,039
if you want to find out more i'll just

00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,280
give a shout out to two phenomenal

00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:34,640
people uh in the zoe community this is

00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,000
bill pereira he's part of the zoey on

00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,280
border squad he's got

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,679
a playlist lots of great uh educational

00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,200
videos he's got about using

00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:45,200
he's in the zoe explorer and he's also

00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:48,080
got ones about node

00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,880
and ansible and zoe and also jelly just

00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,160
like

00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,600
who's actually also speaking at this

00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,720
conference in some of the later talks

00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,760
she has a youtube channel called

00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,440
mainframe bites

00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,039
and she's part of the zoe explorer squad

00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,480
and she's got some great material

00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,160
on the zoe explorer that's definitely

00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,480
worth checking out if you want to find

00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,480
out more

00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:06,320
okay so the next major component we're

00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,679
going to take a look at is the

00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:11,280
zoe desktop now the zoe desktop

00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,600
doesn't require anything to run on a

00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,720
laptop other than a browser it runs in a

00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:18,559
browser it runs in the

00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:20,080
uh here it is in chrome um firefox it

00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:21,840
sets it against a number of

00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,679
kind of modern browsers and one of the

00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,760
advantages of that over perhaps

00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:27,840
something like the zoe explorer

00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,200
which requires vs code to be installed

00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,320
is that

00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,240
certainly within a lot of mainframe

00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,320
shops that i visit

00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,440
they actually have an issue deploying

00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,600
things onto

00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,960
desktops there's a cost associated with

00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,280
it there's a management

00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,280
associated with it some internal perhaps

00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:46,000
policies or politics or

00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:47,360
of charging about how mainframe groups

00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,400
can get things onto their

00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:52,880
uh corporate it desktops so and that's

00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,919
perhaps one of the reasons why the 3270

00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,440
has still

00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:56,960
to a certain extent remains a sort of

00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,039
prevalent

00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,880
mainframe interface that people use

00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:02,240
despite all the modernization as

00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,160
efforts that have kind of occurred

00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,039
within within the mainframe's life cycle

00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,480
so

00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:08,160
i'm very excited that the zoe desktop

00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,600
exists because that really cuts right

00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,360
through it

00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,280
in terms of sort of guardian not in that

00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,640
you all you need is the browser

00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,280
so here i am logging onto the zoe

00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:20,880
desktop with my tso user id and password

00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:23,200
now within missouri desktop it um

00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,000
it has a very a theme almost like your

00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,240
own sort of

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,080
laptop os itself you have some kind of

00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,760
app launch bar in the bottom left

00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,520
with the applications you can pin them

00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,679
on the bottom you can customize how

00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,960
how it looks and when you launch

00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:37,039
applications they run sort of

00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:40,000
picture-in-picture within the browser

00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:41,280
so here i've got i kind of one of the

00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,799
seams right at the start remember i

00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,720
talked about the things i was going to

00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:47,440
hark back to was all of the old was all

00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,960
of the new so there is a 3270 emulator

00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,400
within the zoe desktop

00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,400
and you can see on the right i actually

00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:55,520
have an ispf 3.4

00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,880
a dataset member open

00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,640
and that same member i'm actually

00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,640
browsing on the left hand side

00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,320
with a sort of nice rich graphical tree

00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,480
and the two can work side by side

00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,440
within the desktop remember i'm only

00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,880
logged on once i mean you're

00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,480
authenticated once upon a

00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,520
accessing these multiple applications

00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,360
we'll see a little bit more about how

00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,840
that works later on

00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:15,760
likewise jazz explorer is a kind of gui

00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,400
equivalent for sdsf which i'm showing on

00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,400
the right

00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,840
both able to work so you could have the

00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,280
rich kind of new

00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,200
experience where you can very easily

00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:26,559
scroll up and scroll left and

00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:28,400
um you know search within your job spool

00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:30,240
files or you can use ssf as that's what

00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:33,120
you're more comfortable with

00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:35,120
and again with unix isps 3.17 or we have

00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:38,960
something called the uss explorer

00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,960
and we actually have a terminal as well

00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:45,120
some folks i know actually don't like or

00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,559
prefer the picture in picture

00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,880
and they actually like to take a zoe

00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:50,000
desktop application and launch it full

00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,360
screen and you can do that you can

00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,880
select the graphic

00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,480
on the little launch bar and right mouse

00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,520
click it and just say open in new

00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,200
browser tab

00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,799
and you can spend all day working in

00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,679
this you can spend all day working in

00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:03,039
ispf

00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:07,280
or sdsf or you know uh

00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:08,960
you know i shell or the tso or um

00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,240
you know commands directly logged onto

00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,760
your mainframe if that's what you want

00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,400
and again a nice sweet spot with this

00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,480
which

00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,520
i actually know one company who deployed

00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,200
zoe uh

00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,559
just to get this is that there's nothing

00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,919
required on the desktop they didn't

00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,880
actually now need terminal emulator

00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,159
software

00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,000
you're just running within a browser so

00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,880
that's nice something that the squad did

00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,200
this year which is

00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,400
very cute is you have more customization

00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,919
options some people when

00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,120
they first saw the zoe desktop they said

00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:32,080
well it's a bit jarring i didn't like

00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,280
the color team

00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,200
not a problem you can select your own

00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,400
color you can upload graphics drag and

00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,559
drop graphics

00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,240
you can change your password either at

00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:42,080
login or just on an ad hoc basis which

00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,679
is useful perhaps it's expired or

00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,679
or you just want to change it you can

00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,200
select the language and as part of the

00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:49,520
zoe conformance program

00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,200
all of the applications that support

00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,919
language translation will then respond

00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,120
to that

00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:56,799
uh same request and then uh work and i

00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:59,840
you know i see it in japanese and i see

00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:01,600
desktops in french and things

00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,919
here i've customized my desktop with

00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,799
linux foundation uh background and a few

00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:07,039
other apps as well

00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:08,480
so now the neat thing remember zoe is

00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:09,840
not just about what you get in the tin

00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,240
but what you can extend it with the

00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:14,320
success of open source and excessive zoe

00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,679
are the apps within it the echo system

00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,960
uh the bazaar that surrounds the

00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:18,320
cathedral

00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,320
okay so let's look at how the zoe

00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,840
desktop works so within my browser

00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,440
you're connecting through the mediation

00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,960
layer nice single certificate single

00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,280
sign-on multi-factor authentication

00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,840
challenge a bunch of address spaces sort

00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:32,960
of microservices doing things like those

00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:36,159
uis i showed you beforehand um

00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,520
and the 3270 emulator the ssh running

00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:39,360
through a node server

00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,640
there's actually a cross memory serve in

00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,640
the back end but dwell on that too much

00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,960
but the nice thing about extensibility

00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:47,360
is if i look at here i can have an

00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:49,520
extensions within the zoe desktop

00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,720
and those extensions can either be

00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,000
iframes

00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,000
or they can actually be more native they

00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,320
can be sort of angular or react

00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,919
extensions and they likewise can go

00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,120
through the api mediation layer and talk

00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:01,200
to the existing server

00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:03,679
or the existing ui rest api server on

00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,679
the back end

00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,480
like the zoe cli there's a conformance

00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:10,000
program for those extensions all those

00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,240
plugins to work um

00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,600
and when they're extended they will

00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,799
appear in the search bar on the left so

00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,720
this is our base search bar

00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:17,840
this is the screenshot of one sega

00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,840
software

00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,039
uh roy boxwell from sega software

00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,960
there's a video that he did if you just

00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:26,159
google for segas and zoe

00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:28,640
uh he he co-presented um for zoe

00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:30,240
share recently um and he showed a couple

00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,919
of their apps that they've done

00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:35,600
got within the zoe desktop and

00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:36,960
coming up next there's a nice screenshot

00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,320
of one from roy's video

00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,000
where they're showing the sql workload

00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,120
expert for db2 running in the zoe

00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,799
desktop so again

00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,159
that benefits from multi-factor

00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:47,840
authentication which was a

00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:49,679
sweet spot for them and um

00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,960
that's the power of the zoe desktop is

00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,120
you have these base products

00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,799
run in the browser zero install on the

00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:57,200
client extensible

00:23:54,799 --> 00:24:00,240
and they're all backed by single sign-on

00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:03,039
which got multi-factor authentication

00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,640
for the zoe desktop but by no means

00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:05,840
least we're going to look at the zoe api

00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,000
mediation layer so we've talked

00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,279
about it a little bit already to do with

00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,400
the cli

00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:13,200
and the uh the web desktop they're both

00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,039
clients

00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,880
on the client side running on laptops

00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:18,240
either in your in your browser or

00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,080
where your jenkins server or your

00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,919
automation server is

00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,760
they're connecting to services on dos

00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,159
the mediation layer sits in the middle

00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,159
it's an

00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:27,200
edge server it's on the edge of your

00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:29,520
network it's a

00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,039
actually based upon netflix tool which

00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:33,039
obviously is a very scalable

00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:34,799
you know internet videos at scale and it

00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:35,520
provides a number of really key services

00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:37,120
and

00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:39,520
the first service it provides is

00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:42,080
authentication so when you authenticate

00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,120
you're not authenticating to the server

00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,640
beneath you

00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,880
on dos you're authenticating to the

00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:49,919
mediation layer it'll generate a token

00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,360
and that token is then used on stored by

00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:52,640
the client either in the browser cookie

00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,200
or the cli

00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,840
that's used on subsequent requests back

00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,279
and forth

00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:59,120
the mediation layer will then either

00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:00,240
flow that to the server depending on how

00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,559
it's registered itself

00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,400
or we'll use a pass ticket so you get

00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:05,840
multi-factor authentication single

00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,559
sign-on experience

00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:10,080
and that was something that i know with

00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:11,120
listening to roy box we'll talk about

00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,960
sega software

00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,360
coming to zoe that was one of the killer

00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:17,679
apps that they that they needed

00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:19,760
to to deliver to their customers and the

00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:21,440
zoe api mediation they gave it to them

00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,799
it also gives you configuration

00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,159
simplicity because

00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:25,840
if you look at all of these services

00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:28,640
here perhaps they're using

00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:30,400
tls 1.2 and secure socket layer they

00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,240
might all have individual certificates

00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,000
perhaps some are self-signed

00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,679
some certificates expire at different

00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,200
dates with the zoe mediation layer

00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:38,559
there's a single certificate that your

00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,200
browser

00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:42,880
client has to or your cli client has to

00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:46,240
validate the

00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:48,559
the trust and store in its trust or

00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,080
the mediation layer has to be configured

00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:51,039
obviously to trust all of these but once

00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,559
that's occurred

00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:54,400
you have a much easier client

00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:55,919
configuration also you know you need to

00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,559
connect to a single port you don't need

00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:59,919
to know where

00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:01,600
all of these are it provides some other

00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:03,039
services as well it provides an api

00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,640
catalog

00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:06,240
the api catalog is actually cute for

00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,679
developers because if you look at

00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,919
these are the five services that come

00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,559
with zoe and the api catalog if the

00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:13,679
service has

00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:15,279
swagger um it can publish its swagger

00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:18,240
and you have this nice try it out

00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:19,919
now so you can see here the data sets

00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,080
filter and you could just hit a button

00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:23,440
execute and you can see the result of a

00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,720
rest api

00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,480
you can get the curl statements it just

00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,720
copy and paste it into your favorite

00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,679
uh you know curl uh application that can

00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,120
issue cal commands

00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:32,960
and that's really cute you don't need to

00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:35,039
have swagger to benefit from

00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:38,159
reverse proxy services but swagger

00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:38,799
definitely helps your usability um if

00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:41,360
you do

00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:43,360
the discovery service is interesting so

00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,480
based upon netflix all if a request

00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,760
comes into a server

00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,760
these are all the servers that we bring

00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,480
up by default we bring up one instance

00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,159
of

00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,520
you know the explorer that we saw in the

00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:54,240
zoe desktop

00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,520
we bring one instance of the api's

00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,360
server for the um

00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:59,279
files apis that we saw but if multiple

00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,840
are brought up it'll say two three four

00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,600
five

00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,960
and what happens is when the request

00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,799
comes in from the client

00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,840
it sends it to the most available server

00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,640
and there's a different number of

00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,400
algorithms

00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,480
round robin is the most basic or

00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,919
depending on whether your server

00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,919
instance and how it registers itself

00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:15,600
with the api gateway

00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:16,799
that you can have more sophisticated

00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,600
sort of health checking and whether

00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:19,120
you're available

00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,840
but you basically get workload

00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:23,919
management through that and you get them

00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,360
you know at the dispatching of services

00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:27,120
to the most available server

00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:30,080
that's a very nice interesting feature

00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,080
of the api gateway

00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,760
now the remember zoe is not just what

00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,799
you get in the tin it's also the

00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,320
community people who

00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:37,919
can extend it that's very important and

00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,279
i hope you picked that theme up to that

00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:42,159
entire presentation so

00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:42,960
if we look at a couple of boxes here um

00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:45,120
we saw

00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,000
uh segas earlier with their product they

00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,720
were able to

00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,640
onboard their existing server up through

00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,840
the api gateway benefit from mfa and

00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,760
some workload balancing

00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,120
another one i'll quickly show you ims is

00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,360
something we did previously

00:27:55,120 --> 00:28:00,080
so ims connect lets you talk to ims but

00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:02,480
zoe has an ims operations api server

00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:04,480
and the ims cli can talk to that through

00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:07,120
that so you can get the

00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,240
multiple dispatching you can get the

00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,200
single sign-on multi-factor

00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,440
authentication

00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:14,320
and also within the api catalog if you

00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:16,240
think back i just showed five within ims

00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,840
when that's registered to six one

00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,360
appears there and you can click it

00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:22,960
and you can try it out now and you can

00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:25,520
test those okay um ims operations apis

00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,880
just as the cli just as a zoe desktop as

00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,399
a conformance program

00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,559
api mediation layer and these are the

00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:31,679
products that have zoe conformance and

00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,880
there's a really nice set of products

00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:36,320
there and i know there's some others

00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:38,240
that have applied it'll be coming soon

00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,840
and just finally to finish out let's

00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,440
have a look at what zoe's done this year

00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:43,520
and what it's looking to the future

00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,279
so the theme for this year really was

00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:47,840
enterprise ready for zoe

00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:50,080
um snp was available with a long-term

00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,440
support program for version 1.9 at the

00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:54,159
start of the year

00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,279
for the we've had ptf roll-up ptf uh

00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:57,600
delivered as smp

00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:58,480
a-pars since then zosmf workflows have

00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,840
been included

00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:02,080
for installation and configuration of

00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:05,279
key components of zoe certificates

00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:06,480
were first introduced into uh uss

00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:09,120
keystores which is a

00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,600
a java key store and customers told us

00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,120
that they

00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,640
liked having their certificates madison

00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,679
key rings that's just got added single

00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,520
sign-on

00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:17,440
multi-factor authentication was included

00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,720
lots more features that really make zoe

00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,279
more enterprise-ready and more

00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:24,320
enterprises are basically

00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:25,679
installing zoe and extending zoe for

00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,120
their products and the futures

00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:28,960
we're really doubling down on that

00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,559
that's a very successful strategy so

00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,480
client-side certificates are being added

00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:34,080
soon our customers have said that they

00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,240
want zoe to be a sort of always

00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:38,080
up endpoint they want high availability

00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,559
sysplex awareness of zoe

00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,840
um zoe has a lot of con uh java and node

00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:43,360
net stack if you think back to the

00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,080
architecture diagram customers have said

00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,600
that they want

00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,440
parts of that available to run in

00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,279
containers either on platform

00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,480
perhaps on the ccx or z linux or perhaps

00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:51,360
off platform as well that's very

00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,279
interesting

00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,640
uh strategy that we're taking zoe in and

00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:57,039
the zoe explorer which

00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:58,799
you saw earlier hugely uh important

00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:59,919
component uh you know underpins the

00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:02,320
cobalt

00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:03,760
uh training the open mainframe project

00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,799
did and there's a conformance program

00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,159
for that uh

00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:09,120
some vendors have said that they'd like

00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:10,960
to extend that for some of their

00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,080
some of their you know devops tools as

00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,919
well so that's something that you'll see

00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:16,000
coming soon within zoe and the dot dot

00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:18,000
dot the most important thing zoe is more

00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,039
than technology it's a community join

00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,720
the community

00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:22,960
that's how zoe's future is it's

00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:25,840
unwritten it's all in our hands

00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:27,120
and it's in summons and mine some is an

00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:29,360
open mainframe project but

00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,320
most of all whoever you are wherever you

00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:33,279
are listening

00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:34,000
the future of zoe's in your hands all

00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:36,080
right

00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,200
thanks everyone stay safe and enjoy the

00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,399
rest of the conference there's some

00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:43,440
great uh

00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:43,440
