	Zowe - What it Means for Mainframe Modernization, the Landscape of z/OS, How it Works, What it Delivers, and its Future - Joe Winchester, IBM 

Zowe is the first open source tooling project on z/OS. Since its announcement of open beta in August 2018and GA of version 1.0 in Feb 2019, it has grown in maturity and also in terms of its scope. This talk will cover the technology included with Zowe, with a focus on how Zowe can be extended by Independent Software Vendors and System Integrators. This talk will deep dive on the Zowe Explorer, the Zowe command line interface, the Zowe desktop, and the Zowe API Mediation Layer. How to install Zowe, how to configure Zowe, how to launch Zowe, how to monitor and tune Zowe. The talk will also cover the governance and rules by which Zowe operates, as well as give history into the mistakes that Zowe has made, the successes it has had, and a perspective in terms of the future of Zowe and its relationship to other open source projects on and off the mainframe.
