hello everyone i'm brian mellendorf

00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:05,839
executive director of hyperledger and i

00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,120
want to tell you a story

00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:11,679
my parents met at ibm in the early 1970s

00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:14,320
my dad rode cobalt and my mom was an sc

00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,679
selling system 360s or something

00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,359
we had punch cards lying around the

00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,640
house that we'd use for

00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:22,400
shopping lists and other various needs

00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,320
i remember my dad taking me to work some

00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,720
days during summers when i was in kind

00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,640
of mid

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,160
elementary school parking me in front of

00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,320
a green screen or maybe was

00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,920
an amber screen of some sort and telling

00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,559
me there was a basic compiler

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,160
uh an interpreter and prompt and to try

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,760
not to get into trouble

00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,160
i was learning basic at the time so i

00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,879
actually on the trs-80 that we had at

00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,559
home

00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:44,239
so i actually could reasonably entertain

00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:47,200
myself um but

00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,320
opsmek opsec schmopsec right i don't

00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,600
recall what i wrote

00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,760
i just remember writing something that

00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,760
would randomly peak and poke

00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,600
at random addresses and see what would

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,280
happen i don't think i ever got to do

00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,800
anything useful except this one

00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,800
thing i ran would cause my dad to come

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,640
out of his office cave and punch some

00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,159
buttons on a mainframe every time i ran

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,519
it and go back inside

00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,920
so i figured i might have done something

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,520
interesting some of us are old enough to

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,439
remember back when the word nerd

00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,560
was a slur it wasn't something you

00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:15,040
wanted to be called

00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,880
computers were not cool typing in basic

00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,560
programs from bite magazine to play a

00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,560
very primitive rpg

00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,799
or downhill ski racer or what or

00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,560
whatever was definitely not cool

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,479
but i still remember having an intuitive

00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,400
sense as i think my dad did as a few

00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:29,840
other kids in the computer lab did

00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,520
that there was something important going

00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,400
on with all these big computers deep in

00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,159
corporate basement

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,840
computer rooms and the small ones in our

00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,040
homes something that was going to be

00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,720
worth paying attention to

00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,400
despite the hazing that we would get

00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,799
from the cool kids

00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,240
that future was being invented it felt

00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,399
albeit quietly

00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,000
and something about this mattered of

00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,600
course in 1982

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,040
the big movie in our lives was the

00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,280
original tron

00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,119
suddenly nerds were heroes and computing

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,680
was no longer about running accounting

00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:58,640
numbers

00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,560
computing was now about good and evil it

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,320
was about corporate fascism versus

00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,079
freedom of speech and thought

00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,840
it was about autonomy versus central

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,280
planning and it was about love over

00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,039
hatred

00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,720
lots of other movies and before and

00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:13,920
after explored this domain from

00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:16,720
2001 and colossus the forbidden project

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,640
to the matrix obviously and others but

00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,920
for me and for others it was tron and i

00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,440
suspect that was really kind of a

00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,920
definitional generation

00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,879
our our mission as as nerds in this

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,599
space

00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:28,959
became the fight for the user uh this

00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:32,080
fight for computing

00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:34,080
was a tool for justice over corruption

00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,560
it was a tool to build this bedrock

00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,800
foundation for the society we wanted to

00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,080
build and in the society that did not

00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,920
exist yet right

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,440
um but the society we thought we could

00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,560
build with this technology

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,640
and we felt like we better get the

00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,599
details right and right from the start

00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,360
or who knows what would happen of course

00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:53,200
the internet came around and

00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,640
and and you know the early internet was

00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,360
full of technologies

00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,120
for sending email the prototype web all

00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,280
these different building blocks and it's

00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,480
it had that sense about it that it was

00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,760
being built by people who had this

00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,760
intuitive sense that this is

00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,239
not just about building reliable robust

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:11,120
systems but a fight for the future

00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,879
so fast forward 38 years to 2020. it's

00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,120
now no surprise to me that so many of

00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:17,440
the cobalt and mainframe systems running

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,280
from the late 1970s or even earlier the

00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,519
60s or the 80s or whatever

00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,120
are still in operation upgrading

00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:26,319
upgraded piecemeal or even

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,000
wholly joisted using virtualization but

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:30,080
still performing the thankless

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,760
routine essential functions that modern

00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,599
society depends upon

00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,959
the technical debt they accumulated

00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,239
driving things like the new jersey

00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,640
employment office's

00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,640
crunch for cobalt talent was not due to

00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,080
poor design originally but to a basic

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,720
failure of people's part

00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,640
to continuously iterate and gradually

00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,319
adapt and improve these systems

00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,239
these systems worked so well that the

00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:52,560
bureaucracy took them for granted

00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,080
forgot they even existed really truly

00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,640
they just became like the furniture they

00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,080
became a victim of their own success

00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,000
but i love that the open mainframe

00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,480
community is reawakening the

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,280
this this domain the the rigor and the

00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,280
design

00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,720
that built the modern computing era at a

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,760
time when so much of the rest of the

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,480
cloud world

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,239
is focused on disposable inefficient

00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,480
shotgun approaches as the tree

00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,400
shotgun approaches that treat

00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,239
reliability and robustness as an

00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,600
afterthought at best and as a needless

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:22,000
expense at worst

00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,440
it's like buying a tesla suv when what

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
you really need to haul that horse

00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,400
trailer is a ford f350

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,919
so much of the rigger comes down to that

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,960
rigor comes down to the word

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:34,479
transaction transaction it used to have

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,560
this sacrosanct place

00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:38,000
in computing because it was meant to be

00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,680
something you could rely upon something

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,800
that was designed to be absolutely

00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,440
impervious to

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,880
race conditions and mechanical failure

00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,199
mainframe architecture as i

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,400
hear as i understood it goes to

00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,400
tremendous links

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,560
to ensure that when the system can

00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,080
systems confirm your rights

00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,160
it's as good as gold being moved from

00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,560
one safe to another you can depend upon

00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,120
it

00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,840
you can run not only banking systems on

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,240
it you can run

00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,960
airline reservation systems on it you

00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,280
can run

00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,400
tax systems on it like this is for the

00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,080
systems of the world

00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:13,120
right where that kind of variability

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,639
just isn't tolerated then along comes

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,560
eventual consistency

00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,320
a well-intentioned approach to scale out

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,000
for services like twitter where if you

00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,720
miss a tweet in your timeline

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,039
meh you know so what no one's gold is

00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,560
being moved from one place to another

00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:28,320
then people started building content

00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,080
management systems on top of this

00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,919
not just for caching where again cache

00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,080
misses are a tolerable meh

00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:36,560
but for rights of new content and then

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:39,199
payment systems payment systems

00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,320
bitcoin is not a transactionally

00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,400
coherent system

00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,840
transactions are never totally finalized

00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,440
on the bitcoin network

00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,600
they are merely probabilistically

00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,199
correct since across a whole network of

00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,800
possibly unreliable nodes

00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,639
there is an inevitable possibility that

00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,120
the subset of the network you're looking

00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,720
at

00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,720
is not aligned with the subset i am

00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,240
looking at over time the portion of the

00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,720
network representing the most computing

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,039
power

00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,479
via proof of work wins out but you might

00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,759
be spending bullets for a while if you

00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:06,080
sold your house

00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,120
for bitcoin as that transaction might be

00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,960
blocked or worse

00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,039
even reversed on another fork of the

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,120
ledger with more hash power

00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:14,639
imagine if your mainframes only provided

00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,960
probabilistic correctness in their

00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:19,280
operation or eventual consistency

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,199
in the database that they that they run

00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,039
i'm not talking about stray neutrinos

00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,759
triggering memory faults in non-ecc

00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,479
memory

00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,759
i'm saying as designed and operated

00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,520
bitcoin and other proof-of-work

00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,120
transaction systems are not designed for

00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,440
the kind of settlement finality

00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,240
that you expect and need that businesses

00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,199
expect

00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,840
when conducting transactions for the

00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,600
last

00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,880
four years of hyperledger we've been

00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,560
working on a different approach to

00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,400
enterprise blockchain systems

00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,840
why because if blockch if business

00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,120
transaction networks go the way of

00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,440
consumer networks

00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,560
as tron's master control it go the way

00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,440
of consumer networks

00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,080
the future looks like uber and etsy and

00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,639
paypal

00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,800
and facebook just as centralized and

00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,000
powerful as tron's master control

00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,319
program

00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
this far into the internet revolution we

00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,840
shouldn't need centralized architectures

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,440
that only work reliably if everybody is

00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,400
running on one company's centralized

00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,280
database

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,720
sql or not we need business networks at

00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,639
least as federated and

00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,720
under centralized as the domain name

00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,479
system ideally even more so

00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,479
in fact i've started to avoid the term

00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,840
decentralized when talking about

00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,080
blockchains and distributed ledger

00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,000
systems and recognizing instead that

00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,520
there's usually a need for a degree of

00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,440
loose coordination of some sort

00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,800
necessarily involving humans

00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,800
so i've started to call it minimum

00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,400
viable centralization

00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,080
open source software actually gives us

00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,080
the perfect template for this sort of

00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,160
minimum viable centralization

00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,080
voluntary cooperation via shared

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,000
validation developers reviewing each

00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,000
other's patches and signing off on them

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,520
and merging in pull requests and all

00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,360
that kind of work with

00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,280
the right to fork the right to fork

00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,199
guaranteed by the open source license

00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,720
that guarantees you can take that

00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,240
somewhere else if you disagree with the

00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,280
direction that the core developers are

00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,479
taking the

00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,120
the rest of the software we can do that

00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,360
with soft

00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,360
not just with software source code ip we

00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,840
can also do that with databases

00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,160
and programs now that's why blockchain

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,720
technology is the next logical step

00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,479
in an arc that starts in the 1960s with

00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,440
open standards or if you want to go way

00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:18,160
back to the

00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,520
19th century with railroad gauges and

00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,599
screw shapes and

00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,919
and all that kind of thing to open

00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,800
source software in the 80s and really in

00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,520
the 90s and

00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,039
beyond to blockchain networks today this

00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,680
is about building cooperative

00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,479
voluntary business networks where

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,039
teutonic

00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,479
centralized fascist control over the

00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:39,519
transactions of the system

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,080
and the systems of the world are are not

00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,440
possible

00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:46,560
are our second to creating fair flat

00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,560
replica uh fair market systems

00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,480
we have a better shot at replicating the

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:53,040
kinds of checks and balances that happen

00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,399
in competitive and flat business markets

00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,920
through shared infrastructure like

00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,519
distributed ledger technology

00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,920
we have a better shot at that than we do

00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:01,440
at replicating those central platforms

00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,279
in fact in the modern financial markets

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,000
there are many such market utility

00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:07,200
operators

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,040
that we've seen from dtcc the depository

00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,920
trust and clearing corporation which is

00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,160
a

00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,760
co-op that tracks where who owns which

00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,320
shares of public companies on wall

00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,240
street

00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,880
to the original co-op model for the visa

00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,480
network blockchain technology replicates

00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,920
that utility model

00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,519
and that shared network function and

00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:26,080
that uh stakeholder

00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,880
uh type of of operation and it

00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,440
represents that

00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,040
in a technical architecture uh it

00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,160
represents that in a way

00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:35,279
more in in in a clearer way and a more

00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,680
closely aligned way

00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:39,040
than any sql database sitting at google

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,880
or amazon would

00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,640
this isn't an easy case to make to

00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,320
technologists sometimes but i think it's

00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,440
one that this audience would appreciate

00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,200
more than others

00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,800
how building markets to be fair

00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,560
resilient and just

00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,080
requires thinking about technology that

00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,160
uniquely enables that

00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,399
rather than on one focus just on speed

00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:59,120
or cost or capturing maximal returns

00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:01,680
through rent seeking from ivc investors

00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:04,000
but all this enterprise focus on the

00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,480
sanctity of transactions about replacing

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,519
old systems all of this is decidedly

00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,079
uncool

00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,760
uncool if you're a crypto bro looking

00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:13,760
for a quick pump and flip

00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,360
uncool if you're a performance maniac to

00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,120
whom a blockchain can never be anything

00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,959
but a slow database

00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,160
uncool if you're a vc looking for the

00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,000
next amazon

00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,600
and uncool if you're an activist who's

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,200
seen one too many well-intentioned

00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,959
social impact proposals

00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,320
from people who use magic blockchain

00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,320
tokens to

00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,360
naively incentivize away all the bad

00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,040
stuff

00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,880
maybe the mainframe community hasn't had

00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,560
quite the level of inflated expectations

00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,440
driven by quick financial exits that

00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,120
we've had

00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,120
but i think there's something tron level

00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,240
heroic in both the mainframe and

00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,360
blockchain worlds

00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,360
something about the fight against

00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,200
corruption the fight against errors

00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,640
the that cost people their livelihoods

00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,480
and even their lives

00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,160
something core to who we are in the

00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,320
blockchain industry

00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,000
and i'd argue that we're both we're both

00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,360
two technologies the blockchain world

00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,519
and the mainframe world

00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,880
that the cool kids love to hate but are

00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:04,160
or are becoming

00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,279
essential to how society works now

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,200
here i didn't talk at all about

00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:08,399
hyperledger really in this talk but i

00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,920
hope you all have a chance

00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,440
at some point in the next few weeks to

00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,040
take a look at what we're doing the

00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,360
kinds of problems people are solving

00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,240
with

00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,600
with hyperledger uh technologies the way

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,959
we're bringing rigor and trust to

00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,200
markets and problems where

00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:22,399
trust is the key challenge please join

00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:26,480
