to be able to moderate this panel

00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:46,399
discussion with um such experts

00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:48,159
uh talking about white collar blue color

00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,240
these are terms we've known about for a

00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,920
while have been using it for decades

00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,159
what this is is really a traditional

00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,960
entry into professional

00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:59,280
jobs through college graduates um and

00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:02,079
you know internships things like that

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,880
so then the question is what is this new

00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,759
term

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,560
new collar right new caller really

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,360
simply put

00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,440
is a non-traditional way a

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,080
non-traditional pathway to technology

00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,480
jobs

00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,480
so apprenticeships is you know one such

00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:20,080
opportunity to gain skills

00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:22,239
competency based scaling up right

00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,440
and so meredith i'd like to come to you

00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,480
first here

00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,640
and really from your role as you know

00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,519
overseeing the client skills

00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,280
um what what what is uh this going this

00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,280
going to look like

00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,720
great thanks so much sid arshna so a lot

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,720
of times when we're working with um

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,720
clients and with various employers uh

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,000
in the z area one of the first things

00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,760
that we really need to talk about is how

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,400
do we build that sustainable

00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,920
workforce for the future um really

00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,000
identifying what is

00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,519
that talent strategy and the first thing

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,959
is to determine what are the types of

00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,440
recruits that we're going after for

00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,080
these

00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,760
for these skills and for these jobs and

00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,560
typically in the past it's really been

00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,760
around

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,280
hey i want to go after early

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,680
professionals those individuals that are

00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,120
just

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,040
graduating from a four-year degree

00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,400
program or i want to go after

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,319
experienced professionals those

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,280
individuals that already have experience

00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,959
maybe

00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,159
five to ten years experience or whatever

00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,000
it is that you're looking for from an

00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:16,080
experienced professional

00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,599
but now there's this new category of

00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,080
apprentice and new caller

00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,800
where it really is that non-traditional

00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,080
candidate

00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,680
it could be individuals that have

00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,560
two-year degree programs it could be

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,480
individuals

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,480
who are looking to re-enter the

00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,480
workforce it could be individuals who

00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,560
are looking to

00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,519
change their careers um it could be

00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,840
folks that just aren't

00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,959
aren't really interested in taking an

00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,879
academic track

00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,159
but they're very very interested in the

00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,879
i.t field

00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:44,319
so from a skills program perspective we

00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,000
have all types of

00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:47,760
programs and assistance to help

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,400
facilitate each one of these whether

00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,519
it's

00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,280
if you're going after an early

00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,560
professional then how can you leverage

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,360
some of the relationships

00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,400
and um that we have with the academic

00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,680
initiative

00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,640
and university uh organizations around

00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,959
the world

00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,799
but if you want to go after apprentices

00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,840
and new collar we do have a new program

00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,080
that we're looking at

00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,599
for the u.s um that really targets those

00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,519
apprentices and how can we create that

00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,720
easy button to get that non-traditional

00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,480
workforce going

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,560
obviously from there you've got to go

00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,720
into training and being able to grow and

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,000
retain so we also have other programs

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,519
around that but we'll talk about the

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,160
training a little bit as we get into the

00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,919
apprenticeship program

00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,680
that is excellent so i do have a

00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,639
question you know oftentimes this comes

00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,840
up so what is

00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,240
an apprenticeship so an apprenticeship

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,320
is

00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,520
is very different if you will from an

00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,160
internship so many

00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,199
companies are very familiar with

00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,600
internships

00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,120
and apprenticeship is truly a structured

00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,400
program and earn as you learn

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,680
program where you hire an individual

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,759
and then they go through a very

00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,240
structured training program

00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,600
to learn the competencies that are

00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,560
needed to then graduate from that

00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,560
program

00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,120
these are associated with the department

00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,039
of labor as well as with state agencies

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,280
that provide these nationally

00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:04,800
recognized credentials upon completion

00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,600
and so you have defined

00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,479
training standards that the individuals

00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,639
go through

00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:12,000
you have on-the-job training and you've

00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,080
got mentorship

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,280
and you also have that formal training

00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,000
so it really is

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,680
focused in around training and building

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,280
very specific skill set

00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,800
for those individuals to then be

00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,400
credentialed upon the completion of the

00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,400
program and as

00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,600
these uh as they meet these different

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,199
competencies

00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,840
that's where you also get progressive

00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:34,400
increase within the wages and for those

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,960
apprentices

00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,160
so um i can see that this is you know

00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,000
hugely beneficial

00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,280
even from an employer point of view so

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,800
if you could just um

00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,120
highlight some of those benefits

00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,479
meredith absolutely so there's been a

00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,080
number of studies um

00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,360
around what are the benefits

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,400
particularly from an employer

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,919
perspective

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,160
for apprenticeship programs because

00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:57,039
apprenticeships truly are all around

00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,039
workforce development um it's typically

00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,960
focused on as i mentioned before going

00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,000
after a very diverse workforce going

00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,199
after

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,319
underrepresented populations veterans um

00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:10,800
ensuring that we have that diverse uh

00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,160
that diverse background in our in our

00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,000
talent pipeline

00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,840
and one of the key things that we're

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,840
seeing from an employer perspective

00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,960
around apprenticeship programs is really

00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,199
retention

00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,639
um it instills that loyalty in employees

00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,120
and in fact you see that

00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,639
uh quote there that 94 of employees say

00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,000
that they would stay at a company longer

00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,800
if it invested in their career

00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,319
development

00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,319
and that's what apprenticeships are all

00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:35,360
about so not only are you benefiting

00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,560
as an employer from that loyalty and

00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,479
from that retention

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,759
but there's also quite a bit of funding

00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:41,680
that's available out there from a

00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,280
workforce development perspective

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,840
and more importantly you're getting that

00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,479
very specific skilled workforce that you

00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,759
need

00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:51,440
to fill those talent gaps

00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,120
thank you meredith so it's great that

00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,400
there are all these benefits from an

00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,880
employer point of view and

00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,400

so clayton if i can come to you first

00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:07,199

tell us a little about you know the the

00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,800
journey that brought you here

00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,000
and what it's been like being part of

00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,759
the apprenticeship program

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,120
i know you're a recent graduate so we'd

00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:20,639
love to hear your story

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,479
yes ma'am so i started off um

00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,160
looking for work in the i.t industry

00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:27,440
without a degree which is

00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,400
a difficult challenge it's it's one of

00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,080
those fields where the

00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,160
employers are really looking for a lot

00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,160
of experience and or that equivalent

00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,720
college degree and i had neither

00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,919
so the apprenticeship was a great way to

00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,880
get into that field

00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:42,000
and it's um it's really the only path

00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,840
that i could find

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,840
with my level of experience

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,759
hold that thought um um thank you

00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,120
clayton i'll come back i do have a

00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,240
question but i'd love to hear from

00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,160
nathan as well

00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,479
so nathan i know you're a current

00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,240
apprentice so tell us a little about you

00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,840
know how you learned about it

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,280
you know what you think about it you're

00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,800
in the process so

00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:07,599
your thoughts please yeah so

00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,000
um i actually learned about the program

00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:11,759
through

00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,960
clayton um he reached out to me

00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:18,560
after he had graduated um

00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:21,440
and said hey you know they're they're

00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,080
trying this again it's a new wave do you

00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,720
want to

00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,879
try out and see if you can get on board

00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:30,879
and i said okay sure that's what we did

00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:35,200
and um i managed to get one of the slots

00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:35,599
um and my current experience with it has

00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,240
been

00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:41,599
great i really enjoy it i enjoy the

00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:45,040
structure of the program

00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:47,600
and honestly i've learned more about

00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,560
uh mainframing than i probably ever

00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,720
learned in my life

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,560
um you know and these this was an

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,320
industry i didn't think i could even

00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,959
get involved with until after i had a

00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,279
four-year degree

00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:01,040
so i had dismissed it entirely i didn't

00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,160
think there was a way to even get into

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,680
it

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,440
really and truly with my educational

00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,640
background i was kind of stuck to

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,399
entry level jobs

00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,160
that is an excellent point to make

00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,640
nathan about how the apprenticeship

00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,640
program

00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,720
truly does benefit in this

00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,480
competency-based sort of scaling up that

00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,920
we touched upon earlier right

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,080
so thank you for that so i'm going to

00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:25,279
come back to you clayton if i

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:27,519
if i may um so what if what would you

00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,320
say is some of the things that you would

00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,560
look for

00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,839
you know to stay on this role or you

00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,880
know what are some of the key

00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:38,399
um factors that are important to you in

00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:40,000
in a job well one of the most important

00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,720
things for me is to do something that i

00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
both enjoy

00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,040
and something that challenges me um it

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,959
is or

00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,640
just technology in general has always

00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:50,320
been a certain passion of mine and so

00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,120
being able to work in a field where i do

00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,240
that

00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,839
for a living is really the big draw i've

00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,399
worked in jobs in the past

00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,120
that um i worked in one as a

00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,959
photographer

00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,640
kind of doing i.t for the photography

00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,959
company and i actually stayed with them

00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,760
for

00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:07,200
a while just because i enjoyed the work

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,279
so much despite the fact that it was

00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,279
kind of a stagnating position

00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,560
and by contrast i worked for another

00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,959
company and

00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,720
was hired to do a technical role and was

00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,640
immediately switched out

00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,839
and made to do something else and i left

00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,839
within six months on that one

00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,440
and we're we're glad to see that you're

00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,320
here and

00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,640
um so how have you so you really enjoy

00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,959
the

00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,320
the mainframe role that you're in as a

00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,240
sys admin

00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,800
tell us a little about linux is a

00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,800
personal personal uh hobby of mine and

00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,240
so being able to to work on that on the

00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:43,279
mainframe is

00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:45,600
it is a wonderful role for me

00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,800
excellent so nathan how about how about

00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,959
you um

00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,959
you know in terms of do you resonate to

00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:54,000
those thoughts and feelings around

00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:57,120
what is critical or key of components to

00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,120
to a role that you would have

00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:01,040
you know i agree with uh clayton on all

00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,120
those points

00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,560
i think that those are really important

00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,160
for

00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,760
people to find satisfaction and

00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,680
fulfillment in the job they're in

00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,320
and you know if you if you feel like

00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:15,200
you're just lacking

00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,240
i feel like employers can't save their

00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,560
retention rates

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,160
if employees just don't feel like they

00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,760
want to be in that job it doesn't matter

00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,760
how much they're getting paid

00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,120
it doesn't matter the kind of benefits

00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,519
you're offering them if

00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,120
if they're not liking the work if they

00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,519
feel like there's no room to grow

00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,200
if they feel like there's no challenge

00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,240
in the job that they have they're going

00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,920
to

00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,959
they're going to switch it out they're

00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,839
going to leave they're going to find

00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:40,079
someone else who

00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,560
who might offer them those those things

00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:44,480
that are missing

00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,240
excellent thank you both so much for

00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,360
sharing your you know personal

00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,160
experience and this

00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,440
and you know what is key and important

00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,480
to you both

00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,880
so meredith if i can come back to you

00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,040
how can clients participate in this

00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:01,360
apprenticeship program

00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,800
great thanks so much production so what

00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,800
we really wanted to do with the

00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,160
uh apprenticeship program is take all of

00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,320
the lessons learned that

00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,600
we've that we've gone through from an

00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,680
ibm perspective

00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,360
and having apprentices in various roles

00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,399
and then how can we easily make that

00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,760
available

00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:20,560
to employers all across the us um

00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,959
and how can we create that cohort if you

00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,480
will

00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:25,839
of of new to disney individuals coming

00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,000
onto the platform

00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:29,760
get them through the training right and

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,200
have them work together as a community

00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,920
through that which we've seen be very

00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,839
successful

00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,440
which is why we we typically are always

00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,200
hiring in pairs or more

00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,800
um to ensure that there is that that

00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,480
sense of belonging again they've got

00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:43,040
somebody that they can work with

00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,480
um on the platform so to do that what

00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,079
we've been able to do is to partner with

00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,760
a third party a non-profit

00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,680
who's going to actually help with the

00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:53,440
recruitment of the

00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:56,160
diverse talent pool so whether it's

00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,240
individuals that are coming from uh

00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,480
underrepresented populations

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,839
also working with veterans so for

00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,000
example the department of

00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,680
labor has a new veteran program where

00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,720
they've got placement counselors at

00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,920
multiple bases all around the u.s um for

00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,040
service men and women who are

00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,480
transitioning from

00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:16,480
military service into civilian life and

00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,720
helping them to place them into these

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,399
types of apprenticeship programs

00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,760
also just working with the third parties

00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,639
ecosystem network

00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,480
um to help recruit this diverse talent

00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:29,839
and this non-traditional talent

00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:31,200
so employers need to identify the types

00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,320
of positions or the

00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,920
the types of roles that they're

00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,399
interested in hiring whether it's that

00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:38,480
sysadmin sysprog or whether it's the

00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,680
application developer identify the

00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,120
locations

00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,040
where those individuals are going to be

00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,120
placed so that then this third party can

00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:48,160
work in those local areas

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,920
to identify and recruit local talent the

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,680
next thing that happens is then this

00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,360
these individuals these candidates go

00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,240
through a pre-apprenticeship program

00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,800
this is a 12-week

00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,639
about a 12-week program it's all virtual

00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,120
um and it will take these individuals

00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,600
through

00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,680
training from introductory computer

00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:06,800
science but also into

00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:08,880
specific zos topics as well um and the

00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,839
importance of this is not only are these

00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,800
individuals

00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,760
getting exposed to this technology but

00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,880
they can determine

00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,959
are they passionate about this

00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,240
technology and so as as nathan and

00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,519
clayton were talking about

00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,600
that it's very important that

00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:22,800
individuals are passionate about what it

00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,480
is that they're working on

00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,160
and so this gives them an exposure to

00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,440
this technology to determine

00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,440
do they have an affinity for this

00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,480
technology and from an employer

00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,480
perspective

00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,160
it gives them the idea or it gives them

00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,519
insight into does the individual

00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,000
actually have aptitude

00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:40,399
for this type of technology so once they

00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,920
complete that pre-apprenticeship program

00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,079
and they graduate then they are

00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,600
available for hiring into the

00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:47,760
apprenticeship program by these

00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,399
employers so the employers would then

00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:53,199
hire these pre-apprenticeship graduates

00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,600
for a one-year apprenticeship program

00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:56,320
and

00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,079
during this apprenticeship program they

00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,199
would gain the on-the-job training so

00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,959
the employer would provide that

00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:03,199
on-the-job training

00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:04,079
while the individuals are also getting

00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:06,079
formal training

00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:08,720
and all of that formal training is

00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:10,480
administered by this third party

00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,000
um and ensuring once again it's also

00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,320
available all virtually which is why

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,839
we're able to do this across the us

00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,440
and then upon completion of that

00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,519
apprenticeship program

00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,600
they will earn the department of labor

00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,720
credential as well as the state agency

00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,800
credential

00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,560
um for those individuals and then be

00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,920
available for have that skilled

00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,920
workforce that's available for those

00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,600
employers for long term

00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,320
so it's really providing that easy

00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,720
button for employers to not only

00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,560
have a service that recruits has a

00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,079
service that takes these candidates then

00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,480
through that pre-apprenticeship program

00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,480
to help to vet those candidates and then

00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,600
to have the employer hire them as an

00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,920
apprentice

00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,199
continue that wage step increase provide

00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:52,000
the technical mentorship

00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:54,399
provide the the on-the-job training so

00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,320
that they can also get

00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:57,519
get a better understanding of of how

00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,600
that company

00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,639
um actually implements their z

00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,160
environment

00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,880
and then they graduate and have that

00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:08,000
skilled workforce

00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:11,199
that is excellent um so i think that

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:14,720
comes up to you know so why or how

00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:17,120
um would the clients be par participate

00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,040
in this program in terms of benefits

00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,639
that they stand to gain or

00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,720
what kind of commitment are we looking

00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,240
from them

00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,320
as i mentioned before we really wanted

00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,160
to create this easy button and so

00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,920
the benefits that the employers gain are

00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,800
number one the recruitment service with

00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:34,079
that once again

00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:35,199
real focus on diversity having those

00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:37,199
vetted candidates through that

00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:38,880
pre-apprenticeship program once again to

00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:40,639
to determine is there not only an

00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:43,040
affinity towards that technology but an

00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:45,279
aptitude toward that technology

00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,480
over 300 hours for each one of these

00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:48,240
programs for

00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,240
the application developer as well as for

00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:54,240
the um sysadmin says

00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:56,720
program over 300 hours of training at no

00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,079
charge to the employer apprenticeship

00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,959
program administration so

00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:02,959
not only um will the third party be

00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:05,760
doing the recruiting but they'll also

00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:06,799
administer all of the apprenticeship

00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,319
overhead if you will

00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:09,679
an administration of that apprenticeship

00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,199
program with the department of labor and

00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:13,360
with the state agencies

00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,640
in addition to assigning success

00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,640
managers to

00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,240
the individual apprentices to help them

00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,600
ensure that they are successful in going

00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,679
through the program

00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,640
and then they get the skilled ibm z

00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:24,240
talent

00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,480
so what do we need from the employers

00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,240
well we need some commitment

00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,720
we need them to commit to hiring a

00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,400
specific number of pre-apprentices

00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,840
for that one-year apprenticeship so they

00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,080
need to identify

00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,840
the number of whether it is um which

00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,400
role so is it a sys admin is this this

00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,280
prog

00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,240
is it a mainframe application developer

00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,360
and how many

00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,400
and what location uh then once they hire

00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,360
those individuals

00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,799
assign a technical mentor enable those

00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,640
apprentices to attend those virtual

00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,960
training programs and provide those wage

00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,720
step

00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:58,799
increases but that's it and ideally we

00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,520
want to start our first cohort

00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:02,880
um in this fall the first cohort of

00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,320
pre-apprentices going through the

00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,080
program this fall

00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,480
and then being hired at the beginning of

00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,640
2021.

00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,880
that sounds exciting meredith all the

00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,880
very best to the program

00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:17,039
i'm going to turn to theresa at this

00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:21,600
moment here to talk a little about

00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:24,160
the new disease community um theresa

00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:26,320
yeah sure so meredith actually touched

00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,640
on a really good point where

00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,919
she mentioned that we often encourage

00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,640
clients to hire

00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:33,919
in at least pairs and the reasoning for

00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,799
that being that

00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:38,720
it helps these early professionals to

00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:40,559
already you know have somebody have a

00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,799
community alongside them and

00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:44,240
encourages them to enjoy what they're

00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:45,919
doing a little bit more when they have

00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,799
people with them who are in the same

00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,559
boat

00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:50,799
but not everybody is that lucky that

00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:53,440
they get to start with others

00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:55,200
in in the same way that they are so we

00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,799
have the new to z community

00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,720
which brings together any early

00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:00,240
professional working on the mainframe

00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,720
for less than 10 years

00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,440
and it helps them connect to others like

00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:07,280
them

00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:09,520
maybe mentors to workshops

00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,280
and also gives them a platform to become

00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,360
leaders in this space

00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:15,280
so again like meredith was mentioning we

00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,679
want people who are excited about this

00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:19,760
technology and excited about their jobs

00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:22,080
and as early professionals the new to z

00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:24,320
community is a place for them to

00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,440
not only find that excitement but grow

00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,679
it as well

00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,760
so we have many folks in our new to z

00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:32,400
community who are now leaders

00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:34,799
packing their companies or leaders on

00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,640
the new to see community helping to

00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:39,760
facilitate workshops speaking at

00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:42,320
conferences and even creating content

00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:44,000
and it's a great community for everybody

00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,000
especially apprentices who

00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,880
are starting on this technology to

00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,840
continue to grow their career

00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,520
this is exciting um i could see how this

00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:56,240
is very very valuable

00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,440
right to bring these folks to the new

00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,320
physique professional

00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,880
folks together and really feel a sense

00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,520
of

00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,919
belonging right and i think that is that

00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,080
is

00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,960
huge in terms of how successful one

00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:10,000
would be

00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:12,320
in and through their career um

00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,799
and i want to just take a moment here to
