	Cloud Foundry Orchestrated by Kubernetes on Linux on IBM Z - Vlad Iovanov, SUSE & Dan Pavel Sinkovicz

The effort to make containerized Cloud Foundry orchestrated by Kubernetes on IBM Z was started several years ago as part of the Mainframe Project mentorship program. Three years later, the goal of this year's summer mentorship is to make on-going s390x builds of containerized Cloud Foundry a first-class citizen in the CF Project. This session will provide a background of previous years projects as well as results of this year's effort.
