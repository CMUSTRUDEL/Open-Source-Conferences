hello and welcome to today's panel a new

00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,000
world is dawning the mainframe

00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,080
imperative that lies ahead

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,440
my name is rick peret i'm on the

to kick off our executive track today we

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,320
want to put some things into perspective

00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,320
look 2020 has been a challenging year

00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,800
full of a lot of uncertainty

00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,320
and with covert among us many people

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,840
think that's really been the root cause

00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,880
of all that's been happening

00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,880
in many respects it's really accelerated

00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,399
many issues that have been in play for

00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,559
the past few years

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,120
so we brought this panel together to

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,120

with george

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,879
george can you shed some light on some

00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,760
of these global issues

00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,640
and what some of these large external

00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,760
factors that are

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:32,879
impacting all of us today

00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,840
sure thanks rick so

00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,080
things are changing and they're changing

00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,400
fast

00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,080
i'd like to look at three significant

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,760
areas of uncertainty facing

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,920
organizations today

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,360
so obviously we're in the midst of a

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,920
global pandemic

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,720
but i like to focus on other factors of

00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,319
uncertainty

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:54,080
i feel will greatly outlast the pandemic

00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,560
and i hope the other panelists here

00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,720
today will agree with me

00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,120
the three topics i really want to focus

00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,920
on are global politics

00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,280
changing business models and demographic

00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,319
shifts

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:11,280
so first global politics

00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,560
this is really world trade international

00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,720
trade relationships

00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,680
are decaying the world trade

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,879
organization

00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,599
g7 they have much less power now than

00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,640
they did

00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:24,879
just a few years ago countries

00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:28,080
are starting to create more direct

00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:30,080
unilateral relationships to one another

00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,440
and this creates complexities for

00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,799
companies that want to

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:38,159
do global trade it's very difficult

00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:40,159
for global businesses i have a firsthand

00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:43,440
example of this being with broadcom

00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:45,120
largely a semiconductor company

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,680
last year when it looked like we were

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:51,120
going to have a trade embargo with china

00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:54,080
our ceo had to announce to wall street

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,959
that this was going to cause us a loss

00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,640
of over

00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:00,000
2 billion annually so you can see global

00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,760
politics can have a huge

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,159
effect on international business

00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,239
so that's the first factor i'd like to

00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:11,599
put out there as a large

00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:13,840
change agent the second area affecting

00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:17,040
organizations is new business

00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:19,519
so obviously technology will continue to

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,479
disrupt and create new business models

00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,840
and this is not

00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:26,320
nothing new of course but i believe it

00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,000
will continue to accelerate

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,919
no business is immune look at the

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,120
disruptions over the past

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:34,320
10 years right retail disrupted by

00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,800
amazon an upstart

00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,400
bookseller entertainment turned on its

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,199
head by netflix

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,080
transportation overnight uber and lyft

00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,639
became global

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,160
transportation companies and even

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,919
industries where it looks like you need

00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,000
a lot of capital to break in

00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,040
like hotel and tourism have been

00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,400
disrupted by

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:56,960
players like airbnb so technology is

00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:59,840
obviously going to continue to disrupt

00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,520
on business models um the other thing

00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,400
that will affect business models

00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,120
um increased consumer activism so

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,800
consumers

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,759
continue to put their money in companies

00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:14,000
that they perceive

00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:16,560
are doing good they like to

00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,479
back the underdog companies like warby

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,479
parker and toms

00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,800
would have sort of pioneered this buy

00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:26,000
one give one to charity

00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,919
which has become popular and

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,840
social issues like privacy and

00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:32,880
environmental friendliness are

00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:36,880
influencing which companies come out

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:38,639
winners and the last thing changing that

00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,720
changing business models as a global

00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,600
supply chain so

00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,680
global supply chains uh have switched

00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,880
completely in the internet age where

00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:51,919
small companies have access to goods and

00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,759
manufacturing of goods that they that

00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:56,400
only much larger companies could

00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,919
years ago so this is of course allowing

00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,560
um physical disruption

00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:01,440
for companies that are able to produce

00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,560
goods that weren't

00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,639
able to before so global politics new

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:10,000
business models the last factor

00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:11,440
is demographics so this really has to do

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,280
with the shifting demographics

00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,880
millennials are becoming the majority of

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,639
the population

00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,479
and their behaviors are very different

00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:21,199
from the baby boomers and

00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:23,280
generations before them they're much

00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,919
more educated and as a result

00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,840
they have a lot of student debt on

00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,840
average they save 36

00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,000
more than previous generations and they

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,319
prefer to rent over buying a house they

00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,600
would rather rent in the city

00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:39,520
all this will have an impact and will

00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,520
suppress spending which will have an

00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,400
impact on the economy

00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,479
so in summary global politics new

00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,360
business models and demographics these

00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,520
are

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,039
i think some of the major factors that

00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,800
are going to affect us in the upcoming

00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:55,520
years

00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,599
thanks george tim meredith you deal with

00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:00,000
a lot of clients

00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:01,039
how are these factors impacting business

00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,160
priorities

00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,160
tim let's start with you

00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,160
yeah thanks rick you know like taking

00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,759
what what george

00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,680
has said and bringing that to the

00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:14,720
mainframe now i've talked to

00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:17,120
to many many clients over the past

00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,160
four or five months and what what we're

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,639
seeing

00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,319
is that they're seeing great they're

00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,240
talking about great shifts

00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,759
in their workloads running specifically

00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,599
on the mainframe

00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,680
for many of them it's actually an

00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,639
increase in workloads of their of their

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,400
business

00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,160
uh some of them have told me their their

00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,520
shifts within lines of business within

00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,120
the company so

00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,360
one area of their mainframe or a

00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,360
particular lpar might get hot

00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,039
you know and other other areas are

00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,120
actually cooling down so

00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:47,039
these workloads are are shifting and

00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,280
changing as a result of these

00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,800
these very fast you know global events

00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:54,160
that we're seeing so they're

00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:56,479
they're really focused now much more on

00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,240
how do i protect that mainframe how do i

00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:01,919
make sure it's prepared

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:04,639
for these shifts in in that workload

00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:06,400
and and how how are they making sure

00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:09,680
that they're resilient

00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:11,599
that they're able to recover and back up

00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,039
in the stated time objectives

00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,960
and they're really more interested in

00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:17,440
and what they can do and what's new

00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,720
say in the last couple of years that

00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,199
they're able to exploit

00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,840
uh to do that so i've had a lot of

00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:27,440
conversations with with customers around

00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:30,800
is there software available to me that

00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:32,800
leverages things like ai or

00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,959
intelligence or actionable intelligence

00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,880
that discovers the state of normal

00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:39,120
and can tell me when my system is

00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,680
starting to step outside of normal

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,159
so they can be alerted and prepared

00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:46,640
they're also looking for systems to say

00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:48,320
uh can i test that i'm recoverable

00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,839
within my stated time objective so

00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,760
they're really looking

00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,519
inward you know at their mainframe

00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,360
looking at those things that

00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,560
we traditionally here in this group know

00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,839
the mainframe

00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:02,560
absolutely excels at at resiliency

00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,360
at uh adjusting for those workloads and

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,200
being

00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,760
uh capable of that but they want to make

00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:10,640
sure seeing these changes happening

00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,560
faster than they ever happened before to

00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,480
their system is their system prepared

00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:18,000
for that

00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:20,880
another thing i hear is is that

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,160
how can we automate how can we leverage

00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,560
and modernize

00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,959
and transform my mainframe so it takes

00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:29,920
care of more of that automation for me

00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,880
the things that i'm i'm focusing on um

00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,480
you know daily

00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:36,800
to how can i set up software

00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,920
that takes care of that for me uh so i

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,959
can focus more

00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,880
on on the future so they're looking for

00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,640
any sort of advantages they can take in

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,200
in automation

00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,399
and then lastly uh talking about that

00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,640
shift in workforce

00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,839
how that george talked about as they're

00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,080
hiring more people

00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:56,399
and the people that know the mainframe

00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,600
uh are retiring they're very very

00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,279
interested in

00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,120
how can i make the mainframe more

00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:03,040
familiar how can i make it more

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,600
accessible how can i make

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:08,000
interacting with the mainframe more like

00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:11,200
you know any other system

00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,800
that's out there more cloud-like more

00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,680
linux-like

00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,120
more server-like and we know there's

00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,160
there's software out there and this is

00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,079
where open source

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,440
you know plays a big role in making it

00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:23,600
more accessible

00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,920
and they're looking at transforming even

00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:29,600
their development organizations

00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:31,360
more from waterfall to agile

00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,640
so what systems are out there on the

00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:37,360
mainframe to help do that

00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,079
to automate over those those processes

00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,120
of building

00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:43,200
and testing and releasing that software

00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,720
you know even ibm themselves has gone to

00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,800
a continuous integration

00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,000
continuous delivery model for many of

00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,320
the mainframe

00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,440
systems and software so they're looking

00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,680
for their vendors

00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,640
you know to do that and looking

00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,240
internally

00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,800
saying how can we do that on our

00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:01,040
mainframe so that we can adjust to these

00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,720
shifting priorities we can look for

00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,800
competitive advantage

00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,079
by coming out with a new line of

00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,920
business very quickly

00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:09,519
so how can they do that on their

00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,880
mainframe to make sure that they're

00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,480
agile

00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,480
and that they can they can come out with

00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,399
that you know very quickly

00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,760
and again open source plays a big part

00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,600
in that

00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,600
you know good good point uh great points

00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,000
tim and and certainly broadcom where i

00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,640
work

00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,040
uh we we are very much focused on ci cd

00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,560
as well

00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,320
as far as continuous delivery and

00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,240
improvements uh meredith

00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,480
um can you give us the perspective from

00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,160
your from ibm

00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,320
absolutely i'd like to kind of build a

00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,959
little bit on exactly what tim

00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,000
and both george have been saying um in

00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,320
today's environment

00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,240
the very nature of that it

00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,680
infrastructure is truly being challenged

00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,640
by the sporadic and

00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,120
unforeseen workloads um the businesses

00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,360
need

00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,040
agility to dynamically scale and meet

00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,360
that compute capacity

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,680
but in a very non-disruptive cost

00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,920
effective and dependable manner

00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,880
in a way that that delivers confidence

00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,399
right and

00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:05,440
the ability to respond to these

00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,880
unprecedented changes and demand

00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,680
they also need the ability and what

00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:11,200
we're seeing is to quickly switch data

00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,040
centers right to meet availability

00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,040
requirements so when external or

00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,200
environmental forces disrupt existing

00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,360
locations for example

00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,399
wildfires or they disrupt workforce

00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,880
availability

00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,160
they need that ability to switch quickly

00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,720
so once again as

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,800
as tim mentioned those core quality of

00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,360
services that ibm z and linux 1 are

00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,480
known for

00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,680
security scale resiliency truly delivers

00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,360
that flexibility

00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,519
that confidence the predictability that

00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,160
the businesses need

00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:41,760
in these uncertain times and in fact

00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,480
there was a study that was done

00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,399
and it showed that organizations are

00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,360
facing massive changes to their business

00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,040
right now

00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,279
four times the number of employees are

00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,279
working from home so 45

00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:54,959
now versus eleven percent before covet

00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,399
and so the various impacts that that has

00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:58,959
on business

00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,720
and processes and the ability to to work

00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:03,120
in an agile manner

00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,279
um 84 of executives are expecting

00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,160
customers to prefer online channels for

00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,000
engagement

00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,600
so this results in that unexpected need

00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,959
for increased capacity across

00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,760
all digital channels for example ibmc

00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,839
clients

00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,839
they temporarily activated a total of

00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,959
nearly four times more general purpose

00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,040
capacity

00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,320
using the the capabilities of capacity

00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:26,639
on demand in 2q

00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:29,200
2020 compared to the same time last year

00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:31,120
57 of customers are now seeking

00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,600
environmentally or socially conscious

00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,200
products

00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,600
this is something that george talked

00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,680
about about as far as the changing from

00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,920
from consumer needs and in fact more

00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,279
than 30 percent of germany's post coven

00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,600
recovery aid program

00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:45,360
it's tied to those green initiatives

00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,800
once again this is a key place

00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,680
where ibm z and linux one have a proven

00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,720
track record

00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:54,800
and in the field of energy efficiency

00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,839
there is a recent example a large

00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,480
insurance company

00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:00,880
in asia pacific they were faced with

00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,959
rising data center and software costs

00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:05,199
they deployed linux one for its database

00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:06,560
as well as application server workloads

00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:09,040
and after they saw significant

00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:11,120
efficiencies and savings with linux one

00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,320
in their dr site they they rolled it out

00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,480
further in fact

00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,399
two linux one servers along with the

00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,720
software and the services so about 300

00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,720
cores

00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:28,399
replaced 6400 cores on 100 x86 servers

00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:30,079
the result 71 lower electricity

00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,480
consumption for that client

00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:33,519
and with the fewer soldiers

00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,000
administration

00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:39,360
efforts are reduced and the associated

00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,360
carbon footprint as well

00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,240
so in addition so you've got all those

00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:46,639
factors but we're also seeing these

00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,920
these top three immediate business

00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,920
priorities and

00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,519
as mentioned before many of them were

00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,160
already there and those priorities were

00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,240
in place

00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,440
beforehand but they're now being

00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,399
accelerated

00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,120
number one is just survival that ever

00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,199
increases

00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,160
pace increasing pace of change the new

00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:04,480
product cycles

00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,279
unperceived challenges it's driving this

00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,199
focus

00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:09,519
on demand management and that customer

00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:12,639
experience so the need to speed

00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:15,279
digital transformation and for the ibm z

00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,560
platform make it truly interconnected

00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:19,360
via that hybrid cloud

00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:21,839
and application modernization uh we're

00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,680
also seeing that ongoing transformation

00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,040
evolution or that reinvention is

00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,199
absolutely key

00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,120
to enable organizations to navigate

00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:31,360
these inevitable next shocks

00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,240
so really bringing that agile workforce

00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,639
agile

00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:40,000
working ways and devops to the forefront

00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:42,079
second is around simplification complex

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,320
processes are absolutely inadequate for

00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:47,120
the case that we're driving today

00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,959
so that need to simplify uh whether it's

00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,680
through deployment of containers as i

00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,800
mentioned before

00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:54,079
agile development all of this linked

00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,240
back to the new workforce

00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:58,079
that we were talking about earlier in a

00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:01,040
sustainable workforce

00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:02,000
to adopt those common and modern tooling

00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,720
and then find

00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,360
super scale so to stay in business

00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,720
clients

00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:10,000
they strive for that competitive

00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:12,240
advantage and so that ability to

00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,480
adapt and benefit from existing

00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,000
technology or new technology to really

00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,079
help to scale that

00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,279
is essential and nothing speeds

00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:23,680
innovation

00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:26,160
like open source communities

00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:28,639
excellent excellent thanks thanks very

00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:31,199
much uh meredith and tim

00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,920
so brent you know we've heard change

00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,720
innovation

00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,000
survival you know open you know how do

00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,320
these open platforms

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,839
really help in supporting change and

00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:44,800
this agility that's that's that's needed

00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,040
absolutely rick i love this question you

00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,519
know

00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:49,040
openness really plays a much bigger role

00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:51,120
than just supporting

00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,360
change and agility to the point where

00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:56,160
openness is really necessary

00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:58,079
for enabling change and agility today

00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,320
let's see a couple of key elements for

00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:04,079
enabling

00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:06,720
the key elements of an open platform

00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:08,079
which include the ability to maximize

00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,480
interoperability

00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:12,079
between systems and the portability

00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,240
across systems

00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:16,400
with these characteristics open

00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,640
platforms then make it possible

00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,439
for the industry to collaborate in

00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,240
developing

00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,760
interoperable tool sets and portable

00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,760
applications across the diverse

00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,760
ecosystem

00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,760
these are the ingredients to enable

00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,840
rapid change and agility

00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:34,000
and being able to respond to unforeseen

00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,120
events and circumstances in a timely

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,240
manner

00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:40,559
which we've had plenty of lately now

00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,679
when you look at today's it platform

00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,760
ecosystem

00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:45,039
it's more diverse than at any time in

00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,919
our history

00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:48,480
this diversity can be a challenge then

00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,320
also

00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,240
it can be a great opportunity

00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,240
potentially allowing developers and

00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,480
businesses to utilize

00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,440
the most optimal systems for the problem

00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,720
at hand

00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:03,280
wherever that may be but clearly

00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,440
is greatly simplified with the use of

00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,840
open platforms

00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,840
also on the challenging side as we have

00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:12,480
been already discussing

00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:14,000
in today's business environment change

00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,640
and unforeseen events

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,400
are a certainty and businesses need to

00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:21,200
be able to respond real time

00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,960
if they're going to survive open

00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:26,080
platforms give businesses

00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:28,000
the agility to respond to develop new

00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:30,240
applications connecting

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,080
and managing disparate systems in new

00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:35,840
ways that may not have been

00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:38,880
anticipated weeks or even days before

00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,760
this is the value of open systems to

00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,760
business

00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:44,160
in the context of the need for rapid

00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:46,559
change and agility

00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,320
in the open mainframe project there are

00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,360
numerous projects that enable the

00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,960
mainframe

00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:53,919
to be open to ecosystem and application

00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,640
developers

00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,360
to build upon and for it to participate

00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,320
as a peer

00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:02,240
platform in the broader industry as

00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:05,679
change and evolution to cloud native

00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:08,720
computing models continue to accelerate

00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:10,720
two great example projects that you're

00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,000
certainly hearing about this week

00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:15,360
include zoe

00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,039
and feilong zoe is an open source

00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,600
software framework that provides

00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:22,559
solutions allowing development and

00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:25,440
operations teams to securely manage

00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:26,480
control script and develop on the

00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,360
mainframe

00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,720
just like any other cloud platform in

00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,919
feylong

00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:36,559
it enables restful api calls for virtual

00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:40,000
resource management for the zvd

00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:42,320
the z vm hypervisor

00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,440
ultimately projects like these open up

00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,360
the mainframe

00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,039
for businesses to use any number of

00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,799
operational and development tools

00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:50,640
commonly used across today's cloud

00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:52,880
native ecosystem

00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,559
simplifying change and enabling that

00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,960
agility to take advantage

00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:57,840
of the diversity of platforms available

00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,960
available

00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,960
including the mainframe

00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:11,360
all right good thanks a lot

00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:15,200
so len last but not least

00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:17,919
um how does open complement the way

00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,360
the clients that you work with or have

00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,120
interacted with over time

00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,880
how is open really complementing the way

00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,840
they are doing things today and and how

00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:27,840
do you envision that

00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,840
you know playing out in the future

00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:34,880
well rick you know since open

00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:38,480
code is usually developed

00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:41,039
to be hardware architecture

00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,640
agnostic it really helps take the

00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:44,799
guesswork

00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,919
out of selecting the architecture best

00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:48,720
suited

00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:50,159
to an application's attributes by

00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:53,600
eliminating the stress

00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:56,400
of having to choose a platform

00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:58,880
and what i mean by this point is is that

00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:02,000
it really helps greatly enhanced

00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:03,679
clients relationships very well because

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,200
of taking this stress out of the

00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:08,640
equation

00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:11,600
you see every architecture has

00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,480
three dimensions of performance that is

00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:16,559
io

00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:18,720
compute and data active in memory

00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:20,480
and if you take a look at these

00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,919
alternatives that are available today

00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:26,640
like x86 usually

00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:27,039
uh compute design point is what it is

00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,679
about

00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,640
it's not a it's not their strength it's

00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:32,480
not their weakness

00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,159
it's their design point as long as you

00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,799
use things for what they're designed to

00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,520
do

00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:39,679
then you're doing the right thing by the

00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:41,360
set trying to satisfy the attributes of

00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:44,880
the application

00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:46,880
things like uh power uh exadata their

00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,919
design points

00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:53,360
are a mix of of uh

00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:56,159
compute and data active in memory

00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:57,280
and then there's the z the z that is

00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:00,320
most balanced of

00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:03,360
all the architectures its design point

00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:06,880
since its inception

00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:09,200
in april 7 1964 to be exact

00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:11,360
it's always been that way and will

00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,799
always remain that way

00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,000
there's something else that's going on

00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,120
in the marketplace today and there's a

00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,240
lot what i would call

00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:21,520
camouflage camouflaging by

00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,840
vendors that are using creative names

00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,120
like

00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:27,919
hyper converged infrastructure which is

00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:32,159
really no more than x86

00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:34,640
under the covers of a software layer

00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:36,159
now take into consideration also the

00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:40,240
qualities of service

00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:44,799
of the z superior insecurity

00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:48,640
compression sort resiliency availability

00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:50,320
and what this has done for clients is it

00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:53,360
has placed

00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:57,679
the z at the top of their list now

00:22:53,360 --> 00:23:02,240
for open source systems for today

00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:08,159
especially open hybrid

00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:12,000
multi-cloud environments

00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:13,440
thanks lynn so look we've covered a lot

00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,480
in very little time

00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:18,320
and um so what i'd like to do is to give

00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:22,400
each panelist a parting shot

00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:25,600
not at each other but 60 seconds no more

00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:28,240
give us your uh parting thought meredith

00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,120
let's start with you all right i would

00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,120
say

00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,640
place transformation at the center of

00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:36,240
your strategy

00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:38,080
embrace and adopt modern open source

00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,600
standards and tooling

00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,279
and really focus on application

00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,159
modernization to create that

00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:45,440
interconnected

00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:48,720
digital experience all with security

00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:52,320
resiliency scalability of ibm z

00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:55,840
and linux one at the core

00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,840
excellent george

00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:02,880
thanks rick so if you learned anything

00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:05,200
from this panel discussion today

00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:08,240
hopefully it's that the future is filled

00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:10,640
with uncertainty and business challenges

00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,760
and in order to address these challenges

00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:16,080
we need to remain

00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:18,000
agile and open embracing open is one of

00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,840
the best ways to stay agile

00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,600
in your mainframe development and your

00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:24,559
operations

00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:26,080
and you can play a key role in this you

00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:27,760
should demand that your mainframe

00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,520
vendors and partners embrace

00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:32,080
an open strategy so you can take

00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:34,880
advantages of the innovations going on

00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,880
at open source

00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:39,200
thanks rick great tim

00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,039
yeah to tag on to what george just said

00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:46,400
i i agree with that you know

00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:48,320
you as as mainframe customers

00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,760
should be looking for your vendors and

00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,480
partners and

00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:53,279
but only internally yourself also be

00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,960
looking for

00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:57,440
how are you going to leverage that open

00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:00,159
source that's available

00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:02,320
i can say firsthand that leveraging open

00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:04,480
source has accelerated

00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:06,159
really provide new capabilities in the

00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,039
commercial software that that we're

00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:10,159
offering

00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:11,760
both in in development methodology uh

00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:12,640
the languages that we were able to

00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,640
choose

00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,840
and then the the wealth of open source

00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,159
that we were able to leverage

00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:20,320
you know to produce that so taking that

00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:23,520
to a mainframe customer

00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:25,520
um especially on zos where open source

00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,480
is relatively new quite honestly when it

00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,400
comes to it

00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,960
so you as as companies that own a

00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:33,679
mainframe uh for z os what i implore you

00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,760
to do is have a policy for open source

00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:37,279
that means how do you consume it how do

00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,600
you install it who are you getting

00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:41,279
support from uh as you're as you're

00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,760
leveraging that open source

00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:44,559
but then how are you contributing back

00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,640
are are you

00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:47,600
adding to that are you building that

00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,039
community

00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,640
and this is something that's again

00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:53,760
fairly new to z

00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,799
os on the mainframe so i'd say make sure

00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:57,279
if your leader

00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:58,880
you know ncos at your organization get

00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:01,760
your thought leaders together

00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:03,200
create that policy um put it out there

00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,039
and then you know make sure

00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,039
you're leveraging this great technology

00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:08,559
that's out there of open source

00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:10,080
okay tim you may have exceeded a little

00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:13,360
bit of your time but that's fine

00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:15,919
right how about you

00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:17,760
yeah thanks rick um you know i see great

00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:19,840
passion and enthusiasm here at the open

00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,760
mainframe project and i love it

00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,520
uh the mainframe continues to play an

00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:26,880
important role in the diverse

00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:28,880
it ecosystem in this group the

00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,480
open mainframe project plays a major

00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:33,039
role in ensuring

00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:35,200
that it is open to enable it to be

00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:36,480
appear with the rest of the cloud native

00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,360
ecosystem

00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,799
your work will help cement its continued

00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,320
success and growth

00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:44,320
and we at susa look forward to

00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,360
collaborating with the industry to keep

00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:48,960
it a vibrant

00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:50,320
and open platform and also one quick

00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,600
plug for one other

00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:55,360
uh project uh that expands awareness of

00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:57,360
and familiarity with the amazing

00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:59,520
capabilities of the mainframe

00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:01,360
the open mainframe projects mentorship

00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,120
program and it provides a great

00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:05,039
opportunity for students to learn and

00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:07,679
contribute to real world projects on the

00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:11,440
mainframe

00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:15,279
thanks a lot brett lynn ramp it up

00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:18,399
all righty sir i'm gonna plant the seed

00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:20,880
in everybody's mind

00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:22,000
the next time someone tells you that

00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:25,200
they are selecting

00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:28,480
an alternative platform to implement

00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:31,600
its open source

00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,080
systems applications whatever that is

00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:37,120
just

00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:40,080
like a mainframe ask them this question

00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:41,120
when your child becomes ill do you take

00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:44,320
them to someone that

00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:49,520
is just like a doctor or who

00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:53,039
is a doctor

00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:56,000
i love it so on that note

00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:58,320
of health um i'd like to thank all the

00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,840
panelists for joining me today

00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,440
and i'd like you to stay tuned as we

00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,720
take this panel to another digital

00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,679
platform

00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:07,279
uh in an upcoming open mainframe project

00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:09,360
block series that will be

00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:10,559
uh out probably in an october november

00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:13,520
time frame

00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:15,360
um i do want to say this much that you

00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:18,240
know from all the things we've heard

this is really about and this whole

00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:23,200
summit is really about

00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:25,919
being open embracing open and

00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:28,240
um being excited about open it's the

00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:31,039
mainframe shines once again

00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:33,039
and uh being open uh and having an open

00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:36,960
mainframe you know we'll continue that

00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:40,240
uh that uh moving forward so until then

00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:45,440
