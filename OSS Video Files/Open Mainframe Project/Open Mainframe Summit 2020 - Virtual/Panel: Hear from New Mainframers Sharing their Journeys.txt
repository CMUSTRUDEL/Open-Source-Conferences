Title: Panel: Hear from New Mainframers Sharing their Journeys
Publication date: 2020-09-05
Playlist: Open Mainframe Summit 2020 - Virtual
Description: 
	Panel: Hear from New Mainframers Sharing their Journeys - Joe Winchester & Robbie Avill, IBM; Jessielaine Punongbayan, Broadcom; Simge Helvaci, IBM 

One of the challenges facing the mainframe is to make it familiar and attractive to a generation who are graduating having grown up on non-mainframe computers, such as PCs, Macs, computers running Linux. Information is learned from videos, software is forged in hackathons, open source is prevalent, blogs and forums are used to collaborate and share information. This panel discusses how four new mainframers have navigated this from their personal viewpoint, the stories they share will be their perception coming to the platform, what worked for them, what didn't work, what challenges they faced and overcame, and what their advice and hope for the future is to help de-mistify the mainframe and evolve and grow a healthy and vibrant community of 21st century mainframers.

hi everyone on this panel we're lucky

00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:05,920
enough to be hearing from three

00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,520
really talented individuals each with

00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,440
different stories to share

00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,040
about their journeys and what they're

00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,240
working on on the mainframe

00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,200
so the way it's going to work is each of

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,719
the folks is going to share a little

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,240
clip of what they're working on

00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:18,000
followed by a little bit of discussion

00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,680
and questions uh with each other

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,920
and and myself i'm the moderator i'm joe

winchester and i work on the zoe project

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,519
so to start us off uh jesse lange um

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,519
pronounce bayern also goes by the uh

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,880
pseudonym of jelly from broadcom

00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:35,840
um works um in the czech republic and in

00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,440
prague

00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,960
she's gonna chat about zoe and some of

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,960
the projects he's involved with and for

00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,440
folks who don't know jelly before she's

00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,039
uh the face and the voice behind her

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,200
youtube channel mainframe bytes

00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:50,160
very popular a great source of

00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:52,719
information videos about survey explorer

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,399
and also videos about the zoe mobile

00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,760
project incubator project that jelly is

00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,280
pretty much part of

00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,520
um jetty is also very active on social

00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,199
media she's a great evangelist

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,199
and proponent of zoe and open source

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,680
technology on the mainframe she has

00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:07,200
blogs

00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,880
and a little plug in um

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,479
bottom left-hand corner you can see she

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,880
was featured on the open mainframe

00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:15,200
project i'm a mainframer podcast

00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,640
and also on the terminal talk podcast

00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,759
where she talks a lot about zoe

00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,479
from the perspective of cable

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:23,600
development so without further ado let's

00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:24,400
let's hear from jelly as technology

00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,600
progress

00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:30,240
the new developers with new knowledge of

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,200
modern technologies join the mainframe

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,759
community

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,400
you can't help the thing how can this

00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:40,159
next generation of developers

00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:43,439
help in improving mainframe

00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:46,560
it to a more strong network

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,920
and that's where we thought of it zoe

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,240
out

00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,360
it is an interactive learning experience

00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,159
that allows you

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,240
to learn more about winfrey and the

00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:59,360
different components of zoo

00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:01,360
such as the cli the web desktop

00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,600
the vs code extension and also the

00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,840
mobile application

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,360
it is in the form of a game where in

00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,599
self-paced interactive

00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,200
tutorial course and hands-on experiences

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:12,800
are available

00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,800
it is a step-by-step guide with

00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,560
checkpoints that includes links

00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:21,680
to tutorial videos and other resources

00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,080
it is a fun way to gain more knowledge

00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,599
about

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:28,879
me the goal for this

00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:30,879
interactive learning experience is to

00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:34,640
ask the question

00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:34,640
what more can you do with matrix

00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,040
i want to ask you a question because one

00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,160
of my uh

00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:45,360
team member is working on the ai

00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:48,400
chatbot that helps people to understand

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,360
and step by step which videos you can do

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,120
next

00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:56,560
it's like uh your website or your tool

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:59,680
but it is like it was ai and

00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,920
um have to say chatbot powered so

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,800
maybe uh if you want it we can work

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,080
together

00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:09,360
with a project and you know create

00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:12,480
some new stuff with our team

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:15,519
it's really useful uh and

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:18,560
we have really good um uh

00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,400
repository right now so

00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,680
i would like i would love to work with

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,159
you

00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,879
that's wonderful yeah i mean that's the

00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,040
beauty of

00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,400
open source and the mainframe community

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:32,239
we can help each other out

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:34,959
we have great ideas

00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,080
teaching this skill so important for my

00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,319
job too

00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,760
and we are also wanted to develop for

00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,480
our tree so

00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,200
working together will be that thanks a

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,640
quick question

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,920
i've got jelly you've worked in

00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,120
vapeframe for a fair bit longer than

00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,480
i've got

00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,000
what kind of trends have you seen over

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,680
that time because it's a short period

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,360
for me five years i'm trying to sort of

00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,799
see where it's going but

00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,480
i think with your experience you've

00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,920
probably seen a bit more of the trends

00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,040
that have happened over the past maybe

00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,959
decade or so

00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,470
you're right i've been working like more

00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,400
than a decade

00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:09,360
[Music]

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:14,959
like what was the question again sorry i

00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:16,320
got fixated uh the different trends that

00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,519
you've seen over the years on the

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:21,440
mainframe

00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:24,560
the different trends well

00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,560
i think we started off

00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:31,600
how do i answer that one i think

00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,000
what i really like in the progress of

00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,320
that career that i have is that

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,120
when i work in the local bank they don't

00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,560
have that much

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,800
budget so they have this like basic

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,000
sets of internet they use visam for all

00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,360
of their

00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,280
all all of their data with transactions

00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,520
and account information

00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,479
and then when i went to singapore and

00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,639
work for

00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,960
i think for a german bank they started

00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,080
using this db2 and imss and then i

00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,960
learned as well

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,160
this mq series stuff and then we work

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,039
with eclipse where they

00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,080
they do the screen scraping of this

00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:08,320
kicks

00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,080
kick screens and then so that you can

00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,639
have this web gui

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,919
and maybe the trend that i'm i'm

00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,479
actually seeing is that

00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,280
you know before it's like an attempt to

00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:20,720
have

00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:23,840
um a really nice web guise and

00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:27,039
you user i mean user friendly

00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:28,400
and it improves from from time to time

00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,720
before

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,720
it's like it's really hard to use it

00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,120
like you have so many

00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,320
um many clicks that you have to do you

00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,240
have to

00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,400
many pages that they have to open but

00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,639
now it's like it's easier because we are

00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,919
also using like rest apis

00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,800
and if we have those kind of

00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:49,600
microservices

00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,400
it's easier to access it it's easier to

00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,880
use it

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,880
it's more how does how you say it like

00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,479
it's a it's it's user friendly so

00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,600
that's the turn that i am seeing like

00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,880
through the years

00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:09,280
it's getting more and more user-friendly

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,280
than before that's really interesting

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,440
that kind of passion that i'm going to

00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,080
say is like something that

00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,240
i i just got because i really am

00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,319
passionate with sharing my knowledge

00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,520
and i do believe that you know all of

00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,520
this knowledge that i have

00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,280
should be sharing to everybody because

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,039
it's like passing on

00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,639
whatever it is that you learned and i

00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,160
don't want to keep it for myself it's

00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,000
it's not useful for me to keep it to

00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,639
myself and inspiring

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,080
others can lead to a to better

00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,479
innovation and

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,440
you know a better future that's

00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:43,120
brilliant

00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,560
so i think what's really good as well is

00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,440
that i didn't know what you think about

00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,639
the main thing

00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,280
sometimes we think we have to be

00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:51,199
inspired by 60 70 year olds and there

00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,080
are some phenomenal 60 70 year olds out

00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,599
there

00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,440
but sometimes they've forgotten what

00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:57,440
it's like to be in their 20

00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,280
in your 20s or 30s or 40s perhaps it's

00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,440
so far distant

00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,560
it's a bit like you know children it's

00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,400
nice to have i have two

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,479
i have two two sons and and and they

00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,000
have a a kinship and a relationship they

00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,120
can play video games that i don't know

00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,120
how to play

00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,400
so sometimes having that very gradual

00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,919
transition

00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,599
so it's interesting to watch robbie

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,639
asking you for advice and you

00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,400
and you're quite struck and you're

00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:21,199
thinking wow now i'm the adult in the

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,199
room now i'm there

00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,000
it's really good that you can do that

00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:31,919
that you're leading others

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,080
um yeah i'm very thankful that i have

00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,599
that kind of opportunity it's not

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,199
i don't think that everybody has that

00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:40,080
opportunity and so

00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,880
yeah great so um next we're going to

00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,800
hear from singer

00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:46,400
herself uh cindy works as a program

00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:48,800
leader for ibm in in turkey in istanbul

00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,000
and there she's the organizer of the ibm

00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,319
z linux one community

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,280
community where um where's members can

00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:57,039
learn about new tech

00:07:53,280 --> 00:08:00,080
um like ai blockchain devops joey

00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:01,599
um amongst others all of which leverage

00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,800
the um the mainframe platform and what

00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:05,120
the group does is it

00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,479
connects its members with technical

00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,919
experts from ibm

00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:11,599
platform experts um across the globe

00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:14,080
and it's pretty much established does

00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,800
benefit um ibm z the next one mainframe

00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,560
customers

00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:20,000
business partners anybody really um

00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,520
from anywhere wanting to expand their

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,199
mainframe skills sessions are given in

00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,120
english as well as turkish

00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,560
um and if you point your phone at the qr

00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,840
code bottom right hand corner it'll take

00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,280
you right to their homepage and you'll

00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,000
see the calendar of events upcoming

00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,680
events

00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,200
recordings of previous sessions you can

sign up become a member

00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,560
and and get connected to that phenomenal

00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:39,919
community out there

00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:42,399
and um at ibm uh senegal herself

00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:44,560
actually manages 19 people and she

00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,839
her team works alongside customers and

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,839
ibm experts and

00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,200
one of the projects that her team has

00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,399
been responsible for creating is an

00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,160
application

00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:55,920
using a mobile device um connect to z os

00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,120
and uh sim guys colleague mehmet put

00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,880
together a video on this project we're

00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,320
going to take a quick look at that video

00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,240
and then have a walk through an

00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,560
accompanying blog

00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,440
zoe is an ibm supported open source

00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,519
project

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,399
it hosts some of the z operating system

00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:12,320
services making them accessible publicly

00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,160
using xovi i created a mobile

00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,240
application that aims to help both new

00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,320
and experienced z users

00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:21,360
zine is more young people but the new

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,440
generation is terrified by z interfaces

00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,440
they understand things visually and love

00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:28,240
graphical user interfaces

00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,920
to enable z4 generation z tools must be

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,640
modern and easy to understand

00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,640
such as this one on the other hand

00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,839
experience z users may need to access to

00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,920
the system anywhere

00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:39,839
anytime whether they need to check the

00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,680
status of a task on the go

00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,600
or they are called by a colleague due to

00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,279
a problem this app enables them to

00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,680
connect you with minimum effort

00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:49,200
and possibly save them a lot of time

00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,120
this app uses one of the newest

00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,839
application development frameworks

00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:56,000
flutter and again it uses the most

00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:59,200
modern and common way to communicate

00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:02,240
rest apis z is open and modern

00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:04,480
i think this is a great way to prove it

00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:07,279
i am mehmet type smash and i am proud of

00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,279
working on z

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:17,040
what i've actually read this is

00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,720
a detailed instruction on how to create

00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,000
this flutter project

00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,399
like to create our own mobile

00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,440
application have you tried it or

00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:28,240
you just downloaded how to use it

00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,440
well i i checked it out because i'm

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,440
using ionic

00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,640
so i have tried it in ionic and i wanted

00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,040
to see how

00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,560
mehmet did it in flutter and the

00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,760
approach is the same

00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:42,000
so i didn't

00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:44,240
i was trying to creating a slather

00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,200
project is not easy i think the hardest

00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,519
part was

00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,800
just creating a repo and creating a

00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:53,440
flutter app but

00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:56,959
uh whenever you did it the other parts

00:10:53,440 --> 00:11:00,720
it's easy

00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:01,040
and not only this pattern we have many

00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,240
but

00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:07,600
one of the other was is the hackathon

00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:11,760
that we uh attended the code to curve

00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:15,120
we created a blockchain based solution

00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:19,040
with uh ibm z and linux one

00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:22,000
and we had also a pattern too but

00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:24,240
for open source we can easily share that

00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,240
one

00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,720
and this is so one one question that i

00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:34,480
have is that

00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:39,200
are you planning to publish it in

00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:41,600
in google play or or in ios

00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,320
i don't know maybe we can do this we

00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,640
haven't

00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,640
think about yeah so why not

00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,519
i have a question for you so you're a

00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:57,360
manager right of

00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:59,680
how many people exactly 19.

00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,560
how do you find being a manager of that

00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,360
many people but

00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,079
also being so young i can't imagine it

00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,760
uh

00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:10,639
it is a little bit different experience

00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,279
because i can't call myself i'm not a

00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,800
manager

00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:15,920
i'm i'm just a team lead you know i i i

00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,959
had an experience

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:22,240
as a software engineer i know what they

00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,560
uh face and i know the experience so i'm

00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,079
just

00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:27,920
sharing my knowledge and just leading

00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,920
these are the tasks and these are the

00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:33,120
ideas that you can follow

00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,160
and i think it's not that hard because i

00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,160
can

00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,079
think about their thinking because

00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:41,200
almost they're in the same age

00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:44,959
so i i don't think it's that hard

00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:47,600
as you know my organization how

00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:50,000
to you know combine everyone in one

00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:53,519
place so it was not hard for me but

00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,680
um creating new stuff and

00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,120
brainstorming sessions makes me really

00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:00,639
fascinating i really

00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:02,560
excited to have that one so uh the new

00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:05,600
ideas makes me so happy

00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,000
that's why i really like my job it is my

00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,959
dream

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,920
job and i'm living it there's this

00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:12,800
actually

00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,240
the mobile stuff in zoe is getting

00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,760
bigger and bigger so you have

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,959
flutter there's this recent um sdk that

00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,000
was given to us

00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,800
and it's coded under swift and he

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,079
created

00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,600
an application for our ios and as well

00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:30,720
as for ipads

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,959
and they have a repository now in zoe

00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,519
and

00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,000
it's under the client sdk and then the

00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,720
ionic

00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,200
part which is using angular so i think

00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,600
it would

00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,399
be great if we have we can combine all

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,360
of these

00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:45,839
three great projects together and you

00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,920
know make it bigger or make it like

00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,360
just once so that we don't have like

00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,880
different projects

00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,360
for mobile i just don't have time to do

00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,199
this

00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,120
incubation project right now because i'm

00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:58,880
also part of zoe explorer which is like

00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,279
a big project as well but

00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:03,040
if we can have it i mean if you can work

00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,839
together on this i think it would be

00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,040
really

00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:10,560
easy uh i don't know uh do you know that

00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:13,839
um flutter is something that uh

00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:16,160
easily downloadable both ios and android

00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,880
that's why we choose it uh the first

00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,079
time i

00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:21,680
um meet with the flooder was when i am

00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:24,480
in the google i o

00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:26,160
in san francisco i just i was walking

00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,959
around the codelabs

00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,880
uh google also sent me an invitation

00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:34,399
because i'm a woman techmaker

00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:37,040
ambassador and i was the only girl

00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:39,760
that just go to that conference from

00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:42,639
turkey it was really honored for me

00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,040
and i just uh walking around the class

00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,040
and

00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,560
they said that this is the flooder why

00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:49,760
don't you have a

00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:53,279
collab after i've seen that whenever you

00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:55,760
type the code even you don't build it

00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:56,839
uh you've seen in your mobile phone it's

00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,160
really

00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:03,360
um fast and adoptable for

00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:05,279
any as in flutter you can also create a

00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:08,560
web application that's why

00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:11,839
uh when we think about the project i

00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:13,040
give all of the software engineers the

00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:16,560
possibilities

00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:19,360
but the best one was for others so um

00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,000
it if you want it we can work on

00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,519
different

00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,040
projects too that's that's great

00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,920
actually we can go

00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,600
maybe offline for more technicals

00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,600
awesome so now um

00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,600
jelly and sim gonna head off and uh chat

00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,000
about the technical stuff

00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:38,320
um let's hear from robbie um robbie aval

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,720
so robbie's background um

00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,399
robbie joined ibm actually straight out

00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,279
of school um about five years ago uh

00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:47,279
aged 18

00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:49,759
um and he started to work in the ibm z

00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:51,279
uh sort of mainframe internal release

00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,600
engineering side

00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:55,440
and um ruby tells the story which is

00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,120
where when he joined up surrounded by

00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,880
obviously lots of much older much wiser

00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,959
more experienced people from himself

00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,880
uh david sort of say to him it's going

00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,600
to take you months and months and months

00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,360
uh

00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,199
you know years to become productive to

00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,040
learn this stuff

00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,560
and um it did take a long time for

00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:14,399
robbie to learn to become

00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:16,959
to get to the point where he's at now um

00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,959
and he was sort of challenged by that

00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:22,000
and wanted to

00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:22,560
um wanted to see if that always had to

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
be the way

00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,000
wanted to see if there was a better way

00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,720
to to do release engineering within z

00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,160
robbie left ibm um but fortunately he's

00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,920
back we're very lucky uh that he's

00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:34,720
working on the zoe project

00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,000
where he is uh i suppose getting paid to

00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,800
do what he loves he's working on release

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,920
management

00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,519
he's working on the continuous

00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,440
integration continuous delivery side of

00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:49,840
zoe itself

00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:52,929
and let's hear what he's up to

00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,929
[Applause]

00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,440
hi there everybody robbie aval here and

00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,600
welcome today to my jenkins overview for

00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,880
the zoe cicd pipeline

00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,720
now the first thing i want to show you

00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,199
strangely enough isn't actually jenkins

00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,120
itself

00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:06,880
but more the way that our git repos

00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:08,319
interact with jenkins

00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,600
so when you have a pr you have two

00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,480
checks that need to pass before you're

00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,400
able to merge it

00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,520
the dco which is just checking who you

00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,520
are that you say you are

00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:18,000
and this continuous integration jenkins

00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:20,319
pr merge and what this is is a

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,600
build that is triggered in jenkins every

00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:25,039
time a commit is pushed to the branch

00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:27,919
so you can see here if you click on

00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:29,919
details you're redirected to the output

00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,360
for the build that was run and you're

00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:33,679
told whether or not it

00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:35,120
ran successfully or unsuccessfully as

00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,799
it's loading now

00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,120
so you can see here this one was

00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:40,400
completely green so i was able to merge

00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:43,039
it no worries

00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,640
benefits here are mainly that you know

00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:46,080
as you're working on something you can

00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,440
see whether or not it's going to be

00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,360
acceptable for a merge or if you're

00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,960
going to need to make any changes to it

00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,640
it saves a lot of hassle further down

00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,799
the line and makes your life a lot more

00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,919
streamlined

00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:57,600
that's the first thing i wanted to show

00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,120
you the second thing that i think is

00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,600
really cool that we have on our jenkins

00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,799
instance

00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:04,559
is this docker swarm dashboard so all of

00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:06,480
our builds that we run on jenkins are

00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:07,840
run in their own docker image

00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,919
that means that we don't have to worry

00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,400
about what's on the build machine itself

00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:12,960
and

00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,679
levels of software and things like that

00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,600
we can

00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,799
make sure that all of the correct levels

00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,480
of uh

00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:20,400
software are installed into the docker

00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,520
image so as you can see from the

00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,720
dashboard we have a

00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:27,440
cpu usage and a memory usage

00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,000
overview there's also the nodes which we

00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,360
have the

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,960
worker and the manager obviously this

00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,960
makes it a lot simpler for the

00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,039
build team if we want to come in and see

00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,320
what memory is free what cpu's free any

00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:40,320
issues that might be with the docker

00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,080
swarm

00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:44,080
makes our lives a lot easier i think

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,840
dashboards are generally a good thing to

00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,280
use for that kind of thing

00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,039
the next thing that i would like to show

00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,880
off is something that makes

00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:52,080
looking at jenkins slightly simpler so

00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,960
at the moment we have

00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,160
a long list of builds that's quite

00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,240
difficult to see the wood through the

00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,320
trees of what's broken and what's not

00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,760
so in order to counter this i created

00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,280
some dashboards that would make it a

00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,120
little bit easier to tell when things

00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,880
are working and when they're not

00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,240
this one is a good example so this is

00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,120
the rc view

00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,480
or release candidate so when we release

00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,160
a new version of the product

00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,240
we need to have a few builds that are

00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,360
working and some tests that are passing

00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,440
otherwise we

00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:21,440
can't put the product out it makes it a

00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,840
lot easier to come in and look at this

00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,520
screen

00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,679
and see that there's four big green

00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,760
boxes than it is scrolling up and down

00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:30,720
the page looking for a sunshine or some

00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:32,240
rain that jenkins gives you

00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,000
so i thought that this would be a good

00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,039
way to counter that we have another

00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,280
example of a

00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:39,120
simple dashboard that i created this

00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:42,559
one's called staging

00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:45,039
and what this shows you is the uh

00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:46,880
the eight different staging builds for

00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:47,840
the git repositories that we store all

00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,760
of our code in

00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:52,000
so a good example of how this works you

00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,760
can see here with explorer jazz

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
it was fixed after jack and nicole

00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,840
committed their changes 15 days ago

00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,679
now 15 days ago it probably said that

00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,360
jack and nicole had broken the build

00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:02,880
but it's good to know that you can have

00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:05,919
that level of clarity

00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:08,159
of where exactly things have gone wrong

00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:10,640
who may have committed the code that

00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:12,240
caused the issue and in turn helping you

00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,799
figure out what will be the best method

00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:17,120
to fix the problem

00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:18,960
so i think the dashboards make that a

00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,640
lot easier than it would be just

00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,559
scrolling up and down here hoping for

00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,919
the best the final thing i want to show

00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:26,159
off to everybody today

00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:29,200
is this test result report that we get

00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:32,159
when we run tests on our jenkins

00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,200
and if you follow the links you're taken

00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:34,880
to a much

00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:38,000
nicer page than you would normally see

00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:41,679
within jenkins for test results

00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:44,320
as you can see you get proper output

00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:45,440
from the tests as they are run in the

00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,360
top right we can see

00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,960
how many tests passed how many failed

00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:52,000
how many were skipped

00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:56,159
and also my favorite function of this

00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:58,559
page is the images that come up

00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:00,080
with the tests so as you can see jez

00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:02,400
explorer was able to

00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:04,559
run so we didn't get any errors there

00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,679
but in a situation where jazz explorer

00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,760
wasn't able to open

00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:09,360
we would get an image that would show

00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,000
what would be on the screen if you tried

00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,200
to

00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,799
run the jazz explorer it makes it a lot

00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,960
easier in my opinion

00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:19,039
if you are able to look at pictures and

00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:21,600
see simpler breakdowns than

00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:22,559
just having that jenkins full console

00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,320
where you have to

00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:26,080
scroll up and down for 15 minutes and

00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:28,240
hope that you can spot what the error is

00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,679
we've got a lot of debugging tools in

00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,400
place that make

00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:33,919
our lives a lot easier that is just the

00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,440
tip of the iceberg of some of the many

00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:37,600
many cool things that we have in

00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,799
in our jenkins instance to make our ci

00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,039
cd pipeline

00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:43,600
life as easy as possible thank you very

00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:43,600
much for watching

00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:48,720
so can i ask you a question what do you

00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:51,120
like about jenkins

00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,480
oh jenkins uh i i love trick it's it's

00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,360
the best open source

00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,240
tool there is in my opinion um in terms

00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,640
of packaging

00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:01,440
and the job that i'm my job role the

00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:03,600
sort of systems team of zoe

00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,200
it makes my life a lot easier because it

00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,720
has a ui for all of the things that

00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,760
normally i'd be sitting there staring at

00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,240
cliff or

00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,200
i don't have to ssh to a machine and

00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,360
trigger a build

00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,440
with my own two hands i can just click a

00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,919
button that says build it and then

00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,600
any out it's all linked to github so if

00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:22,080
any commits are pushed to github

00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,640
then the build triggers itself you could

00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,799
it's

00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,480
you could link it with most open source

00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:28,159
tools and they can do

00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,720
pretty much anything you'd want a build

00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:32,400
system to i'd so yeah that's what i like

00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,720
there's not really any downsides to it

00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,720
for me

00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:42,000
it was a great question uh are you

00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,880
publishing your work

00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,159
in uh any channel like youtube or

00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:49,520
anywhere that

00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:52,559
uh i would like to watch your series of

00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,840
things that you've done uh no i actually

00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:55,760
have never uh

00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,960
really done anything like that but i do

00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,400
think that is something i'd like to look

00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,360
into in the future i think i've sort of

00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,880
been inspired by

00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,080
listening to jelly talk about her

00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,280
youtube channel and all the things that

00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,200
she does and

00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,799
i think there's definitely a gap in

00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,200
people talking about the ci cd

00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:10,880
area of programming and especially zoe i

00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,880
think the stuff that we've got on our

00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,559
jenkins is pretty interesting and pretty

00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,240
cool and innovative so

00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,760
yeah though that's a good question i

00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,480
haven't done but definitely something i

00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,360
will

00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,000
definitely do something like that i know

00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,720
that these

00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,440
processes are harder it's not they're

00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,520
not

00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,360
independent as jelly do because i know

00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:32,880
the marketing processes

00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:36,640
as you already mentioned as an ibmer but

00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:39,840
even it's hard you need to try and

00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:41,360
we would like to learn from you i'll do

00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:44,640
my best to pass on my education

00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,039
and knowledge after this recording i'm

00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,880
gonna

00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:51,440
ask you a favor to give a webinar to

00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,799
to our my team because it will be very

00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,120
wonderful if you

00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:57,360
have time in any time i don't know but

00:23:55,120 --> 00:24:00,640
it's really informative

00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:05,760
both jelly and you i'm just asking

00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:07,120
for any time your very lucky they take

00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,120
i'm always happy to do that kind of

00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,240
thing yeah i think automation and things

00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,000
like that is something that

00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,360
has really interested me and that i

00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
think that's the whole reason behind why

00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,760
i like

00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,120
working in continuous integration

00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,400
continuous delivery i think most people

00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,640
find it quite dull

00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,679
but i think just the side of automation

00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,080
and getting everything

00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:26,080
to not need a person that's just kind of

00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:28,640
interesting for me

00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,200
not need you at 11 o'clock at night yeah

00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,480
exactly

00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,960
work so i don't need a job anymore

00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,960
that's the point

00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:42,000
for me in five years i'm i'm hoping to

00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,320
see mainframe like

00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,200
you know more integrated in modern

00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:48,000
tooling

00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:49,200
you know not just not just with with us

00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,159
vendors but

00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,039
it will be adapted by other companies as

00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:56,080
well like

00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:58,720
especially in banks and

00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:00,480
most importantly i would love to see the

00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:03,200
mainframe community to work

00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,240
more together you know uh mainframers

00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,799
such as robbie

00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,760
and sim gay who has like knowledge in

00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:10,480
different

00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,520
modern tooling i would love our

00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,600
community to

00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,799
work together together and learn from

00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,120
each other

00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:19,600
so that we can build a better mainframe

00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,600
platform

00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:25,200
awesome the mainframe

00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:30,559
in five years everyone uh all together

00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:33,200
with our community will

00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:35,440
share what is mainframe when we ask they

00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:38,000
will know ah i know that i've seen

00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,480
in a movie i've seen in a webinar i've

00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,039
seen in

00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,000
the university i would like to hear

00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:45,440
these answers

00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,600
and also not only the big companies

00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,360
and also the other i know that it's

00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:53,279
really powerful

00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:56,559
and it is uh when comparing the others

00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:57,760
uh it's really great and zero downtime

00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:00,720
that's why maybe

00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:02,960
uh the small businesses can use it via

00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,760
the linux one and the more integration

00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:08,000
with the mobile

00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:11,279
modern tooling is also in addition and

00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:14,640
i like to copy and paste of your

00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:18,720
wish everyone can access mainframe

00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:22,400
uh freely this one is in five year wish

00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:26,240
and five years next awesome sexy way

00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:29,200
probably five years first uh

00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:30,000
five years i think in five years i think

00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,039
i'd like to see

00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,520
the openness of being i think widely

00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:35,120
used

00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,039
it is already at the minute but i think

00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,520
in five years there'll be more adopters

00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:40,080
if the

00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:41,039
the open source tooling that's available

00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,760
on mainframe

00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:45,440
and i think linux on z should become

00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,400
more adopted in the next five years as

00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,520
well i think that's still

00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,880
sort of in its infancy with linux one so

00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,240
i think in five years it would be really

00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:55,360
interesting to see where

00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:57,279
that is at the linux on z space

00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:59,279
yeah i think the the openness and just

00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:59,679
getting more people to use the mainframe

00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,520
and

00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:03,440
not seeing it as such a restricted piece

00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:06,559
of equipment anymore that's i think will

00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:09,760
happen in the next five years awesome

00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:12,880
cool thank you jelly

00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:14,320

00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,919
connected to the mainframe using zoe's

00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:31,760
rest apis qr code are linked to that

00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:32,399
