	Panel: Hear from New Mainframers Sharing their Journeys - Joe Winchester & Robbie Avill, IBM; Jessielaine Punongbayan, Broadcom; Simge Helvaci, IBM 

One of the challenges facing the mainframe is to make it familiar and attractive to a generation who are graduating having grown up on non-mainframe computers, such as PCs, Macs, computers running Linux. Information is learned from videos, software is forged in hackathons, open source is prevalent, blogs and forums are used to collaborate and share information. This panel discusses how four new mainframers have navigated this from their personal viewpoint, the stories they share will be their perception coming to the platform, what worked for them, what didn't work, what challenges they faced and overcame, and what their advice and hope for the future is to help de-mistify the mainframe and evolve and grow a healthy and vibrant community of 21st century mainframers.
