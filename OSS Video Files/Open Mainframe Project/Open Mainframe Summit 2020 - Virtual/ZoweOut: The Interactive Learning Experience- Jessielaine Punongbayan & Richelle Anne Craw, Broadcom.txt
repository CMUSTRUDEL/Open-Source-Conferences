Have you ever wondered if games and mainframes are compatible? We have! Join this session as we showcase our winning hackathon project about a Zowe Learning Environment that allows you to learn more about Mainframe in a fun way.

Come and hear about how and why we came up with the idea; the technologies we used; and all the fun, learnings, and challenges we experienced during the hackathon. We will discuss how we see this project fits in the modern mainframe movement, including how everyone from beginners to experts in mainframe technology can come together and learn from each other.

All learners are welcome!
