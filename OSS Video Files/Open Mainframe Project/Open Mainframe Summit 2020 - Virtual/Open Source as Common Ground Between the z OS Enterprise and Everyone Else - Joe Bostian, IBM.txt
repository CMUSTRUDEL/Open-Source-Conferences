	Open Source as Common Ground Between the z/OS Enterprise and Everyone Else - Joe Bostian, IBM

As the system of record for much of the world's financial infrastructure, IBM Z and z/OS have evolved according to a different set of rules than most other technology driven service providers. Security, efficiency, and reliability are the most powerful forces driving z/OS development in ways that the open source community still doesn't fully appreciate today. Open source software has brought an unprecedented wave of creativity to software development that could never be achieved by even a large group of private entities selling their own proprietary offerings. As open source solutions mature, they increasingly encounter some of the same forces that z/OS continues to address. The z/OS and the open source communities have strengths that each can benefit from. Learn how this can be accomplished while preserving the characteristics that make each community successful.
