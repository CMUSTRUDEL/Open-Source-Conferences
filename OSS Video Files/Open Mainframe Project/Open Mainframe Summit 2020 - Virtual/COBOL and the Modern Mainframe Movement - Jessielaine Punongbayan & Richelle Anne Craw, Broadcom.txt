	COBOL and the Modern Mainframe Movement - Jessielaine Punongbayan & Richelle Anne Craw, Broadcom 

In these unprecedented times, COBOL became part of the discussion once again, with some misgivings due to its age. How has COBOL kept up with the modern times? From our humble beginnings as a COBOL Programmer Trainee, to our experience as a System Developer, and now as part of the DevOps R&D team for the OMP Zowe project, We are first hand witnesses to how COBOL has evolved through the years. Join this session as we talk about how the technology of today can be combined with COBOL. Come to hear first hand experiences and insights of a modern mainframe developer, including how everyone is empowered to innovate and invent different mainframe solutions, and enjoy the benefits from those innovations.
