	Zowe Conformance: High-reliability Extensions for Mainframe Tools, Guaranteed - Rose Sakach, Broadcom

How do you ensure bulletproof extensions? How do you know your extensions are going to work? The Zowe Conformance Program was developed by the Zowe community as a means to ensure that each plug-in and extension associated with a given Zowe component has met a set of requirements that ensures they deliver common functionality, interoperability, as well as a common user experience. Join this session to learn about the program and why conformance is critical.
