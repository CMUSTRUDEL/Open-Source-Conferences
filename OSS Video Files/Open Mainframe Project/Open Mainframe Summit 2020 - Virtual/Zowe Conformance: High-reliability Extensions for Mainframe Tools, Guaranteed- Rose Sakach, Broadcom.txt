Description: 
	Zowe Conformance: High-reliability Extensions for Mainframe Tools, Guaranteed - Rose Sakach, Broadcom

How do you ensure bulletproof extensions? How do you know your extensions are going to work? The Zowe Conformance Program was developed by the Zowe community as a means to ensure that each plug-in and extension associated with a given Zowe component has met a set of requirements that ensures they deliver common functionality, interoperability, as well as a common user experience. Join this session to learn about the program and why conformance is critical.

hi everyone it's great to be with you

00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:05,920
today welcome to zoe conformance

00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,320
high reliability extensions for

00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:11,360
mainframe tools guaranteed

00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,719
i'm rossetcatch scrum master for the zoe

00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:17,920
onboarding squad

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,920
and i will lead you through this session

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,160
whether you're familiar with zoe or new

00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,960
to zoe whether you're a zoe

00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,880
extender or a zoe consumer if you are

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,599
interested in understanding how the zoe

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,439
community ensures that zoe extensions

00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,399
whether they're written by individuals

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,280
or vendors are guaranteed to function as

00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,520
expected

00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,480
you will want to understand the zoe

00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,239
conformance program

00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,640
so we'll start with a quick summary of

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,520
zoe the industry's drive towards open

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,840
source

00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,320
the zoe landscape and what we mean when

00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,920
we reference zoe extensions

00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,920
then we'll review the conformance

00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,239
program what it is

00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,160
why it is necessary and the value it

00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:01,199
offers from the perspective of both

00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:03,039
extenders and consumers and finally

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,920
we'll explain the meaning behind

00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:07,040
a zoe conformant badge why you should

00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,520
ensure that

00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,360
if you are an extender you will want to

00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,520
earn the latest badge

00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,880
and if you are a consumer you will want

00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:19,680
to ensure that your zoe

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,680
app has earned its zoe conformance badge

00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,040
so what's happening with the technology

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,159
industry

00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,000
and open source well

00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,200
if we take a market view we see all

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,320
sorts of evidence

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,840
of open source in enterprises how many

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,400
of you are seeing tools like

00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,400
get jenkins and visual studio code

00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,280
within your organization

00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,600
i can tell you're nodding yes these are

00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,320
all

00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,360
open source tools and you're not alone

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,240
by the way

00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:52,720
they're everywhere in fact according to

00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:55,759
a 2016 analyst report

00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,840
95 percent of organizations

00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,119
leverage non-trivial open source

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,200
software

00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:04,320
within their mission-critical i.t

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:07,280
workloads whether they know it or not

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,039
but despite the use the increase we see

00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,440
within organizations

00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:12,800
and the inherent quality associated with

00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,200
open source

00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,720
until recently mainframe did not

00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,040
participate in this trend

00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,400
to leverage open source and when you

00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,520
consider these stats

00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:26,000
on the use and the associated quality

00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,319
they certainly support why mainframe

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,319
should

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:35,840
mainframe did not participate that is

00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,480
until zoe for the sake of everyone in

00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,760
this session

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,560
let me quickly review zoe was introduced

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,680
in august

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:46,959
of 2018 at the sheer conference in st

00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,800
louis zoe is a linux foundation open

00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:51,200
mainframe project

00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,080
zoe is the first ever mainframe open

00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,239
source initiative

00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,720
leveraging the power of the community

00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,519
with the collaborative expertise of key

00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,879
platform

00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:04,239
isvs zoe introduced a modern interface

00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:07,440
to mainframe

00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:09,920
allowing enterprises to manage leverage

00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,840
and interact with maintrains like any

00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:16,159
other platform

00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:18,720
the three introductory components of zoe

00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:19,519
circled here on the left include the

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,640
command line

00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:26,319
interface the api mediation layer

00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:28,720
and the application framework or web ui

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:31,120
the full landscape in the upper right

00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,640
demonstrates how the ecosystem has been

00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,480
expanding

00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,280
with the introduction of the zoe

00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:40,959
explorer and in addition to

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:43,599
two incubator project components

00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,840
namely the zoe mobile app and the zoe

00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:48,239
client

00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,760
ultimately the community will extend the

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,400
zoe conformance program

00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,280
to include these components but at this

00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,480
time

00:03:53,280 --> 00:04:00,159
the program covers extensions

00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,879
for service apis for the api mediation

00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:04,159
layer

00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:07,280
and i want to circle those

00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:09,760
plug-ins for both the cli and the app

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,760
framework

00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,640
let's take a closer look at two of these

00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:17,120
components

00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,079
i'll pick the cli and the api evolution

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,840
layer

00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,240
and i want to do this to help you all to

00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:25,120
gain an understanding of what we mean by

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,280
extensions and sometimes during this

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,320
presentation i'll probably refer to them

00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,520
as plugins so i want to help you to

00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,560
understand

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,560
what we mean by the extensions and

00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,800
the relationships that they have to

00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:42,080
conformance

00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:45,680
at a high level zoe is foundationally

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,639
services oriented the zoe cli and api

00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,280
mediation layer

00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,759
are again core zoe components and these

00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,800
two

00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,800
help enable off platform access to

00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,199
mainframe services

00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,440
at the risk of oversimplifying its

00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,919
tremendous value as a service layer

00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,720
the mediation layer also serves as a

00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,880
catalog

00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,720
housing mainframe services in the form

00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:10,080
of apis

00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:13,360
the cli is client-based technology

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:15,680
that simplifies the mainframe api

00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,400
service calls it essentially makes

00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,800
remote

00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:21,759
or off-platform mainframe access look

00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,759
and feel like any other platform access

00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,280
platforms that are very familiar to

00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:28,639
enterprise architects

00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:30,800
as well as mobile and cloud developers

00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:34,240
all of these folks are capable and

00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,919
comfortable working and coming online

00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,680
so you can kind of start to see that

00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:41,120
leveraging zoe enables

00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,240
that open first approach users can add

00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,320
mainframe

00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,000
to the huge volume of tools that are

00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,479
already downloaded

00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,560
to their workstation whether it's for

00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:54,080
modernizing mainframe access

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:57,520
or enabling mainframe devops it empowers

00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,000
teams to decide how best to meet the

00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,400
needs

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,280
of the business leveraging tools they

00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,199
know

00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,120
and leveraging tools they use on their

00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:08,400
desktop in a manner in which they

00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,759
are proficient but this is just part of

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,600
the equation

00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:14,000
in addition to being able to use the

00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,560
multitude of available open source

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,280
technologies zoe's command line

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,680
interface

00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,800
offers tremendous flexibility with on

00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,080
mainframe product

00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:26,960
integrations for example mainframe

00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:29,280
teams can now use ci cd pipeline

00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:32,080
orchestration tools like jenkins

00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,520
or testing framework frameworks like

00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,039
jest

00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,440
and they can combine them with

00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:40,400
traditional mainframe solutions like ca

00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:43,120
endeavor and mainframe databases like

00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:45,360
ibm's db2 for z os

00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,199
this is easily achieved through zoe's

00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,240
extensibility

00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,599
for the cli component of zoe as shown on

00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,000
the prior slide

00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:55,360
the these extensions of this extent

00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,319
extensibility

00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,080
manifests itself in the form of plug-ins

00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:03,520
here's how it works

00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,720
the cli and plugins run locally on your

00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,039
machine

00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,599
and they communicate to the mainframe

00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:11,120
through zlsmf services or the product

00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:14,000
apis

00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,759
product apis are cataloged in the api

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,759
navigation layer

00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:19,039
all that's left for you to do is to

00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,680
build the scripts

00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,800
that invoke your mainframe product of

00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,759
choice

00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,080
in the form of the zoe cli commands and

00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,000
then

00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:31,520
execute them along with the commands

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,639
required for your desktop tool of choice

00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,280
as an example you could execute a zoe

00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,520
cli

00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,919
endeavor move command from a jenkins

00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:42,560
pipeline essentially allowing jenkins to

00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:44,560
control your mainframe delivery process

00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,000
in the same manner that it orchestrates

00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,280
your mobile cloud

00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,280
or distributed delivery process

00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,720
two final points before we dive into

00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,840
conformance

00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,599
first traditionally these tools shown in

00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,080
the box on the left

00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:01,919
and any desktop tool for that matter

00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,400
have been applicable only to mobile

00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:08,400
cloud and distributed environments

00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:10,560
zoe makes them applicable for mainframe

00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,000
and second how do you know whether or

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:16,160
not a mainframe product has

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,919
a zoe plug-in and if it has one

00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:21,520
how do you know whether or not it's

00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:23,680
compatible with a given zoe release

00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,039
i guess that was more like one point in

00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,800
two questions

00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:29,680
sorry about that but the answers can be

00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,560
found on the

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,279
conformance pages at zoe.org let me

00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,839
describe

00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:38,560
the program and then i'll guide you

00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,560
through those answers

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,479
we'll start with the simple question

00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:45,279
what is conformance

00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:47,279
as a consumer of any zoe component you

00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:49,040
may be interested in taking advantage of

00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:51,040
product plugins

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,959
what i was describing the off host

00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,519
enablement zoe provides

00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:57,440
we talked about the ca endeavor zoe cli

00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,480
plugin and the ibm db2

00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,680
zos cli plugin it's important that you

00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,480
understand

00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:06,399
unless they are explicitly included as

00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,680
part of or zoe

00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:12,720
and i will show you how you can tell

00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:15,200
these plugins are not developed by the

00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,760
zoe community

00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,959
they are developed and delivered by an

00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,000
extender

00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:24,320
in this case broadcom developed the ex

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,839
the uh the endeavor plug-in while the

00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:30,000
zoe community developed

00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:32,160
the db2 plug-in how then as a consumer

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,680
can you be assured that the extension is

00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:37,040
compatible with

00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:38,160
and similar to that is has a similar

00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,440
look and feel from

00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:44,480
you know a ux perspective how can

00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:47,839
you be assured that

00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:51,200
the plug-in and extensions are

00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:53,920
compatible with core zoe that's where

00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,480
the zoe conformance program comes in

00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,680
it was developed by the zoe community as

00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,880
a means to ensure

00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:03,200
that each plugin and extension

00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,760
associated with a given zoe component

00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,920
has met a minimum set of requirements

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,560
that enable them to deliver common

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:13,839
functionality

00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:16,839
in addition to ensure interoperability

00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:19,200
and offer a common user experience

00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:23,120
essentially this program

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:26,320
was designed to ensure both providers

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:28,240
and consumers of zoe a high level of

00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,200
confidence with extensions

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,560
let's take a look at both perspectives

00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,200
as a provider

00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:37,440
of a zoe conformant application the

00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,440
conformance program

00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,680
ensures my application will behave as

00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:44,399
designed and as i intended

00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:47,200
in the zoe ecosystem helps me to

00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:49,440
maximize the value of my application

00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,800
helps to ensure that other applications

00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,000
will not break mine

00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,120
and mine won't break any others allows

00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,200
my product

00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,160
the ability to partner with and

00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,360
participate

00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:04,240
in the zoe ecosystem

00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,240
allows me to market my product extension

00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:11,120
sometimes we refer to these as

00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:13,519
zoe apps using the zoe brand

00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,480
as a consumer of a zoe conforming

00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,120
application

00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,279
the conformance program allows me to

00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:22,240
leverage a common infrastructure stack

00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:23,279
across multiple vendor applications

00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,959
provides me with

00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,640
operational confidence through

00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:29,760
transparency

00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,160
that is conformant apps clearly indicate

00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,760
which

00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:36,480
zoe releases they're certified with

00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,279
allows me to quickly understand which

00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,200
extensions

00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,720
leverage the latest and greatest selling

00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,680
features

00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,480
ensures that my experience as a user is

00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,920
consistent

00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,880
across extensions and plugins and offers

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,200
the collective

00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,000
quality assurance of the community

00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,399
meaning

00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,839
all conformant applications have been

00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,839
vetted by the community

00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:02,560
how does the conformance program help to

00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,480
ensure all of the points we just

00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:08,079
reviewed for both providers

00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:10,079
and the consumers well when a zoe

00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:12,000
extender applies for conformance

00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:14,800
they need to ensure their extension

00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,720
meets all of the required test criteria

00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,519
entries for the particular component

00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:22,000
they are extending each component has

00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:24,240
their own set of criteria

00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,160
the criteria is determined by each of

00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,200
the zoe squads currently supporting

00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,839
their respective

00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,720
components so for example the zoe cli

00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,959
squad

00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,000
submitted the list of zoe cli test

00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,600
criteria

00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,040
and they're also responsible for

00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,399
maintaining it

00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:43,440
a sample of this zoe

00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:45,839
cli test criteria is located on the

00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,399
right of this chart

00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,839
the zoe on boarding squad is responsible

00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:53,120
for vetting the criteria

00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:56,639
and any changes with existing extenders

00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:58,320
to ensure that the entries are clear

00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,959
it's important to understand that the

00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:03,839
criteria is associated with specific

00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,480
zoe releases and that the required

00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,200
entries

00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,279
will not change throughout the active

00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,040
and maintenance phases of a long-term

00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:14,079
support release

00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:17,440
this helps both providers and consumers

00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:20,399
of conformant apps to understand

00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:23,920
that their earned badge is applicable

00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:26,320
for the life of the lts release

00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:28,000
let's dig into this a little bit more i

00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,920
want to make sure it's clear for all of

00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,839
you

00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,240
so this diagram depicts the zoe release

00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:37,839
timeline

00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:39,920
in this timeline um well let's say as of

00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:41,040
september 2020 which is where we're at

00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,320
today

00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:48,000
zoe is currently in the active lts

00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:51,680
or long-term support phase of the v1 lts

00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:54,639
release at a point in the future

00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:56,240
sometime in the first half of calendar

00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:59,600
year 2021

00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:01,519
zoe v1 lts will transition to a

00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:04,959
maintenance phase

00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,959
during these two phases

00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:12,079
i'm highlighting it there with a red box

00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,639
during these two phases of the v1 lts

00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:15,600
release

00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:17,440
the zoe conformance v1 test criteria

00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,600
will be applicable

00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,600
this means that any extension that has

00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,560
earned a zoev1 batch

00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,560
will be certified with the v1 lts

00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:30,560
releases of zoe

00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:33,440
and those releases start at 1.9

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,959
and continue up until the most current

00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:40,320
release

00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:42,959
v1 lts is still in the active phase

00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,480
now when v1 lts goes into the

00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:47,760
maintenance phase

00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:51,040
v2 lts will transition from

00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:53,760
current to active lts

00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:55,680
when this happens again highlighting

00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:58,639
with the red box

00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:00,959
a new v2 conformance badge will be

00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:03,040
available and required

00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:04,480
at this point extenders will need to

00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,560
ensure that their apps

00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,240
meet any new test criteria that was

00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:11,839
introduced with the v2

00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,320
lts release in other words they need to

00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:15,440
earn

00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:17,839
the v2 badge

00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,880
note there is no conformance assigned to

00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:22,079
the current

00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:25,040
lts phase that's the phase

00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:26,240
that's colored in green and this is by

00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,480
design

00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,480
current represents a phase that may

00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:33,519
introduce features that cause errors

00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,839
known as breaking changes

00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:37,839
if you're interested in more details on

00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:41,920

00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:44,079
please visit zoe.org backslash download

00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:46,480
you will find this diagram and more

00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:49,199
details

00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,800
at the bottom of this page so go ahead

00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:53,440
and reach down

00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:55,839

00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,839
download

00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,399
okay so let's re-ask those questions we

00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,480
reviewed a short while ago

00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:05,279
the first how will you know if your

00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:07,440
mainframe product has a zoe plug-in

00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:10,399
and second how can you be sure it's

00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:13,199
compatible with a specific release

00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:15,600
the answers lie with the zoe conformance

00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,600
badge

00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,800
at this time i'd love to ask you all to

00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,680
take a moment and open up your browser

00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:25,120
and type in

00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:27,279
zoe.org go ahead and hit enter

00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,519
page down until you see the zoe

00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:31,199
conformance program banner

00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:34,320
it's the banner that i show on this

00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:37,680
chart go ahead and click on that learn

00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:40,720
more button

00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,360
page down is until you see the words the

00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,920
following

00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,360
products have earned zoe conformant

00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:49,120
status

00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:50,079
and remember the zoe v1 badge confirms

00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,759
the extension

00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:56,880
or plug-in is conformant with the zoe v1

00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,880
lts release

00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:02,000
when you page down you will be presented

00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,720
with a list of zoev1

00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,079
conformant apps or extensions and

00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:09,520
they'll be in the form of

00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:12,240
cards categorized by the component

00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,439
which means you'll see a list of zoe api

00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,640
mediation layer

00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:19,439
informing apis a list of zoe up

00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,880
framework conformant plugins and a list

00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:24,240
of zoe cli

00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:25,199
conformant plugins notice there are

00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,720
conformant

00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:33,120
apps cards from

00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:35,039
enix software ibm rocket and broadcom

00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,320
but there are also cards that have the

00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:39,600
zoe logo

00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:40,480
what did they represent well earlier i

00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,280
mentioned

00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:45,200
the zoe extensions could be delivered as

00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:48,480
part of zoe core

00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:50,960
or they could be delivered by extenders

00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,960
the cards with the zoe logos represent

00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:56,400
extensions that are included with

00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:59,200
four zoe the cards with the other

00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,320
logos are not delivered as part of zoe

00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,280
core

00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:05,120
to determine how the non-core extensions

00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,840
are delivered

00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,880
click on the card to view the details

00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:12,480
the website

00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:16,000
should provide you with those details

00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:19,039
and as an fyi i framed a list of v1

00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:22,000
conformant apps from several weeks ago

00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:23,520
and this is already out of date the web

00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,760
page you are viewing now

00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:28,960
is the most accurate reference for all

00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:32,000
of the zoe conformant apps

00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:35,440
one more point before i wrap this up

00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,720
is this the exhaustive list of all zoe

00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,760
extensions

00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:42,240
probably not i say that because it is

00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,039
absolutely possible that extensions and

00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,080
plugins

00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:47,520
exist for any of the zoe extensible

00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,720
components

00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:53,200
and they may not be conformant

00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,000
the question you need to ask yourself as

00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,480
a consumer

00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,160
of any of the apps are you willing to

00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:01,440
use an extension

00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:03,280
that has not earned conformance i hope

00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:06,400
this session has helped you to decide

00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:10,320
how to answer that question

00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:11,840
and finally at broadcom we see ourselves

00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,360
