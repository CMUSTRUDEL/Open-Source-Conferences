	Open Source Tool to Modernize the Build of the z/OS Development, using Jenkins and Git - Jerry Edgington, Western & Southern Financial Group

Polycephaly is intended to be a key technology in expanding access to mainframes. The name comes from the Greek word meaning “a condition of having more than one head,” because the project marries two different development life cycle methodologies, distributed and z/OS. Polycephaly requires minimal z/OS system programming, and provides flexible development paths and options, moving from linear to non-linear development. It removes the need for separate development paths for distributed and z/OS workloads. Developers can develop on any platform, store to Git and Jenkins to deploy. Plus it has all the benefits of the 1000+ Jenkins plugins, The OMP Polycephaly is a set of Groovy scripts, building upon IBM DBB technology, in an effort to jump start and aid conversion to Jenkins and Git
