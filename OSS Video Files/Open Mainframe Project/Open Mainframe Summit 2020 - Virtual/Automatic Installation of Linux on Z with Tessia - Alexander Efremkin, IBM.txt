	Automatic Installation of Linux on Z with Tessia - Alexander Efremkin, IBM

Whether you are new to IBM Z or have some experience already, installing Linux on Z manually had never been an easy task. Tessia - an IBM open-source project - automates Linux on Z installation, provides datacenter resource management capabilities for better control over project resources and unifies LPAR, z/VM and KVM operations. Alexander Efremkin, Tessia architect, demonstrates how to get a friendlier experience of Linux on Z installation and customization with Tessia.
