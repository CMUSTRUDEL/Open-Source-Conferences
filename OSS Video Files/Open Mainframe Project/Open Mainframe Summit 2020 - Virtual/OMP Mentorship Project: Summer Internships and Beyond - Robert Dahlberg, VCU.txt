	OMP Mentorship Project: Summer Internships and Beyond - Robert Dahlberg, Virginia Commonwealth University

This session is an introduction to the OMP Mentorship Project. The Mentorship Project focuses on developing the mainframe's future workforce. Currently the main objective of the project is to run the OMP summer internship program. Student from 6 of the 7 continents have participated (no one yet from Antarctica) have participated. This session will cover the summer internship in detail. How to participate (as a mentor/mentee), how to submit a project, how the program is run and why it is important. Highlighting some of our successes and the some of the program's greatest challenges. The session will also cover other initiatives planned for the future of the Mentorship Project.

	00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,520
this is the mentorship project summer

00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:06,399
internships

00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:09,040
and beyond uh session i'm bob dolberg

00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:12,160
i'm your speaker

00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:15,759
so as the workforce

00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,920
in mainframes gets older we'll need to

00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:18,800
start training and providing opportunity

00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,400
for the next

00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,400
uh the next generation so this is what

00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,599
this project is really all about

00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,560
developing the

00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:30,240
engineers and developers of tomorrow uh

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,679
the skill sets uh

00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,680
is going to have to be different than

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:37,200
the previous skill sets of the previous

00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:39,200
generation because uh unlike

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,399
the last generation it's not just need

00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,600
of of

00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,640
mainframe skills but also of linux and

00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,280
uh

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,760
the enterprise in general so what does

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,120
the

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,440
mentorship project do so one of the

00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,440
biggest things we do is manage and

00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,680
coordinate the open mainframes

00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,520
uh summer internship program which is

00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,520
international

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,800
another thing we do is we provide

00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,960
projects for

00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,040
academic credit usually in capstone

00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:10,159
projects or independent studies

00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,760
for students to work on projects

00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,280
at their universities and get college

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,880
credit for it

00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,640
we really want to facilitate open

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,159
mainframe workforce development

00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,000
uh we work closely with a lot of the

00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,159
other projects

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,840
we collect uh projects from other

00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,400
sources in the open mainframe project

00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:29,759
and from user the user

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:32,000
membership so some of the benefits and

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:35,040
some of the things we do is we expand

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,600
the knowledge of the younger technicians

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,680
coming in

00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,280
using things like master the mainframe

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,320
providing

00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,000
webinars and ted talk tech talks

00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,920
we're trying to develop these crucial

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,840
skills for tomorrow's

00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,759
enterprise like i said it's more than

00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,720
just mainframe skills

00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,560
it's mainframe skills in tandem with

00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,759
distributed processing

00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:00,640
environment so we provide

00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,600
again summer internships projects for

00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,439
credit

00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:07,920
and we try to expose the mentees to

00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,039
things like key companies and technical

00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,399
professions

00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:14,160
professionals try to aid their

00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,160
transition into career path

00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,599
so the summer internship this is the

00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,760
biggest part of

00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,360
what the mentored ship project does and

00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,720
so we'll go in a lot more detail what

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,280
it's all about

00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,720
and what is entailed and participating

00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,319
in it

00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:32,400
so like i said the mentorship program

00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,440
runs the summer internship we've

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,720
successfully

00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:38,720
had interns on

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,400
six of the seven continents we have yet

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,680
to uh have

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:46,000
an intern from antarctica but generally

00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,599
we start in october in october

00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,120
the projects we start collecting

00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:52,000
projects for the next year

00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,040
and also we're looking for projects in

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,879
the pipeline pretty much

00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:59,760
all year long because usually the

00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,159
projects for credits start in january

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,599
and

00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:04,319
in august but in october we do the real

00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:07,120
push

00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:08,879
for getting the different projects for

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,159
the summer internship

00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:15,599
november we start recruiting

00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:17,440
interns to participate by october

00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,200
we pretty much understand who the

00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,720
mentors are going to be to help the

00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,959
mentees or the

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,319
interns but november the flyers go out

00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:27,360
in a call for

00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:30,400
interns so about march

00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:34,159
february march we close the

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:36,319
open invitation for mentors and

00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,519
we start the interview process and the

00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:40,799
interview process

00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:42,640
is we get what the preferences of the

00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,680
projects the projects are out there for

00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,799
the

00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:50,560
mentees to look at and they can bid

00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,680
on one or more projects those mentees

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,400
then go to the

00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,080
mentors who look over their

00:03:53,400 --> 00:04:00,239
qualifications and then

00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:02,239
they'll pick a number of mentees to do

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,480
live interviews find out what their

00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:07,519
interests and skills are

00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,519
by march uh april we select the

00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,799
the mentors select the mentees who work

00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:14,239
on their projects

00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:16,959
and usually we we target eight

00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:17,680
mentees for the year but uh in the past

00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,519
years

00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,519
and especially because of covid we've

00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,919
we've upped it to 11 because we don't

00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,440
have

00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:28,160
our expenses are lower by may 1st

00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:31,600
the summer internships start and this is

00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:34,880
where the whole process really begins

00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,080
so the in mentorship it's a paid

00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:39,680
internship

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:42,720
and after the first two weeks in may

00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:45,040
mid may we give out a five five hundred

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,919
dollar uh stipend

00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,720
then what we do is about midterm which

00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,120
is when

00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,199
we get to a point where we get a

00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,880
documented design and start

00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:58,720
doing the coding we get we release a

00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,919
twenty five hundred dollar step in

00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:04,000
and at the end of the project when they

00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,520
actually deliver code documentation and

00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,240
a video presentation

00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,039
we distribute a three thousand dollar uh

00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,479
stipend

00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:14,800
so we used to do this based upon timings

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:17,520
uh during the during the summer but we

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:20,400
went to something which is more of a

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,919
event-driven release so as the students

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,039
come up with their project plan they get

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,280
the first step in

00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,800
the second step in when they get their

00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,560
detailed design

00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,400
and uh starting their progress in

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,600
programming and

00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:36,000
finally the last one in

00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,800
when they finish the project sometime in

00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,759
august or september

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,320
so we have three phases first starts may

00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,360
1st

00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:47,440
generally and this is what we

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,479
call the burn-in process this is where

00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:52,160
we kick off

00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:54,080
the project the interns

00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,680
are the mentees and the mentors get to

00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,600
know each other they start setting up

00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,440
their environments they start

00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,919
defining their project plan that type of

00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,199
thing mid-cycle is about halfway through

00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:06,479
generally around july

00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:08,319
1st or mid-july it's not cast in stone

00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,080
and of course the drop dead date for the

00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,560
end of the mentorship is

00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,560
september 30th or it's earlier because

00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,360
we have two schedules we have a european

00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,720
schedule

00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,800
and we have a uh an american schedule

00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,479
so the myth like i said before the

00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,360
internship starts with the burn in

00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:26,400
period

00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,560
they engage socially with the mentor and

00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,240
mentee they set expectations

00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,080
they start developing learn about

00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,680
development practices for the project

00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,280
and the development environment that

00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,520
they'll be using

00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,280
they refine the project plan they start

00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,600
get to know each other they start

00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,120
figuring out what they can accomplish

00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,880
over the summer and they come up with

00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,720
basically milestones that they plan on

00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,800
meeting

00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,639
and of course the last thing in the

00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,560
burn-in period is we've got to get all

00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:55,680
the uh

00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,199
processing forms tax forms uh required

00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,199
by the linux foundation

00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,800
licensing and other things so that we

00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:03,039
can pay the interns

00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,280
and since we're dealing internationally

00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:07,919
this this we've got to get this stuff

00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,039
done in the beginning so that there's

00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:12,560
less problems with

00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:14,160
releasing stipends during the course of

00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,840
the program

00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,919
so the mentor mentorship our

00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,720
relationship uh we want them

00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:22,479
to identify at a time each week where

00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,720
they can meet via

00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:26,319
conference call or video conferencing of

00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,759
course sometimes the mentors and the

00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,319
mentees are

00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,599
maybe in different parts of the world so

00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,599
they've got to coordinate

00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:35,520
when they're going to meet and they need

00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:39,199
to be able to share

00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:42,720
documents and code in real time as

00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:44,639
mentees get need guidance or get stuck

00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,360
it's important that the mentor be able

00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:49,840
to uh look over their shoulder

00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,599
so we we to ensure the meetings are on

00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,840
their calendars so that they don't miss

00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,319
it

00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:56,240
don't forget about it and we got to make

00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,319
sure that mentees understand that they

00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,720
have a commitment to the project

00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,440
so you know if they've got other things

00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,440
going on

00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,479
we need to make sure that they are going

00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,599
to

00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:08,720
a lot time to do the project

00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:11,199
so we have a lot of different

00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,960
communication vehicles we use slack

00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,879
we have a slack channel on the open

00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,120
mainframe project

00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,000
we have video conferencing we can use

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,039
zoom whatever

00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,560
is preferenced by the mentee and mentor

00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:25,039
emails of course are important

00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,440
conference calls are essential

00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:29,680
and of course we use github and the open

00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,039
mainframes github in order to uh as a

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,320
repository to collect

00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:37,760
uh information and the source code

00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:40,080
so um as they as the mentees and the

00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:43,839
mentors get into a project

00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:46,880
we use something called community bridge

00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:50,080
and in community bridge what you can do

00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:52,160
is you can identify get into the pro

00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,160
community bridge and you can then click

00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,000
on view repository

00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,240
and that will take you right to the

00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,920
reposit github repository

00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:04,959
for the project so in the github

00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,920
repositories what we do is we set up a

00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:08,000
template

00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,680
so we have a documentation folder in

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,160
there and this is where all the designs

00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,480
go

00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,920
and any other information they need like

00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,399
requirements and

00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,160
project plan and things we have a folder

00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:21,200
for notes and research

00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:23,360
this is for as they find documentation

00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,240
or apis that they need to work with or

00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,160
other pro

00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,399
things that are helpful for someone

00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,399
who's picks up this pro

00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,519
project and takes a look at it they can

00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,240
find it

00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:36,000
we have status reports in there we want

00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,000
that'll be deleted after the project

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,279
is done but we want to make sure that we

00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,279
get status

00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:43,279
so that the mentors can have something

00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,800
to uh evaluate on

00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:47,839
and of course then there's the source

00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:50,720
code in src

00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,600
so the first phase is what we require in

00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,760
phase one

00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,600
which is the project plan and start

00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,240
collecting requirements now the project

00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,760
plan

00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:01,519
we have a set uh form it's very simple

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,360
basically we want the student's name the

00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,800
prod the mentor the project a short

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,760
description of the project that they

00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:09,279
have

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:11,200
define a short problem definition

00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:13,120
and of course then what we want to do is

00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,120
have them come up with kind of a

00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,279
a milestone plan in other words what

00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,279
week are you going to do

00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,480
what task and what's the goal of that

00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:22,720
that task

00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:26,560
and this is needed in order to get the

00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,560
uh the first step in the 500

00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:31,440
so midterm deliverables about midterm

00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,360
which is usually between you know july

00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,120
1st and july 30th

00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,480
by this time we expect the high level

00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:41,600
architecture uh some detailed design

00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,720
that that complements the high level

00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,079
design

00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,399
and what we entail here is that the two

00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,640
should

00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,519
uh you know one should refer to the

00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,200
other

00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,800
so as i look at the detail level design

00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,079
in terms of the components i should be

00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,640
able to see that on the arc

00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:58,079
high level architecture so what we try

00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,240
to encourage is that

00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:02,399
designs and documentation are living

00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,320
documents in other words

00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,440
as you change your project change the

00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,959
documentation

00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:11,600
this is a good practice because it

00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:14,720
allows them to perform good habits

00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,760
so in this phase of course we're doing

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,800
the high level design

00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:21,200
detailed level design and of course

00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,560
commenting the code all projects are

00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,720
different so the

00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,800
artifacts that they produce for a high

00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,880
level design is really up to the mentor

00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,920
and mentee same thing with detailed

00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,160
level design

00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,920
and of course the code in the comments

00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,120
these things that all complement each

00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,519
other

00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,880
so these things are required again these

00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,560
things should be

00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,640
living documents because if you get in

00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:45,760
the habit of documentation

00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:47,519
both on paper and in the code

00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,760
it makes life easier and i don't know if

00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:52,240
how many of you have looked at

00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,040
sort open source code we're trying to

00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,880
improve

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,240
uh the quality of documentation that

00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,600
goes with it so it's easier to

00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,079
understand it's quicker

00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,920
to be able to understand what's going on

00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:03,839
so a high level architecture might be

00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,880
something like a uml diagram

00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:08,160
where you've got the different

00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:09,440
components here and of course you've got

00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,040
in the components you've got the

00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,720
different modules that are attached to

00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,760
those components

00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,560
again this is just one example detailed

00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,200
level design

00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,560
like i said should complement the

00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,120
architecture

00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,240
as you refer start identifying in the

00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,480
detail design

00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,839
what each module does that's referenced

00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,480
in the

00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,920
the architecture we expect something in

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,160
that just very simple we're not trying

00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,160
to do a lot of documentation but we want

00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,560
some things to create a roadmap for

00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,360
people coming in looking at it trying to

00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,600
figure out the

00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,519
the source code so a description of the

00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,680
module what are the input outputs

00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,200
what are the apis or external calls and

00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,600
are there special

00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,639
data structures you're using in them now

00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,320
in the

00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,760
comments in the code that's where you

00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,480
get really detailed

00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:58,240
uh about what's going on in the module

00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,200
and that should complement

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,880
so when i look at a source code module i

00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,440
should be able to go into the module

00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,680
then

00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,360
or the the program and then see the

00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,279
detailed compliments and there should be

00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:12,320
some compliments of going on so

00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:14,000
the idea here is it's a three-tiered uh

00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,079
documentation architecture as we're

00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,560
looking at

00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:20,320
and of course the final phase is the

00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,720
finished code we want complete and

00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:25,200
documented code we want the

00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,200
documents that that document the code as

00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,839
well like the high level

00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,760
our architecture and the detailed design

00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:33,519
we also want testings

00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,880
unit and system testing of course we

00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,959
realize that

00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,320
you know a developer can't really test

00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:40,639
his own code

00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:43,360
from a user perspective but we expect

00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:46,160
that something that should be

00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,360
something that could be wrong uh at we

00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,600
also are going to expect

00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:52,000
them to do a demo and we want them to

00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,920
record that demo in a presentation

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,279
and of course complete the final

00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:59,360
documentation for

00:13:55,279 --> 00:14:02,079
turnover in the presentation

00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,959
we started doing this this this year as

00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:04,800
a matter of fact

00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:06,959
because uh we didn't have live

00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:09,040
conferences to send students to

00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,240
but we felt that this was actually

00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,800
better that uh

00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,959
and actually we'll go back to the live

00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:17,199
conferences when covet's over

00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:19,199
but we still are going to do video

00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:22,079
presentations because

00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:22,880
this this gives the more exposure for

00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:25,040
the students

00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:27,199
and the projects because we can use them

00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,240
for marketing materials we can also use

00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:31,199
them

00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,639
highlight the project uh get a quick

00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:35,120
update about what the project's all

00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:37,440
about so it gives more

00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,880
exposure to the students so there's many

00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,160
days we can do this we can do a

00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,560
powerpoint slides

00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,399
and of course in a powerpoint slide you

00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:47,040
can powerpoint itself you can

00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:49,680
create a video with the slides using the

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,360
insert audio which i've got over here

00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,040
just on the right here to show and we

00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,519
show them how to do that

00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:57,120
so the demo uh with with the powerpoint

00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,720
slides you can also do a demo

00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,560
so you can go not only from the

00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,160
powerpoint slides but you can go outside

00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:05,600
the powerpoint slides

00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:07,199
using the ins in insert screen recording

00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,839
and actually go through a demo and of

00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:14,160
course then we create the uh

00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:17,360
mp4 uh presentation

00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:19,760
so the uh projects for academic credit

00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,920
that's basically the same as what we do

00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,839
during the normal year we get mentors we

00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:26,079
get projects they work with a professor

00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:28,240
who's a faculty advisor

00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,759
and the students there's no monetary

00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,240
compensation here

00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:34,240
the students get academic credit now

00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,720
these projects can run one semester or

00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,560
two semester depending upon

00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,440
what the univ what the specific

00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:43,680
university how they run their program

00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,560
the code they need to create an open

00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:49,040
source they need to use the mainframe

00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,720
open mainframe github and we also are

00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,920
going to require a

00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:56,000
recorded video at the end of the project

00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,959
so what's next going on here for the

00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,040
mentor so

00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:01,199
basically that's that's the main things

00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,519
we do is the

00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:05,040
projects for credit and uh the

00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,120
mentorship

00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,120
summer internships so what else we

00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,759
trying to do well we collect a lot of

00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,639
projects

00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:13,279
through the uh technology projects and

00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:17,120
these are the

00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:20,000
projects that are in uh open mainframe

00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,839
and we collect a lot of projects here we

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,560
also work with the

00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:24,959
mentoring and uh learning modules where

00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,399
we've

00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:29,759
also in addition to the mentorship

00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:32,320
project we've got the

00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,199
kobo pro programming courses and we've

00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,880
got the

00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:37,040
education which is brand new starting

00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:39,600
we're starting to create curriculum

00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,480
but we also have other uh industry

00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,480
partners

00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:47,120
such as ibm rocket these are all uh

00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,720
these these areas we get partners we get

00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,759
projects for and they also help with the

00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:53,360
mentoring of

00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:55,759
students so we can also collaborate

00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,399
with our other industry partners here's

00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,560
just some

00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,839
some smaller areas that we've gotten

00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:04,319
projects from

00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:07,600
you see ibm there you see uh

00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:10,400
jenkins and you see uh walmart labs

00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,120
and of course uh this is this is an area

00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,160
where we can

00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:17,600
uh go beyond just with the vendor

00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:21,120
uh type of sponsorships but also

00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:23,760
go with other companies that can

00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:25,360
sponsor projects through the open

00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,039
mainframe mentorship

00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:30,880
so some of the academic partners we've

00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:34,000
got some academic partners that are very

00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,600
active in the open mainframe

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,200
especially the mentorship we've got

00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:40,080
marxist college which provides

00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,960
us uh with resources on their uh

00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,919
mainframe

00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,520
um at their university we've also got

00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:50,400
eastern

00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:52,160
carolina is very active north carolina

00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,559
agriculture and technology is very

00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,480
active western is very active and of

00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:58,840
course the university i come from which

00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,080
is virginia commonwealth university also

00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,160
active

00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,640
so what's the next one we want to

00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:07,679
increase academic membership

00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,039
we promote the learning opportunities

00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:12,240
and awareness

00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:14,799
i'd like nothing more than to start a

00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,679
kind of a group that can discuss and be

00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:18,880
more active

00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:20,880
in this we also want to encourage

00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,440
uh development sharing of mainframe

00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,440
curriculum

00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,960
it's it's i think we can produce more

00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:30,400
well-rounded uh

00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:33,200
computer science students and town pool

00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,600
if we include not just mainframe and not

00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,000
just

00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,960
distributed systems but a combination of

00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,200
both because that

00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,840
is the reality of what the world is

00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,000
going to look like in the next

00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,240
generation

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,080
so we want to create also create new

00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,960
opportunities so we're increasing the

00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,440
number of

00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,559
intern summer internships and projects

00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,520
for credit

00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:55,679
uh we we work with hackathons creating

00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,760
digital badges

00:18:55,679 --> 00:19:00,480
so there's a lot going on here and a lot

00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:02,160
we can do and a lot we really want to do

00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,520
but we're going to need more people to

00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,400
help us so

00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,919
uh really we want to facilitate uh you

00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,559
know the talent pool

00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:12,480
and the the networking between the

00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:13,440
talent coming up the employers and

00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,919
academics

00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,360
uh i think this this is the three legs

00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:20,320
of the stool here

00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,960
that uh using the new talent coming

00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,039
through

00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,440
the employers or the companies out there

00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:27,200
in the field and academia i think

00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,559
getting those three working together is

00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,400
essential for the

00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:32,720
next generation and moving our

00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:35,760
discipline further

00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:37,440
so we we really need more members we

00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:40,559
need more active members

00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,760
so if you're inclined to help out it'd

00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,760
be great

00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,919
so that's it in a nutshell uh what we're

00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:50,240
all about so i'll open it up for

00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:50,240
