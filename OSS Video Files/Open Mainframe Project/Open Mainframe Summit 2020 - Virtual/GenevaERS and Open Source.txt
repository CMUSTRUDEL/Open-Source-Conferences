[Music]

00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,279
good morning

00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,400
from flower mountain texas i'm at

00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:11,120
grapevine lake

00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,639
in northern texas let's talk about

00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,040
mainframes this will be a longer

00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:17,600
conversation with kip than typical

00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,080
i haven't talked much about platforms

00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,560
but

00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:23,439
i'd like to talk more seriously about

00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,840
the mainframe because when it comes to

00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,599
financial systems the mainframe is an

00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,720
integral platform to our

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,000
systems and has been for decades now our

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,559
systems were early

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,680
on automated financial systems were some

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,000
of the first systems

00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,680
automated and they were automated in a

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,480
serious manner

00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,800
we we did that because it was expensive

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:48,079
to do bookkeeping associated with

00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:51,440
financial systems and the computer

00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:54,480
did away with whole rooms full of people

00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,719
that didn't have to do that work anymore

00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,320
the automation just saved a lot of money

00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,760
and increased accuracy

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:05,360
tremendously just as an evidence of this

00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:08,400
who anymore spends times reconciling

00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:10,799
their bank accounts i think that's uh

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,159
i don't think no that anybody does that

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,720
because effectively

00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:17,040
our banking systems have become accurate

00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:20,640
enough that we don't have to check them

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:23,520
if you go back 50 60 years

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,799
because it was done by clerks everyone

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,479
reconciled their

00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,159
their bank statement to make sure that

00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:29,280
somebody didn't add up something

00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,920
incorrect

00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,280
three years ago i kind of went off of

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,479
the mainframe

00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,000
became frustrated by the inability to

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:41,280
convince customers to go

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,920
modify their mainframes and to enhance

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,720
and

00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,320
renew them and to make them do more and

00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,200
make them do better

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,920
the pc and cloud-based systems based

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,159
upon blades and those kinds of things

00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,600
has just been known for a long time that

00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,360
those systems were

00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,280
lower costs you could string enough of

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,399
them together to get the capacity that

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,079
you saw

00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:07,280
within a mainframe system and so

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,959
that approach clearly has has taken over

00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,920
much of the computing world

00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,879
and no doubt that it's a it's a winner

00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:17,040
by and large

00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:19,920
for cloud-based approaches it it hasn't

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,560
impacted completely the mainframe it

00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:26,400
hasn't taken away the mainframe

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:29,680
in 1991 a info world rider

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,120
predicted that the the mainframe the

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,959
last mainframe would be turned off on

00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,560
march 15

00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:40,319
1996 as i said that this week to a

00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:42,160
friend cb alex he said kip

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,519
we're coming up on the 25 year

00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,800
anniversary of the death of the

00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:48,840
mainframe then

00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:52,000
next march 15th march 15th

00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,680
2021 about six months away

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,440
it might be six months away from the day

00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,840
i released this video

00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,480
25 years since the death of the

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:03,680
mainframe was proclaimed

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,519
that's a long time we will

00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,800
celebrate the death of the mainframe

00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,840
well we need to

00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,519
we need to prepare for celebrating the

00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,360
death of the mainframe

00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:18,080
on march 15 1996 here 25 years

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,800
later what are we gonna do part of that

00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,120
is to

00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,879
talk about this why is why did the

00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,959
mainframe not die

00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,920
what happened to the death of the

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,080
mainframe

00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,519
and how have we done how's that death of

00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,879
the mainframe going

00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:37,360
well it's terrible i mean for for these

00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:37,360
large financial systems

00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:42,640
very little of them have been taken off

00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:45,920
of the mainframe

00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,959
why is that let's compare this for just

00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,200
a moment with

00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,959
with what goes on in other systems that

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,280
have been automated in

00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:56,000
in the last couple of decades that are

00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,400
not these kinds of financial systems

00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,200
if you think about the underlying data

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,720
structures

00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,120
that sit below the major systems of the

00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,720
world

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,040
the major computer systems when you

00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,439
think of them what's the fundamental

00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,200
data principle that organizes for

00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:13,840
example a search engine

00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,880
how is the search engine organized the

00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,880
fundamental data principle is a url

00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,519
everything pretty much in the search

00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,840
engine is organized around a url

00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,600
a social media site what is the

00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,800
fundamental organizing principle for its

00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,600
data

00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,360
it's a post everything is organized

00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,840
around a post

00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,479
for an online retailer what is the major

00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:39,280
organizing data principle

00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:41,040
it's a sku it's a product that's the

00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,000
major now those aren't the only data

00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,080
structures there are other

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,919
data structures that work around those

00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,040
but those are the major core data

00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,360
structures

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,080
well when it comes to a financial system

00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,160
what is the

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,720
major data structure well you know it

00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,000
well because your credit card statement

00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,919
shows it to your bank statement

00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,520
shows it to you and it happens in every

00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,680
business process and by financial

00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,960
process i don't just mean banking

00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,560
i mean large business systems where you

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,320
keep track of money

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,400
like payroll systems accounts payable

00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,240
accounts receivable shipping receiving

00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,919
inventory all of those things keep track

00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,919
of money they're all financial systems

00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,199
at their core they all have ledgers at

00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:20,000
their core

00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:22,560
all of these systems the data structures

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,440
involved are a set of transactions

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,320
and a set of balances but the difference

00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,280
right there

00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:31,520
is that the balance incorporates all of

00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:34,160
the history of all the transactions

00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,960
the mainframe because it was automated

00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,759
early

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,400
and because the systems that were put on

00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,199
it

00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,199
were critical business systems that

00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,360
errors were a problem

00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,880
the error rates in those systems were

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,840
driven to

00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,400
nearly zero let me give you an example

00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,680
if

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:56,560
your search engine drops a url

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,600
in response to your query of the search

00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,360
engine

00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,280
what's the likelihood that you will ever

00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,360
know

00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,880
how would you know that a search engine

00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,280
didn't present you with some results

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,720
that it should have presented you

00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,600
there might be ways of knowing but it's

00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:14,240
not very common not very easy to do

00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,919
if if a social media post dropped

00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,360
certain posts social media platform

00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:19,120
drops certain posts

00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,720
and they don't show you some post you'll

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,360
never know if a

00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,560
on online retailer doesn't show you

00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,639
certain products

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,160
well you might know then last week my

00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,240
online retailer wouldn't show me a

00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,240
particular product that i knew they had

00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,759
and i was a little bit upset by that but

00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,560
that's a little bit of an unusual case

00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,759
you really

00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:41,199
rarely know that that results

00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:43,199
okay i was talking to a major

00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,720
transportation shipping company

00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,840
yesterday with a set of people

00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,120
there and and i said what's the

00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:53,440
likelihood

00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:56,560
that somebody notices that that package

00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:58,319
that was shipped was dropped

00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,840
that there wasn't it wasn't listed or

00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,319
wasn't built or it was

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,039
it was lost in transit well the

00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,639
likelihood's

00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:10,240
very high if you're a vendor

00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:13,919
and your the credit card system

00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:17,120
drops a payment due to you

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:19,120
are you going to know well there's a

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,720
very good chance you will know

00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,639
you will find that out you will figure

00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,960
that out and you will be upset

00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,720
when it's dropped see the issue with

00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,039
these business systems is

00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,400
it's not about the transaction it's

00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,080
about the balance

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,720
the balance is what's important the

00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,720
balance is where all the processes begin

00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,000
when you log into your financial system

00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,720
the first thing you look at is the

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,479
balance you want to know how much

00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,080
am i at what's the position at this

00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,840
point in time and the balance

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,919
is an accumulation of all of the

00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,560
activity see the the

00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:52,560
complexity of these business systems is

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,560
that they have to accumulate

00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,000
all of these transactions to get to the

00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,560
right balance and if the balance is

00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,479
wrong

00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,639
you're going to know it the mainframe

00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:03,919
drove air rates

00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:07,039
to near zero these things can run

00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:10,160
for and sometimes decades without

00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:12,319
any unexpected outages that's

00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,199
unbelievable i mean it really is

00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,400
incredible

00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:19,520
what these systems do that they can go

00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:21,919
so long it it's very common to go an

00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,800
entire year and not have any unexpected

00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:26,240
outage

00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,759
in one of these systems my laptops over

00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,759
the years have become better but they're

00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:32,479
nowhere near

00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,479
that sort of capability particularly if

00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:37,360
they're running day and night

00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,680
full bore on their systems being used

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,279
right

00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,800
it doesn't mean they don't have downtime

00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:42,159
there is downtime that goes on these

00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,640
systems but it's planned

00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,279
downtime and it's very small in some

00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,360
systems

00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:49,040
there is no down time there is no

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,959
planned down time there is no downtime

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:53,200
they run continuously

00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,480
for year after year after year and

00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,399
that's the very largest

00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,240
systems that have to do that the

00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:02,080
mainframe drove the air rates

00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,760
to zero but it's expensive to do that

00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,279
it's very expensive to do that and it

00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,360
was expensive to do it at the time

00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,760
because the systems were built at a time

00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,000
when

00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,519
a gigabyte of storage cost seven million

00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,480
dollars

00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,440
so those systems are expensive more

00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,720
expensive than

00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,480
other cheaper kinds of systems to run

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,240
but the business requirements behind

00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,959
those systems

00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,160
are higher business requirements the

00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:28,160
lower cost hardware

00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,560
was not designed that way so how do we

00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:33,279
deal with this in other systems

00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:35,120
where we try to use lower cost

00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:38,480
approaches to the problem

00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,040
the the machines that sometimes do give

00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,600
errors

00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,760
i mean it would be unexpected for

00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,160
someone to find a pc

00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,959
that has not had some down time in a

00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,720
year

00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:50,800
that just doesn't happen and when you

00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,839
string together pcs

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:57,040
in order to build a system you

00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:59,360
build in that kind of air raid

00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,480
and because they were we were automating

00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,519
systems of a less

00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,920
sensitive nature when we started to

00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,920
string together pcs to do it

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,120
the error rates weren't really a problem

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,800
the the

00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,160
functional requirements of business

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,320
systems

00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,680
far exceed most of these other more

00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,560
modern systems we've

00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,240
automated that functional requirement

00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,680
when we take and we try to use

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,920
redundancy

00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,760
on top of the functional requirement it

00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,800
makes the system

00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:32,000
unmaintainable they become too difficult

00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,600
to build and maintain because the error

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,920
rates involved

00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,959
just cause concerns even if you can

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,480
figure it out

00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:44,399
the redundancy issues become a problem

00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:46,560
the balance for a for these systems

00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,240
incorporates all of the transactions

00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,920
that have ever occurred to make the

00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,519
balance

00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,200
that's a difficult functional

00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:56,560
requirement

00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,560
for these kinds of systems

00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,680
we've spent 25 years now trying to get

00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,959
rid of the mainframe by

00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:08,640
using redundancy in lower cost systems

00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:10,399
we've gone for 25 years now of

00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,680
trying to move these applications off

00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:15,120
the mainframe

00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:17,920
and it hasn't worked it hasn't worked

00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,279
it's not going to work it hasn't worked

00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,440
it's not going to work

00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:23,519
it hasn't worked in 25 years it's not

00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:27,120
going to work in the next 25 years

00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:30,240
so let's just stop it

00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:32,640
so let's stop it let's stop the madness

00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,000
in a sense why hasn't it worked it's

00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,920
because redundancy

00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,160
is not an adequate strategy to the

00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,040
problem you have to drive down the air

00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,160
raids

00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:43,040
in order to make the system work and

00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,279
instead of

00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,480
all the cost we spend on trying to get

00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:50,000
them onto low cost

00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:51,920
hardware which cost may actually eat up

00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,560
most of the savings we have anyway for

00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,720
the higher cost hardware

00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,880
let's go renew these systems that were

00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,760
automated so early and make them do

00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:04,079
something more important something

00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,079
better

00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,120
well okay there's quite a bit of energy

00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:14,560
in that but it's true

00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,560
you can tell i'm passionate about it

00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,000
but this is only one side of the problem

00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,760
right

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,079
the other side of the problem is these

00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:27,440
systems have stagnated in the last 25

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:30,480
years and it's not just stagnated

00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:32,720
from you know the application side where

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,920
they haven't changed because everyone

00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,279
said they were going to die and we're

00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,959
going to move them off and we'll make

00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,320
them new when we move them off and that

00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:41,440
hasn't happened so

00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:44,000
they've stagnated functionally it's also

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,320
also stagnated from vendor perspectives

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,639
vendors have stopped investing in them

00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,240
vendors have stopped renewing the

00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:53,839
software stack

00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:57,279
these things have sat and not changed in

00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:58,959
very many ways in 25 years in a certain

00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:01,200
sense i think they've believed

00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,240
the message that the mainframe was going

00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,560
to die

00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,279
they've taken the profits for these

00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,279
systems

00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,399
that were very highly profitable and

00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:11,040
they've gone and invested

00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,639
in other things that haven't worked

00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,800
they've chased the market

00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,320
instead of standing with confidence that

00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,240
error-prone systems aren't going to be

00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,639
able to replace what they have

00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,160
instead of investing that money in

00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:25,519
things that don't work

00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:27,519
let's renew the platforms it requires

00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:30,000
having courage and not acting out of

00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,839
fear in some instances

00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,240
executives that own these sorts of

00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:36,399
business systems are fearful

00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:39,600
that they're going to lose the profits

00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:42,079
that they're they've got today

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,880
fear is rarely a very good motivator

00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:46,880
unless something's on fire

00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,399
what's the positive statement instead of

00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:51,440
being fearful

00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:53,839
about losing control what's the positive

00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:56,720
statement you want to make in the world

00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:58,240
revenue for a business is like breathing

00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,160
to an organism

00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,519
breath has to happen naturally

00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,480
frequently

00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:07,600
almost effortlessly it has to happen all

00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,839
the time for the organism to live

00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,880
but the end of one's life i can't

00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,920
imagine anyone

00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:17,519
saying that their life ambition had been

00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:20,639
to breathe that's just absurd

00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:22,800
so no one says that of life ambition

00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:23,680
and organization's ambition to make

00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,680
money

00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:28,399
is as meaningless as a life ambition to

00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,079
breathe so what's a vision

00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,000
i'd like to ask some of them i've not

00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:33,920
had these discussions this is me

00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,040
speaking here not my company or anything

00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,279
like that

00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,360
i'd like to ask them what is your vision

00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:42,240
for these systems what do we do next

00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,079
with these systems i've what we have

00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,160
systems here that have balances and

00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:48,160
transactions what's the vision for them

00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:51,040
we automated them early was that it

00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:53,040
that's the end of the world

00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:55,040
now that's ridiculous right you know

00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:58,800
from my videos you've seen me traveling

00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:00,560
around the world

00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,959
i travel around the world and i think

00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:05,519
about financial systems and at times

00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:06,240
you know i'm passing a a beggar in

00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,240
london

00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,399
and i realize i have no cash anymore

00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:13,199
we've gone to a cashless society i can't

00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,880
give them something i stopped one time

00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:16,160
used my credit card to take out some

00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:20,000
cash so i could give

00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:22,320
a beggar some money

00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,839
you know i drive through mexico city or

00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:27,360
through sao paulo

00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:28,320
or india and there's you know street

00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,120
vendors they're

00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,920
standing by my car and i don't have

00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,920
anything i could

00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:36,320
buy i don't have anything i could pay

00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,320
them with

00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,320
all of the executives of these companies

00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,839
everyone involved in business knows the

00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,399
power of measurement

00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:46,079
that measurement changes our behaviors

00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,720
over time

00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:50,240
measurement is a very powerful thing

00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,279
that tells us what we do well and what

00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,639
we don't do well

00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:54,639
what we should do more of and what we

00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,320
should do less of it tells us how to

00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:58,480
specialize and use our particular

00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:01,839
talents effectively

00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:04,560
well the poorest merchants in the world

00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:06,480
now have a computer it's called a cell

00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:09,920
phone

00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:11,759
there are hundreds of millions of these

00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:14,320
if not billions of people that have cell

00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:16,720
phones now

00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,440
do they have a measurement system that

00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,680
gives them

00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,880
impact on an information about what

00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,079
they're doing well and what they should

00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,959
do more of and what they

00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:25,759
don't do well why doesn't the street

00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:28,160
merchant

00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,880
have the ability to at the end of the

00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,839
day

00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,240
look on their computer that they own and

00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,600
know

00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,160
whether they made money or whether they

00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,560
lost money to know which products they

00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:40,079
sold

00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:42,320
that gave them the best profit to know

00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:44,720
what they should sell more of to look at

00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:47,279
a map of where they sold that week and

00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,920
and decide where was the best place to

00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,120
be placed

00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,560
to sell the things that they were

00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,680
selling all of that measurement that

00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:55,199
will impact their lives

00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,440
our financial systems and business

00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:59,440
systems don't do that today

00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,199
because they were automated in the 1960s

00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,000
and that was a bit ambitious for that

00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:04,240
time

00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,919
but it's not ambitious for today so

00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,039
what's our vision vendors

00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:08,720
what's the vision about how we're going

00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:10,079
to transform these systems what's your

00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,319
vision is there something better than

00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,319
that

00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,079
well let's get started on instead of

00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,400
fear of losing profits let's

00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:20,400
use the profits to solve some problems

00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,959
in the world

00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:25,760
i've got some passion there don't i this

00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:27,679
is kind of absurd

00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,960
okay so that takes something to do it we

00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,799
have to do that slightly differently

00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,520
because there have been changes made

00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:34,480
the the change of open source is

00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,960
changing the way

00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,679
systems work and the systems get built

00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,919
open source

00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:42,160
will change the software industry the

00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:45,360
margins that were accrued which are

00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:49,120
somewhat outra outlandish you know 15

00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:51,520
20 years ago of 70 80 margins

00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:53,919
consumers don't accept that sort of

00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:56,400
margin on any product and it's gonna go

00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:58,160
away and open source software

00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,240
is the means by which consumers are

00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:03,360
taking control of

00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:06,160
that margin and are lowering the cost of

00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,760
software so it's going to happen if

00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,919
someone will do open source

00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,200
and build a system that is not based

00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:12,799
upon redundancy

00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,799
but it's based upon driving the air

00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:17,919
rates to nearly zero

00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:20,480
for the systems then open source could

00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:22,320
take away the mainframe as well

00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,160
that's something possible there's

00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,960
another alternative there though

00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,880
the mainframe vendors could begin to be

00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,160
more open with their systems they

00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,480
recognize these trends

00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,320
they they've known this for for two

00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,919
decades they were early on spotters of

00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,320
this and some of them

00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:39,760
uh identified it sooner and other large

00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,160
organizations just recently

00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,960
admitted that their stand on open source

00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,960
was wrong

00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,480
and that they are going to adopt open

00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,000
source approaches to the problem and

00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,440
they're embedding linux in the core of

00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,880
their system

00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,080
today so that's another approach to

00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,520
solving this problem

00:18:54,080 --> 00:19:00,799
is that the existing vendors

00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:02,880
move to open source things um and maybe

00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:04,880
it will start with more the mainframers

00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,840
that are involved in this problem space

00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,440
right

00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,280
mainframers have believed that the

00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,120
systems were going to die

00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,960
and they've acted that way by and large

00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,360
they're quiet older people now they're

00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,520
not

00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,400
charging ambitious they're not there to

00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,120
create waves

00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,720
they just do their job knowing that that

00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,240
they'll have a job tomorrow for the most

00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,160
part because the system hasn't gone away

00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:27,520
in 25 years why is it going away

00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:29,200
now mainframers it's time to do more

00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,799
than that

00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,240
we need to step up we got to take some

00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:34,320
leadership

00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,840
you've done this in your younger age and

00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:38,160
it's time to do it again you have

00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,600
experience you have capacity now

00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,240
this isn't something somebody's going to

00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,799
pay you to do start with some volunteer

00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,400
work

00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:45,919
the kind of vision i just outlined is

00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,720
something that a lot of you could

00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,640
believe in

00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,160
helping in the world these kinds of

00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:53,039
problems

00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,880
let's get started on on transforming the

00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:57,520
systems and take some leadership

00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,640
where you need to go is there things

00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,480
that you need to learn some new

00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,640
technology the way open source

00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,760
works is a different way of our systems

00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,520
working

00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,880
it requires different tools and you're

00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,320
going to have to retrain yourself on

00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,559
some of those tools

00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,600
the cloud-based approach for source code

00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:14,480
management is

00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:16,799
very appropriate github is very powerful

00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:19,280
as a source code management tool

00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:20,080
and mainframers should need to know how

00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,480
it works and

00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,919
how to use it you need to know how to to

00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,440
look for open source

00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,440
mainframers need to approach their

00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,720
companies with these legacy systems and

00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,960
say hey

00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:33,280
this system is critical to us but it's

00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:36,880
not a critical asset to our business of

00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:38,799
the ages it becomes a liability to us

00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,320
can we take this part of our this

00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:42,720
critical system

00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,760
and can we open source it and can we

00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,919
work with others

00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,360
who are interested in this functionality

00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,280
to improve it

00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,520
if we had four businesses they all

00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:53,280
contributed their systems of a similar

00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:55,760
type to open source

00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:57,600
and the committee of knowledgeable

00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:00,640
individuals from each of those companies

00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,760
got on an open source call regularly to

00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,360
review

00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,960
their aspect of the system what's the

00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,400
best part of it what's the weakest part

00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,520
of it what's the thing that we could

00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,600
enhance

00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,120
could we integrate these parts of these

00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,080
systems together doing these similar

00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,559
functions see

00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,280
we stop thinking we're going to take the

00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:17,679
erp

00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:19,120
systems of the world and going to build

00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:20,799
them from scratch some place else

00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,039
because they've already been automated

00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:24,960
we won't do that it's too expensive the

00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:27,360
functionality that exists in the code

00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:29,919
that runs today on these systems even if

00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:32,159
we change the language and we converted

00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:35,679
from cobalt to java

00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:37,440
right converting from something that's a

00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:40,080
known language to another language

00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:44,320
is a tenth of the cost of rebuilding the

00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:48,080
system from scratch so

00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:50,640
mainframers it's time to step up

00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,200
and provide some leadership that's one

00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,280
thing that

00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,720
that i think is kind of needs to happen

00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,520
to do this

00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,720
i think also companies should be talking

00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,440
to their

00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,880
their vendors and saying open source

00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,520
your platform

00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,640
open source your operating system it's

00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:09,679
time

00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:12,880
these are too critical to us to

00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:16,480
allow you to have them die

00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:17,919
for fear it's time to open source them

00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,000
and it's not just about open sourcing

00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,840
things right i i have

00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,520
individuals who are trying to work on an

00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,360
open source project that i've recently

00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,679
become involved with

00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,960
and there's no public cloud for us to

00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:33,280
work on

00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:35,919
can you find public mainframe systems

00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:37,360
uh they're not very common right if i go

00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:39,360
to a cloud-based system i want to get

00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:41,120
certified in that cloud-based system

00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:44,080
they'll give me they'll give me an

00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:45,280
environment a large environment for some

00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:48,159
period of time

00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,720
they just give it to me for free there

00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,960
are

00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:53,679
there are tools available that could be

00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,840
made available more widely available

00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:57,280
that allow you to run a local instance

00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:00,720
of z

00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:01,200
can i run a vm well you have to have a

00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,440
key

00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,919
oh the keys aren't produced very

00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:08,320
frequently we've got to go buy more keys

00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:09,280
oh no this isn't a funded project for

00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,559
some

00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,880
these people are willing to volunteer

00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:15,440
their time to experiment

00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:17,919
with the software and do something new

00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:21,200
so release the vms

00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:26,480
for people to do stuff with let's let's

00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:26,480
get on with the work let's stop messing

00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:40,400
around

00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:42,799
well there's a bunch of energy for you

00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,799
isn't there

00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:48,320
this video is going to be released as

00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:51,360
part of the open mainframe project

00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:53,200
summit linux foundation is

00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,400
now supporting projects that are focused

00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,159
on zos

00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,720
that's a little bit of an unusual turn

00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:00,480
isn't it well it's a very good turn

00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,840
it's a very important turn it's what's

00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,080
going to help renew and restore this

00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:07,120
environment

00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:09,520
what a wonderful career i've had working

00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:12,799
in this problem space

00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:14,960
i passionate it's fun i love it the

00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:16,960
challenges are real

00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,799
i'm excited about the changes that will

00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,880
come because there will be changes that

00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:22,880
come our systems are aging

00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,559
and we're going to renew them they'll

00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:27,120
get renewed that's

00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:28,320
what happens in the world old things get

00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,080
renewed in some way

00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,880
and that's what we're going to do on

00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:36,000
these large financial systems

00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:38,480
and it'll be fun to be part of that

00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,240
it'll be fun to see how these trends

00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,720
that perhaps if i'm

00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:44,840
i don't know 70 percent accurate that's

00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:47,520
a pretty good accuracy

00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,880
prediction uh of what i predicted here

00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:51,279
in this video

00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,919
will help um will help further that

00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:56,240
along the open mainframe project

00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,600
is going to help make these changes

00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,440
happen

00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,520
participation by mainframers

00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:05,200
participation by vendors

00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:08,400
would help further this goal customers

00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,360
contributing their their large financial

00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,919
systems

00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,799
whether whatever kind to an open

00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:15,679
mainframe

00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:16,960
project to get started on building

00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:19,840
applications let's go

00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,720
share business data let's share the

00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,559
account of

00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,240
chart of accounts let's figure out how

00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:27,520
to share a ledger

00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:30,559
as another initiative i've tried

00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:32,320
and would like to continue further share

00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:33,600
information about ledgers and share

00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:36,960
ledgers

00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:40,640
let's go make the world a better place

00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:42,400
enabling a billion new people to

00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,159
improve their lives by coming into the

00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,159
digital economy

00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:47,919
by having measurement systems that help

00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:49,440
them track what they do

00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:51,279
and inform them what they could do

00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:54,000
better and how they could do it

00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:56,080
and do it at low cost and they don't

00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,200
have to understand finances

00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:01,840
these systems can do it for them this is

00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,600
conversations with kip

00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,880
thanks for listening love to have your

00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:11,840
feedback

00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:11,840
have a good day

00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:26,640
b

00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,480
what's the main frame for those of you

00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,520
that may not know let's talk about it

00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:33,200
briefly

00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:36,320
if you go back to 1959 there were rooms

00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:38,400
full of stuff in 2017 when i recorded a

00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,440
segment on my blog with jim ladocheski

00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,279
there

00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,840
it looks more like a refrigerator behind

00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:46,960
us they're just a server

00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:49,120
z is the ibm name for its

00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:51,360
mainframe hardware there are many

00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:54,559
operating systems that work on z

00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:56,080
one is the flagship system is z os which

00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:58,880
has probably the largest

00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:01,840
system the largest number of customers

00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:05,120
cics db2 cobalt all of that

00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:07,039
is a typical z os environment

00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:09,039
there's a very old application operating

00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:10,480
system called zvm which is a virtual

00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:11,760
machine one of the original virtual

00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,000
machines

00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,840
quite often it's used it can host any of

00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,120
these operating system but quite often

00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:20,880
it hosts

00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:23,360
the linux instances so smaller

00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,720
individual instances for linux hosted

00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:27,039
under zvm

00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,080
if you go down this list one of the

00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:30,240
systems that's

00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,799
highest performance lowest number of

00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:36,000
customers would be ztpf

00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:37,279
and that's a very high transaction

00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,159
processing

00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:40,880
facility system very few customers but

00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:44,240
very

00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:46,640
demanding uses of the system

00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,679
in some cases people might even class

00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:51,279
what

00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:53,279
was termed mini computers or mid-range

00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:55,120
that were smaller than mainframes when

00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:55,440
they were introduced but it was before

00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,480
the

00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:01,120
advent of pcs system i

00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,559
in the ibm nomenclature is one of those

00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:05,919
systems also known as

00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:07,840
as400 has many of the characteristics of

00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:11,360
z and still a widely used business

00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:13,360
system in many locations

00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:15,279
so here's the quote that uh stuart

00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:17,039
alsopa unfortunately

00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:18,320
gave and gets picked on because he gave

00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:20,880
such a specific date

00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:22,799
he wasn't alone in his predictions but

00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:26,399
he gave a very specific date

00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:28,000
on february 22 1993 in infoworld

00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:30,080
he said i predicted that the last

00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,760
mainframe will be unplugged on march

00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:34,000
15th

00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:37,159
1996. but

00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:40,080
uh arcadi made from yearbook survey

00:28:37,159 --> 00:28:42,159
2019 showed that there's a lot of growth

00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:45,520
in mainframe usage these are customers

00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:48,240
that are planning to grow their usage

00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:49,039
of the platform and there's you know

00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,200
eight percent

00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:53,039
going to have a decline eight percent

00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:55,200
will have no change

00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:56,960
but other than that that you've got 84

00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,039
percent there that's having growth

00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,440
some of it substantial growth in

00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:02,960
mainframe

00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,799
but the mainframe has certainly been

00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,320
impacted by

00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:08,159
recent developments and one of the big

00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,039
impacts has been open source in open

00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:10,799
source

00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:12,640
mainframe developers have known that

00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:15,679
open source was impacting

00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:18,159
i t systems for decades this was

00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:19,919
an interesting quote to me by holder

00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:22,240
mueller

00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:24,080
he said when he realized that open

00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:26,240
source was going to win

00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,760
was somewhere in the early 2000 oracle

00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:30,960
dropped its multi-year

00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:33,039
1000 plus fte effort on an application

00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:35,120
server to use open source apache going

00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:39,440
forward

00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:41,600
next in 2013 ibm's debbie sabbath

00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,799
shared that ibm was basing its next

00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:46,320
generation paths

00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:48,720
bluemix on open source cloud foundry

00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:50,480
holger says when enterprise software

00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,559
giants cannot afford to out

00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,240
innovate open source platforms it was

00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:58,159
clear that open source

00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:59,840
was winning so open source

00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:02,080
is having an impact on the mainframe but

00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:04,640
let's look at the impact open source is

00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:08,640
having on proprietary systems

00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:11,279
this cert survey from tide lift and

00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,960
new stack 400 professional developers

00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:15,440
were asked to compare open source and

00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:18,640
proprietary software

00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:21,120
and you can see in out of this survey

00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,159
that open source was clearly deemed

00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,760
better by

00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:26,880
by these developers maybe they were all

00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:29,039
open source developers but

00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,880
you know the prior statement was very

00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:33,279
clear as well the one place that it's

00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:35,679
not true is on reliable support

00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:37,440
consulting services that's an

00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:39,919
opportunity for someone to

00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,200
make a big difference there in that

00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:43,600
space

00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,320
but not everything has been impacted i

00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:48,720
think uh

00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:52,000
frank scale uh commenting on mueller's

00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:53,679
blog post said open source means a large

00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,480
set of potential users

00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:58,559
but enterprise applications do not have

00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:01,039
as broad a potential user base as

00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:02,480
infrastructure software although erp

00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:04,159
market is huge

00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:06,480
when you break it down by specific

00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:06,960
industries it is small compared to the

00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,240
market

00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:13,279
for say linux

00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:15,600
so on the far left hand side here i drew

00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:18,720
this pyramid

00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:21,200
with infrastructure at the bottom

00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,799
which has been widely impacted by open

00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,960
source initiatives

00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:27,120
and those are continuing to grow in the

00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,000
middle space of utilities common

00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,960
applications

00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,159
ocr cad office applications more and

00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,640
more we're seeing

00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:35,760
more and more things impacted by open

00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,000
source

00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:41,120
erp systems though even though there are

00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:44,159
open source erp systems like apache

00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:48,080
of biz they're not very

00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:51,279
impacted yet because like frank said

00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:53,360
the number of users are smaller

00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:54,720
in the center of this though if you take

00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,720
the orange line

00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,840
as a representation of what the growth

00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:01,519
in open source and its impact it's been

00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:03,360
having right

00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:05,279
and the white line is proprietary

00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:09,279
software it's clear proprietary

00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:13,039
is declining open source is growing

00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:16,799
if you laid out though how this works

00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:19,440
ginny rometty in 2019 ibm ceo said

00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:21,120
chapter 1 which might be infrastructure

00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,120
and utilities

00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:25,039
of the cloud represents about 20 percent

00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:27,360
of the workload opportunity

00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:29,120
it was largely about moving a lot of new

00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,080
and customer-facing applications to the

00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:33,679
cloud

00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:37,039
chapter 2 is about the hard stuff

00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:39,600
so on the far right-hand side

00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:40,720
what really remains to be done is much

00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:44,480
larger

00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:46,399
much much larger than what has been done

00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,919
the pyramids really upside down the

00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:51,039
impact to be had

00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:52,960
is much much larger

00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:55,039
so why hasn't it changed i mean you've

00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:56,480
got the number of users is one thing but

00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:57,919
i think there's more than just the

00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,760
number of users because there have been

00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:01,519
organizations been attempting to move

00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:03,840
open source

00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:05,120
move off of mainframe applications for a

00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:07,840
long time

00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,640
and pondering that on the far left-hand

00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,640
side here i

00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:12,399
i did this analysis you look at

00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:16,000
computing cost

00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:16,320
from the time of the ibm system 360 the

00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,720
first

00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:24,240
main generalized mainframe system 1964.

00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:27,519
in 1964 a gigabyte of storage cost

00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:30,880
about seven million dollars well our

00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:35,440
financial systems were automated

00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:37,679
in this up to perhaps the 1990s was when

00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:40,320
most of these systems and the cost were

00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:41,279
very high through all of that automation

00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:45,679
it was done

00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:48,880
to in such a way as to preserve

00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:51,679
uh and reduce the use of hardware

00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,960
and to optimize the systems to be able

00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:55,679
to get

00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:58,399
your value out of such a high cost

00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:58,399
environment

00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:03,519
but when we look at what's been

00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:04,960
automated since then on the right hand

00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:05,600
side here right things that are

00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,840
automated

00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,720
more recently include things like web

00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:11,520
searches

00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:13,679
and social media and e-commerce and

00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:15,679
those kinds of things

00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:17,520
the white in this chart represents

00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:19,280
functional requirements the functional

00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:22,480
requirements are fairly

00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:24,000
low for those applications as we noted

00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:27,040
in the video

00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:29,119
if we take the functional application

00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,800
requirements functional requirements for

00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:34,159
financial applications

00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:37,359
it's much higher so when you add

00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:38,159
using redundancy as a way to overcome

00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:42,399
the error

00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:45,040
rates of the platform you end up with

00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:46,399
a functional requirement a complexity

00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:49,359
that is too high

00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:52,000
to maintain thus financial applications

00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:55,359
have not been by and large converted

00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:57,599
because redundancy as an approach to

00:34:55,359 --> 00:35:00,720
overcome error rates

00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:00,720
makes them too complex

00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:05,119
okay so how is the mainframe going to be

00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,240
impacted

00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:09,839
by open source how how might it come

00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:13,200
about more fully

00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:16,320
well if the 20 which has been done

00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:19,839
comes from the linux zvm

00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:23,839
side of of the the platform right

00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:26,400
and the yet to do the 80 yet to do

00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:28,560
comes in and affects cics that's still

00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:32,480
the cics db2 cobalt

00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:33,760
pieces that yet to be re affected

00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,320
the thing that's interesting in the

00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:38,000
middle here is this unix system services

00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,040
that's been around a couple of decades

00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:43,040
now on

00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:46,720
z os it's a unix implementation

00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:48,400
um it's a posix compliant not linux but

00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:51,119
unix

00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,839
you can see that that it's starting to

00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:53,920
pull

00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:55,440
applications that are developed in the

00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:59,280
open source world

00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:03,200
onto z os and

00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:05,680
that impact i think is going to grow

00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:07,599
that the data and applications in z os

00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,960
are going to start to get impacted more

00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:12,160
and more

00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:15,200
by this the space in the middle here

00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:18,079
apache spark java python

00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,640
docker jupyter notebooks those are just

00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:21,119
some

00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:23,119
of the things that are moving into the

00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:27,280
zos space

00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:30,880
that came from the open source world

00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:32,480
the linux foundation which was focused

00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:34,640
began this project began something

00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:37,920
called the open mainframe project

00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:41,440
was focused more on

00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:42,880
linux on z really but over time the

00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:46,000
projects that are contributing

00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:48,079
one that i'm working on is geneva ers it

00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,440
really sits more in the z os

00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:52,560
space it's more part of the z os side of

00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:55,359
things

00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:57,040
and that's continuing to grow we'll see

00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:57,839
more and more coming from the open

00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:00,800
source

00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:02,720
projects okay one last comment that i've

00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,640
been asked a few times is how does

00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,720
you know how does someone live off of

00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:09,040
open source well there is an economy to

00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:10,320
open source this is the way i look at it

00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:14,160
because everyone has to eat

00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:17,200
right the financial incentives

00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:19,839
provided by direct proprietary customer

00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:21,839
interaction proprietary software

00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:24,320
interactions with customers

00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:25,760
in many cases it fuels much of the

00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,280
innovation that happens because

00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:30,160
customers will pay

00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:31,680
to solve specific problems and vendors

00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:35,359
are involved in

00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:38,960
in building those those applications

00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:40,480
but after those things have been built

00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:43,200
by vendors

00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:44,480
others become aware of them and they

00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:48,160
tend to get embedded

00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:51,599
into open source platforms over time

00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:54,160
kevin rawlings the ce ceo of uh

00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:55,599
of dell computers once said that pcs

00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:57,440
were like groceries

00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:58,720
the older they got the less valuable

00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,720
they are and it's true for

00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:02,800
software features as well the older they

00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:06,160
get the less valuable there

00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:07,760
are so over time

00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:11,280
more and more of these features that

00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:14,240
were embedded in proprietary systems get

00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:16,079
embedded into open source platforms if

00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:17,200
the vendors do not keep up their

00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:19,359
innovation

00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:21,520
they can be eclipsed by an open source

00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:24,320
platform and become irrelevant

00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:25,680
so the vendors have to continually work

00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:28,240
ahead

00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:30,079
of the open source platforms to advance

00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,800
into new space new territory new

00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:33,920
problems

00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:36,480
to be solved that process of

00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:38,320
vendors continually adding and then

00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,280
getting absorbed into the open source

00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:42,480
platforms

00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:43,200
is what builds this foundation upon

00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:46,240
which

00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:47,920
so much innovation can thrive and it's

00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,920
so broadly based because

00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,440
many many people are attracted to those

00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:54,480
platforms

00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:55,599
that's the way people live within an

00:38:54,480 --> 00:39:01,839
open source

00:38:55,599 --> 00:39:01,839
environment in my opinion

00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,640
