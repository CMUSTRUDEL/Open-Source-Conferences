all ibm z

00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:23,040
enterprises now have linux uh which is

00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,720
incredible to see

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,240
and it's a journey that's taken place

00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,720
over the last 20 years

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,079
and the new normal is hybrid and open

00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,439
and how important is it

00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:36,240
for us to be celebrating that with um

00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:38,400
the zoe project um which fits right into

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,159
that sweet spot of bringing open source

00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,479
bringing linux technology to the

00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,799
mainframe myself to winchester

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,640
i tried to 25 minutes to talk about

00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,240
every technology but the most important

00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,119
take home for me survey is more than

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,040
technology

00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:52,240
so as a community i was lucky enough to

00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,159
be joined by three people from that

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,080
engine room powerhouse behind the zoe

00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,520
cicd continues integration delivery

00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,959
thanks very much for all three of you

00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,040
for being part of the zoe community and

everybody else throughout 2020

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,560
um alex came from vicom always an

00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,080
absolute tree to any conference uh gave

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,319
an outstanding demo

00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,319
of uh what it's like to talk to the

00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,560
mainframe using zoe and

00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:38,640
viva first i want to show you how viva

00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,680
is using

00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,720
joy apis and other system api such as

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:48,840
zebra

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:51,840
hey dj what is the current cpu

00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,840
utilization

00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:58,239
the current cpu utilization scpu is four

00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,239
percent

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,840
10 million for two hours

00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:19,519
the requested message has been sent so

00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:22,640
the viva will contact twilio and

00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,840
getting the text messages and graphs

00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,879
from

00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:29,120
um grafana you can see

00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,159
here it's a midnight actually after

00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,080
midnight

00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:33,920
so you can see this graph with the alpha

00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,720
into these reports

00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,599
we're in the community uh roy saccas who

00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,360
is the

uh squad leader of the soviet border

00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,760
squad gives a fabulous presentation

00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,959
certainly the importance of the

00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,440
conformance program

00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:48,159
which is really underpinning the

00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:50,239
extension the vendor ecosystem for zoe

00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,280
giving a really symbiotic relationship

00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,319
between

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,799
um plugins working well together

00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,799
on top of zoe and zoe working well

00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,760
beneath those plugins defeat the fanduel

00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,400
of rocket

00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,519
talked about um conda packaging and

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,680
showed beautifully

00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,680
with some nice live demos how from a

00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,920
public cloud and also a private

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,280
condo repository he was able to install

00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,360
a fantastic zoe

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,079
conformant extension rocket blue zone

00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:19,120
web on top of his early desktop

00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:21,120
uh we'd absolutely treat again we had

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,880
jelly and her colleague the broadcom

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,360
richelieu and crawl

00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,639
really talking about the modern cobalt

00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,160
movement this is something they're both

00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,479
very key from they're both

00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,440
um very experienced system programmers

00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,199
cable engineers and

00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,960
we here we have the zoe explorer a huge

00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,720
success story of 2020

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,360
and they really showcase how it's

00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,840
becoming pivotal and relevant to sort of

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,360
bringing up the next generation of

00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,040
engineers and developers

00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,919
working with cable on the mainframe they

00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,919
also showed us a

00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:52,240
very mobile incubator project that they

00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:53,520
both have worked on

00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,240
that was launched as part of the zoe

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,919
hackathon allowing mobile devices to

00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,680
connect

00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,039
uh we had sean grady and uh hasidique

00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,240
jared from rocket software

00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,919
uh showing us how you can build

00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,320
commercial extensions and they showcase

00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,160
this

00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,680
again with their rocket blue zone web

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,080
which is a 3270

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,560
terminal emulator it also does 5250 as

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:15,759
well um

00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:18,479

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,680
and uh let's see what he was up to with

00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,440
so why he excited everybody at the

00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,160
conference this year

00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,320
zowie it is an open source tool set

00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,440
created to provide a bridge between our

00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,720
modern environment

00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:39,840
and the ibm z mainframe platform

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,840
cola on an ipad easy right

00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,360
here is kabul being executed on the

colleagues have done in the in the zoe

00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,600
squads and communities they worked with

00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:04,639
it sort of transformed this world out

00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,800
to this world the zuri explorer and they

00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,840
showed how amazingly productive they are

00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,560
now as

00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,919
cobol developers as modern mainframes

00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,360
which led

00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:15,759
beautifully into the fact that they were

00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,600
part of the winning hackathon team for

00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,280
the open mainframe project hackathon

00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,199
with an incredible project called zoe

00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,319
out which is where they gamified the zoe

00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,000
experience

00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,639
to round out this summary let's hear

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,639
more about zoey

00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,720
as technology progressed the new

00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,039
developers

00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,400
with new knowledge of modern

00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,560
technologies

00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,000
join the mainframe community you can't

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,080
help the thing

00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,360
how can this next generation of

00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,720
developers

00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:49,250
help in improving mainframe

00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:52,880
making it to a more stronger

00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:55,199
[Music]

00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,319
it is an interactive learning experience

00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,120
that allows you

00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:01,199
to learn more about mainframe and the

00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,240
different components of zoo

00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:06,319
such as the cli the web desktop

00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,560
the vs code extension and also the

00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,720
mobile application

00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,240
it is in the form of a game wherein

00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,560
self-paced interactive

00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,160
tutorial course and hands-on experiences

00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,759
are available

00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,759
it is a step-by-step guide with

00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:23,520
checkpoints that includes links

00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:26,639
to tutorial videos and other resources

00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:29,199
it is a fun way to gain more knowledge

00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,599
about means

00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,520
the goal for this interactive learning

00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:36,639
experience

00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:39,360
is to ask the question what more can you

00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:41,120
do with mainframe

00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,639
so all the presentations i talked about

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,080
in the open mainframe summit are

00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,960
available on youtube

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:51,199
