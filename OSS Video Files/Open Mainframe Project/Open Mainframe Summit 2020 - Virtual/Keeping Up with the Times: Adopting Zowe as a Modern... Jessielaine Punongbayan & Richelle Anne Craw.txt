	Keeping Up with the Times: Adopting Zowe as a Modern Mainframe Developer - Jessielaine Punongbayan & Richelle Anne Craw, Broadcom 

How extending Zowe CLI made Mainframe Engineers, Jessielaine Punongbayan and Richelle Anne Craw, more productive. From their beginnings as Application Developers and subsequent experience as Operations Engineers, their move to a DevOps role as part of the Zowe project is a natural progression in their career journey. Knowing what they know now, how could they have used Zowe to improve their lives in their previous roles? Join this session as they show the time-saving benefits of adopting Zowe, specifically via the creation of a Zowe CLI Systems Utilities Plugin. Using what they learned from developing legacy Mainframe applications and performing system administration tasks, extending Zowe CLI was the obvious answer as a way to improve the productivity of teams doing repetitive tasks on the Mainframe even without deep Mainframe knowledge.
