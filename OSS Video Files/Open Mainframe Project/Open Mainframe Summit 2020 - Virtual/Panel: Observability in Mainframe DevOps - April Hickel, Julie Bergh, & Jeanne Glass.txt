Title: Panel: Observability in Mainframe DevOps - April Hickel, Julie Bergh, & Jeanne Glass
Publication date: 2020-09-08
Playlist: Open Mainframe Summit 2020 - Virtual
Description: 
	Panel: Observability in Mainframe DevOps - April Hickel, BMC; Julie Bergh; Rocket Software; Jeanne Glass; VirtualZ Computing 

"DevOps brings together development, operations, and automation, shortening the development lifecycle and improving product quality. Despite mainframe development teams being the first to employ DevOps practices, today when most people think of DevOps, they typically think of distributed platforms.

IBM recently reporting record high growth in mainframe MIPs, the new IBM z15 runs one trillion secure web transactions per day, and increasingly, businesses are integrating the mainframe back into their DevOps lifecycle. But DevOps extends beyond just technology and monitoring extends beyond just gathering log data. The concept of “Observability” and its strong human element, including organizational culture, is becoming prominent in the DevOps lifecycle. 

Observability brings together the people, processes and technologies in the software development lifecycle.

Join Jeanne Glass, Founder and CEO of VirtualZ, as she hosts a discussion with April Hickel, AVP of Product Management at BMC, and Julie Bergh, Worldwide Lead Security Executive with Rocket Software on the importance of Observability in Mainframe DevOps."

so hello everyone and welcome to our

00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,240
panel discussion on observability and

00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,800
mainframe devops

00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,599
my name is jeannie glass and i'm founder

00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,000
and ceo

00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,880
of virtual z computing and we were

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,759
really honored

00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:18,160
uh to have the open mainframe project

00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:20,320
invite us to facilitate today's panel

00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,640
representing women in the mainframe and

00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,400
with me today are two recognized experts

00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,039
in mainframe computing

00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,920
april hickle avp of product management

00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,679
at bmc

00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:33,280
hi april and julie burke uh worldwide

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,120
lead security executive with

00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,280
rocket software so thank you both for

00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,520
joining us today

00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,520
so devops has definitely proven to

00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,239
shorten the development lifecycle

00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,440
and help ensure product quality bringing

00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,239
together development

00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,079
operations automation and even

00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,879
artificial intelligence

00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,719
and although mainframe practices

00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:57,280
originated in mainframe development

00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,559
today when most people think of devops

00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,320
they're typically thinking of

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:03,039
distributed platforms

00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,000
but today we see ibm reporting record

00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,720
high growth

00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,520
in mainframe mips uh new mainframe

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:12,799
hardware is able to run up to a trillion

00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,280
uh transactions per day and businesses

00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,600
are

00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,560
increasingly re-integrating the

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,759
mainframe

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,280
into their devops practices but with the

00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,360
evolution of devops

00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,560
we're hearing about something new uh

00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,040
observability

00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,119
uh reading a lot about observability

00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:32,560
hearing a lot about observability

00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:34,880
which adds a human element uh to

00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,200
uh the software development life cycle

00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:40,880
and organizational culture

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:43,920
as well and uh to define

00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:47,360
observability it's often compared to

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,520
monitoring with monitoring uh telling us

00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,840
whether the system works or not

00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,560
um and observability may be telling us

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,200
why

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,719
it's not working and we chose

00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,439
observability

00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:02,000
for the women in i.t track because it

00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:05,439
makes sense that the next evolution

00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,439
in the devops life cycle

00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,759
would apply to diversity because it

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,900
takes diverse teams to problem solve and

00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:13,680
it's proven that more diverse teams

00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:16,480
[Music]

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,000
do better at problem solving and we'll

00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,879
talk a little bit more about that at the

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,160
end of the session

00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:25,040
as well but with that april i've heard

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,959
observability called everything from a

00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:30,000
trendy tech buzzword

00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,680
uh to monitoring on steroids um

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,360
and bmc has written quite a bit on

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,360
observability as well

00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,920
in your view what's the difference

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:41,440
between monitoring and observability

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:44,800
and its importance to the mainframe

00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,560
uh thanks genie so i guess um i'm gonna

00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,480
sort of take the long way around to

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,879
answering this question

00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,840
um i think you have to start with the

00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,640
context

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,080
of monitoring and subsequently

00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,720
observability

00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,040
i think everybody sitting here has seen

00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,840
how the recent circumstances so

00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,360
covet have accelerated digital

00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,959
transformation it's sort of

00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:11,760
digital or done um right now

00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,159
and um you know you may be thinking

00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,640
about

00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:16,480
how you yourself are interacting with

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,360
vendors whether it's your

00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,920
uh restaurant and you're ordering food

00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,400
or

00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,360
it is for me i have a college daughter

00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,200
and so

00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,440
you know every call i get is about

00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:31,120
transferring money to her

00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:32,879
so you in these this digital economy

00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,799
you know where we have so much digital

00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:38,480
transformation happening

00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:40,239
in customers in clients in organizations

00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,440
who have a mainframe

00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:45,200
you really have to have a level of

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,959
system resiliency

00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:52,640
a level of availability a level of

00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:55,920
customer experience that's very high

00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:59,599
so this brings me to talk about

00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:02,959
uh monitoring versus observability

00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:06,560
so monitoring is really the

00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:10,159
act of looking at the

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:12,239
information provided by you know maybe a

00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:14,239
monitoring solution

00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,599
information provided in the logs you may

00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:19,359
be doing event

00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:22,639
notification from that and observability

00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:25,840
is really a sort of a cooperative or

00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:29,280
associated discipline observability

00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,240
is really about making sure all of these

00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,680
systems

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,080
all of these applications are making the

00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,960
right

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,840
information available so if you think

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,560
about

00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,960
you know observability and monitoring

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:46,400
are a little bit of a ying and a yang

00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,280
and at bmc you know we believe this

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,800
applies

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:54,000
to the mainframe in a number of

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,320
important ways so the first thing that's

00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,639
important in thinking about

00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:59,680
observability

00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:02,880
is the evolution of mainframe

00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:05,919
systems and applications and how early

00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:10,400
in the development life cycle you

00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:12,720
need to expose the right information so

00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,520
you know if you're devops enabling that

00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,240
if you're modernizing your applications

00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,280
you need to be thinking about how you

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,160
make them more

00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,639
observable the second place we think

00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,639
about

00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:29,680
it is in the way people interact and

00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:33,520
solve problems so observability

00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:37,199
really brings a culture as does devops

00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:40,160
of collaboration uh you know of coming

00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:43,919
together and using the information

00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:46,160
um to solve a problem so i think

00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,520
um back to you i hope i answered the

00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,160
question genie

00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,120
back to you you did thank you so much

00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,120
april

00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,240
um artificial intelligence and

00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,400
observability are

00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,000
often tied together as well with the

00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,919
concept of applying

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,280
machine learning to pattern recognition

00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,919
and monitoring and

00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,960
in some of my research for this panel i

00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,360
also read an article that said

00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:09,840
observability

00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,919
when combined with continuous automation

00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,600
and artificial intelligence

00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:15,440
holds the promise to deliver the

00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,800
actionable answers

00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,639
needed to ensure cloud native

00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,639
applications work perfectly

00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,000
and to your point april that cross

00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,560
collaborative teams

00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,960
can deliver the best user experiences

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,280
and business outcomes that are possible

00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,800
uh julie um welcome to the panel uh

00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,080
you're a real world mainframe

00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,160
practitioner as well

00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,160
having worked in a variety of very large

00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,199
organizations you've had a lot of rules

00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,000
ranging from

00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,280
programming to it audit and you're

00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,080
certainly a recognized

00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,039
expert in mainframe security uh what's

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,160
your view

00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:50,800
of observability particularly

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:53,360
when combined with ai and then given

00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,639
your expertise in mainframe security

00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,199
how do you see security and

00:06:54,639 --> 00:07:00,319
observability connected in the

00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:03,120
mainframe devops life cycle so

00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,960
thanks um jeannie it's interesting that

00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,960
april kind of talked out about

00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,880
um the monitoring and bringing things

00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,880
together and when you really think about

00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,039
from like my background

00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,000
in security when i was asked to talk a

00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,080
little bit about this

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,520
and go into this is i really kind of

00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,880
want to spend a few minutes talking

00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:23,039
about monitoring because we

00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,520
a lot of times from being in uh being an

00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,880
audit

00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,639
and being a director in audit and

00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,680
looking at these things it really was

00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,360
kind of about

00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,440
monitoring all these things so you

00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,080
really kind of got into that mindset

00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,919
mindset of monitoring but you know when

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,160
you when you think about it again from

00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,639
an

00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,599
application services area that

00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,120
infrastructure

00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,960
and that's kind of historically kind of

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,000
where i've looked at it is you know you

00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,919
really think about people

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,840
and kind of like april talked about it

00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:50,240
seamlessly effortlessly want things to

00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,280
work really fast in the environment

00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,919
um but you know these are all

00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:56,160
interconnected parts and when you look

00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:57,919
at this even from like the devops

00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,759
and you know now it's kind of like

00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:01,520
devsecops that are out there

00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,039
it really requires all these things

00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,520
working together

00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:07,440
and you know kind of like april talked

00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,440
about there's volumes of information out

00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,759
there how do you siphon through all this

00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,680
how do you contain all that information

00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,960
how do you determine what's important

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,720
that's out there

00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,560
how do you troubleshoot that information

00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,840
that is out there and look at that

00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,759
overall process

00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,280
so when you think about it and kind of

00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,400
going back to even what april and

00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,080
building on that

00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,680
is when you think about monitoring we're

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,720
looking for those potential problems

00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,639
that are out there

00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,000
you know which includes you know maybe

00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,919
alerting on something that's

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,479
happened you know something that's maybe

00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:38,080
going on in your environment

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,360
um you know we're looking at those

00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,519
dashboards you know how do we know

00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,800
things are working in our environment

00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,320
and working through that problem

00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,279
resolution that's kind of what's april

00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,680
alluded to which

00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:49,680
the devops and observability is bringing

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,440
a lot of this information together

00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,720
to make sure it's all working together

00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,040
and happening

00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,839
and making sure we're doing it looking

00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,200
for improvement

00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,600
whether it's maybe performance and

00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,040
capacity planning etc

00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,440
so you know when you really think about

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,040
how do we correlate that data

00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,959
into some kind of intelligence that's

00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,320
kind of where that ai kind of comes into

00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,240
play to some of it

00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,440
there's a couple of things when you

00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,640
think about this

00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,200
is um you know observability as they

00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,560
talk about

00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,920
instrumenting those systems and

00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,120
applications to collect all that

00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,560
information

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,240
and when you think about it and kind of

00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,959
talking through some of these things

00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,279
that

00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:27,360
i'd gone through and even april touched

00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:29,760
on is but when you think of monitoring

00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,720
it's telling you how the system works is

00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,360
it's working

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,720
and from an observability point of view

00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,959
one should be asking

00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,160
why is it not working so you know we're

00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,680
looking at how it's working

00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,519
observability is looking is like maybe

00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,959
why it isn't working

00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,560
and then when you think about for

00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,440
monitoring especially in the field of

00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,959
security

00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,480
it's really looking at those collection

00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:50,560
of logs it's out there

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,680
and doing those metrics and normalizing

00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,440
that data

00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,519
where observability is kind of

00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,560
disseminate disseminating that

00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,240
information

00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,800
and making it available for you

00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,399
monitoring we tend to look for failures

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,480
you know what's going wrong that's out

00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:07,680
there in your environment and doing that

00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:09,760
automated analysis of that

00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,120
observability is helping trying to

00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,200
understand that system

00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,560
behavior so you know again you see a lot

00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,680
of the articles that are out there about

00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,839
you know

00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,440
um monitoring is not observability and

00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:20,240
observability is not monitoring but they

00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,800
do really work

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,000
very close and hand in hand and again

00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,480
when you think about from

00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
a security standpoint it's often thought

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,480
of as looking at what people are doing

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,800
via

00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,399
the different tools but you know when

00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,880
you look at observability it's more

00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,640
about

00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,320
making that application observable and

00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,279
that's kind of what april was talking

00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,200
about it

00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:40,800
so when you think about that kind of i

00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,000
kind of give the analogy as i went

00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,920
through some of these things i was

00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,360
reading the articles like you were

00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,600
is it's when you think about

00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,040
observability then one of the examples

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,800
that i read was a really good example

00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,399
about driving a car and you're driving

00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,800
down the highway in the car

00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,640
and you've got cruise control set on but

00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,600
yet driving down and as you're driving

00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,399
down the

00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,760
highway the cars maintaining that speed

00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,839
of whatever you set for the

00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,160
cruise control but as you decide to

00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:08,000
start going up a hill

00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,839
because of what's been built into the

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
car it determines well i need to

00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,120
accelerate to keep maintain that speed

00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,200
that's up there

00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,560
vice versa as i come down the other side

00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,160
of the hill i don't

00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,079
i'm not going to speed up is that

00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,839
observability the metrics that have kind

00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,880
of built into it making that information

00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,640
available

00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,240
has made it you know that car is going

00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,440
to start slowing down because now i'm

00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,680
coming down the hill

00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,440
and i need to make sure that i'm staying

00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,959
at appropriate speed

00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,720
so i talked a little bit about this

00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:37,040
earlier but when i think of the trends

00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,959
with devops and observability

00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:41,519
and it's really beyond developers and

00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:43,600
operators it really is becoming

00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,839
ops that are out there and it really is

00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,440
combining all that to understand that

00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,360
and kind of playing into the

00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,120
observability it's not just about

00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,480
infrastructure anymore

00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,800
so that's kind of where i think about it

00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,279
from an ai an observability standpoint

00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,200
is

00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,560
helping under you know helping you

00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,200
answer questions like

00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,920
why is x broken what performance has

00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,160
changed

00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,680
what do i need to be thinking about that

00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,560
really is kind of telling you from the

00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,839
security point

00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:12,399
viewpoint of what's observability

00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:15,120
means kind of me and kind of caps on

00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:17,440
what's going on from a devops standpoint

00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,639
and again just continuing looking from

00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,720
an um

00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:22,079
artificial intelligence and one of the

00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,160
things when you think about it going

00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:26,880
back to the observability

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,160
is you've got to get this information

00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,600
from different areas because there's

00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,480
just not one thing out there that's

00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,240
going to tell you

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,519
everything that's going on wrong or

00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,279
right in the mainframe

00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,360
there's different areas and that's why

00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:39,600
you need to have that with the

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:43,040
ai out there's a key component to help

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,040
you understand your environment

00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:50,320
great thank you genie thank you julie

00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,360
um so before we move on from you know

00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,600
maybe helping

00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,800
our audience uh understand the

00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,279
difference between

00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,040
monitoring and observability and and

00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:00,480
tying this back to the open mainframe

00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,440
project a bit do either of you have any

00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,880
other comments you'd

00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:07,440
like to add relative to the definition

00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:10,079
of observability as it relates to

00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,079
monitoring

00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,000
okay um so let's move on um so

00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,639
observability

00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,279
you know really is known as adding that

00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:23,120
human

00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:25,760
element requiring collaboration across

00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,600
every organization and stakeholder in

00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:30,560
the devops life cycle

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,560
including the mainframe and specific to

00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,600
the open mainframe project one of their

00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,839
goals

00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,440
is to increase collaboration across the

00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:40,240
mainframe community

00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:42,079
and develop shared tools and resources

00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,399
for the ecosystem

00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,920
april and julie how do you think about

00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,480
observability

00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,199
relative to open mainframe project and

00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,000
how

00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:55,120
it should be or could be relevant to the

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,120
open source community

00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:06,800
april do you maybe want to go first

00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:09,920
thanks jeannie um i i said um

00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:12,639
earlier that observability is really

00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:14,160
about making information available and

00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:17,839
then developing

00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,639
a culture of collaboration and i would

00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,040
say

00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:23,440
this is equally relevant on the

00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,240
mainframe the mainframe is part of a

00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,720
complex

00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,240
system of interconnected environments

00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:32,399
the mainframe

00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:36,000
isn't now and nor has it ever been an

00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:39,199
island so you know our recent survey

00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:42,160
shows that still in a lot of companies

00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:43,199
50 of their data might reside on the

00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,079
mainframe

00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,560
so the applications and the services

00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,600
being

00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:51,120
built around the mainframe accessing

00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,680
data on the mainframe

00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,839
taking advantage of the transactional

00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:59,639
power of the mainframe

00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:02,959
are not unique in needing the observ

00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:04,399
observability so i think you know a

00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:08,079
practical takeaway

00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:11,600
for the audience is that observability

00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:13,760
um is both something that starts early

00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,320
in the application development life

00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,279
cycle

00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,440
so if you think about building new

00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:20,079
applications

00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,440
building a devops environment for your

00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:24,880
mainframe

00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:28,079
really that has its roots in integration

00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:31,199
it has its roots in automation

00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:32,639
and it has its roots in making sure that

00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:36,000
the things that you

00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:38,160
build are observable because it's no

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,600
good for you to get agile

00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:44,079
to get your mainframe automation

00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,079
and continuous integration continuous

00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,880
delivery capabilities delivered to the

00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,959
market

00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,560
and then have no idea if the things

00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,639
you're delivering are making

00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,000
performance or experience better or

00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:57,040
worse so that's

00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:00,079
why we think and we see

00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:03,920
our customers who are adopting the bmc

00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:08,320
compyware devops tools as really

00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:10,160
valuing observability and integration

00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,839
so that's one thing and then i would say

00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:15,600
the other thing relative

00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:19,199
to the mainframe is that we see

00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,519
um an open borders approach so at bmc

00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:23,360
we're really

00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:26,839
prioritizing our delivery

00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:30,399
of sdks

00:16:26,839 --> 00:16:34,160
apis cli

00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:37,680
in a way that allows an exchange

00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:41,279
of information between tools between

00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:43,279
processes um it allows access to data so

00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:45,680
i think for the mainframe

00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:46,880
the two takeaways that i really leave

00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:50,320
our audience with

00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:53,240
are you need to think about delivering

00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,560
observable applications as you're

00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,880
modernizing

00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,440
your application development and

00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:01,759
delivery for main the mainframe

00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:05,199
and you really need to think about an

00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:08,959
open borders approach it's not a silo

00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:10,319
or a proprietary environment embrace the

00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:13,439
capabilities that

00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:14,000
open source brings you make sure that

00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,839
you're

00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,079
open and integratable and that you're

00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:21,199
prioritizing

00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:23,760
and delivering the right types of apis

00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:25,839
um and that you're um really supportive

00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:28,079
of the broader ecosystem

00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:29,200
those are things that we're doing and we

00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:32,400
see them really

00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:36,160
helping mainframe customers reach the

00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,160
outcomes that they want to reach

00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,760
that's a really great perspective april

00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,799
thank you so much i appreciate you

00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,600
sharing the

00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:46,080
uh bmc compyware uh devops story in that

00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:49,520
way related to the mainframe project

00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:52,320
um julie you know what's your view on um

00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:55,760
how observability should or could be uh

00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:57,919
relevant to the open mainframe community

00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,840
oh i kind of like with april i really

00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,960
agree a lot when you think about that

00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,240
and she talked about with the

00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,320
application

00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,280
um programming interfaces the apis that

00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,240
are out there

00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:09,840
more and more um we think of a lot of

00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,520
the mainframe software that's out there

00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,679
like she said with bmc

00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,520
is it taking advantage of those to take

00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:17,760
advantage of the open source

00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,640
um software that's maybe open and

00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,760
available

00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,679
and one of the things that when you

00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,200
think about some of this and again going

00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:25,200
back to that observability

00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,799
and why it's very important is you know

00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,240
the one thing that's nice about open

00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:29,760
source tools is

00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,520
they're free right they're out there

00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,520
they're making them available you can

00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,919
customize them to meet your needs

00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,360
but you also need to and again i put my

00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:39,360
security hat on going

00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,880
i need an observability i even need that

00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,360
monitoring that's out there

00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,480
because i need to make sure that these

00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,960
changes are

00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,559
being tracked that something's not being

00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,640
introduced into the system that should

00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:53,840
not be introduced into the system

00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,520
and again i i think by more from again

00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,120
my putting on my security hat that's

00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,799
where observability is really

00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,559
kind of comes into play like april had

00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,679
talked about if i've got these people

00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:03,440
coming together

00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,039
to look at these things to help solve

00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,320
this problem because i've got this

00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:09,039
information out there

00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:11,600
then it makes sure that yes if i'm using

00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:13,120
open source i think it's very viable

00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,200
but i'm also making sure that i'm not

00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,880
doing anything that may impact

00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,559
the company that i'm working for that's

00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,120
out there and again it helps

00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:22,480
me helps me with that being data driven

00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,400
in my environment

00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,000
and again it helps you with the bugging

00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,360
and everything else because

00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,520
open source is all about i'm going to

00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,960
give you some code you can customize it

00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,640
but now the sudden

00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,080
it's kind of your responsibility but if

00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,799
i had that observability it makes it

00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,080
easier for me

00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:38,320
to bug that because i made that

00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:40,559
information available to everybody on my

00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,559
team

00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:45,320
yeah i guess i'd add one more thing as

00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:48,559
i'm as we're talking about this

00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:51,039
observability and monitoring one of the

00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:52,240
things that i think everybody also needs

00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:54,960
to recognize

00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:58,559
is in addition to this collaboration and

00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:02,240
the instrumentation of observability

00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:02,720
um the amount of data that's going to be

00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,640
made

00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,640
available as you're going through the

00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,480
process of developing better

00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:11,120
observability or you're looking at

00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:13,760
security like in julie's world or

00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,799
whatever it might be is immense right

00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,679
and it's just

00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:18,480
far surpassing uh you know an amazon

00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,440
glass

00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,919
type approach to managing health we're

00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,960
really

00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:28,080
moving into the need for

00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:30,480
prediction for being able to take a vast

00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:33,679
number of kpis or

00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:36,480
information about security and

00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:37,440
use techniques machine learning

00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,159
techniques

00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,880
you know artificial intelligence in

00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:44,559
order

00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:45,520
to um solve an outcome right to make a

00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:48,559
prediction

00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:51,679
to isolate a root cause to

00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:53,159
detect a threat whatever it might be so

00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:57,120
i would say you know

00:20:53,159 --> 00:21:00,080
observability culture and the techniques

00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:02,080
of applying machine learning learning

00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:05,600
are all sort of linked and

00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:08,559
i think in the mainframe especially

00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:11,600
we can't cling to how it's been done in

00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:13,840
the past i have a monitor i have a

00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:16,080
you know i'm securing the perimeter of

00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,280
the mainframe or security through

00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,600
obscurity

00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:21,440
those are techniques which served the

00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,720
mainframe in the mainframe community

00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:26,320
well in the past

00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:29,039
but the time has come to really embrace

00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,559
some of the newer approaches like julie

00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:34,799
was talking about

00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:36,159
prediction um ai devops and delivering

00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:38,159
applications so

00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:39,200
you know i'd encourage people as they're

00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,760
on their journey

00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,400
and looking at their own environment to

00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,440
really

00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:48,720
think about the implication

00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:51,679
that observability has on the types

00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:54,320
of approaches you take to manage in your

00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:57,039
mainframe

00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:58,880
great thank you so much um and thank you

00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:01,520
both um

00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,880
before we close and go to questions um

00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,799
do you have anything else that you'd

00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,039
like to add relative to observability

00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:08,720
julia or april

00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:10,559
no i think if we've kind of summarized

00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,600
it very well it's been great talking to

00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:14,880
april and you on this

00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:18,240
discussion thank you so uh you're both

00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:20,080
obviously uh industry experts in ibm c

00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,120
with years of experience and expertise

00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,600
and we appreciate you

00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,720
helping educate us on observability

00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,799
today

00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:29,120
and as i said earlier we chose the

00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:30,880
concept of observability for our panel

00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:33,200
representing women in the mainframe

00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:35,679
because of the human element

00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,000
and requiring collaboration across

00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:41,120
diverse teams and knowing that

00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,960
diversity powers collaboration um

00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:46,080
and we all know there's lots of research

00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,919
that shows uh diverse teams

00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:49,440
are better at problem solving and so it

00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:51,200
does seem natural

00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,520
that the human element would be the next

00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,440
evolution in devops

00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:58,400
i thought it was also interesting as i

00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:00,880
was researching for this panel i learned

00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:03,039
that there's also research specific to

00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,080
patent portfolios you know creating new

00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:06,720
products that solve

00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:08,000
customer problems and the research shows

00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,080
that even patents

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,039
that are highly cited by others as an

00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,400
indicator

00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:14,400
that they're highly relevant and

00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:17,120
successful patents uh

00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,880
are likely created by diverse teams as

00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,640
well so we did feel it was appropriate

00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,640
to tie the power of diversity

00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,400
to the concept of observability for

00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,080
today's discussion we hope you found it

00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,159
interesting and valuable

00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,760
as well so april and julie again thank

00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:31,760
you for sharing your expertise

00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,840
and educating us on observability in the

00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,640
mainframe and for representing women in

00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,120
i.t

00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,640
uh they'll a mainframe project so with

00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,520
that we'd like to open it up for

00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:43,279
