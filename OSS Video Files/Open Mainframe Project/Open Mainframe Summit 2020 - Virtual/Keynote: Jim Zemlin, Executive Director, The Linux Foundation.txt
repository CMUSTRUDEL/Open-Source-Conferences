good morning my name is jim zellman i'm

00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,120
the executive director of the linux

00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,440
foundation

00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,400
and i'm very happy to be with all of you

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:13,200
today

00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,200
at the inaugural open mainframe summit

00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,279
these are tough times and albeit this is

00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,840
a virtual event

00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:21,600
i'm excited to be a part of it you know

00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,800
the open mainframe project

00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:28,160
has been excited since the beginning

00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:30,320
we've seen open source breathe life into

00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,719
the mainframe in a way that we've seen

00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,480
that happen in other industries

00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,840
at the linux foundation we worked with

00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:39,280
the automotive sector

00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,600
as an example to create a new

00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,719
software driven automotive cockpit

00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,360
experience

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,640
we worked with the film industry and

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,120
filmmakers

00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,280
to create exciting open source projects

00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,680
around visual effects

00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,879
and the open mainframe project in

00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,920
addition

00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,800
is an exciting new way to bring a new

00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,359
ecosystem

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,239
of developers into the incredibly

00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:06,400
important

00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:09,520
mainframe space mainframe computing

00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:12,560
is special in so many ways

00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:15,920
it runs so many of the world's most

00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:18,240
important computing systems but for me

00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,600
mainframes hold a special personal

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,840
connection

00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,640
you see i grew up with mainframe

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,119
computers

00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,640
as a part of my childhood and early

00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:29,280
adult life

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,400
my father was a programmer and worked on

00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,600
mainframes

00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:36,240
and my grandfather was also an engineer

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,320
and worked on mainframes as well my

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:42,880
father worked at control data for the

00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:46,000
bulk of his career and was a programmer

00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:49,040
on those very mainframe computers

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,920
my grandfather george hansen also worked

00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,560
on some of the

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,520
earliest computers in the us military

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,799
during world war

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:59,600
ii but also worked at control data

00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:03,119
before moving on to become a founder of

00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:05,680
cray research with seymour cray

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,320
i remember fondly going into my father's

00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,959
work

00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:11,200
or visiting my grandfather and seeing

00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,760
the amazing computers

00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,760
and watching the wonderful work that my

00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:19,520
father and grandfather were doing

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,400
in this area in fact being a part of

00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,400
that early

00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,480
part of computing is one of the things

00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,040
that really motivated me to work

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,879
at the linux foundation you know i used

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,000
to talk to my father and grandfather

00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:32,000
about

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,200
linux and all of the interesting work

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,879
going on there

00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,720
and their responses would always be the

00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:39,840
same you know jim

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:42,239
everything you think is cool in linux or

00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,840
bleeding edge is really stuff that we

00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,560
did on the mainframe

00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,920
two three decades ago and we always used

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,319
to laugh about

00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,080
uh how we've kind of come back to the

00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:53,200
future in terms of the forms of

00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,599
computing

00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,640
and the pioneering work that happened on

00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:00,000
the mainframe

00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,879
in the very early days so i'm really

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,920
happy to be a part of this event

00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,879
you know during this time the linux

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,760
foundation

00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,959
has been working quietly with our open

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,440
source communities

00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,200
including the open mainframe project to

00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,560
help meet the challenge

00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,360
of today's current pandemic part of this

00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,319
involved

00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,720
some quiet leadership to make sure that

00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:27,360
our organization could better serve

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,840
the communities that we work with such

00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:33,280
as the open mainframe project

00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:36,400
we've restructured our business to help

00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:39,200
facilitate virtual events like this one

00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,159
we expanded our mentoring programs in

00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,000
order to provide

00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:44,239
jobs opportunities for people who've

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,480
been displaced

00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,599
we've expanded our training scholarships

00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,440
to help people learn

00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,120
new skills and give them new

00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:54,879
opportunities during this

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,159
uncertain time most importantly we've

00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:58,400
also

00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,760
launched some new initiatives that have

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,879
direct impact

00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,720
on the current pandemic

00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,560
we launched over the summer our linux

00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,760
foundation public health initial

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:12,319
initiative this is directly impacting

00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,239
contact racing around the world with

00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:16,320
applications such as covid shield and

00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:20,160
others that are being used in canada

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:23,919
and ireland to help people identify

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:26,160
uh and receive exposure notifications

00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:28,240
we've started a racially charged

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,199
language removal effort across

00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,680
all of our projects we've been providing

00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,160
clear

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,280
statements on the free and open nature

00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,280
of open source

00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,720
in the midst of deepening trade conflict

00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,199
around the world

00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,120
but i want to definitely give a hats off

00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,280
to this community

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,320
for working with ibm and the linux

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,400
foundation

00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,560
to help provide cobalt training for

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,800
developers in the us

00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,000
you know many of the us's unemployment

00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,400
systems

00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,479
have were written in cobalt and haven't

00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,639
been updated for a very long time and

00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:03,840
struggled to meet with the demand

00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,680
and need to provide relief to millions

00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,720
of people

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:11,199
and this community truly stepped up

00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,880
to help train folks to alter those

00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,680
systems so they could both handle the

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,160
load

00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,199
and change to the new requirements that

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,080
are being

00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:22,960
issued during this pandemic it's been

00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,479
very gratifying to see this work

00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,400
and i'm very happy to see that this

00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:29,759
community has stepped up to meet

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:31,919
all of those challenges you know

00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,280
to build a community like the open

00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:36,960
mainframe

00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,320
community you need to do so many things

00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,479
and one of the things that we've been

00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:43,199
focused on at the linux foundation

00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,600
is supporting all of the different ways

00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,639
which

00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:50,000
a community grows over time

00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:52,240
at the foundation we host over 360

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,280
industry defining projects like the open

00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:57,680
mainframe projects

00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:59,840
250 000 developers from over 18

00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,120
000 companies participate in these

00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,319
projects

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,520
collectively we see an average of 2

00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:09,199
million lines of code

00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:12,400
added 1.5 million lines of code deleted

00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:14,960
and 3.6 million lines of code modified

00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,400
daily across all linux foundation

00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,759
projects

00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:23,039
we kick off 215 million builds a year

00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,759
process 241 000 jira tickets and github

00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,800
issues

00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:30,880
we manage 110 000 email groups

00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:34,319
hosts 27 000 virtual meetings

00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,600
we have 180 000 people in our slack and

00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,639
chat channels

00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,919
and we hold over 150 events annually

00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:43,440
with over 40

00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:46,800
000 attendees we manage

00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:50,479
29 000 contribution agreements and over

00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:53,599
700 700 700 trademark

00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:54,319
registrations we've enrolled a million

00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:57,120
and a half

00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,919
people in our free training courses and

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,039
sign up a

00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:03,120
thousand people a day to pursue new

00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:05,280
training and certification through our

00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,599
online learning

00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,880
we also have issued over a billion tls

00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,280
certificates through our

00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,240
let's encrypt project and are the

00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:16,240
world's largest

00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:18,800
certificate authority as a result from

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,759
all of this work we've built sustainable

00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,280
ecosystems

00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:26,400
like the open mainframe project and

00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,199
many others ranging from kubernetes to

00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,720
linux

00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:33,280
to node.js and many many more

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,639
and all of this work is facilitated by

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,800
only a couple hundred of

00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,840
the best employees in the business who

00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,120
work here

00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:44,240
at the linux foundation

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:46,479
but perhaps the open mainframe project

00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,000
being one of the earliest communities

00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:50,080
out there

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,520
starting with share which was one of the

00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,479
first it

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,120
user groups out there i'm proud to say i

00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,479
believe i

00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:00,879
went to a share up as a child

00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:02,960
accompanying my dad who probably didn't

00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,879
have child care for us at the time

00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:08,240
and lucky for me because that was one of

00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:10,800
my first introductions to computing

00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,000
and subsequently through our home

00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,840
personal computer

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,360
became enraptured with what computing

00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,280
can bring

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,440
and the open mainframe project is now

00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,599
carrying on that tradition

00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,720
and no matter where you are in the world

00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:25,280
as a developer

00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,120
whether it's a seasoned professional a

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,960
student or hobbyist

00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,560
now through our open community in the

00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,719
open mainframe project

00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,680
people can connect to their passion for

00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:37,200
mainframe

00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:39,919
technology or pursue new opportunities

00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,640
in mainframe computing the computing

00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:44,000
platform

00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:47,120
that runs so many critical systems

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,920
out there the open mainframe project

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,200
launched at the linux foundation in 2015

00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,920
with one project

00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,640
and that's now grown to 12 with more on

00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:58,480
the way

00:08:54,640 --> 00:09:01,600
later this year whether it's cbt tape

00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:03,440
or the cobalt efforts this

00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,200
effort continues to grow and

00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,600
demonstrates the important role

00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,360
mainframe computing has in modern

00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,279
computing

00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,880
the momentum of the open mainframe

00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:16,320
project has been

00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:19,440
uh unmatchable in terms of its pace

00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:21,440
relative to many of our other projects

00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,959
it's really a cornerstone of the linux

00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,680
foundation ecosystem

00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:27,920
and this inaugural event is the staying

00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:31,279
power of the passion of this community

00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:34,320
and the importance that it plays

00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:36,880
you know so many times year over year

00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,680
people have heard the word mainframe and

00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,440
thought oh

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,920
are those still around do they still

00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,920
exist but my prediction

00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,839
is that mainframe computing will exist

00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,320
for another 20 years

00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,279
that mainframe computing provides the

00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,080
resiliency

00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:53,600
and scalability that's so important in

00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,440
modern computing

00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,959
and with open source and the open

00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,279
mainframe project

00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,720
we can openly and freely bring a whole

00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:04,880
new generation

00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:07,760
of developers into this ecosystem

00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,880
i really look forward to virtually

00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,360
seeing all of you

00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,640
and hopefully soon enough physically

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,720
seeing all of you

00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,079
at next year's open mainframe event

00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,120
which we hope to hold

00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:21,760
in person when it's safe

00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:24,000
but i want to wish all of you the best

00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,880
for this year's open mainframe project

00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,600
virtual assembly and look forward to

00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:33,279
seeing you

00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:33,279
