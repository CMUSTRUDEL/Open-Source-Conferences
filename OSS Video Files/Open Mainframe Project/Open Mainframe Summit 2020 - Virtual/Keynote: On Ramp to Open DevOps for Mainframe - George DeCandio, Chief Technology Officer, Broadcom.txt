Description: 
	Keynote: On Ramp to Open DevOps for Mainframe - George DeCandio, Chief Technology Officer, Broadcom Inc, Mainframe Software Division 

"Many of today’s modern organizations are running on open tooling. They’re enabling automated CI/CD pipelines and utilizing the industry’s best tools and practices to supercharge enterprise-wide development processes. But how does “open” extend to mainframe development? How do you bring legacy tools from the mainframe world to this modern approach to fully leverage the richness of open source tooling? What do you need to adopt an open strategy in your organization, and where do you start?

In this session, you’ll learn about the expanding opportunity for mainframe DevOps, and how to get started. You’ll review how you can integrate with existing DevOps tools like Git and Jenkins, or into existing cross-platform CI/CD pipelines. And you’ll discover how Zowe, OMP’s first project devoted to the mainframe, is opening mainframe system commands, data sets, and source libraries so you can integrate with tools that know nothing about mainframe.

You’ll walk away with a framework for building your own DevOps integrations using Zowe and the IDE of your choice."

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,679
hi

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,599
i'm george decandio cto mainframe

00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:14,400
software at broadcom

00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:17,520
it's a pleasure to be here i'm excited

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,920
to be part of this omp event

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,800
i'm a long time advocate of open source

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,119
you see

00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,199
i was fortunate enough to work on one of

00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:28,480
the first open source projects

00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,000
the eclipse ide in many ways

00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,200
it was one of the highlights of my

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,320
career eclipse became a major factor in

00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,840
java's success

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,680
as a language i saw firsthand the

00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,960
opportunities that working with open

00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,399
source communities

00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,520
can bring to business and now i'm even

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,559
more excited

00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,079
to be part of extending open source to

00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:52,480
the mainframe

00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:55,520
the system that runs the largest

00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,680
enterprise businesses

00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,719
since my days working on eclipse

00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:03,199
development methods have evolved a bit

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,879
today devops has become the development

00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:06,880
method of choice

00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,680
everyone is reporting on the fact that

00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:12,960
devops has achieved critical mass

00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:16,240
forester forbes devops.com

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,119
and gartner gartner's recent hype cycle

00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,159
report

00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:22,080
features devops as passing the plateau

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,400
of productivity

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,439
that's their final point in the adoption

00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,119
cycle

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:33,119
when a technology has clearly taken off

00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:35,840
its value is fully recognized

00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:38,240
teams that have adopted devops practices

00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:41,200
are responding to customers quickly

00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:44,159
rolling out agile features continuously

00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:47,360
and meeting the demands of the business

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:50,079
so devops is great

00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,880
but the question is is there a way to

00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:53,759
combine

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,360
the tried and true mainframe tools and

00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,479
processes

00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:01,520
with modern devops

00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:04,799
in working with clients we've found

00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:08,879
the answer is as you may have guessed

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,119
absolutely yes although devops is based

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:11,360
on

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,680
open source and collaboration and

00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,720
mainframe has historically

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,239
been closed and siloed it's still very

00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,280
much possible

00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:23,680
the solution i tell our clients is

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,000
opening up the mainframe and we're going

00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:29,680
to talk about this today

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,599
how to embrace an open first approach

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,280
the benefits of opening up the mainframe

00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:35,360
are clear

00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,480
you can leverage your existing mainframe

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,680
investments

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,120
yet work with the tools you want and you

00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,599
can look to the community

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,720
for technologies that have been tested

00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:47,120
versus developing

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:50,560
everything in-house or getting locked

00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:53,200
into a proprietary solution

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,280
you may have heard greg galacto our gm

00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,599
talk yesterday about how this shift has

00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,879
disrupted many industries

00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:02,879
car sharing payments hotels etc

00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,159
and it's changing the game for mainframe

00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:08,879
too

00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:13,040
to us at broadcom we take open seriously

00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:15,200
we define it more broadly as open first

00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,959
open first means going beyond working

00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,200
with open source tooling

00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:22,239
it means consuming mainframe services

00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:25,360
and external automations with ease

00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:28,720
this includes leveraging apis

00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:32,000
sdks command line interfaces

00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:34,799
or ide interfaces

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,720
it means being highly transparent and

00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:39,680
opting for community solutions to

00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:43,120
problems versus proprietary ones

00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:46,319
it's about freedom of choice and the end

00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:48,319
of vendor lock-in open first is the

00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,879
basis of broadcom's view on mainframe

00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,879
devops

00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,439
okay so today we're going to focus

00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,480
specifically on devops and three

00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:00,879
approaches

00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:03,040
for employing open devops on mainframe

00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:06,400
we'll review how you can get started

00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,840
regardless of how you're working today

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,000
so what are these three ways to get

00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,360
going first

00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:17,840
you can leverage zoe to help automate

00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:19,600
i'm sure you all know about zoe second

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,280
you can introduce git into your

00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,840
mainframe environment

00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,320
to encourage collaboration and further

00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,240
increase

00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:30,560
automation and finally you can empower

00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,520
developers with modern ides

00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,280
and increase their productivity let's go

00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,320
through each one in turn

00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:41,360
and see how they work option one

00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:43,440
leverage zoe zoe opens up

00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,120
your mainframe to a whole new world of

00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,800
developers who want to use

00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:52,160
new cloud-based tools and integrations

00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,120
ci cd tools like jenkins gradle circle

00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,000
ci

00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,080
and test tools like jest and mocha these

00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,680
powerful open source tools

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:03,919
make devops simple and approachable

00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,280
we want to unleash the same power for

00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:07,520
the mainframe

00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,400
and we have invested significantly here

00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:12,160
at broadcom

00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,759
in making this a reality zoe enables

00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,039
open source integration

00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,840
through apis and cli you can script your

00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,880
mainframe

00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,280
off platform with a myriad of open

00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,600
source

00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,919
tools the same ones you use in your

00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:29,280
cloud environment

00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,840
and recent additions to zoe they've made

00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,120
it even

00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:34,160
easier to consume with features like zoe

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,560
explorer

00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,080
visual studio code integrations and

00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,759
language bindings

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:44,080
in the upcoming sdks it's not just basic

00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,280
mainframe operations like jobs and data

00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,400
set access

00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,960
but with vendor participation it even

00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:54,080
extends to tools like sysview

00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:57,039
vantage ibm z net view

00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,400
z os connect in addition to the heavy

00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:02,319
hitters like kicks

00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,960
db2 etc and the list of tools zoe works

00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,919
with

00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,800
is growing every day as vendors across

00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:09,440
the industry

00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:12,319
including broadcom are getting on board

00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:15,039
and opening up their products with zoe

00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:17,440
this may seem like a radical shift but

00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:19,759
you won't be alone in your journey

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,680
we've heard from many of our clients

00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,800
that they're excited about what zoe can

00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,400
do for them

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:28,720
but worried about not having the support

00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,639
broadcom has you covered with our bright

00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:36,800
side offering

00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:39,520
okay option two introducing git

00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,800
you guys know about git right all modern

00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,560
developers understand

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:46,240
love and use git and many devops tools

00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,919
interface directly to get

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,919
and are enhanced by its presence

00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:53,759
but how do you introduce git into your

00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:57,039
mainframe

00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:59,840
well you have two options

00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:02,639
one you can migrate your code from your

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:05,360
source code management systems to get

00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:07,120
this comes with major risks but it is

00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,960
possible

00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:12,479
or you can use get with your existing

00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,440
scm

00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:17,520
this is a much less risky solution and

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,280
it leverages the years of investment you

00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,919
have made in your source code management

00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:24,560
environment and build scripts

00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:25,759
if you are using ca endeavor the market

00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,880
leading scm

00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:30,720
it's even easier with endeavour you

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,360
don't have to rip and replace your vital

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,560
code

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,960
you can synchronize endeavor and get

00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,599
by working with a bridge solution for

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,560
git

00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:44,400
your developers have both a git and a

00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:46,319
traditional mainframe library interface

00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,240
this allows millennials to work with

00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:51,440
modern ides

00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,720
and those who love ispf can continue to

00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:56,400
work the way they like

00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:59,199
and are familiar and with gitbridge

00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,560
you minimize disruption by maintaining

00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:03,759
existing tooling

00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:07,280
while adding in the get goodness

00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:08,879
it's the best of both worlds now

00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,520
let's talk about the third option for

00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:13,840
enabling devops on mainframe

00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,879
integrated development environments or

00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,400
ides

00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,400
contribute a lot to developer

00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:21,199
productivity

00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,479
as you probably know ides are a very

00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:25,199
personal choice

00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:26,720
and when you love an ide it's kind of

00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:29,199
like your religion

00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,520
to make it easy to enable many types of

00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:34,399
developers to work with the mainframe

00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:36,320
you need a broad range of ides to

00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:40,479
support the mainframe

00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:42,560
so let's talk about a few starting with

00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:45,680
visual studio code

00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:48,880
far and away the most popular ide

00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:52,080
last reported it has 11 million users

00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:54,240
making it the most widely used ide

00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,680
broadcom has contributed plugins to

00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,320
visual studio code

00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,720
to extend its capability to allow

00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,800
development for the mainframe

00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,160
to do things like syntax highlighting

00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,279
and content assist

00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:10,320
for mainframe languages like cobol jcl

00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:13,839
and rex then there's the new

00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:16,560
browser-based ides that are emerging

00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,240
it's early days for browser-based ides

00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,399
but this is where the industry is

00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,200
definitely going

00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,800
red hat code ready workspaces visual

00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,600
studio code spaces

00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,680
and a clip sha these are the next

00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,000
generation of ides

00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,959
they are becoming more and more powerful

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,600
every day

00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:36,800
and have huge advantages like not having

00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,640
to maintain

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,040
ide installations on developer

00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,839
workstations

00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,720
at broadcom we believe these ides are

00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,600
the future

00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,279
and we've extended a clip shay to work

00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,480
with the mainframe

00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:54,240
we call the project shafer z and it's

00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,440
contributed as open source

00:09:54,240 --> 00:10:00,399
on the eclipse website

00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,440
it's all about choice and freedom from

00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,079
lock-in

00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,519
past ide solutions have been costly and

00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:08,000
proprietary

00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:10,800
our approach is to offer open and

00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,800
license free options

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,720
broadcom continues to contribute

00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,440
community-based technologies

00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,000
to make the mainframe more accessible

00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,120
and we do

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,760
not plan to stop wow

00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,720
that's a lot but that's just the

00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,360
beginning

00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,480
the value of devops is significant which

00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,160
is why it's achieved

00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:34,720
mainstream success of course

00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,920
devops is not a one-size-fits-all

00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:40,000
approach

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:42,240
it's a journey so where do you begin

00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,120
the key is to figure out where you are

00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,720
today

00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,920
and start simple you can start improving

00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:52,000
your processes

00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,000
with any of the options we've discussed

00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,240
we've helped hundreds of clients break

00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,800
down the mainframe silo

00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,600
in fact we use all of these open source

00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,920
innovations

00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,560
and products i've talked about today in

00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,560
our own product development teams

00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,399
we're committed to making the mainframe

00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:11,519
just like any other platform

00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,800
and we're doing it transparently with

00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:16,240
the community

00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:19,279
and in the open open first

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,200
is the least costly least risky

00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:23,279
fastest path to deliver mainframe

00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,680
innovation

00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,560
navigating the path forward is your next

00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,839
step

00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:32,160
and we can help contact us

00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,760
we have a number of no-cost workshops

00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,560
offered through our devops center of

00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,160
excellence

00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:39,920
that can help get you jump started

00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,000
check out our booth here at this virtual

00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:49,519
conference and thank you so much

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:49,519
