	Keynote: On Ramp to Open DevOps for Mainframe - George DeCandio, Chief Technology Officer, Broadcom Inc, Mainframe Software Division 

"Many of today’s modern organizations are running on open tooling. They’re enabling automated CI/CD pipelines and utilizing the industry’s best tools and practices to supercharge enterprise-wide development processes. But how does “open” extend to mainframe development? How do you bring legacy tools from the mainframe world to this modern approach to fully leverage the richness of open source tooling? What do you need to adopt an open strategy in your organization, and where do you start?

In this session, you’ll learn about the expanding opportunity for mainframe DevOps, and how to get started. You’ll review how you can integrate with existing DevOps tools like Git and Jenkins, or into existing cross-platform CI/CD pipelines. And you’ll discover how Zowe, OMP’s first project devoted to the mainframe, is opening mainframe system commands, data sets, and source libraries so you can integrate with tools that know nothing about mainframe.

You’ll walk away with a framework for building your own DevOps integrations using Zowe and the IDE of your choice."
