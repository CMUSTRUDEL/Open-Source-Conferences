hi my name is meredith stoll and i am so

00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:05,920
excited to be here to talk a little bit

00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,040
about business imperatives business

00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,519
priorities

00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,400
um and how that impacts infrastructure

00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:13,519
and development

00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,599
i lead our ibm z ecosystem and i get to

00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,960
work with open sourced communities open

00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,000
source developers

00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,680
students all over the world and really

00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,199
helped to build the talent pipeline as

00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:26,720
well as a vibrant

00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:28,640
community for our platform

00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,240
so the current reality truly has

00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,960
shattered assumptions in our business

00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,280
models

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,960
the stress spots and many operational

00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,960
models have been exposed

00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,399
globally connected supply chains were

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,960
optimized or at least we thought they

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,760
were

00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,879
and they were perceived as low risk but

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,440
94 percent

00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:47,520
of fortune 1000 faced covet 19 triggered

00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,239
supply chain disruptions

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,079
and while transformation was absolutely

00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:53,600
a priority and a vision in fact 70

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,120
percent of executives

00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,120
said that their companies have either a

00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,879
digital transformation strategy in place

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,840
or are working on one

00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:02,559
the reality was it was business as usual

00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,879
in fact i

00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:05,760
t spending on growth and transforming

00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,439
business

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:13,119
was 18 less in 2019

00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:14,560
than where it was in 2009.

00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,159
so what are some of the things that are

00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,280
causing these disruptions what are some

00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,240
of the components that

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,119
really play a role into these business

00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,600
model

00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,600
changes

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,040
four times the employees are working

00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,799
from home 84

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,040
of executives are expecting customers to

00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,880
prefer online channels for engagement

00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,479
so not only are we working differently

00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,520
within our business and the need for

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,040
changing and how we

00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,159
process in the various business

00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:45,360
processes but also how we can deliver

00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:47,759
our our goods our to our clients and our

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,720
the services to our clients need to be

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,759
more digital

00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,600
and this all then impacts the underlying

00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,600
infrastructure in i.t

00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,360
57 of customers are seeking

00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,079
environmentally or socially conscious

00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,759
products

00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,920
that means that we need a higher level

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,759
of focus or at least more focus has

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:09,200
really been put on

00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:09,920
responsible computing in fact the crisis

00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,520
has really made

00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,520
three immediate priorities clear that

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,879
i'll talk through number one is just

00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:20,000
flat out survival and also the need

00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,879
for simplification but then also number

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,360
three

00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,800
super scalability taking a look at what

00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,520
are our competitive advantages

00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:30,959
and how can we leverage technology to

00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,959
help scale those advantages

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,120
from a survival perspective there is an

00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,760
increased pace of change

00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,720
customer expectations while they were

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,360
always changing

00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,519
are changing at a at a speed that we

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,920
didn't even realize could be

00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,760
new competition and all of this combined

00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,360
is accelerating that need for digital

00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,239
transformation in that demand for

00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:57,360
responsible computing

00:02:54,239 --> 00:03:00,000
from an ibm z perspective we have a

00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,920
digital transformation model this was

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,360
already in place and there's a number of

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,840
areas where you can start

00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,959
your journey depending on where you are

00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,480
in your process

00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,400
whether it's from an application

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,840
modernization perspective or whether

00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,640
it's from a data modernization

00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,640
perspective

00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,080
in fact many clients are on that journey

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,159
of transformation

00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,599
and that includes core modernization and

00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:21,440
expansion of their ecosystem

00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,800
leveraging the increasingly broad set of

00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,159
industry providers

00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,799
with various functions that are

00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,319
available so across this journey

00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,400
numerous entry points for this

00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,000
transformation and ibm z offers that

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,799
unique value proposition across

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,720
the spectrum so whether it's modernizing

00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:39,760
applications through apis

00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,319
infusing automation exposing higher

00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,720
value

00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,440
data integration integrating open

00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,440
standards

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,560
introducing containerization for

00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,640
flexibility

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,239
or cross-platform orchestration with

00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,920
openshift

00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,599
all of this while leveraging the

00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,519
platform that is known for its

00:03:53,599 --> 00:04:00,480
industry-leading security

00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:02,640
scalability as well as its resiliency

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,200
as i mentioned responsible computing is

00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,760
really becoming a top priority

00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,120
and what that means is that not only are

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,400
we looking at reducing that

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,560
environmental impact

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,040
but it's also responsible infrastructure

00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,959
responsible code responsible systems

00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,680
responsible social impact

00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:22,240
and what can we do to address that let

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:25,680
me give you one example from

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:28,720
a computing perspective uh as far as

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,960
looking at how can we how can how can

00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,479
how could one company take a look at

00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,720
greenhouse gas emissions

00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:36,320
they needed to reduce that by 25 percent

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,000
in order to comply with the netherlands

00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,600
supreme court decision

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,680
and so one dutch local government

00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,080
organization replaced part of its x86

00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,720
server

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,000
it infrastructure with an ibm linux one

00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,240
environment

00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,759
by moving its linux linux applications

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:54,320
from 47 x86 blades to 11 ifl's on

00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,280
a linux one energy consumption for the

00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,800
organization

00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:00,960
is projected to be reduced by 80 percent

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,639
in addition that doesn't even count for

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,759
the floor space that saved

00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:08,320
and there was also a resulting 946

00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:11,840
fewer metric tons of carbon emissions

00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,840
over a five-year period

00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:18,479
cloud flexibility during covet that need

00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,560
to be able to deliver to clients as

00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,360
quickly as possible when they need it as

00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,440
i mentioned

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,400
there's that increase of online demand

00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,759
increased

00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,320
of wanting to go from a digital digital

00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,880
interface

00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,800
ibm z clients they temporarily activated

00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,479
a total of nearly four times more

00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,600
general purpose capacity

00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:42,000
via that on off capacity demand and 2q

00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:43,680
versus the 2q 2020 versus 2q 2019

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,360
taking advantage of that key design

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,320
point of the z platform and being able

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,880
to dynamic

00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,400
dynamically turn on that capacity to

00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,680
ensure that they were able to deliver

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,720
their services

00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:57,600
to their clients when they needed it

00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,600
at all times

00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,280
the second key area around

00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,800
simplification while processes and

00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,280
ecosystems are becoming

00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,280
more and more complex whether it's

00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,960
driven through regulatory compliance or

00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,960
complex supply chain

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,720
or internal processes that have been

00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,479
developed over years and years

00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,759
they are absolutely inadequate for the

00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,240
required case

00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,080
that is needed today so there's this

00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,680
driving need for simplification

00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,919
and a lot of that is being driven

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,600
through devops and agile

00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,280
but also implementing open source

00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,560
standards and tooling to drive skilled

00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,720
sustainability

00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,000
now devops is that union of people

00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,919
process and tools

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,520
it enables the continuous integration

00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:41,199
the continuous delivery that

00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:42,560
speed to clients equality the people

00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,080
need to ensure that everybody's

00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,520
delivering value in the business and

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,960
working tightly together with that

00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,960
common goal

00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,240
process devops is all about improving

00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,759
processes because

00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,919
even if you have a highly motivated

00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,280
people and they're working well together

00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,960
you may still have several business

00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,080
processes that could get in the way and

00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,479
so being able to

00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,080
to create those processes that can

00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,360
integrate and it can speed and that are

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,759
simplified

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,360
tools there are products tools services

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,240
that can help to enable the devops

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,240
practices

00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,680
such as continuous testing integration

00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,759
delivery

00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,680
but even with the best tools you still

00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:18,160
have to have the right culture

00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,479
the primary characteristics of a devops

00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,720
culture is increased collaboration

00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,000
between the roles of development and

00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,440
operations

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,039
and there are some important cultural

00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,400
shifts in within the teams and at an

00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:31,039
organizational level

00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:33,039
that support this collaboration it is

00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:35,120
possible that you can transform your z

00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,840
os environment to a true modern devops

00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,520
practice

00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,360
there's nothing about z that stops you

00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,199
from doing devops

00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,800
enterprise ride standardization with

00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,520
that focus on common tooling

00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,199
across the development process is

00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:50,080
absolutely key and you can see some of

00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:52,639
the common uh tools down below

00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,759
automation continuous testing is a key

00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,280
part of devops

00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,080
it means testing earlier in the life

00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:00,400
cycle which results in reduced cost

00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,720
shortened testing cycles and continuous

00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,879
feedback on quality

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,039
modern development practices another

00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,080
driving factor for common tools across

00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,759
the stack

00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,160
is that need to attract the new

00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,000
generation to this platform

00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,280
to do so we need to bring current

00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,160
development practices to this

00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,680
environment

00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,759
and we need to do that by looking at the

00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,160
distributive pipeline and bring it onto

00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,599
the z

00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,440
platform but it's not just about

00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:26,479
bringing it to the z platform

00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,960
we need to actually embrace it integrate

00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:30,160
it

00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:32,320
and use it that way this allows

00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,880
cross training of developers on familiar

00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:38,159
tooling so they don't need to learn any

00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:41,039
platform specific tooling

00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,919
and then finally super scale in order to

00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,159
stay

00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:46,640
in business and prevail our clients have

00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:48,160
to strive for that competitive advantage

00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,080
uh where there is that business

00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,440
advantage we need to use technology to

00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,680
take advantage of it

00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,440
um and a lot of this is at play when it

00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,279
comes to data in fact one of the core

00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,399
competitive advantages for company is

00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,320
their data

00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,839
gaining access to that data and being

00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,480
able to quickly leverage it to gain

00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,720
insights

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,800
improve client experience integrated

00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,760
across the enterprise

00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,519
is imperative so in order to facilitate

00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,040
this integration there are many tools

00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,880
processes that are available

00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,160
so for example the ibm z digital

00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,240
integration hub

00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,360
that delivers faster time to revenue for

00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,920
z integration

00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,519
through a pre-integrated in-memory cache

00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,240
that serves up the right information

00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,399
queries

00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,160
to allow modernization while maintaining

00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,279
that core performance and cost it's

00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,519
basically

00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:33,440
a read-only approach of key information

00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:36,240
from the core delivered in real time

00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,080
and speaking of real time the ability to

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,519
optimize analytics with real-time

00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,000
insights

00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,920
that's also very important and that

00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,600
interaction infusing artificial

00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,600
intelligence with business transaction

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,760
whether it's for fraud detection

00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,519
auto loan approval this is what enables

00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,360
companies to super scale and leverage

00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:56,399
their existing technology investments to

00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:59,760
deliver business results

00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:02,240
so that brings us to the final end

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,079
we have got to accelerate that speed

00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,040
accelerate delivery speed enhanced

00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:07,360
timelines

00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,519
all built on business result resiliency

00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,839
and truly reaffirm

00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,880
digital transformation at the core of

00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,800
our strategy

00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,800
