hi

00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,960
my name is lauren valenti head of

00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,639
education and customer engagement within

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,280
the mainframe software division

00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:12,719
at broadcom and i'm yvette lamarr

00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,440
director of ivmz

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,320
ecosystems for ibm and we are here today

00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,160
to talk to you

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,760
about the mainframe open education

00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,840
project

00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,680
so for decades the technology industry

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,760
has had a need to replenish the aging

00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,800
workforce with talented skilled

00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,720
professionals

00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,560
for example any new hire manager

00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,239
educator or even a student

00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,320
there's not a diverse collection of

00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:35,920
education material that includes the

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,640
unique experiences

00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,320
and expertise of the mainframe community

00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,920
there's a lack of community support

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,480
platform where experts can share their

00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,920
knowledge

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:48,160
and materials the open mainframe project

00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,800
has helped fill the skill gaps

00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,600
with its mentorship and kobold project

00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,000
and will go

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,120
one step further with the new education

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,239
project

00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:00,239
spearheaded by broadcom and ibm the open

00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:02,960
source project drives access

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,840
educational content through a simple

00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,000
platform

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,360
in which subject matter experts share

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,520
up-to-date materials

00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,200
and foster collaboration with the

00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:14,240
broader community

00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,159
the result is a clear learning path that

00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,560
rejuvenates the workforce

00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,720
and drives access to business critical

00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,880
systems
