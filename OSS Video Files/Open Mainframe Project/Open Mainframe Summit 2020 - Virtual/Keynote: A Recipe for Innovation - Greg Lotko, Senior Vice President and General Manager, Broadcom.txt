00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,280
hi

00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,920
greg latko svp and general manager of

00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:14,799
the mainframe division at broadcom

00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,400
i'm not a particularly big drinker or

00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:17,520
honestly the trendiest person in the

00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,920
room

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,279
but i do enjoy a social drink from time

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,880
to time

00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:25,439
lately i've been wondering what all the

00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:28,560
fascination is with being a mixologist

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,640
what exactly is a mixologist i thought

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,120
it was bartending

00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,120
apparently there's this whole world of

00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,120
new creative drinks out there

00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,200
and innovation in drinking that the

00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,640
sophisticated crowd is calling

00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,440
craft cocktails i'm a bit old school

00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,520
like

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,640
if i have a drink it's typically a

00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,280
classic

00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,160
take the margarita the basic ingredients

00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,199
are tequila

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:56,239
cointreau lime and just the right

00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:58,960
mix of added sweetener add ice

00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,920
salt the rim garnish with a fresh lime

00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,359
wedge

00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:07,600
mix pour yeah

00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:11,200
that's a great drink so mixing a drink

00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:14,000
easy right all you need is a good recipe

00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:17,040
shopping for the ingredients is easy too

00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,159
you can pretty much find them anywhere

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:23,040
mixing an even better drink

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,119
that can be a bit more challenging it

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,159
comes down to great ingredients

00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:30,720
and how you mix them

00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,479
working with new ingredients it's

00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:36,079
changing the game

00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:39,280
it's all about continuous innovation

00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:42,880
can you guess where i'm going with this

00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:45,600
our world is i.t and innovation is

00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,119
absolutely critical to business we drive

00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,079
digital transformation

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:52,000
to create innovative services services

00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:53,360
that take customer experiences to

00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,640
another level

00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,640
services that win in the marketplace

00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,320
they need to be unique and

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,719
differentiated

00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:06,240
they need to be trusted they need to

00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:09,360
have integrity in every transaction made

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:13,120
whether it's banking insurance retail

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:16,319
government you name it the transaction

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,800
is the elemental form of business you

00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,120
can't afford an exchange or interaction

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,319
that

00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:25,200
doesn't execute and i mean reliably

00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:27,040
all the time if you don't your standing

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,840
with your customers will suffer

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,280
maybe irreparably that's where the

00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,239
mainframe comes in

00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,560
in today's world with all the challenges

00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,280
and

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,680
opportunities that are out there the

00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:43,120
mainframe with new tools and services

00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:45,280
is a key ingredient to success so let's

00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,840
talk about how mixology

00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,640
and mixing it up connects to the message

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:53,680
for today why is an

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:56,560
open strategy important for technology

00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,680
and business i think we'd all agree it's

00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,519
absolutely

00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,720
critical but let's dive a bit deeper

00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,959
into this

00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,760
and look at how open applies to both

00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,840
sides

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:11,920
business and tech on the business side

00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,080
there are many examples of putting parts

00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,640
together to deliver a new service or

00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,959
experience to your customers

00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,319
mixing the right parts partnering for

00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:24,159
the ones you don't have

00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:26,080
or creating just the ones you need voila

00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,360
with the right mix you can disrupt an

00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,560
existing market

00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:33,440
or get a fast start into a new one

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,519
but remember with an open approach the

00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:40,159
barriers to entry are lower

00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:42,400
for everyone you and your competitors

00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:44,720
take ride sharing services how they've

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,519
redefined mobility with innovations that

00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,080
sprang from

00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:51,920
new open approaches like accessing

00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:54,560
google maps apis and overlaying gps data

00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,640
or airbnb and netflix and how they

00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,040
revolutionize their industries

00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,000
raising the bar on customer expectations

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,480
by orchestrating

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
apis from the community as well as

00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,239
private apis

00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,040
or capital one paypal and others in

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,040
finance

00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,879
who are using open source tools to

00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,319
deliver innovations like peer-to-peer

00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,319
payments

00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:16,000
now i can pay joe directly for my share

00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:20,239
of those cocktails the other night

00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,239
and there's a record in case he forgets

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,280
likewise logistics leaders are using

00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,280
open technologies to improve their

00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,960
customer experience by enabling them to

00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,040
print their own shipping labels

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,800
their drivers are making fewer delivery

00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,520
errors as well

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:38,240
innovation and disruption all comes down

00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:41,600
to being open and having the right tools

00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,520
for mixing testing iterating and gaining

00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,800
the insights to get to market

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,960
faster than competitors let's say you

00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,759
have three parts already in-house

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,280
but you need a fourth or a fifth this is

00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,840
where you look to a partner

00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,479
or the community for assets that have

00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,919
proven

00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:00,479
successful here's an example of how this

00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,199
works

00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:04,720
in the mainframe community partner apis

00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,440
are just like they sound mainframe

00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:10,160
services made available to partners

00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,639
when open these apis satisfy the needs

00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:15,199
of a broad range of applications

00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:17,360
take for example a mega retailer they're

00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,600
publishing reusable technologies to

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,199
empower their supply chain

00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,960
one of their apis enables their

00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,199
retailers to check inventory

00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,280
dynamically before serving up

00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,840
personalized recommendations

00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,759
this ensures promoted items are actually

00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:34,400
in stock

00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,440
fully open apis are available to anyone

00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,880
in the community

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,880
they're published without any

00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:41,840
expectation for how they'll be used

00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,479
a great way to create new possibilities

00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,039
remember

00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:46,240
uber cashed in on this approach

00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,320
literally

00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,520
when they used open apis to overlay

00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,160
google maps data

00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,600
with data from cars gps's to develop a

00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,759
ride sharing app

00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,160
google probably never imagined this

00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,800
development but because those maps were

00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,199
open

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,280
the data was used in a novel way

00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:07,199
creating disruptive value

00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:10,000
it's all about seeding innovation

00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,639
leveraging open and shared technology is

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,720
inherent

00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,240
to the mainframe ecosystem and is

00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,600
driving excitement

00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:20,160
among innovators look

00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,840
you approach this in steps start by

00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,319
opening up your infrastructure

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,240
you can create disruptive innovations on

00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,440
the mainframe by opening it up and using

00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,280
tools like zoe

00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,400
and apis you can create the same culture

00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,919
of contribution

00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:37,520
collaboration and creativity you fuel

00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,520
innovation whether you're talking

00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,960
business logic or infrastructure

00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,039
processes

00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,160
on the tech side of things you need the

00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,720
right elements

00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,840
and you need to know how to mix them

00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,800
right

00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,160
think integration but it's more than

00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,960
that

00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,960
you need a mix of new tools plus the

00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:00,479
ones you already have

00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:03,919
think open source tools plus

00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:06,319
we call this open first open

00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,840
first means going beyond working with

00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,000
open source tooling

00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,599
beyond just exploiting those tools in

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,720
isolation

00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:17,280
it means making it easy to consume and

00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,360
automate mainframe services externally

00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:23,199
whether through open apis

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:25,039
sdks clis or ide interfaces

00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,479
open first means being highly

00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:29,039
transparent

00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,840
opting for community solutions to

00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:33,199
problems

00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:35,520
versus proprietary ones that's freedom

00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:38,240
of choice

00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,599
open first is the enabler of mainframe

00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,479
innovation

00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,520
it's a mix that works for your

00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:47,599
developers

00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:50,479
across platforms and experience levels

00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,800
broadcom is breaking down industry silos

00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:53,759
in

00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,360
several community focused ways we're a

00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,919
founding member and contributor of more

00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,199
than half of the initial zoe code base

00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:01,840
and we continue to be

00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:03,280
very active in the community we're

00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,400
opening up our own products and

00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:08,800
mainframe data with zoe compliant apis

00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,879
this enables deeper integrations and

00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,120
easier orchestration and automation of

00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:15,360
mainframe solutions

00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,800
we're also embracing open ide

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,639
initiatives

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,440
development and debugging tools follow

00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:23,440
open protocols required for popular ides

00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:27,120
like visual studio code

00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:31,599
and cloud native ids such as eclipse che

00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:34,719
red hat code ready workspaces and others

00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:37,440
it's about being customer centric we're

00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:40,719
enabling customers to lead by embracing

00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,399
open a large u.s insurer is deepening

00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,519
their investment and open source for

00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,360
mainframe

00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,800
they're running zoe with our support

00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,040
offering brightside

00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,760
leveraging jenkins and endeavor and

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:53,200
using sonarcube for quality testing

00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,800
and i don't mean they're just playing

00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,120
with it in test

00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,320
they have more than 50 mainframe apps

00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,640
already in production

00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,440
out of nearly 300 that they're planning

00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,399
to onboard

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,800
onto their brightside jenkins system

00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,240
they're now saving significant time in

00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,640
deploying applications

00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,600
with mainframe as part of their ci cd

00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,959
pipeline

00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:18,160
and speeding up troubleshooting

00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:21,040
sure alternative approaches exist

00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:23,040
but they also come with limitations and

00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:26,320
risk

00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:29,440
there are degrees of open

00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,240
there are those who are doing open and

00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,360
those

00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:35,279
who claim to be just

00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,640
providing apis and point-to-point

00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:39,839
integrations

00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,720
that's not open doing that and nothing

00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,880
more

00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,200
constrains innovation and results in

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,440
vendor lock-in

00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,720
failing to take an open approach in your

00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,920
market segment

00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,680
puts you at risk you can bet your

00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:57,279
competitors are embracing open

00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:59,920
and leveraging it to disrupt you

00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:02,320
open is all about communities and tools

00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,399
working together in a synchronous way

00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,880
and the ecosystem becomes more valuable

00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:08,399
as participation increases

00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,560
at broadcom we're investing

00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:13,279
significantly in open interfaces

00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,200
not point-to-point one-off integrations

00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:17,120
we're excited about working with our

00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,360
clients on new innovations

00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,800
in areas like configuration management

00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:24,000
and software maintenance

00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,440
based on this open approach one example

00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,959
is a large customer

00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,560
which hosts internal business

00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,560
applications

00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,079
they're working with zoe and extending

00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,720
ansible based configuration

00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,440
management to the mainframe and there's

00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,399
so much

00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,320
more that can be done in this space just

00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:43,120
think about the possibility of

00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,720
say leveraging widely used open test

00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,560
frameworks to automate mainframe

00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:51,519
application testing

00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:55,920
listen mainframe teams have a choice

00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:58,079
the vendor controlled or the open path

00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,560
with commitment from the open mainframe

00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:04,000
project and further investments

00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:06,079
from broadcom rocket ibm and others

00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,640
the opportunities for the mainframe will

00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:10,560
only expand

00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:13,360
when it comes to innovating the

00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:16,560
mainframe makes a great mixer

00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:20,079
mix open and cloud with your mainframe

00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:22,880
you'll get far more strategic value

00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,519
you've probably heard me say this before

00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,279
i

00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:29,120
hate the term vendor we're a partner

00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:31,360
and partner means working together to

00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:34,000
advance your agenda

00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,200
reach out we're happy to bring our main

00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,680
frameologists

00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,200
to mix it up with you so you can adopt

00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,880
an open first approach

00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,200
to deliver on your innovation

00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:45,600
imperatives

00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,200
now remember i started this by saying

00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,959
i'm not a big drinker

00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,600
nor am i the trendiest person in the

00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:53,440
room but at least in this virtual world

00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:57,839
of today

00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,839
i'm working on both of those

00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,880
here's to the five-year anniversary of

00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:06,720
omp

00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,720
and two-year anniversary of zoe

00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:24,639
that's a good mix thank you

00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:24,639
