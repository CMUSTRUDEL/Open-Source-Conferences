Description: 
	Beyond the Mainframe Security Features, it is Time to Learn about Open Source Software Security - Javier Perez, IBM

Mainframes are the most secure platforms available, they provide the functionality to build secured mission-critical applications better than anyone. There is also a growing ecosystem of open source software (OSS) for mainframes. Tools, frameworks, and libraries are being increasingly used by development teams. With this new reality, it is very important to educate your developers, managers, and executives about securing code on open source. In this session, you will learn why and how vulnerabilities on OSS exist, how to prevent them, and how to protect your applications and data. You will also learn how to keep up with constant changes in OSS. Vulnerabilities in open source software increase the risks of exploitation, it is critical then to have a plan around visibility at an early stage in the development lifecycle, shift-left, and automate application security.

hello good morning good afternoon good

00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,279
evening

00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,120
really happy to be here at the first

00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:10,240
open mainframe summit

00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,719
uh my name is javier perez and i'm open

00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,920
source

00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:14,960
uh program manager for ibm i'm part of

00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,080
the ibm z

00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:21,279
organization and i'm here to talk about

00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,080
open source software security we have a

00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:24,080
good title here

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,680
beyond the mainframe security features

00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,119
it's time to learn about open source

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,439
software security

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,439
and for the next 25 minutes i'm gonna

00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,239
talk to you about all the details around

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,600
open source

00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:38,719
uh as we grow uh the industry

00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,239
keeps moving into open source um

00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,520
you know it's just natural to have more

00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:42,559
and more open source software in the

00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,000
mainframe

00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:48,640
so i think it's an important uh uh topic

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,879
to talk about security beyond all those

00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,480
security features that uh

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,640
you will know and we have on the

00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,760
mainframe and i've just just mentioned

00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,640
uh briefly so without further ado i'm

00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,160
going to

00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,440
uh start a presentation so it's all

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,200
about open source right

00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,400
it's all about uh all the innovations

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,000
that are out there

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,920
you know you name it right you see on

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,280
the images there augmented reality

00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,320
virtual reality

00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,920
autonomous cars autonomous vehicles ai

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,759
machine learning deep learning

00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,439
blockchain virtual assistants

00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:24,000
all of that and more all those

00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,280
innovations are being built on the open

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,360
right i mean you can just go to the

00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,840
github repo or any other get

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,960
a public repo and and look at the code

00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,960
to see exactly how it's been done

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,640
uh and that's that's a beautiful open

00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,200
source right communities

00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,240
more people contribute there's there's

00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,640
engagement

00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,560
and it's growing right it keeps it it

00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,720
grows in terms of the enhancements

00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,920
new functionality and at the same time

00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,200
addressing

00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,280
the box and addressing uh security

00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,159
issues uh and that's what we're to talk

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,560
about here but but it's very clear

00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,000
that open source it's mainstream open

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,520
source is here to stay

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,960
i mean look at all those programming

00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,240
languages right and frameworks they're

00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,000
all open source

00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,000
all your developers if you're a

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,520
developer you are using open source

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,440
right and there are there are actually

00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,280
millions of libraries

00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,560
out there so you don't have to start

00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,400
from scratch you just

00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,239
go you need something to encrypt there's

00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,800
a library or actually many libraries out

00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,599
there

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,959
that do the job for you and you know

00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:26,400
depending on the story

00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:29,280
uh there's between 70 to 99

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,640
of of the the applications the software

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,160
that is built today

00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,920
that it's actually contained in open

00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:37,519
source so 70 to

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:39,599
99 of the code it's actually already

00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,040
open source and we're just reusing and

00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,959
innovating and building

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,720
uh new functionality and that's and

00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,280
that's that's a good thing about open

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,560
source

00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,800
right um in the enterprises

00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,760
in the businesses uh you are seeing it

00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,160
more and more

00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,040
uh even if you are just focusing on the

00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,400
on the mainframe

00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,440
uh space you see that that open source

00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,599
is taking

00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,760
uh taking off just because of it's it's

00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,920
the low cost to start right it's free

00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,480
it's available and as i just mentioned

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,239
uh most of the innovations uh or all the

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,720
innovations are on the open

00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,840
right when we talk about uh machine

00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,239
learning for example

00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,959
you know every all these libraries from

00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,720
python or tensor tensorflow

00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,640
they're all out there and you want to

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,799
use the latest and greatest

00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,159
q flow and i can go on and on in terms

00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,400
of uh

00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,840
open source projects many of them part

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,040
of this

00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:35,280
umbrella linux foundation and

00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,440
and and that's where you know you want

00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,519
to keep innovating you want to use those

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,959
that uh that functionality that is

00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,400
already available there so

00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,159
it's a great advantage for the

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,400
businesses it's a great advantage for

00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,280
for the enterprises a couple of other

00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,280
points that are

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,799
important is you know there's a faster

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,560
pace especially on both successful

00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:55,040
projects there's a faster pace

00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,840
of bug fixing and vulnerability fixes

00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,000
you know and i'm

00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,159
going to talk about the securities

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,720
security in just a second but

00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:04,560
you see more people participating more

00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,720
people addressing any issues

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,799
right and you know something that didn't

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,879
happen a few years ago

00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,799
uh you know there's actually more more

00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,239
and more documentation there are forums

00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,079
there are community forums there are

00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,880
videos there are blog posts there's

00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,560
so much content out there uh with the

00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,519
participation of many businesses many

00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,400
enterprises

00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,520
so there's more so much support on open

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,400
source software

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:30,320
that is a really viable way to start on

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,600
the businesses and by the way

00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,440
you know it also helps with your

00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,880
recruiting and you want to recruit good

00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,880
developers you want to recruit

00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,000
old stack developers that's what they're

00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,639
doing that's what they're learning

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,520
they're using all the latest open source

00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,320
software so it's also another reason to

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,280
to adopt

00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,280
open source software

00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,240
if we move into the mainframes um and

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,440
actually recently just

00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:58,240
published an article at the ibm

00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,240
systems magazine you can you can you can

00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:04,080
get a little bit more detail on that

00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:06,000
and and we are um you know within five

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,080
actually just just just have the five

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,120
year anniversary of linux one

00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,759
uh actually together with uh five years

00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,800
with the

00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:16,639
for the open mainframe uh uh

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,400
project which congratulations that's

00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,680
that's great uh a lot of things have

00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,840
happened in five years

00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,199
right but there's open source there's

00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,880
always been open source on the

00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,520
mainframes i mean linux has been on the

00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,680
main fence for more than 20 years now

00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,800
and uh as i said there's there's there's

00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,720
a blog post and there's more

00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,240
documentation out there about about that

00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,840
and and i know that there's some

00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,039
initiatives to talk about

00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:41,360
the 20 years of linux in the mainframes

00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,880
but now these are these are numbers uh

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,759
very recent numbers from

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:48,080
from ibm uh we have more than 50 percent

00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,160
uh of all mainframes running linux

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,360
uh more than 90 of the largest

00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,120
enterprises

00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,120
that have a mainframe they are now

00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,800
running linux uh

00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,639
pretty much all linux distributions are

00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:02,080
available on mainframes uh

00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:03,120
commercial and and open source

00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,720
distributions

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,720
they're very much all available out

00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:10,160
there and and there's a

00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,120
large or a growing ecosystem of open

00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,759
source software that

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,160
is now available on four mainframe

00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,240
platforms what is known as the s390x

00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,800
architect process architecture

00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,199
and just to show you a quick example

00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,080
here a few logos these are actually open

00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,400
source software

00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,520
you know popular or most recognizable

00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,880
software out there

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,199
but it's also available on the

00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,880
mainframes right so so we have a growing

00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,680
ecosystem and by the way you can go to

00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,919
those links

00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,039
there if you want to take a picture or

00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,600
have access to the

00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:41,199
recording on the slides later um where

00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,720
you can find information

00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:47,680
um on on each one of these um

00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,759
open source uh software how to you know

00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,240
including documentation in some cases

00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,280
uh some scripts of how to deploy or how

00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,919
to build it

00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,960
uh but this is just a partial list there

00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,720
are more

00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,639
open source software that is available

00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,560
now

00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,240
on the mainframes now you know within

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,039
the languages and runtimes

00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,240
uh you probably recognize their zoe also

00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:11,440
part of the

00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,960
open source uh project um you know

00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,680
there's also some growing

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,960
space for z os right the mainframe

00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,360
operating system

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,639
uh most of this obviously is uh it's uh

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,960
it's linux but again

00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:25,759
it's a growing ecosystem and this is

00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,520
fantastic right this is this is great

00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,280
so now let's talk about open source

00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:32,319
software security and

00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:34,000
and here i'm talking about not just the

00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,360
the kind of well-known open source

00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,639
software that i just showed you on the

00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,759
previous slide

00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:42,319
but um want to talk about when you

00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,199
are developing when your developers are

00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,879
coding

00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,120
and they're building applications for

00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,000
for the mainframe uh when we talk about

00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,560
security

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,240
uh we talk about vulnerabilities it's so

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,680
it's it's all about vulnerabilities and

00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,160
of course when there's an exploit on

00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,240
those vulnerabilities

00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,639
those vulnerabilities happened on the

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,680
open source libraries or components or

00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,319
packages

00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,800
uh in reality it's in a specific

00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,319
functionality of that library

00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,000
right so we can say well this library

00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,599
has uh uh

00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,080
you know one bullet ability or two or

00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:15,680
three vulnerabilities but in reality

00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,280
uh the vulnerability happened in a

00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,840
specific function or

00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:22,240
or what is called methods of that

00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:24,080
library so very important when when

00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,440
you talk about vulnerabilities what part

00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,000
of that library what what's the

00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,080
vulnerable

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,120
method or vulnerable function of that

00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,520
library

00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,959
um the cv is the common vulnerability

00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:36,000
and exposures that's when

00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:37,039
the vulnerability is reported it's

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,839
disclosed

00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:41,599
and there's a number there's basically

00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,159
an id assigned to it

00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,519
and a score and that's the cvss score

00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:48,000
system

00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,360
which goes from you know very high high

00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,080
medium

00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,000
low severity there's actually a couple

00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:57,519
of versions of cvss version 2 version

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,760
3 version 3 adds another severity uh

00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:01,440
and that's how you help you classify or

00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,240
rank or prioritize

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,560
your your vulnerabilities and and the

00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,600
big

00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:09,519
issue here one of the big areas is

00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,680
you know not every vulnerability is

00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,519
disclosed or is

00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,360
available in the national vulnerability

00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:18,560
database or some other

00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,279
public uh repository uh so there's an

00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,000
issue here

00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:24,000
where especially with newer more modern

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,680
languages and with the speed of devops

00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,839
that there's not really time to go

00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,760
and publish and disclose information

00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,680
about the vulnerability so

00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,040
that's another uh kind of important

00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,080
problem or important

00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:38,160
issue when we talk about uh for for

00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,760
open source software uh you have to go

00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,760
and find those vulnerabilities that are

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:45,920
out there right this whole open source

00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:49,200
open repos uh they're out there

00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,959
so why do vulnerabilities exist and and

00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,480
you know there's always a question right

00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:54,959
i mean you know they're bad

00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,920
but developers there or or people that

00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,959
are trying to do

00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:01,680
uh the bad things it's not that

00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:03,760
uh really uh avoidability exists on the

00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,440
software especially on or

00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,200
any software but i'm talking about open

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,480
source software uh when there's not

00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,200
enough education

00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,800
about uh security or development uh

00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:16,240
security education

00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:19,519
uh for example uh developers should know

00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:21,519
at least the top 10 or or wasp uh

00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,440
type of uh vulnerabilities you know

00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:26,160
things like cross-site

00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,480
scripting things like injection of sql

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:32,959
injection or non-sql injection

00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,959
or ldap injection and

00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,680
if this is new to you or to your

00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,279
developers to go and check the oguasp

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,839
and the different training that is

00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:43,680
around security this will go

00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,440
a long way in terms of reducing the

00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,440
number of vulnerabilities on the

00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,279
on the code uh and then there's there's

00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,360
the concept of a security champions

00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:53,519
uh you know not everyone is an expert

00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,560
nobody nor everybody knows a lot about

00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:58,880
uh security but if you have at least

00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,000
one person that knows more about

00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,399
security in the different

00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,560
teams in your different scrum teams they

00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:08,320
can act as security champions and

00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:10,160
you know help with reuse or or assist

00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,440
in anything that that relates to

00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,680
potential uh

00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,519
a flaws or potential opening for

00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,120
vulnerabilities

00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,560
the other issue and you know a couple of

00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,760
other issues is that it's there's no

00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,279
question is

00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,279
especially in the successful projects we

00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:25,519
have way too many contributors right

00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:27,279
and and i like to put there the that

00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,079
code from from linux torvalds which

00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,240
which i think is

00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,200
it's good and and captures the essence

00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,079
of open source

00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:36,480
which is uh given all enough eyeballs

00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:39,279
all blocks are shallow right and box or

00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,120
security uh or vulnerabilities are

00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:42,000
shallow and then it's how it works and

00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,360
that that's

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,640
you know with participation there's a

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,480
bug there's a fix there's a

00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,040
vulnerability people find go and find a

00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,440
fix and

00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,120
that's great about open source uh but

00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,959
with so many contributors

00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,399
uh you sometimes you lose track and then

00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,000
sometimes you know unintentionally

00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,399
someone with not enough security

00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,440
education can make it open for uh

00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,040
vulnerability

00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,959
and then the final point there and and

00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,279
this is the best picture i could find

00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,200
for

00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:06,399
for this is the fact that especially for

00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,920
the large projects

00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,680
uh there's not a single architecture

00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,519
right there there's enhancements there's

00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,279
new functionality there's new subsystems

00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,480
or there's new apis

00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:16,160
and then it gets a little bit of arrow

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,120
control in terms of a single unified

00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,839
architecture so

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,600
that creates uh gaps right where

00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,720
potentially can be exploited potential

00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,920
vulnerabilities

00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,120
uh there um let's talk quickly about the

00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,000
libraries and obviously i'm not

00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,160
referring to

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,160
to book shelves but i'm talking about

00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,079
the open source libraries and and

00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,839
the the point that i want to make here

00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:40,160
really make here is the fact that

00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:41,440
uh you know open source projects open

00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,079
source

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,880
uses other open source and uses other

00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:48,720
open source

00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:51,120
right so uh you know there's a chain

00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,000
there's a chain you know one software

00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,440
can use another

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,440
open source library that uses another

00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,160
local source library and go on and on

00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,079
and on and on

00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,680
depending on the programming language in

00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,680
some cases is worse than others and i'll

00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,920
show you a graph in just a second

00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,000
about that and i know your developers

00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,680
use dependency management tools they use

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,959
package management tools to

00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,639
take care of all those dependencies

00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:11,920
sometimes it's a big problem when you're

00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,959
building or you're compiling your

00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,120
applications

00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,320
uh but but you also have to look at the

00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,480
security side of things

00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,399
right so so these dependency management

00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,519
tools this package management tools

00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,279
are not really looking for

00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,079
vulnerabilities they're looking to

00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:27,279
address

00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:28,399
your um your dependencies right make

00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,160
sure everything works with

00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,560
the correct versions of your of your

00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,639
dependencies

00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,160
i have a couple of examples for you and

00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,240
i think this represents well

00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,399
this this increased risk right this this

00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,160
issue in terms of open source security

00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:44,360
uh this is one of the most popular in

00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,680
java i use as a source maven

00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,440
repository.com

00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,440
uh you can go and check by yourselves

00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:52,720
and many other examples

00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:55,600
uh the apache commons io library uh

00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,240
this library has uh just just a few days

00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,199
ago

00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,600
had more than 19 000 artifacts that

00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:01,839
actual

00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,519
artifacts meaning libraries that use the

00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:06,959
apache commons io

00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:10,000
library right so so one library is used

00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:12,560
by more than 19 000 other libraries

00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,320
one of them it's apache common slang

00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,360
which actually is also used by another

00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,680
17 000

00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,480
or more than seventeen thousand uh

00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,480
libraries

00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,639
or scale tests that is used more than

00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:26,959
twelve times or spring wave or

00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:29,760
fast uh json or you know hadoop common

00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:31,360
or selenium and others and that that's

00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,560
just a sample right this is just to

00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,680
represent this on

00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:39,279
on on a slide zookeeper and many others

00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:41,440
uh there's a chain right so uh

00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:43,519
if there's a vulnerability in one of

00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,519
these let's say you're on apache commons

00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:48,240
io or in one of these

00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,519
kind of first line uh direct

00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,680
dependencies

00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:53,120
um then it's gonna affect all the other

00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,240
usage all the other open source

00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,079
libraries

00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,279
uh and in some cases you just know the

00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:59,040
library that you're calling

00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,560
but you don't check the rest of the

00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,000
libraries that are being used

00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,240
by the library that you're calling your

00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,160
direct dependency right

00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,680
uh here's another example uh the

00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,639
previous was java

00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,000
this is javascript low dash it's one of

00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:13,839
the most popular javascript

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,360
libraries out there and it was not

00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:18,160
twelve thousand it's actually

00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:20,320
more than a hundred thousand uh

00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,880
libraries used lola

00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:25,120
uh by the way uh lowdash had a lot of

00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:27,360
high priority or a multiple high

00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,920
priority high severity

00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,720
vulnerabilities a few years ago pretty

00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,560
much in the last

00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,839
two three years it's been really really

00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,800
good but there was at one point where

00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,360
there were some

00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,680
you know high severity uh

00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,519
vulnerabilities and it was affecting

00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,959
you know hundreds actually thousands of

00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,399
other libraries and you know here's

00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,040
example and you might recognize some of

00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,000
these

00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,639
like uh elasticsearch or twilio and

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,160
others

00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,440
that are actually using this loadage

00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,519
package and there are many many many

00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,839
many more

00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,759
so what's the what's the situation here

00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,880
right uh there's always going to be

00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:01,040
newer abilities

00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,320
i had i hate to say i had to say it i

00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,320
had to tell you

00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,839
you know there's always new codes

00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,040
there's always the potential for new

00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,519
vulnerabilities

00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:12,079
uh and and you know there's constantly

00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:13,360
discovery of these vulnerabilities now

00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:15,120
uh the good thing i was telling you

00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,839
about you know the beauty of open source

00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,079
the good thing

00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,199
is that the smart way to do it when

00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,240
developers go and find those

00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,839
vulnerabilities

00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,600
they don't disclose that immediately

00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:24,880
they go work on the fakes and once they

00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,680
have to fix

00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,240
then there's a disclosure now you you i

00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,560
know where

00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,639
where i think you know where i'm going

00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,279
uh okay well let's disclose there's a

00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:35,759
fix

00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,800
but now you have to go and update your

00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,560
software right

00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,880
you have to keep up with the latest

00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,720
fixes and that's the other big issue

00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:45,839
with open source security

00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:48,000
um you know i

00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:50,079
i worked on a company in an app security

00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,199
space uh there are different reports but

00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:53,440
really more than 90

00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,480
of the public vulnerabilities in open

00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,399
source software

00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,920
uh they already have a fix that you

00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:00,320
already have a fix

00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:02,160
um here's here a couple of numbers uh a

00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,079
couple of us

00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:06,160
reports that were published just very

00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,839
recently in june basically in the last

00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,799
couple of months by two companies

00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:12,480
uh synopsis and sneak and i just wanted

00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,120
to share some some some numbers and i

00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,919
don't want to scare

00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,640
you uh but if this is real right uh

00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,160
synopsis

00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,559
going on and scan and looked at more

00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,799
than 1500 applications

00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:23,839
and they found that more than 75 or 70

00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:26,480
about 75

00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:28,000
of those applications 1500 applications

00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:31,440
had vulnerabilities

00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,840
uh and then you know 49 had actually

00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,120
high risk high severity uh

00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,440
vulnerabilities

00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,799
um i'm not going to talk about licensing

00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,039
here i mean it's not

00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:43,520
it's not security related but it's it's

00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:46,880
important in open source as you know to

00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:49,280
to be uh have the proper licensing uh so

00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,799
there was also uh uh there's this

00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,240
important information around

00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:54,080
uh you know some of the issues related

00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,160
to open source licenses

00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,520
um and then the other issue that that

00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,200
this report um

00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,039
open source security and risk analysis

00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:04,400
report uh shows is

00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:07,280
you see this at that 82 and 88

00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,160
uh this is when when you use uh

00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,559
libraries

00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,919
that haven't been touched there for four

00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,480
years five years

00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:15,760
some cases a lot more so a very

00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,160
important advice there

00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,120
if you are starting to work with open

00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,840
source software

00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,120
yes look for successful open source

00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,200
projects that they have a lot of

00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,960
activity there's some that

00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,640
you know if no one is really touching

00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,160
them for years that means that they have

00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,440
vulnerabilities out there that no one

00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,600
has really addressed

00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,640
right and then really quickly with the

00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,480
the other report

00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,400
uh the state of open source security

00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,280
reports just a couple of charts there to

00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,919
show you

00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:43,600
uh i was telling you about the the

00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:44,720
dependencies like libraries calling

00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,039
other libraries

00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,320
uh there's a big difference depending on

00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,840
the programming languages

00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,760
uh so for example most of the

00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,679
vulnerabilities found on titan

00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,799
are on the direct library direct

00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,880
dependency

00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:59,600
whereas for java and maybe central or

00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,440
ruby or or for node.js

00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,600
most of the vulnerabilities are found on

00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:06,960
the indirect dependencies or

00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:08,720
or the transitive libraries right not

00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,240
exactly the one that you are you're

00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,760
calling but the ones that are used by

00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,280
those libraries

00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,960
and another very important point now

00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,200
that we're using containers or

00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,640
a lot of people are using containers uh

00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,000
the nice thing about containers is

00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,480
within the same container

00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,600
you have your application you have

00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,880
runtimes and you have

00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,880
you can even have your linux

00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,280
distribution within the container

00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,400
well it's important to to to check those

00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,360
as well right they might have

00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,000
vulnerabilities

00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:35,360
with inside the container and part of

00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
this story went and checked some of the

00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,120
popular

00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,760
um kind of official container images

00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,880
out there and docker hub and and then

00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,919
you can see by yours it's all the

00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,720
well-known

00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,120
um open source uh software out there

00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,480
that

00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,840
actually has significant number of

00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,960
vulnerabilities and you have to keep up

00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,280
with that right that's

00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,480
another reality with open source uh

00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,640
security

00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,160
so what is the real risk and and i think

00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,720
you get it based on on my

00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,640
the previous information uh it is really

00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,280
about the speed right so

00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,760
uh once the vulnerability is disclosed

00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,559
uh

00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:11,280
the exploit becomes easier why because

00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:14,240
the bad guys have access to the same

00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,760
git repo out there that tells you i just

00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,640
fixed this vulnerability

00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,280
right and then becomes a speed race

00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,559
right so

00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:24,400
you go you have to go and and

00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:25,679
and patch it right away right there's a

00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,679
fix you have to go

00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:28,720
and patch it and you have to go and

00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,840
patch also your

00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:33,520
transitive or dependencies so you know

00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,039
that's when you are at risk right and i

00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:37,039
think this picture actually

00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:38,799
uh i when i saw it it's like yeah this

00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:39,679
this represents right you assume at your

00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:41,440
own risk

00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,720
uh you're not gonna go and fix a hundred

00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,400
percent of the vulnerabilities because

00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,280
in some cases could be hundreds or

00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,120
thousands

00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,280
uh but you have to go on and address the

00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,480
the high severity ones at least the high

00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:53,760
severity

00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:56,480
ones and as you move with speed right

00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:58,240
as you are implementing or you already

00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,320
automating your devops

00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,520
uh your continuous integration

00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,919
continuous deploy uh

00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,919
delivery uh it's important to automate

00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:07,600
just like you automate your testing

00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,760
uh just like you're automating your

00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,400
build or your future the build of your

00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,679
apps

00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,000
uh automate security automate scans that

00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:17,280
go

00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,520
and identify vulnerabilities

00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,320
i think that's a great opportunity there

00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,080
for verify

00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:25,760
only not only your first party code but

00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,760
also the the open source code

00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:31,200
so that brings me to the vulnerability

00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:33,360
scanners that's what you use to identify

00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:36,159
these vulnerabilities in a nutshell

00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:38,159
what they are is a way to identify the

00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:40,320
open source libraries in your code

00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,679
and then cross-check against a database

00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,840
where you have the information

00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:45,039
if there are vulnerabilities or not in

00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,679
those

00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:49,919
libraries you know the software can also

00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,919
give you some information about

00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:53,679
you know obviously the cves or the

00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:54,400
scores but also some information around

00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,159
alerts you can

00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:59,039
define some thresholds some some

00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:00,960
policies and then of course recommended

00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:02,159
to be make it part of a devops right

00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,320
that's as they call shift

00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:06,960
left make it early as early as possible

00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:09,919
so you have time to go and address those

00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:11,919
vulnerabilities uh there's a bunch of

00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:13,760
open source software out there or or

00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:15,919
just free scanners

00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,600
i'm just listing a few of them you know

00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:18,159
just go on and do it let's go and

00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,480
implement

00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:21,679
that um you know there's a dependency

00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,000
checker from all us

00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:25,760
there's i mean you can use an npm audit

00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,440
or github gitlab

00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:31,360
offers some some free

00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,720
scanners and there's also the commercial

00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,600
products right the commercial products

00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,919
are known as

00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,720
software composition analysis and they

00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:38,840
offer you

00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,799
uh you know more complete database of

00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,679
vulnerabilities they offer you some

00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,280
other more

00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:46,240
more functionality right deal of

00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:48,720
materials things like that

00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,400
so you got this right you know how do

00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,799
you manage your open source usage

00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,400
uh you have to have visibility of the

00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:56,400
open source usage you have to have

00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,919
visibility of your risk

00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,679
on those vulnerabilities on your opens

00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:01,679
or software and and

00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:03,919
you know make it automatic automatic

00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:07,039
right make it part of your ci

00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:08,159
uh pipelines make make it from devops to

00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:11,919
devsecops

00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:13,600
right um just finally uh there was this

00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:15,840
actually part of the linux foundation

00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,640
a new project the open source security

00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,559
foundation

00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,720
a great initiative august is part of

00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:22,640
them and many of the other major players

00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,400
uh and they're going to be working on

00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,720
you know the vulnerability disclosure

00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,360
which

00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,640
is obviously uh an issue uh that i was

00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,400
telling you earlier that not

00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,000
everyone discloses or there might be

00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,039
some differences on the disclosure

00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,039
are they going to be working on

00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:37,039
promoting tooling to to help you with

00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,960
this open source security so great to

00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:41,120
to check on on on that it's just very

00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,840
very new i just started in the last few

00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,679
weeks

00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,360
uh so finally just just a few thoughts

00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:47,840
for you um

00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:49,840
my advice uh my recommendation is you

00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,520
know keep promoting open source right

00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,960
keep promoting innovation in your kind

00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,919
of organization

00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:57,200
uh if you have mainframes uh you already

00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:59,200
a mainframe user

00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,960
take advantage of those great uh

00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,520
security features right you have things

00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,159
like

00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,640
you know perversive encryption you you

00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:06,240
you may

00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,520
have these problems with open source but

00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,600
if you're encrypting everything you

00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:11,600
reduce the chances of a bridge

00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:14,080
uh you can have your workload iso

00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,520
isolation your isolation of workloads

00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,120
uh you know some of the more recent

00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,919
functionality i believe is just on the

00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:22,240
z15 the data privacy passwords

00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:23,760
uh the compression i mean it's it's

00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,520
amazing i'm amazed uh

00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,120
and the speed of compression available

00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,799
on a mainframe uh

00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,400
and then you know this new feature that

00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:32,559
you probably saw it there the

00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:35,440
homomorphic encryption

00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:36,240
sounds really good right so uh you can

00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,880
have

00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,080
encryption addressed or in transit and

00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,960
with homophobic

00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,279
encryption uh you don't have to decrypt

00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,840
to

00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:46,480
provide to do some operations or do some

00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:49,840
of uh

00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:51,679
the work uh with that data or with those

00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,799
numbers or with with what you have

00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:55,919
encrypted

00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:57,520
uh it's uh uh process intensive

00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,960
but you can do that with the mainframe

00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,440
now so you know if you haven't take a

00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,840
look

00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,559
keep an eye check check that uh and of

00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,360
course

00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:06,880
um you know keep uh promoting open

00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:09,600
source within your developers

00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:11,520
keep an eye on on security educate your

00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,840
developers on security

00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:16,080
uh keep an eye on those vulnerabilities

00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:18,720
identify them and then identify them

00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,919
often so with that i think we're going

00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:25,279
to

00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:25,279
