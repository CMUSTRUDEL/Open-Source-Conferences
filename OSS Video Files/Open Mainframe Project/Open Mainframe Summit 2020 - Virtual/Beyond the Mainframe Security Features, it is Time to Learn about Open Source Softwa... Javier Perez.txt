	Beyond the Mainframe Security Features, it is Time to Learn about Open Source Software Security - Javier Perez, IBM

Mainframes are the most secure platforms available, they provide the functionality to build secured mission-critical applications better than anyone. There is also a growing ecosystem of open source software (OSS) for mainframes. Tools, frameworks, and libraries are being increasingly used by development teams. With this new reality, it is very important to educate your developers, managers, and executives about securing code on open source. In this session, you will learn why and how vulnerabilities on OSS exist, how to prevent them, and how to protect your applications and data. You will also learn how to keep up with constant changes in OSS. Vulnerabilities in open source software increase the risks of exploitation, it is critical then to have a plan around visibility at an early stage in the development lifecycle, shift-left, and automate application security.
