	Keynote: Software Transparency and Dependability: Next Steps - Kate Stewart, Senior Director of Strategic Programs, The Linux Foundation 

The most innovative software products today use open source projects to speed time to market and proprietary software for product differentiation.   When a vulnerability is announced, we all want to know if the software in a product will need to be updated.   Having an accurate software bill of materials that can be queried in an automatic fashion, and determine if a mitigation is needed or not, is a goal weâ€™d all like to see in place, yesterday.  This talk will provide an overview of some of the technologies and projects that are working towards making this vision a reality.
