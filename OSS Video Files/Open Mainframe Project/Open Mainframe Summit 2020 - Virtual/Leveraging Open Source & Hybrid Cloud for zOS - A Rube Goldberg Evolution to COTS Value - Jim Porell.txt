New technologies on the mainframe seem to be all the rage. Attend most user groups and you’ll find out how they work and how they were built. But what can you use them for? How do they return revenue to your business or reduce costs? How do they make your jobs easier?  Here you’ll find some examples that are already underway at a wide variety of businesses to improve their IT environment. And it’s IT environment, not just mainframe. The important aspect is that many of these work on other systems as well as the mainframe. These capabilities are helping to evolve  the mainframe in a consistent way with other platforms. Topic areas that can exploit these technologies include Application Development, Security, System Monitoring, Data Access and Analytics.
