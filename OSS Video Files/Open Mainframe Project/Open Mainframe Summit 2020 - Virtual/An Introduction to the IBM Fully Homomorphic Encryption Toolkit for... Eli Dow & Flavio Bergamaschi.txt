Description: 
	An Introduction to the IBM Fully Homomorphic Encryption Toolkit for Linux (on IBM Z and zOS Container Extensions) - Eli Dow & Flavio Bergamaschi, IBM

Invented in IBM Research, Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is the first and only known technology that allows entirely encrypted data processing not just at rest, or in transit, but also while being operated on by the CPU and in memory. The implications of FHE unlock new cloud potential for even highly regulated industries. In this session, our speakers provide an overview of FHE and business applications and demonstrate how you can begin experimenting easily with a set of open-source FHE toolkits that help enterprise developers weave pervasive security into software source code. The toolkits support Linux for IBM Z as well as z/OS with Container Extensions. We conclude with technical demos shipped with the toolkits. These include Privacy-Preserving Search through a fully encrypted key-value store as well as a fully-encrypted machine learning for credit card fraud detection.
