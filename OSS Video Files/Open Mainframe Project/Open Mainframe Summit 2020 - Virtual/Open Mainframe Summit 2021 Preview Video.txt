the mainframe is kind of a best

00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,320
kept secret we all use the mainframe

00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,679
every day you know the last time you

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,719
used your credit card is the last time

00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:14,719
you use the mainframe

00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,880
the system itself has been used for

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,640
decades

00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,240
to support some of the most

00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,359
mission-critical

00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:28,400
capabilities within um that are used by

00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,400
people around the world

00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:36,480
arguably what i would say is that

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:40,000
the open mainframe project

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:43,280
has and is delivering

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,719
the cloud-like experience to mainframe

00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:49,120
and very very impressive on uh what this

00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,039
open community has uh done so far these

00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,719
systems are reliable

00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,879
they're highly performant i think this

00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:58,000
is the third year that we've

00:00:54,879 --> 00:01:01,440
taken part in the open mainframe

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,680
internship program to try and compile

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,040
all the assets that we require for cloud

00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,240
foundry and run them

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,960
on on z i think that observability

00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:13,280
in the mainframe space is just like the

00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:27,840
importance of observability in any

00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:27,840
scale infrastructure

00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,960
