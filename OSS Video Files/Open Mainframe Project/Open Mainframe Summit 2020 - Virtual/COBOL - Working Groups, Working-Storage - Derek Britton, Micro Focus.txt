Mainframe applications are the lifeblood of the global economy. COBOL is the lifeblood of those applications. Yet few people realize or acknowledge the profound impact the COBOL language has had over its 60 year history.

The session will cover - 
1. COBOL's enduring value - how it stood the test of time

3. The work of the OMP in promoting COBOL
