Title: COBOL - Working Groups, Working-Storage - Derek Britton, Micro Focus
Publication date: 2020-09-05
Playlist: Open Mainframe Summit 2020 - Virtual
Description: 
	COBOL - Working Groups, Working-Storage - Derek Britton, Micro Focus

Mainframe applications are the lifeblood of the global economy. COBOL is the lifeblood of those applications. Yet few people realize or acknowledge the profound impact the COBOL language has had over its 60 year history. 

Showcasing a brand new OMP Working Group, this session reveals COBOL's secret history and the efforts of OMP and others to bring COBOL's value to the public eye.

The session will cover - 
1. COBOL's enduring value - how it stood the test of time
2. Recent trends to demonstrate COBOL's ongoing popularity
3. The work of the OMP in promoting COBOL

hello everybody welcome to this session

00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,319
of the

00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,040
omp summit entitled cobalt working

00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:10,559
groups

00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:13,120
working storage my name is derek britton

00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:15,759
i work at microfocus who are quite well

00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,080
known for their cobol products

00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,359
but more importantly today i'm delighted

00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,640
to be

00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:25,119
one of the uh founding members of the

00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,119
new cobo working group within the open

00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:30,560
mainframe project

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,960
and the this session uh the title is of

00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,399
course

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,160
a play on words anyone who knows

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,559
anything about cobol

00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,960
uh even from the dim and distant past

00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:41,680
will know what working storage is

00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,280
so to continue that pun let's uh get to

00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,039
work and

00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,360
look into what we'll cover in this

00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,360
session

00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,800
all right per the agenda and the

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,360
schedule for the summit

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,719
uh this session is going to cover a few

00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,520
key things

00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,359
a few key elements about the computer

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,239
language called cobol

00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:06,960
why it still matters to us all how it's

00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:10,479
stuck around so long and been

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,080
excuse me frankly so successful

00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:14,320
and what issues and challenges it's

00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,040
facing today and what the open mainframe

00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,159
project

00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,200
is looking to do about that now i'll be

00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,400
assuming some

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:25,600
rudimentary knowledge no more uh

00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,479
on your part about cobol so you know you

00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,560
know what it is

00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,560
what it does um but aside from that

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,040
we'll keep it fairly high level

00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,640
and i hope this is there anyone at the

00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,680
summit who has cobil in their

00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,560
organization or is

00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,840
serving customers with cobalt systems in

00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,920
their organization

00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,600
we'll get something from this now

00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,040
there's quite a lot to cover in

00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,799
the short amount of time we've given

00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,960
ourselves so let's let's dive straight

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,119
in

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,119
let's start with a fairly staggering

00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,560
fact charlie

00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,399
many of you don't just know this of

00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,799
course but worth restating

00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,560
the kobold programming language is now

00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:04,479
as of 2020

00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:07,119
into its seventh decade of loyal service

00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:09,039
uh to the it community now depending on

00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:12,480
where you set that original date

00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:16,000
cable is now 61 years old

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:19,000
the term was first coined um

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,319
by the codicil committee uh in september

00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,120
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:24,160
if records are correct now since then

00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,920
it's been

00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:32,480
in widespread use across the globe

00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:35,519
as a core i.t business systems language

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,840
now of course back in 1960

00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:40,080
things weren't even called it then i

00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,879
think data processing

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,640
hadn't even been coined as a phrase we

00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,840
certainly didn't have the ibm mainframe

00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,040
at that stage

00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:51,360
let alone the internet or the cloud

00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,360
but we had cobol which was invented like

00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,519
i say in 1959 and

00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,440
and first saw the light of day as a

00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:01,120
piece of technology

00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,120
uh later on in 1960

00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,879
so what is cobalt well a few statements

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,480
to uh i'm sure just remind us

00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:12,080
uh cover runs system of record

00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,080
applications it's used to build system

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,159
record applications at literally

00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,840
tens of thousands of organizations

00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:20,800
worldwide

00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,840
supports banking insurance

00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,799
transportation

00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,799
government retail health care many other

00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:29,360
industry sectors

00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,319
it comprises uh according to all

00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,599
estimates we

00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:36,000
we read literally hundreds of billions

00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,680
of lines of code

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,560
running application worldwide

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:44,959
applications worldwide

00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:49,280
and it remains overwhelmingly strategic

00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:51,599
and we can quantify this with a 92

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,280
response rate from the marketplace in a

00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,680
2020 survey saying

00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,480
that their core applications in cobol

00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,640
were strategic to the business

00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,239
worth noting finally if you didn't

00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,159
already know cobalt was actually

00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,640
designed by

00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,680
and and remains uh orchestrated and

00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,439
managed by

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,920
an independent authority it's not owned

00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:15,439
by

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:18,560
anybody there's no single organization

00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:19,680
um that owns the ip while there are

00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,479
differences

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,080
uh of course between that approach and

00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,360
others you could perhaps argue it's one

00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,720
of the first

00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,560
open projects of its kind and certainly

00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,199
long before anyone had considered that

00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,720
term

00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,280
so i think it's very much you know

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:38,800
spiritually at least very at home

00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,800
in what the omp is trying to do

00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,720
now you might imagine that after such a

00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,280
long time

00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,960
uh in the marketplace and such a long

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,960
period of success that

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,800
the interest in the technology might

00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,120
have tailed off and some of us

00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,000
of course remember the spike of the the

00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,040
y2k

00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,479
days in the late 90s um but more

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,080
recently you could be forgiven for

00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:04,560
imagining that

00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:07,280
kobold has drifted off into a fairly

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,120
sleepy glacial state

00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,520
well the reality is quite the opposite

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,080
in fact i mean first of all

00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,840
last year was the 60th anniversary and

00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,240
it went off with something of a bang

00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,759
vendors and commentators alike made

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,320
quite a lot of noise in the

00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,440
in the industry and in the press and

00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,960
elsewhere

00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,479
about the language and

00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,120
a lot of people were asking me how has

00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:33,600
it made it that far has it made it to 60

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,280
which we'll come back to later and on

00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,520
the back of that there was a

00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,520
a market survey commissioned by my

00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,360
employers microfocus

00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,039
that you know captured some fresh

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,240
evidence of usage

00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:49,520
in the marketplace and and caused again

00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:51,759
further interest in discussion

00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,960
now more recently perhaps as we all know

00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:56,160
the industry has been

00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,520
turned upside down by the pandemic which

00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,680
has created

00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:02,720
its own news stories about various

00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,240
organizations and and their reliance on

00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,560
you know one form of technology or

00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,400
another including cobalt systems

00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,319
and whether or not that's a good or a

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,120
bad thing there's been a lot of press

00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,120
about that too

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:19,039
now finally and and worth noting again

00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,280
we all know of the advent and the rising

00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:22,639
popularity and ubiquity of the cloud and

00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:26,720
how this is

00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:29,759
also impacted how and perhaps even where

00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:33,280
core business systems need to reside

00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:35,199
and execute going forward

00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,720
um and that includes cobalt systems as

00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,840
well and that sparked

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,120
uh another round of conversation and

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,880
more broadly

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,319
a topic you know about cobalt

00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,440
suitability

00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:49,680
for the digital age so

00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,280
it's not been out of the press at all

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,680
not been out of the news and and

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,000
and you know worthy discussions each one

00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,000
of them

00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,960
so all in all its 60th anniversary year

00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,919
was quite a busy one

00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,560
uh but let's just stop for a second and

00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,120
consider

00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,800
60 years it's a remarkable achievement

00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,880
isn't it if you think about it it's not

00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,520
often that

00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,800
nit at least an established and

00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,960
untrusted

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,560
technology such as cobalt uh and

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,599
certainly cover running on the mainframe

00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,039
very much

00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:25,039
you know the the key example of that

00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:27,759
not often that anyone reaches that kind

00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,759
of milestone

00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:34,319
and yet you know that's

00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,360
with good reason um cobalt is still

00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,000
affecting

00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,360
our daily lives uh perhaps more than

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,319
people imagine you know booking an

00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,120
airline ticket

00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,240
getting cash out getting a new car

00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,639
insurance quote

00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,400
shipping a parcel whatever it may be

00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,960
they're all prime examples prime use

00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,360
cases

00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,960
for cobalt running a on a back end

00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,639
system somewhere

00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,319
typically on mainframe typically with

00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,639
the help of kicks

00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,720
you know often seen a bit of a holy

00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:03,440
trinity if you like those three

00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,960
technologies for core business systems

00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,080
you know these are constant and

00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,440
unchanging

00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:13,120
parts of day-to-day life and

00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:15,599
industries that support it now evidence

00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:18,160
of cobalt's ongoing

00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:19,759
usage is is everywhere and and this time

00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,840
last year

00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:24,160
the 60th anniversary was celebrated like

00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:27,520
i say notable press coverage of that

00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:30,879
and some you know significant

00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:33,120
pieces of coverage and assets from 2019

00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:35,039
that has continued into this year so to

00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,200
just a quick recap then

00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:39,120
a hundred separate articles published on

00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,479
the topic in the last 12 months alone

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:46,399
5 million social media impressions

00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:48,480
according to a a study we undertook

00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,920
very active community conversation

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,320
around cobalt and and

00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,279
interestingly the the cobol programmers

00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,160
facebook group

00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:59,040
you know something of a barometric

00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:01,519
measure of popularity of things

00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:04,320
shot up in the last couple of years from

00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:08,240
something around 9 000 to 16 000

00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:11,360
today so there's an outpouring

00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:14,240
of continued support in the community

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:17,760
for uh for you know what is clearly a

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,760
fairly legendary language

00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:23,200
and i i thought i'd throw this up there

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,720
for us um perhaps the best way to

00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,760
illustrate this is that you know

00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,760
what's the latest metric of something

00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,120
that's newsworthy well you know perhaps

00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,519
you could argue that

00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,560
social media itself is is the right

00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:37,279
thing to measure so

00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,720
so twitter it's interesting that the

00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:41,760
ieee report

00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:45,040
from this year shows cobol to be in the

00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:48,640
top 10 of computing language

00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:50,800
searches um for the year

00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,320
it's interesting cobalt in the top 10 of

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,080
twitter searches

00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,360
um and i think we can forgive the

00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,560
publishers for not

00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,560
listing it as as uppercase but um

00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:03,200
it's a lot of chatter about cobol in

00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:08,079
2020 for a language that is

00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:08,079
well um quite so old

00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,000
so okay kobold's great it's well

00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,440
designed and it's evolved to meet

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
changing needs and all of the things

00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,800
that we can say

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,160
positively about it but it is an old

00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,880
language and we're never

00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,399
far away from someone throwing rocks at

00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,120
it

00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,959
and indeed it's always been that case

00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,240
from the very start someone didn't like

00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:35,279
it

00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:38,320
keep in mind june 1960

00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:40,079
was before the first ever version of a

00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,800
working cobra compiler had even been

00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,760
produced

00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,200
and yet someone was already willing to

00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,480
complain about it

00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,920
and more recently look at these

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:53,120
headlines from from this year

00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:55,600
so you know it's not all roses look at

00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,680
uh look at cobalt oh it's so old no one

00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,959
knows it anymore it needs replacing yada

00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:02,959
yada yada

00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:04,959
well well i might roll my eyes at that

00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:06,399
and many of us know this this is kind of

00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:10,480
scaremongering or

00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:12,720
you know fairly idle report writing

00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,640
this is some of the information i t

00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:18,000
leaders decision makers

00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,560
might be reading as well this is the

00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,079
threat

00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:24,720
that cobalt faces reputational damage

00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:25,839
based on what idol speculation

00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,880
misinformation

00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:30,959
and maybe some some technical buyers

00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,800
we'll come back to the work of the omp

00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:35,600
and what we're going to do about that

00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,600
very shortly

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,680
but before we do let's let's ask

00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,000
ourselves that question you know what's

00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,480
what's

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,440
the truth about coba what's what's the

00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,200
secret

00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:51,440
60 years on of its enduring success

00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,480
so how is it still here running great

00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,480
chunks of the economy

00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,079
well of course the the secret is that

00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,480
there is no secret

00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:02,160
and and for those who know of all about

00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,800
it uh

00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,240
you know it's entirely entirely

00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,519
understandable

00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,360
um kobel's enduring success it's not an

00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:14,320
accident

00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,079
um so what's good about it well it boils

00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,959
down to these four things there are four

00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,800
attributes that

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:20,320
experts time and time again have

00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,040
reported

00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:25,360
mentioned to myself and to my colleagues

00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:27,600
when we were asking our customers

00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:30,160
and and the market in general about how

00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:33,519
cobalt has stood the test of time

00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,399
see if you agree but his his what i

00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,839
think they are

00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:40,000
business centric portable readable

00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:43,760
adaptable kobo does all of those things

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:46,959
brilliantly and and

00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:50,399
as a result has stood the test of time

00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:54,240
let's look at each one very quickly

00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:57,040
first cobol was designed for business

00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,160
and that's what the b stands for what

00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,440
does that mean

00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:03,760
well put simply it runs very efficiently

00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,880
very quickly which is quite useful if

00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,600
you're managing

00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,880
millions and millions of records and

00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:13,200
countless transactions

00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:15,279
in your business systems it handles

00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,440
arithmetic very very well very

00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:19,680
accurately more so in fact than

00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,480
practically any other technology in

00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,040
which is also

00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,800
quite useful if you're processing major

00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,360
financial transactions

00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,639
all of the time day in day out for some

00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:32,480
of the world's largest

00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:34,800
organizations or government agencies

00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,720
it's designed around the data which

00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:40,560
helps maintain the integrity

00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:44,079
of that data and it's designed for

00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:46,639
how data is processed sorted

00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:48,320
stored it's all out of the box and

00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:51,279
designed with high volumes

00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,079
in mind add all of that together and you

00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,240
have a language

00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:55,199
uniquely capable of running back-end

00:13:54,240 --> 00:14:02,720
systems

00:13:55,199 --> 00:14:04,959
and designed to do so

00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,839
the second attribute is portability that

00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:10,800
cobol needs to work

00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:12,320
the same wherever you run it now the

00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,839
original design remember

00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,000
predates any kind of standard

00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:19,199
environment

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:23,120
there wasn't such a thing as the go-to

00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:25,519
de facto operating system or platform

00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,040
back then it was anyone's guess what was

00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:31,199
going to emerge

00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:33,040
and even as standards emerged

00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:35,920
there was as you can see here something

00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:39,040
of a clamor by many many manufacturers

00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:41,040
to produce market leading

00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,639
machinery equipment operating systems

00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:45,279
chipsets

00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:49,440
and of course in each case cobol needed

00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:49,440
to be available on those platforms too

00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:54,399
uh and this is a random sample of

00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,480
platforms and machinery old and new

00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,160
uh where coble has been engineered to

00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,800
work over the years

00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:03,199
they represent business critical

00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:06,480
platforms of choice for many

00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:08,800
across the years um

00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,800
we we can perhaps afford a wry smile

00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,760
about some of the names listed here and

00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,880
refer to them as

00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:16,480
enterprise platforms but but nonetheless

00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,079
it's what the manufacturers were setting

00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,560
out to do

00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:23,040
now some we can barely remember and some

00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:25,440
we can obviously barely survive without

00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,959
even today and i should have started a

00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,000
list of course i should have started a

00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,880
list

00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:34,320
um of where it doesn't run which would

00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,320
have been a much shorter list

00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:38,959
thirdly it's readability it's child's

00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,759
play isn't it

00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:43,600
um part of kobold's reputation and charm

00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,440
is that you can explain it to a sixth

00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,920
grader

00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,959
now i know that to be true because my 11

00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:52,120
year old

00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:53,279
has had it done to him again the

00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:55,759
specification

00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:57,680
back in the late 50s said let's use

00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:00,240
plain english where possible and avoid

00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:02,399
symbolism where possible so move a to b

00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,759
means move a to b

00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,240
i think that was grace hopper's

00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:07,040
suggestion at the time almost unique in

00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,279
that approach

00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,120
because it's a language that you can

00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:12,160
easily understand and if you can easily

00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,279
understand it

00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:17,519
you can easily learn it which is quite

00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:20,000
useful when there's a good chance

00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:22,240
a very good chance in fact given its age

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,680
that you will end up having to maintain

00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:27,279
review other people's code

00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,360
because we know how old some of these

00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:32,639
systems can be

00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,880
uh and experts across the industry agree

00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,480
it's a pretty straightforward task to

00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,240
pick up cobol

00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:41,199
if you have any kind of computing

00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,199
discipline background

00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,880
now if those three elements were more to

00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,399
do with the original design of the

00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,320
language

00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:52,880
another key design feature was to ensure

00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:56,720
the language was acceptable of future

00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:59,279
adaptation because they knew version one

00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,040
was not going to be a one-and-done

00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,759
because they knew so much was going to

00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,000
come

00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:05,120
thereafter and of course that was

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,640
exactly true

00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:11,280
so today's cobol does well actually back

00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,160
what it did back then very well but also

00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,520
it does

00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:19,520
come a long way forward even from

00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:21,039
cobalt 60 the first incarnation or even

00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:24,319
nc68 or

00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:25,839
i ansi 74 where things really started to

00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:28,000
standardize

00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:29,520
and this table only of course scratches

00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,720
the surface

00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:35,840
in fact a fairly staggering array of

00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:38,080
continued innovation

00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,080
that has taken place after the

00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,880
language's original construction

00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,640
well that's all evolved and the language

00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:48,960
has evolved to to support it

00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:50,480
to continue to support the evolution of

00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,760
the i.t world in which it lives

00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,480
platforms manage

00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,520
code virtualization new programming

00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,840
constructs

00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:00,240
third-party tools they're all now easily

00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:04,480
supported

00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,480
by and integrated from cobol

00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,799
and look at the investments made in the

00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:11,440
technology by the vendors for

00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:12,799
for that to happen and the work done by

00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,600
the standards bodies

00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:16,720
to ensure that those definitions are

00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:20,080
clear

00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,600
and then you know industry-wide

00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,679
and now with the efforts of the

00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:26,320
organizations like the omp

00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:26,960
to ensure new life is breathed in to the

00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,080
language

00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:33,280
and the environment in which it works

00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:35,200
so whether it's new ides whether it's

00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,799
managed services

00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:40,000
whatever it needs to be that

00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:41,440
adaptability continues

00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,760
and i think we can all agree with mr

00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,840
darwin perhaps for providing a

00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:48,480
an appropriate quote here about the

00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:51,039
adaptability

00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,559
of technology being a absolute

00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:57,840
cornerstone attribute

00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:57,840
to its ongoing success

00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:04,160
okay well if that's the story of coble

00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:06,240
and and why it stood the test of time

00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,320
what about the open mainframe project's

00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:11,840
point of view and what about this new

00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,840
working group that's been set up

00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:20,400
well why we're here today is to

00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:23,280
take us back to you know not every piece

00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,320
of press not every comment about kobo is

00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,200
as positive

00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:29,280
as the ones i'm bringing you here today

00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,600
and so there's some work to do here to

00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:34,400
ensure that the public perception

00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,760
the industry perception of the language

00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:39,280
is appropriate

00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:42,480
and is fact-based so

00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:46,000
the omp sparked off a discussion

00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:48,080
there was a a lot of interest in cobol

00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,200
uh interest in telling the truth about

00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,880
its attributes

00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:55,120
to ensure ensure its future success

00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,799
so it will set up in may this year the

00:19:55,120 --> 00:20:00,400
first call took place in

00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:02,960
in june and the objectives will come to

00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,960
you in a second

00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,960
but we have 70 members already

00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:10,080
practitioners consultants

00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:13,919
trainers users vendors

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:17,520
all are welcome more than 70 members

00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:19,840
in the in the working group so far

00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,919
monthly meetings including guest

00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:24,159
speakers new initiatives

00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,120
and you know every voice is heard it's a

00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:28,880
meritocratic

00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:33,120
approach brilliantly chaired by

00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:35,760
my friend cameron c who is

00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,720
something of a luminary in the industry

00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,840
many people

00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:42,960
know cam very well um and he

00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:46,400
is an excellent chair of the group

00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:49,840
and and we're looking for more

00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,840
we're looking for more people to join us

00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:56,320
now what are we aiming to achieve

00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:58,559
the objectives are laid out here and as

00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,240
were submitted to the omp board

00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:03,039
in order to set up the group in the

00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:05,840
first place so let's reiterate

00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:05,840
uh together

00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:13,440
the efforts i think uh have

00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:17,440
already focused already focused

00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:18,640
on re-establishing an appropriate level

00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,840
of perception

00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:23,919
of the cobol language

00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,200
the training objectives actually cross

00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:27,679
over into other

00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,679
omp threads specifically the team

00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:32,080
looking at training courses for

00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:32,720
and other technology so we'll be working

00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,840
closely

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,480
with those teams already doing so now to

00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,360
be clear

00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:41,200
we're not talking about cobo here as the

00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:45,840
only language to use

00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,840
this is not some misguided

00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:50,799
evangelical approach to application

00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,840
development that says only cobol should

00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:54,960
be used

00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,360
this is about talking about using cobalt

00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,200
as a

00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,559
fit for purpose business language doing

00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,200
what it does best

00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:02,640
working alongside and with other

00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:06,000
technologies

00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:08,320
as it should do but it is to help

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,799
everyone make an informed decision about

00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,679
it strategy and where coble fits into

00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:16,720
that

00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:16,720
to avoid any costly and risky mistakes

00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:24,000
so what's going on right now uh well

00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,919
good question based on the objectives

00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,919
we need to ensure that kobold is seen in

00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:29,840
a positive light to anyone asking about

00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:32,480
it and that value

00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:34,080
should be clear and that a path to

00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:38,559
ensuring enough people

00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:39,840
can still code is also clear

00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:42,240
now to that end we have a few

00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:45,039
initiatives underway to help establish

00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,880
uh a point of view based on the truth

00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:49,200
that our members agree with

00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,559
and to use that to underline cowell's

00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,520
value

00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:55,520
as far and wide as is appropriate so we

00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:58,320
want to act as proponents for the

00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:01,520
language to help set the record straight

00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:04,159
and to offer guidelines for those who

00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:06,240
seek to learn more about cobol and

00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:07,760
indeed to learn the language itself

00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,559
so to do that there's some research

00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:14,559
activities promotional work was starting

00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:15,200
just now uh quantify how much cobala is

00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:18,159
in use

00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,840
publish reports that indicate a positive

00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:22,000
reflection of cobalt

00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,520
define and publish the group's view on

00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,280
the language

00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,880
and establish some sort of presence

00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:29,440
somewhere presence

00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,640
to articulate that now there's a lot of

00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,039
work to do so

00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:35,919
any positive discussion about cobol any

00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:37,200
any single point of positive influence

00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:39,039
gives us

00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,120
one more reason to look positively to

00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:42,000
the future and the more of us that are

00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:45,039
doing that

00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,039
the better it will be

00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:51,039
now if you want to net all that out

00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:52,080
our point of view in a nutshell about

00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:53,520
cobalt is something

00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:56,320
you know that could easily be shared

00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:58,159
with others and and and i think

00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:00,320
it is a very straightforward story to

00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:02,960
tell

00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:05,520
the world needs computer systems to run

00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:09,039
economies to run government

00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:11,200
coble was designed to do just that

00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:12,720
and it does that really really well

00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,880
peerlessly

00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,159
furthermore and i think the group would

00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,080
contain that

00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:19,279
the age of something in it terms at

00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:22,640
least is a metric

00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:25,679
of value not lack of value

00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:28,559
electronics don't rust away

00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:30,159
applications don't rust these

00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:30,720
applications are as good as they ever

00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:34,320
were

00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:37,360
and because their cobalt can be adapted

00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:39,520
to support future need so

00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:41,520
betty frieden's quote here is also very

00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:45,279
apt

00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:48,320
age is actually an opportunity

00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:49,919
and the number well that's to remind you

00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,960
again that the percentage of cobalt

00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:53,279
professionals who see

00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:55,039
those cobalt applications as strategic

00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:58,240
to their business

00:24:55,039 --> 00:25:01,039
is a whopping 92 percent

00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:03,039
it's basically a rounding error complete

00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:05,440
unanimous vote

00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:07,360
so it's going to stick around because it

00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,880
needs to

00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,720
but this is a story that needs to be

00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:13,760
articulated further

00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,240
and wider and whenever there is any

00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,320
doubt

00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,480
or any misinformation about cobalt and

00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:20,320
there still is

00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,480
that's when that story needs to be told

00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:26,799
which is of course

00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:29,679
where you come in so getting involved

00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:31,120
well in my view 70 in our group is great

00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:32,799
but i think it's only scratching the

00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,080
surface and if you look at the facebook

00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:37,360
cobol programmers

00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:39,039
group 16 000 and growing i think we

00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:41,520
should be aiming quite high too

00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:43,279
don't you so i would be astonished if

00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,520
anyone in this session today is not

00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:47,520
actively using cobalt either in-house or

00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:51,279
is directly impacted it

00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:52,799
by it in other terms of text strategy

00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:55,679
integration

00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:56,159
application modernization skills or

00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,000
training

00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:59,520
or other core initiatives that you may

00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,200
be working on

00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:03,200
so it's your chance to influence the

00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,279
community right here

00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,720
and if you have a view on cobol please

00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:09,039
share it with us

00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:11,360
we'd love to hear it we'd love you to

00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:13,679
join us to share that

00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:15,600
information with the team all

00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:18,799
perspectives and backgrounds

00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,799
of course are welcome

00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:25,360
now i'll leave you with a few suggested

00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,400
reading references

00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:31,200
recent positive commentary

00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:33,039
about cobol from the it press as well as

00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,720
at the top of this list a really good

00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:37,760
article from our friends over at

00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:40,000
share these

00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:41,520
are perhaps a great way to take the next

00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,720
step into

00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:47,360
our collective appreciation of this most

00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:49,440
legendary of technologies

00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:51,520
but one that's still fairly

00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:54,080
misunderstood in some corners

00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:57,279
and it's our job to you know take that

00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:59,600
message back out to the it world

00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:01,919
and with that thank you for your time

00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:04,840
enjoy the rest of the summit

00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:21,840
and we'll now drop out to the q a

00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:21,840
