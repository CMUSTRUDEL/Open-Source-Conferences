00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,800
about their

00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,879
work around open source and the

00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,199
mainframe

00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,879
so we've hit a big milestone this year

00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:00,000
in the open mainframe project

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:02,000
five years old 2015 back at linuxcon

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,119
seattle this project was launched

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,159
and in that time the project has

00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:09,119
really become the blossom we've seen a

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,720
number of new

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,240
collaborative efforts that have came

00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,880
under this project

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,840
zoe launched in 2018 and a number of new

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,080
projects that

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,600
have flooded um into the project after

00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,600
there in 2019

00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,960
but i say one of the things that really

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,200
has been um

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,320
a big thing for me is i've seen this

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,479
project grow

00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:31,119
is our mentorship program that was one

00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:33,840
of the first things that we kicked off

00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:35,680
back when the project launched and i was

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,119
able to meet the first class of mentees

00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,280
back in 2016

00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:40,240
and share atlanta and it was really a

00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,280
cool experience

00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:46,159
these were students that were excited

00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,159
to be at an event like this excited of

00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,840
the technical work they have done

00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,759
um excited their careers ahead and

00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,360
excited about mainframe and i've been

00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,040
fortunate to meet each of the classes

00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,799
since then and all of them share that

00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:00,399
same enthusiasm

00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:01,360
for this platform we've also seen a

00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,200
really big growth

00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,360
in just open source in the mainframe on

00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,520
that time and and this is the

00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,679
open mainframe landscape which looks to

00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,560
track open source in the mainframe and

00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:14,400
the key projects the key vendors the key

00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,239
technologies that around it

00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,879
you can definitely check this out at

00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:22,080
landscape.openmainframeproject.org

00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,879
but this is really a really great

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,599
synopsis

00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:27,599
of what we're seeing as the enthusiasm

00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:30,720
and the energy that is driving around

00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:34,160
open source on this platform

00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:37,280
so 2020 it has been an interesting year

00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,040
for sure the coveted crisis has impacted

00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,599
us all in one way or another

00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,239
either loved ones who have been sick or

00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:45,120
died

00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:47,440
due to it the financial distress and the

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,360
other upheavals of our daily lives that

00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,200
have been caused

00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,720
kids at home more than they were

00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,640
normally i have four kids they're

00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,840
downstairs right now on zoom meetings

00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,640
hopefully you don't hear them in the

00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,239
background in this keynote but

00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,920
the one thing that's always impressed me

00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,640
about the mainframe community

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,280
is it pulls together at times like this

00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,360
and

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,720
they have in for one another they have

00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,200
each other's back

00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,360
so even if a year like this is a year of

00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,519
challenge which it it certainly has

00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,720
the mainframe community it's always

00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,959
there to deliver

00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,560
and today i just want to touch on a few

00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,440
of those areas of things that i have

00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,599
seen

00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,040
that have just really showcased really

00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,440
where the future of this community is

00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,360
going

00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,680
along with a few little announcements

00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,879
along the way

00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,720
so diversity is a really important topic

00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:37,040
especially in our times here of what

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,840
we've seen in our social

00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,640
world here over the last few months and

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:45,599
from a linux foundation perspective

00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,879
having diversity in our projects our

00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,239
efforts our communities

00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,640
are the ways that we drive better

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:53,920
results in the end we we get more

00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:57,040
opinions we get greater outcomes

00:03:53,920 --> 00:04:00,480
and time and time again this is proven

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:02,400
this picture here was from share

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,760
phoenix back last year and it was the

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,920
first time that

00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,599
uh cher in conjunction with open

00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,319
mainframe project we brought this to

00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:10,400
them

00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,439
where we were able to really celebrate

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,879
the women that were in

00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,879
mainframe and really bring them all

00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:17,280
together and we've seen this

00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:19,280
event start to spot continue um in

00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:23,040
pittsburgh and then also in fort worth

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:26,000
uh earlier this year we really see

00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,120
diversity whether it's across gender

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,440
whether it's across

00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,400
age whether it's across background as a

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,280
critical part

00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,639
of where our society needs to go but

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,400
also is a critical part of where our

00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,440
community's success are

00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,040
and we even from a project perspective

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,199
want to make sure that we're showing a

00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:46,720
good stewardship of that as well

00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:49,440
these women here can prose

00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,479
35 of our open mainframe project

00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,320
leadership whether

00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,600
from a governing board technical

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:57,040
advisory council

00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,639
outreach committee or our staff and

00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,240
this is where we willing to show the

00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,080
community um

00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,560
our best practice we want to show the

00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,160
community what we see is right out there

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,840
um this isn't the best number in the

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,080
world we have a ways to go

00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:13,120
but it shows really our commitment to

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,880
making sure the diverse voices are heard

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,880
and that that is brought into the

00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:22,080
forefront of the conversations we have

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:25,280
so some of you might remember um

00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:28,160
earlier in the covid crisis here many of

00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:30,080
our internal many many of our systems

00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,759
by state and local governments were

00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,039
under a lot of pressure

00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:37,039
uh record unemployment claims record uh

00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,080
jobless claims we're certainly putting a

00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,400
lot of other pressure

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,680
on our into our systems that you know

00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,960
power our government and other

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,120
institutions

00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,400
and this one here really caught to the

00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,560
forefront here when the new jersey

00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,280
governor said hey we need volunteers to

00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,600
help

00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,120
um you know with some cobalt systems we

00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,440
have that are just being beat up right

00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,800
now

00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:58,800
over this unemployment situation now

00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,960
what i was really most impressed about

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,639
where this whole situation was

00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,240
is you know on one hand one could get

00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,639
really upset to hear

00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,039
you know when's technology called out

00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,720
but instead this community came together

00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:12,240
and it said you know what we're going to

00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,880
step in here and help we're going to

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,639
make a difference here to pull together

00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:20,160
to drive a greater outcome

00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:23,360
and with that the response was

00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,639
you know not only developing out a co a

00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,479
programming course

00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,319
for students that are learning cobol for

00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,120
the first time and using modern tools to

00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,840
do so

00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,880
but also making a call to the community

00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,400
and saying

00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,240
if you're a cobalt programmer if you're

00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,160
cobalt talent and you're available

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,520
can you step forward and volunteer or be

00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,400
available for hire

00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,319
and we saw so many people 1700 more than

00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,680
1700 people as you can see on the screen

00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,000
there

00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,160
to date have stepped up and said i can

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,599
be available for this

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,440
and this wasn't just people at the end

00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:55,599
of their career this was people

00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,639
that are young old middle career

00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:59,680
beginning of career

00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:03,199
end of career men women people from all

00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,960
nationalities all backgrounds it was

00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,800
really really impressive to see this

00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,880
community come together

00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,120
and with that also today we have

00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,360
announced a cobalt working group

00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,720
which is really looking at the future of

00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,360
the cobalt ecosystem

00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,280
especially focused on mainframe and

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,400
looking at how do we carry this forward

00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,479
how do we make sure that there's a

00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,199
strong cobol community to come

00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,919
and there's a talk in this conference

00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,120
here

00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:29,120
on the cobalt working group and i

00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,840
encourage you to go check it out during

00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,840
the time

00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,360
the zoe community has also really

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,800
continued to grow and

00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,319
you're going to hear a lot about zoe so

00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,880
i don't want to spend a ton of time on

00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,800
this

00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,919
but there are two big things that really

00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,840
stuck out to me

00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:48,000
as i looked at one is

00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,080
how much development activity has

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,120
happened with zoe within the last year

00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:56,400
over five million lines of code changed

00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,080
with over 11 000 commits from over 150

00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,240
different contributors

00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,160
that's massive that's showing a healthy

00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,759
community coming together

00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:07,840
and driving forward and producing a

00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,800
truly innovative piece of technology for

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,160
the mainframe

00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,160
and when you see a community coming

00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,039
together like that that's when the

00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,479
downstream

00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:16,160
starts to appear and that's when you

00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:18,960
start to see that commercial use

00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,960
and the adopters and the zoe conform

00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,960
program was established last year

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,000
as a way to help recognize those

00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,720
solutions

00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,879
with broadcom ibm phoenix software and

00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,360
rocket software being the initial

00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,080
vendors in that space today we're here

00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,039
to announce

00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,599
software engineering has also joined and

00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,760
is now

00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:41,440
having a zoe conformance solution as

00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:45,120
well so we're really excited about that

00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:47,600
and the new projects they keep on coming

00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,200
we've announced the cobalt working group

00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,519
earlier this year

00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,560
but we are also announcing four other

00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,680
new projects

00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:57,760
as well an education focused project for

00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,920
additional education materials around

00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:02,399
mainframe and open source

00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,040
geneva ers a single pass optimization

00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,600
engine

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,279
a software discovery tool to help people

00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,640
understand the open source

00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:10,720
broad open source that works on the

00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,160
mainframe and one that i'm particularly

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,920
excited about is cbt

00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,279
tape and if you've been around the

00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,279
mainframe for a long time that's a

00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:20,160
project you may be familiar with

00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:23,360
it's roots traced back all the way to

00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:26,640
the 1950s in the early days of share

00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:28,480
when mainframe operators and engineers

00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,920
would come together and literally share

00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,839
code together

00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,320
these pieces all collaborating came

00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:37,040
together in 1975 and became part of a

00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,720
canonical tape that was released

00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,560
basically is open source before really

00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,360
open source and free software or even a

00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,800
thing

00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,839
they were releasing this and they've

00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:47,680
continued to release this since 1975.

00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,120
i got some great letters from sam golov

00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,640
he shared with me of people in the early

00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,519
days that requested this and here you

00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,959
can see

00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,959
from the department of commerce and the

00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,560
postal service they you know before when

00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,720
you couldn't do a pull request

00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,000
or download you had to send a letter to

00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,120
them in the mail and they'd send you a

00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,760
tape back

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,760
it's a really really cool port piece of

00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,920
not only mainframe history here but open

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,360
source history and that community has

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,279
entrusted the open source

00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,440
the open mainframe project to take them

00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,160
forward into the decades to come and we

00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,200
we couldn't be

00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:20,240
happier to be a steward for them

00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,440
so something i'm always asked is

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,600
what does the open mainframe project

00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,120
look like how do we compare as we look

00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,000
at other foundations

00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,680
within the linux foundation and a term

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,920
we use here is called umbrella which

00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,120
means it's a project that hosts multiple

00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,640
projects within it

00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,880
and the idea is those projects

00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,640
interoperate and they have a broad

00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:41,440
already community connection

00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:43,120
these are some of our leading umbrellas

00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,680
that we have here at the open mainframe

00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,000
project

00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,680
and you can see on the far side cncf

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,760
openjs they're definitely the outliers

00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,399
there's huge broad communities going on

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,720
there

00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,600
but if you look at open mainframe smack

00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,399
dab in the middle

00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,240
of efforts such as hyperledger and lfai

00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:01,040
and lf edge and networking and

00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:03,120
energy and aswf open mainframe project

00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:06,000
is really a true umbrella now

00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,680
and you'll hear from jim zemlin a little

00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,800
in the next talk after this

00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,200
and he'll kind of talk a little bit

00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,800
about some of the relations between

00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,839
open mainframe project and the rest of

00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,839
the linux foundation

00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,839
new members are the way that stewardship

00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:22,720
in this community in this project

00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,279
and the work of projects is able to

00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,480
happen

00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:28,399
and in 2020 we had several new companies

00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,399
step forward and be those stewards

00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,399
we announced earlier this year yadro and

00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:35,120
software engineering

00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,839
both joined the open mainframe project

00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,760
and today

00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,920
we are super excited to announce

00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,839
microfocus has stepped forward

00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,040
and is also joining the open mainframe

00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:46,240
project

00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:48,160
these projects these members here see

00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,560
the future of open source in the

00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:53,200
mainframe and they are the stewards

00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,000
to driving this industry forward and we

00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,040
thank them

00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,639
for their support

00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,160
so we have a number of great keynotes

00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,519
coming up today we have jim zemlin

00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,800
coming right after me

00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:06,000
uh we have greg laco ross mori and milan

00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,920
shetty

00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,760
following up there and talking a lot of

00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,880
thought leadership around open source

00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,320
and mainframe

00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,000
and then the morning wraps up with kate

00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,880
stewart talking about software

00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,480
transparency and dependability a really

00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,079
important topic for many of you

00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,680
who are part of organizations just

00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:23,040
coming into open source for the first

00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,920
time

00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:27,279
