Description: 
	Keynote: Building Upon Zowe: How Rocket is Building Commercial Software for Zowe Users - Haseeb Jawad, Director, Product Management & Sean Grady, Senior Software Architect, Rocket Software 

Open source platforms like Zowe enable commercial and open software and services that support, enhance, and bolster the platform. As one of the core members of the OMP, Rocket both supports the open side of Zowe, and plans to adapt our commercial solutions for this platform. The first of these is BlueZone, our leading terminal emulation solution. In this talk, weâ€™ll discuss both the business decisions and the technical effort of making BlueZone available on Zowe.

hello everyone uh this is sean grady uh

00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:06,319
i'm

00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:07,040
a senior software architect at rocket

00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:10,080
and i

00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:13,200
frequently contribute to zoe and

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,360
we also have sib jawad with us also from

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,160
rocket he's a director of product

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,400
management

00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,160
and we're actually going to show

00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,600
something exciting to you today

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,800
about how we are helping to build up the

00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,199
zoe ecosystem

00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,960
with some commercial software from

00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:32,000
rocket

00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,920
about uh terminal emulation so

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,440
why don't we jump into it and i'll show

00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,800
you a little bit about

00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,079
uh zoe whether you're familiar with zoe

00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,040
or new to it

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,200
uh this is a brief refresher so

00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,559
basically uh two years ago we started

00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,000
the zoe project

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:53,199
and uh the idea was to build a zos

00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,280
framework for the modern age uh

00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:56,640
a lot of us mainframe users came

00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,039
together and said well

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,559
what what can we do to make this a user

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:04,000
experience

00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:06,880
uh better for us and uh

00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,840
everyone who's coming into the mainframe

00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,720
so

00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,200
what we started with with was making it

00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,840
open

00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,040
we figured that by making a open source

00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,080
framework

00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:21,360
that everyone would have their say

00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,080
and people can have feedback on how

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,119
we're doing

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:28,479
and really be involved in the process so

00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:30,000
um if you haven't gotten involved in zoe

00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:32,640
and you want to

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,159
uh you know zoe.org is the place to find

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,360
out much more than i can say on this

00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,520
call here

00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,439
but the idea is that we think through

00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,400
openness that we're going to make the

00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,640
best framework

00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,680
possible now the thing about the

00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,000
mainframe is

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,399
there's various things that you want to

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,439
do and so what you'll see here

00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,479
is that as we move towards the bottom of

00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,799
the chart

00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,240
we see that there are different user

00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,759
experiences for different

00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,640
users we have an ide for development on

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,360
the mainframe

00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,200
a cli that can be used for automation

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,920
doing things like code analysis

00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,399
on mainframe code and finally we have

00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,920
the web

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,720
desktop which is uh sort of the missing

00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,000
desktop

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:19,040
that we wished the mainframe had

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,160
and how we do so with the web desktop

00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:24,480
the big idea is that it looks and acts

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,920
just like a traditional you know windows

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,040
or mac desktop

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,800
but it's in the browser and

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,560
allows you to access all of your

00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,400
mainframe data in

00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:39,920
familiar and intuitive ways

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:42,720
now all of these features and

00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,840
components of zoe are pluggable and

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,959
that's really the key

00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:50,160
here that that allows rocket

00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:53,280
to make very interesting

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:56,080
and rich programs on top of zoe so

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,519
uh in the web desktop we have plugins

00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,959
and the ide cli

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:05,280
everywhere it allows us to add

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:08,480
features that extend beyond the base

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,400
uh you know zoe is much like uh an

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,760
ecosystem that you might find on windows

00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,680
or mac where

00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,599
there's uh there's only so much that can

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,440
come out of the box and so plugins are

00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,000
the answer to getting all the features

00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,599
that you really

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,720
need now i'd also like to point out

00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:26,640
uh that everything that you see here

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,560
that the model is really

00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,040
a hybrid cloud model and that the

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:34,760
mainframe is still the center

00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:39,440
of the universe and zoe but we use

00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:42,480
microservices and the network layer to

00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:44,319
push that information outward to

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,879
the devices that people interact with

00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:50,159
today be it you know laptops

00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:53,120
or browsers

00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:54,799
and that allows people to really

00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,599
interact with the mainframe in ways that

00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,599
are natural to them

00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:05,280
so um when it comes to plug-ins

00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,720
uh the the idea here is the more the

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,680
merrier and

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,720
um you know zoe comes with some plug-ins

00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,840
of its own

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,920
but uh these are really just the basics

00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,239
just the everyday tasks that you need to

00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,519
do

00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:21,759
on the mainframe but you know there's a

00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,680
lot of complex problems that that people

00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,880
need to do in their day-to-day job

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:29,520
and zoe can't solve it all by

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,400
itself this is where the plugins come in

00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,240
so

00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,919
we believe that commercial plugins are

00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,440
really critical to zoe because they

00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:38,080
allow

00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,120
the users to have their complex problems

00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,520
solved

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,479
and in particular what we're going to be

00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,960
talking about

00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,919
is a product from rocket called blue

00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,600
zone web

00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,120
that deals with the problem of terminal

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,280
emulation and

00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,280
you know this is a really common

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,600
challenge on the mainframe everyone

00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,240
needs their 3270 terminal

00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,000
but there's endless features and options

00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,800
that every every shop is a little bit

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
different

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:07,360
and it's it's a hard problem to

00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,800
solve adequately in something like

00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:14,240
zoe so instead

00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,080
we're leveraging you know our vendors to

00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,440
provide us commercial solutions

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,160
and this is what we're going to see in

00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,160
blue zone web

00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,160
thank you sean as sean mentioned zoe is

00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,880
the first

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,240
open source project for the ibm zos

00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,720
operating system

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,520
which delivers a modern browser-based

00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,080
gui

00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,759
and services architecture to the ibm z

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,080
platform

00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,960
as one of the core members of the linux

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,919
foundation's

00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:44,240
open mainframe project rocket both

00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:46,720
supports the open side of zoe

00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:49,440
and plans to adapt our commercial

00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,600
solutions for this platform

00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,639
the first of these is rocket blue zone

00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,639
web

00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:59,360
our leading terminal emulation solution

00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,400
rocket blue zone has long provided

00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,319
connectivity

00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:07,520
speed and ease of use between pcs

00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:09,199
and backend systems such as ibm z and

00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,840
rbmi

00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,280
there is a desktop and a web version of

00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,759
rocket bluezone

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,560
but until now there was no terminal

00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,919
emulator

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,759
available for zoe market leaving users

00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:25,039
to leverage several applications

00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,400
and cumbersome workarounds this blue

00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:29,280
zone web plugin

00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,280
is the first commercial enterprise class

00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:34,240
terminal emulator plugin

00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:36,400
to run within zoe platform and it is

00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:41,039
compatible with very long term support

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:42,080
version 1.9 rocket blues on web for zoe

00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:45,440
is a certified

00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:49,039
zoe version 1 app framework framework

00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:52,160
application which aims to give users the

00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:55,360
confidence that when they use a product

00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:57,759
or an application that leverages zui

00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,319
they can expect a high level of common

00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:03,599
functionality

00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:05,759
interoperability and user experience

00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,759
blues on web plugin is a secure

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,800
browser-based terminal emulator

00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:12,720
that lives within the zoe platform and

00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,160
it shows our commitment to the open

00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,120
mainframe project

00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,960
where rocket blues on web enables users

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,919
to connect to the host mainframe

00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,400
remotely

00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:23,919
and is a lot better than the embedded

00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:28,479
terminal emulator

00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:30,400
that comes free with zoe as an example

00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:33,120
it provides superior configuration

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:35,360
options for macros and settings

00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,440
enabling users to feel right at home

00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,280
within the emulation environment

00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:43,039
which is not available with a free

00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:46,000
terminal emulator embedded in zoe

00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,720
the blue zone web zoe plug-in is shipped

00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,840
together

00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:52,160
with blue zone web ga package where

00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,879
customers can either deploy blues on web

00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:58,560
as a standalone web application

00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,199
or a zoe plugin providing a consistent

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,879
experience

00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,879
no matter how you use it

00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,440
now i would like to show you some of the

00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,280
enhancements that this plugin brings

00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,240
that the embedded free terminal emulator

00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:14,080
in zoe does not provide

00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,879
with script recording you have the
