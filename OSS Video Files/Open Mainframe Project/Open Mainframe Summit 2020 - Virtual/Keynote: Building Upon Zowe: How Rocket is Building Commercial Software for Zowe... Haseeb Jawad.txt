Open source platforms like Zowe enable commercial and open software and services that support, enhance, and bolster the platform. As one of the core members of the OMP, Rocket both supports the open side of Zowe, and plans to adapt our commercial solutions for this platform. The first of these is BlueZone, our leading terminal emulation solution. In this talk, weâ€™ll discuss both the business decisions and the technical effort of making BlueZone available on Zowe.
