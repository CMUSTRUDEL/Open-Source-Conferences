	Lightning Talk: How Zowe and Open Source Made Me Talk to the Mainframe (literally) - Yongkook (Alex) Kim, Vicom Infinity

We are living in a world of many smart technologies. Almost 1 out of every 4 grown up in US own smart speakers such as Alexa and Google Assistant. While it's fascinating to use it for personal questions, what other ways can we use voice technology at enterprise work space? Started with Zowe, Yongkook shares how Vicom Infinity Voice Assistant (VIVA) has been using open source efforts to enable connecting with the mainframe, securely.

hi uh and hello thank you for joining

00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,120
in this lightning talk today i am alex

00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,200
king from my

00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,120
viking infinity i'm so excited to be

00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,280
here today

00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,120
next 10 minutes or so i'll talk about

00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,440
following topics first

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,800
i want to show you what it means by talk

00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,240
to the mainframe

00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,000
you might have guess it's a voice

00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,720
assistant

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,279
but it's not alexa with google devices

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,439
second

00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:30,720
i want to share some of the open source

00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:34,000
apis available for zoe including

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,760
ongoing projects like zebra under oap

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
mentorship program

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,760
i'll do some quasi-life demo because

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,640
this is recorded

00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,160
and share some of the things that you

00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,360
can try yourself

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,360
for free as well

00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:53,440
so how can you talk to the mainframe

00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,920
by coming infinity made a secure voice

00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,559
assistant called viva

00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,840
based on ibm wesson and hypercontext

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,680
services

00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,879
it is how you can talk to the mainframe

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,199
securely

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,799
there's good chance that you are

00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:09,840
currently using alexa

00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:12,720
or google assistant at your home

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,000
voice interface is getting so popular

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,880
and before we know

00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,840
it will come to the enterprise space

00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:22,880
another way of user interface

00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,840
the problem is the consumer devices like

00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,960
alexa

00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,640
and google home is the

00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,560
the way they communicate is based on

00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,040
public cloud services

00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,240
the enterprise users probably are not

00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,439
going to have 100

00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:40,479
control over what is being stored

00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:43,600
in the cloud such as your voice

00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:44,880
being stored you can delete it the text

00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,680
still

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,880
lives there forever and the conversation

00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,280
too

00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,560
viva offers end-to-end secure voice

00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,640
interface

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,640
and very strong encryption supported by

00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,680
ibm hyper protect services

00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,719
and you have 100 control of

00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:05,280
your conversations let's take

00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:06,840
let's take a look at how viva used joey

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,840
and other open source

00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,840
projects

00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,120
thanks to joe and chester and colin

00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,520
stone from ibm

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,959
with the open main current project zoe i

00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:21,040
was able to use cpu

00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:22,720
uses api through api services in italy

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,520
it will show you different processing

00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:28,160
utilizations and performance numbers

00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,440
very easy way this can be very helpful

00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,160
if you want to monitor

00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,239
your z-service utilization anywhere and

00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,480
anytime without any complex tools you

00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,879
can use browsers too

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,519
please visit the github link below for

00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:44,160
more information

00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,239
and this is how viva works with the zoe

00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,640
apis

00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,400
first create a web service that engaging

00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,120
watson assistant skill

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,040
and deploy the lack of services with nlp

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,239
services on the hyper protect virtual

00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,120
server

00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,400
if you need strong authentication

00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,280
private key

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,640
is the intent verification services that

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,879
we can use

00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,400
this will enable any conversation

00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:11,200
accessible to

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,200
only allowed personnel in the enterprise

00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,680
using biometrics

00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,959
an output service routines can be served

00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,040
multiple channels through

00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,280
eva harper or what's an assistant

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,840
chatbot or slack twilio

00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:27,200
etc i will show some of the demos at the

00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,200
end for this example too

00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,000
now i want to show you the latest

00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:35,120
integration with viva called zebra

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,400
uh zoe embedded browser for our math and

00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,920
apis

00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,040
zoe is part zebra is part of 2020 omp

00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,159
mentorship program

00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:47,200
and our summer intern is solizoli

00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,680
from nigeria saliso is a former regional

00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,400
winner

00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,640
of masters of mainframe contests and

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,920
very very talented medical students he

00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,000
worked very hard

00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,040
during this summer to develop zebra with

00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,519
me

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,239
you can see more information of zebra

00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,879
from

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:05,200
omp mainframe project internship hit in

00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:07,519
the below

00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,959
zebra takes very simple approach to

00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,840
convert rms

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:14,319
our map.xml report from zos into json

00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,519
format using node.js

00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:19,040
since json format is very widely used in

00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,720
open source project

00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,320
we thought that it could be very useful

00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,880
to many developers

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,639
and end users to integrate with other

00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,720
softwares like mongodb

00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,440
and kafka and any other analytics

00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,440
graphics tools

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,199
without going into too much detail i

00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:38,880
want to show that developer can use

00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:40,720
zebra api through zoe api services

00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,400
at the time of the recording this we

00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,120
only have four apis

00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,479
from our method three into api mediation

00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,800
layer

00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:50,880
zebra has many aromatic reports such as

00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,639
history historical reports like the

00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,040
post-processing report

00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,000
and real-time data that will be

00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:00,080
integrated

00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,080
into zoe akf services so

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:07,440
here are examples of zebra api through

00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,440
zoe api services

00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,880
and this is a great example of how you

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,960
can use

00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:17,199
zebra data formatted rmf data

00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,639
graphana is a popular open source

00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,880
graphic tool

00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,000
that is perfect for processing rmf data

00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,720
points

00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,199
in this example we use mongodb and

00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,759
primitives to store and plug in data

00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,479
into

00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,600
grafana you can use graphana to show

00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,919
real-time data

00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,720
historical data and send you an alert

00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:37,759
through email

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:40,800
slack and smf and many other ways

00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:45,120
i will show you how i use this to send

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,120
report by voice command next

00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,639
so here's a report uh in a real time

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:54,479
report that

00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:55,919
we are showing for zebra to graphana you

00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:58,639
can see here

00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:01,199
you can zoom into specific time and you

00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:04,240
can have a different format of the data

00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:08,080
into graphics you can choose

00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,199
uh which graphics to show and it's very

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,720
easy and very

00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:16,240
um easy to integrate and use in

00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:18,960
in all these examples will be

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,440
in the github under omp mentorship

00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,919
program

00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,039
so make sure you check it out when you

00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:25,360
get a chance and

00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:27,600
we'll have any questions answered if you

00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,600
need

00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,240
so it's a demo time i'll try to show

00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,919
three different cases of viva

00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,560
but the last one is something you can

00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:38,400
try yourself later too

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,160
first i want to show you how viva is

00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:43,199
using

00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,319
3 apis and other system api such as

00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:48,800
zebra

00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:51,680
hey dj what is the current cpu

00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,680
utilization

00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,960
the current cpu utilization as cpu is

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,400
four percent

00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:06,639
hey tj

00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,639
how much storage space is available

00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,000
the current storage systems available

00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:19,520
space is 30.37

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,840
gigabytes now i want to

00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,039
share my phone screen so that i can

00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,160
share

00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:30,960
um the text messages i'm getting

00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:35,759
so hey tj

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,759
send me an elfpar report for two hours

00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:50,400
the requested message has been sent so

00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,400
the viva will contact twilio and getting

00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:56,080
the text messages

00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:59,120
and graphs from um graffana

00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,720
you can see here it's a midnight

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,639
actually after midnight

00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,360
so you can see those graphs with alpha

00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:07,280
utilizes reports

00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,039
the second demo i want to show now is

00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:12,240
about how we can make

00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:13,120
this voice user interface with the voice

00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,160
assistant

00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:18,560
more secure in the enterprise space

00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,800
the case i want to show you is uh in a

00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,199
hospital a doctor comes into the

00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:26,080
patient's room and he wants to check the

00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:31,120
patient's blood pressure charts

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:32,000
hey tj log me into medical mode with the

00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,880
login id

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,880
dr jones

00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,519
you need to authenticate this request

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,039
using private key you see the pop-up

00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,959
