to lenny lenny take it away

00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:49,760
hello hello the open mainframe project

00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,160
community my name is lenny i am part of

00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,039
the

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,239
zoe web ui development team and the

00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,559
purpose of this demo

00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,640
is to showcase a little bit about what

00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:00,800
the zoe desktop is

00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,160
what are some of our core apps and what

00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,040
it means to the

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,040
mainframe industry and open source

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,360
community

00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,960
there will be many of you here who know

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,640
what zoe is

00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,360
and i'll try to be respectful with your

00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:18,320
time but for those folks who don't

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,680
zoe is an integrated and extensible open

00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,600
source framework for

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,640
z os zoe like mac os or windows for

00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,000
example

00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:30,799
comes with a set of apis and

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,680
os capabilities out of the box with

00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:36,079
applications built in

00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,520
so as the mainframe industry continues

00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:40,000
to mature

00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,280
it becomes difficult to maintain the

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,720
same levels of

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,680
system admins and architectures zoe's

00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,479
goal

00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,079
is to offer a modern interface to

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,200
interact with zos

00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:56,960
similar to what one could experience on

00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,520
cloud platforms today so a good question

00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,799
may be

00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,399
who are the intended users well one of

00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,119
those users is me

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,960
right i'm not a mainframe expert and i

00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:09,360
lack the years of experience in this

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,959
industry to know the ins and outs

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:15,520
of ispf or you know tso

00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,760
commands like the back of my hand i

00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,319
certainly can't program in rex

00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,680
right let's be honest who's this

00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:25,200
mumbling buffoon

00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,680
up on the main stage talking about z

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,040
but i do know web development i know

00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,599
rest apis

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,519
right i know open source and i can work

00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:37,120
with the tools and environments

00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:39,360
that modern programming has to offer me

00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,239
and that means together we can bring z

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:45,519
os to the center stage for newcomers

00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:49,360
decrease costs and drive adoption

00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,879
for the future zoe's also intended for

00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,400
experienced admins

00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:55,519
and system programmers too not everyone

00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,159
wants change

00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,920
and that's okay but zoe's mission is

00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:02,239
about keeping what works

00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,000
and extending it as well as adding

00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,959
completely new features

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,319
which will power uh you know the health

00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,599
care agencies

00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:14,959
banks insurance companies

00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:17,920
governments and every other major

00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,959
uh data centered industry for decades to

00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,519
come

00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,800
zoe is a growing community and consists

00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,640
of more components

00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,920
than just the desktop we'll discuss

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,840
today

00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,400
but if you're at all interested i would

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,120
highly recommend visiting zoey.org

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,239
and checking out our many community

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,360
channels like

00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:39,840
slack for example

00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,599
so we know what zoe is about right but

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,360
how in the world is it accomplishing the

00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,840
things that i've said

00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:49,200
well the desktop provides a web ui

00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:51,599
containing a number of apps and features

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,400
with functions which make z os more

00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,959
accessible

00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,840
and intuitive for today we'll be

00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,799
discussing four

00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,280
apps that come with base zoe including

00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,599
the zoe editor which is an ide

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,720
like experience for interacting with

00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:07,840
files and data sets

00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:10,640
on the mainframe the jazz explorer an

00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,920
application used to view and work with

00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,200
jobs

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:18,239
third the 3270 terminal

00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,320
which emulates the functions of an ibm

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:23,360
3270 machine

00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,800
and finally the vt terminal a mainframe

00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,800
emulator for

00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,840
ssh and telnet we may have a few

00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,080
questions already

00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,840
and i will love your questions but

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,720
please feel free to wait until after the

00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,680
demo

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:40,560
just so we have time to showcase some of

00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:45,680
the cool things i would like to show

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,680
so let's begin by logging in

00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,639
from the start we are greeted with our

00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,199
desktop

00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,560
we see our pinned apps in the bottom

00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,720
left

00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,080
we see desktop utilities in our app tray

00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,800
to the bottom right

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,720
things like notifications which can be

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:12,240
sent in multiple ways

00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,960
i.e by apps to notify the user something

00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,240
important

00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,479
by an administrator to send a message to

00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,039
all

00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:21,039
signed in desktop users in an instance

00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:24,080
etc

00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:26,880
we'll quickly open up a tutorial app and

00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,880
send one now

00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,080
there we go

00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,199
we also have system widgets which

00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:41,120
contain

00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,120
support for changing languages

00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,759
and this list will grow in the future

00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:50,000
changing your tso password

00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:58,080
and of course visually personalizing the

00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:01,199
desktop

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,800
like for example changing element size

00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:07,600
for accessibility

00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:10,960
or say a tablet device

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:15,280
date time etc so

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:16,960
here's my list of installed zoe apps

00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,560
there are many out there these are just

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,600
the ones i had on my

00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:24,160
local setup but

00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,800
beginning with the second app let's

00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,280
launch

00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,280
the editor

00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:34,160
so the editor allows me to view files

00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:37,440
and folders

00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,319
if we right click a folder node we can

00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,919
refresh

00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:48,000
its content we can also change

00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:51,919
its unix permissions on the go

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,919
can set recursive or not

00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,199
we can also expand files and folders

00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,599
and we can view file content

00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:11,680
so for example i have this shell script

00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,680
here

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:18,319
uh so open the languages tab

00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,680
you get syntax highlighting for tons of

00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:23,840
languages

00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,840
and this list is also extensible

00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:31,680
right open the preferences menu

00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,720
and you get editor settings that we can

00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,479
change

00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,840
so we have all the capabilities of a

00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:40,160
modern editor

00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:44,080
right um exhibit a i'll change

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:48,160
the font size maybe uh to make it

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,160
slightly more pleasing for a demo

00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:57,280
um exhibit b i'll use a

00:07:54,240 --> 00:08:01,599
hotkey c alt n there we go

00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,599
to create a new file then we can save

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:08,879
we specify file name and encoding

00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,479
right this is the mainframe after all

00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:14,960
right we specifying codings

00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:14,960
in this part of tap we click save

00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:21,680
looks like it's saved and we can close

00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,680
it

00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:27,840
now we can view the properties of the

00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,840
file that we just saved

00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:41,519
like created time our mode etc

00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:45,200
we can also delete

00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:47,279
and there we go it's gone all right

00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,720
so now let's say you hate this right

00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:51,680
give me my putties

00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,360
give me my ssh terminals there's nothing

00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:57,360
wrong with that

00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,360
this is where the vt terminal comes in

00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:08,240
here we can view our host port and type

00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:12,480
right i will log in as myself

00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,480
and um

00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:23,120
i'll go ahead and view directories

00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:25,920
right and now we have the same context

00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:28,720
but maybe in a way that we are more

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,720
comfortable with

00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,040
i'll go ahead and navigate to a folder

00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,160
that we want to

00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,120
delete maybe

00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:43,440
[Music]

00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,440
see what was it called for andy to

00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:55,120
delete

00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,120
and maybe we'll delete this one

00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:04,560
oh that's right it's a folder it's not a

00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:07,760
file

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,399
and we'll see that change has now been

00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:13,530
updated

00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:15,360
in our editor we can also

00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:19,839
[Music]

00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,839
we also have

00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:28,079
other menu functions in the editor

00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:30,880
we can also we create folders

00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:32,079
let's see we'll create a folder here

00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:35,920
we'll call it

00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:37,279
you know new folder we have a new folder

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,040
here

00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:40,720
we'll go back to our editor we right

00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:44,079
click we refresh

00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:46,720
and there's our new folder um

00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:48,480
we've got a quick search filter for

00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:53,360
example we'll do

00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:57,680
alt p and now we can search

00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:59,200
right so we can we can use hotkeys to

00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:02,560
traverse the tabs

00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,839
right we could also do like we can close

00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,880
all

00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:09,600
we can undo etc right i'm not gonna

00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,040
all all of the uh functionality of a

00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,079
modern editor

00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,640
um and these are all features afforded

00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,800
to us

00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,880
through a modern interface right the

00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,519
editor is a community project

00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,160
and computer uh contributors from all

00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:26,079
over

00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:29,120
add code whether student or organization

00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:32,800
um now on to

00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:36,160
data sets so

00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:43,839
let's search up some jcl

00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:43,839
data sets and their members um

00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:52,320
oh yeah i had a huge list here took a

00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:56,800
little while

00:11:52,320 --> 00:12:00,399
so let's maybe open up this one

00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:02,240
will open up this member and just like

00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:03,760
we saw with uss

00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,320
we can right-click to view its

00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,320
properties

00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:14,320
similar to what we have in uss

00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:16,240
for example this properties view tells

00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:19,200
us the record length

00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,880
uh record format right block size and

00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,880
other data set

00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,000
characteristics right some of which are

00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:27,440
not easily

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,440
accessible in a one-stop shop like this

00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,120
maybe your users aren't completely sure

00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,000
what it means for a data set to be

00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,920
blocked

00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:39,120
right that's fine we have a hyperlink

00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:43,760
that leads us to an ibm

00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,760
help page that can assist with that

00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,399
one one small example but

00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,800
however right as with my previous

00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,880
example let's say you hate this too

00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,839
and that's okay right maybe it's not as

00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,720
feature complete

00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,720
as you would have liked

00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,800
you know it's an ongoing free app and

00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,920
development after all

00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,639
maybe you can do things faster on ispf

00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,880
or at least

00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,480
ispf is what you prefer because that's

00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,519
what you're comfortable with

00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:17,279
and that leads us to our third app the

00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:17,279
tn 3270

00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:24,240
so if we open our settings

00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,240
at the top

00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:31,279
uh similar to vt

00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:34,079
we can view the host the port and other

00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:36,240
settings like the code page

00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,240
so

00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,279
i'll go ahead and log in

00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:49,839
type in my password

00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:58,639
and now we're in ispf so i could for

00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,680
example

00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:05,680
go to 3.4

00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:08,560
to view my data sets

00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:10,399
we'll search the same ones that we

00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,959
searched for

00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,959
in the editor

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,240
right jcl lib

00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:27,600
and then we'll open up the same member

00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,839
so here we have side by side views right

00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:37,040
of different contexts

00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:40,399
that we can interact with uh

00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:43,199
with z data right so i'm not an

00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,800
ispf wizard so i can't showcase all of

00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:47,920
what that has to offer

00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:51,440
but nonetheless we can do it all in our

00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:53,600
tn 3270 app

00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,480
additionally i'd like to showcase some

00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,079
more core

00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:59,360
desktop features so for example when we

00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:02,240
right click an app

00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,560
on the launch bar say the editor a

00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,240
context menu appears

00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:09,920
right we can select properties to view

00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:12,399
the version and the app id

00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,079
uh these can be useful from an

00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:17,680
administration perspective

00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:20,240
for managing zoe apps you know perhaps

00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,440
allotted to a team of engineers right by

00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,399
a manager or

00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:27,279
or it specialist maybe at a bank that

00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:30,560
uses the os

00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:34,480
we also have standalone mode

00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:35,120
uh here we'll do we'll do the tn3270

00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,480
this time

00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:41,839
we'll right click and we'll select open

00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,839
in new browser tab

00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:54,240
so now we have an emulator environment

00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:57,920
that's maybe more comfortable to some

00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:02,079
but still offers the benefits

00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:02,079
of being on the zoe desktop

00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:11,519
so we also have some app to app features

00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:13,440
so i'm going to go back to our desktop

00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,959
and then we're going to exit our full

00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:19,199
screen mode

00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:22,560
because this is in a browser

00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:26,079
and we know what our url is for

00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,079
our desktop

00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,880
let's say we have some ui from the

00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,800
presenting

00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:35,519
blocking it but that's okay you guys can

00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,519
see it probably

00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:42,079
so now if we navigate to our full screen

00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:46,079
app we can see how that ui

00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:50,079
has changed right

00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:53,440
so let's take that a step further

00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:57,120
so for example here we

00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:59,360
have an editor app

00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,560
and then we're going to use app to app

00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:04,319
to say

00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,959
i want to launch a terminal app on top

00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,039
of that

00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,559
and what do we want to launch it with we

00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:12,240
want to launch it with this

00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:19,839
set of data right

00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:19,839
so we'll log in

00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:30,880
and there we have our

00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:36,799
editor app being launched with 3270

00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:36,799
using app to app right we could also do

00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:43,039
let's say if we wanted to open our

00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,039
editor

00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:48,720
but our origin maybe came from a

00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:52,240
hyperlink right maybe a website of yours

00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:55,520
or a product that refers to a file

00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:58,880
in uss so that means we would need

00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:01,360
a url that spawns the editor

00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,720
but also plops us directly into a

00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,600
specific

00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,880
uss path right to open the file that we

00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,120
want to open

00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,400
there are many possibilities here the

00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,400
app to app framework

00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,480
is also extensible right and the

00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:17,919
features that uh

00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,640
we have are growing from from zoe

00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,440
release

00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,440
to release

00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:31,039
so we're going to go ahead

00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:31,039
and navigate back to our desktop

00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:39,919
and for the final app

00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:42,000
of this demo let's try to do some things

00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:44,880
with jobs

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:48,080
right so we'll go ahead and we'll

00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:52,640
navigate back to the editor

00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:52,640
and search for a job that i can run

00:18:54,240 --> 00:19:02,160
i have a very simple one here

00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:05,280
in ts3105.dev

00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:07,570
dot jcl lib

00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,880
there we go we can use our

00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:12,400
[Music]

00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:14,799
our search history right to find things

00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,799
quicker

00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,240
let's open it

00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,640
here's our simple job now using the jcl

00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,240
menu

00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:32,160
i can now click submit and this job

00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:34,720
will get submitted so let's navigate

00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,960
uh to our fourth app that we wanted to

00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,960
show

00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:43,840
sorry which is our jazz explorer along

00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:46,240
with submitting jobs via the editor i

00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:48,880
can also submit a job here

00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,480
so when we open the jazz explorer we are

00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:54,880
greeted with a view

00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:59,600
of my currently filtered jobs

00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:02,000
right so if we click the top left

00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:05,280
for example we can change our filter

00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,000
based on what we need to view

00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:09,840
uh this one is good for me now right

00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,200
i'll

00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:17,520
let's see i'll right click maybe

00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:20,960
a previous job that was running

00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:24,320
um let's see yeah i ran that today

00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:26,480
so we'll click on this one and we will

00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:31,440
right click it

00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:35,840
we are going to select get jcl

00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,840
and we can rerun that job

00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:43,020
it looks like that job with this id has

00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:44,640
been submitted

00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:49,840
[Music]

00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:49,840
9-3 the last two numbers okay

00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:54,080
looks like there it is

00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,640
and there it is our job that we just ran

00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:06,159
at

00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:07,919
11 21. convenient way to keep track of

00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:11,039
time as well that's perfect

00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:14,880
anyhow so if we right click

00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:16,880
we can also download so

00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:20,000
we'll right click this and we can

00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:23,360
download our logs to our desktop

00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,510
right so for viewing later

00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:27,700
and

00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:27,700
[Music]

00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,760
as an admin i can download this log if i

00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:36,000
need to

00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:36,000
or i can purge the job as well

00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,200
purge request succeeded perfect so

00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,520
if the job was running i could also

00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:48,799
right click cancel it

00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:50,000
all of the kind of essentials that you

00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:54,320
need

00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,320
for handling jobs

00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,450
and that about concludes my demo for

00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,559
today

00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:02,960
[Music]

00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:04,400
there are plenty more things that i

00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,600
could show

00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:10,880
we could get into maybe

00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:14,320
some more things on the 3270 side

00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:16,960
on the terminal um

00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:18,000
let's see we we could let's change our

00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,080
language

00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,679
right wouldn't that be interesting if i

00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:24,640
just did the whole presentation in

00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:27,840
chinese for example

00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,840
we'll restart

00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:34,559
etc right we get it so

00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,080
that concludes my demo i'd like to

00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:39,360
formally begin the qa

00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:42,080
section um uh

00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:44,000
the question and answer section zoe

00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,480
offers many more apps that i don't have

00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,480
time

00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,520
to show here but this is where it gets

00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,320
its value

00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,840
right from interested developers users

00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:55,039
and consumers

00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:56,799
so if you have any questions i'll do my

00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:59,039
best to answer them

00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:00,960
uh and if i can't i'll try to reach out

00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,520
to the sources i need to to get you the

00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,000
answer

00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,799
and if we have any time maybe i'll try

00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,240
to show

00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:08,799
more stuff great we do have a couple

00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,480
questions

00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:11,919
sean has been gracious enough to answer

00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,320
some in the background

00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:18,000
um so let's see what are the host

00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:18,000
requirements for the desktop

00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,360
what are the host requirements for the

00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,600
desktop

00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,600
yep

00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,760
um

00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,880
i'm not really sure like what what is

00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,760
the question referring to

00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,960
could the person elaborate i mean we

00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,400
have our host here

00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,159
right we have our host which is

00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:47,360
localhost that's because

00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:48,720
i'm running uh this instance of the zoe

00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:51,279
desktop

00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,480
on my local machine but we could for

00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:55,919
example

00:23:52,480 --> 00:24:00,559
uh run it on z os right maybe

00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:02,799
um one of our systems here at rocket

00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:03,760
so the host would then say something

00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:06,799
like

00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:07,600
you know rs and then the number of our

00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:11,440
system

00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:15,440
you know dot rocket software dot com um

00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,440
let's see we have some in the chat

00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,760
yeah so he answered what what do i need

00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:24,240
to install

00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:24,240
on the os host for the desktop to work

00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,799
right okay yeah that that makes more

00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,679
sense

00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:33,679
i was thinking of something different uh

00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:35,679
yeah the host in this case is windows

00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:39,600
right windows is what i'm on

00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:42,960
um and our supported browsers

00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:45,840
are let's see we have chrome

00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:48,480
we have safari we have edge and we have

00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,480
firefox

00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,960
um

00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:56,240
right like sean added on z os you need

00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:59,200
uss

00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:01,279
some rack f profiles to set up and in

00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,120
most cases the osmf

00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:04,400
that's right yeah so for our

00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:07,520
authentication

00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:09,840
right to log into our desktop uh for

00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:12,159
you know the accounts that we use that's

00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,159
what we

00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:17,520
i'm need up to date with chat here i

00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:20,400
think there's other things

00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,400
give me a moment

00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:29,840
oh wow there's a few messages okay so

00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,279
yeah here's here's a good point that i

00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:38,960
want to point out

00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:42,320
from sean right the desktop that you see

00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:45,279
is in the web browser so

00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:47,360
uh it's not necessary to have a

00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:49,919
client-side installation

00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,880
to use the desktop right that's pretty

00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:54,000
huge

00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:55,120
um what that means is it doesn't have to

00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,679
be

00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,559
um it doesn't have to be hardware

00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:01,120
dependent

00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:02,320
right if you have it running somewhere

00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:05,200
then a user

00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:06,080
could log on to that desktop from their

00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,400
browser

00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,120
you know given that you know they know

00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,840
the host

00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,840
and the port

00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,760
right we talk a little bit about the

00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:28,480
editor

00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:30,720
right it's not a full-blown ide but it's

00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,279
based on monaco right so if anyone knows

00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,520
about

00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:39,679
uh microsoft's monaco editor very

00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:42,720
similar to vs code um

00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:43,840
let me navigate through here and see if

00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:47,200
we have

00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:49,200
okay so so can we use zoe in our system

00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:53,840
using the web browser

00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,840
right we answer that um

00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:02,159
okay sean answering some more questions

00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:04,320
so i have a z os system and my users

00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:06,159
went to zoe how did the users launch zoe

00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:09,919
to get to the mainframe

00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:11,679
we answer that perfect

00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:13,360
okay it looks like that's the end of the

00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:16,320
list for questions

00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:21,840
so i'm open to new questions if people

00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:21,840
have them

00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:35,760
okay looks like maybe no questions for

00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:38,240
now

00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:39,440
so maybe i'll add a few things maybe a

00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:43,120
few more

00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:44,000
uh details that you know wasn't intended

00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,960
in the

00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,559
original user presentation we could talk

00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:52,559
maybe a bit about

00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:54,000
the actual uh the actual things behind

00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:56,559
the scenes right what are

00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,279
what are the frameworks that zoe

00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:59,360
supports

00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:01,360
right we know what zoe is we see the

00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:04,320
desktop and we see apps

00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:05,279
but how do those things happen and the

00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,720
apps

00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:11,120
right now are going to be in

00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:13,200
angular they're going to be in react and

00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:16,799
they're going to be an iframe

00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:19,520
and we have various sample apps

00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:20,960
right we like to call sample apps they

00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:24,399
are tutorial apps

00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:27,120
that showcase the capabilities of

00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:29,360
a certain framework in the beginning of

00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,760
the presentation i used

00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,720
our iframe sample app to send a

00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:36,000
notification

00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,799
for example these are the things that

00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,559
will

00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:44,399
help hopefully help grow the community

00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:47,760
help the onboarding process and

00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:48,320
help interested developers if they would

00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:52,000
like to

00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:55,679
develop their own apps on zoe

00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:59,360
or bring existing web page

00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:01,200
like apps to zoe right we offer

00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:04,880
iframe support so that means we can

00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:08,080
embed a web page within an app

00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:11,279
and that means that if someone did have

00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:14,399
a web page that they wanted to add

00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:20,159
they could do that packaged as an app

00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:20,159
with not too much effort involved

00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:27,840
we have a notification in the chat

00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:33,360
oh yeah okay so i showed off some jcl

00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:35,200
highlighting but it didn't show some rex

00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:37,279
highlighting

00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:39,360
i don't remember the exact data set sean

00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:42,960
could you send me the exact data set

00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,960
i'll open it up in the editor now

00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:55,840
i think it was tsspg oh was it this one

00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:55,840
um it might have been this one

00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,960
okay

00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:11,600
yes perfect so here we have some

00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:11,600
rex um

00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,480
there we go

00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:23,840
i'll briefly scroll through

00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:32,320
and the as i said previously in the

00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:35,200
demo our list for supported languages

00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:36,000
is growing a lot of these are taken

00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:39,120
directly

00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:42,640
from the ones that are built into monaco

00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:44,880
but the languages uh

00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,080
dominant in the mainframe for example

00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:49,679
like jcl

00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:51,200
like rex these are ones that we had to

00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:53,919
um

00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:55,200
well we had to build the highlighting

00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:57,519
from the ground up

00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,039
right we we had to use you know if we

00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:01,600
want to go technical regex

00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:02,399
right and and and things like that we

00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:06,720
had to use

00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:09,840
pattern matching to to create the

00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,840
highlighting ourselves

00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:21,440
uh lionel asked does the highlighting

00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,480
expose

00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,480
syntax errors

00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,440
sean grady is typing an answer because

00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:36,570
i'm

00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:39,990
i'm trying to remember it's fairly new

00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:39,990
[Music]

00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,840
um

00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:58,240
well let's try to do

00:31:54,799 --> 00:32:01,840
something wrong right we have our

00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,840
string here

00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:10,159
so we can see that right off the bat

00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:12,880
it's not recognizing this as a string

00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:14,320
we have you know i'm not a rex expert

00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,880
right i'm not going to

00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:18,399
embarrass some of the rex experts maybe

00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:22,640
that are on this call

00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:24,880
but i know at least from a basic level

00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:26,320
you know we have certain pattern

00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,080
matching that says

00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,840
this is what it should be right we have

00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:33,200
our calls um

00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:34,720
we have our conditionals um and this is

00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:39,519
what it shouldn't be

00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:42,559
so we we have it at a basic level

00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:43,200
maybe sean can talk about the details uh

00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:46,000
because

00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,000
he worked on it

00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:49,760
sorry can't give you a more advanced

00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:53,200
answer um yeah so

00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:57,279
can you hear me all right we can yeah

00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:58,240
sure so um the editor that you see here

00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:02,559
is based upon

00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:06,559
monaco and monaco allows for

00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:09,600
syntax highlighting linting

00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:10,240
and um i think a little bit more

00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,760
advanced

00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:14,159
advanced stuff like potentially

00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:17,039
debugging via what they call

00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:19,600
language server protocol so the

00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:23,039
capability to do a lot is there

00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:26,080
um but we're kind of attacking this

00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:29,039
one thing at a time so we don't

00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:31,440
have flinting support for rex yet it's

00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:35,200
just the syntax highlighting

00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:37,120
however since since monaco is capable of

00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:41,679
so much

00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:44,320
we're happy to collect feedback on

00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:46,480
what everyone thinks is interesting uh

00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:48,880
so that we can prioritize our backlog

00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,919
of future enhancements to make you know

00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,760
one of the

00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:53,200
one of the important parts of zoe being

00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:56,240
open source is

00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:57,039
that um you get your voice heard so if

00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:00,240
you

00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:02,399
want to see something cool um you know

00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,559
just let the community know

00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:06,399
and if you want to participate and and

00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:07,200
help make something happen you know if

00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:10,800
you have

00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:13,839
particular expertise in in something

00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:15,919
that isn't covered yet um

00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:17,040
we'd love to hear that too you know it's

00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:18,480
it's uh

00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:20,240
it's an open source community so

00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,560
anyone's welcome to

00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:25,119
give feedback as well as to contribute

00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,119
if they'd like

00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:32,240
absolutely yeah we should

00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:34,399
definitely reference the awesome

00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:38,079
community that we have

00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:41,200
if we navigate to zoe.org we'll see

00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:42,800
for example the slack communication

00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:46,079
channels that we have

00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:48,960
and we have channels depending on

00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:50,320
maybe the questions that you have or you

00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,040
know the help that you need from a

00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:54,240
development

00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:57,920
standpoint all different channels for

00:34:54,240 --> 00:35:00,800
um you know different

00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,119
different asks that you might have in

00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,839
the

00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:03,839
zoe community

00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:19,359
awesome is there anything else that you

00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:19,359
want to share with us today lenny

00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:28,640
um not for today

00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,640
i think we

00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:33,280
let's see we showcased the desktop we

00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:34,720
talked a little bit about what it's

00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:38,960
trying to accomplish

00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:40,960
we showcase some of the core apps um

00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,720
i think things are good on my end i'll

00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:45,760
probably give a few more minutes

00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:50,000
for questions to come in but

00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:54,400
um maybe sean has some other things

00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:59,359
to say i could you know demo from my end

00:35:54,400 --> 00:36:03,359
but um i think we got through the

00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:04,960
gist great

00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:08,400
all right if anybody has any last-minute

00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,400
questions go ahead and type those in

00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:17,359
i'll give you a minute or two here we go

00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:19,520
can this be used to provide a desktop a

00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:20,839
desktop interface to an application

00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:24,400
instead of running an

00:36:20,839 --> 00:36:29,599
ispf dialogue

00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:32,000
can this fuse write it yes

00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:32,000
um

00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:38,800
well it's a pretty generic question so

00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:41,200
i'm not sure

00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,320
like a specific use case that you have

00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:45,359
in mind

00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:46,960
but yeah i mean we go ahead

00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:50,079
that's the good thing about the desktop

00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:50,960
is um it has a generic answer to generic

00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:54,000
questions too

00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:57,760
right um the thing is the desktop is

00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:59,359
not only what lenny showed it's also a

00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:02,800
framework for building

00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:04,880
programs on top of so if there's

00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:07,920
something that you want to do in the

00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:11,119
desktop that you didn't see today

00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:14,800
and you have a particular vendor product

00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:16,560
that you know and love you can always

00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:18,720
ask that company hey

00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:21,359
will you zoe enable your product because

00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:25,280
i mean half of what we do

00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:29,359
in the community is we help people

00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:30,480
zoe enable their products or make new

00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:34,640
products

00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:38,400
upon zoe so you can definitely

00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:41,920
make an interface in the desktop

00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:44,960
that is an alternative

00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:48,720
to what you might see in ispf or

00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:52,560
translates what you see in ispf

00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:55,839
the whole zoe ecosystem is

00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:59,359
uh has tools like rest apis

00:37:55,839 --> 00:38:01,680
and web sockets and even has

00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:03,280
a server that's specifically meant to do

00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:08,000
low-level system calls

00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:12,160
and all of this is pluggable so

00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:15,440
no matter by what means you can indeed

00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:19,839
get the data up to the web browser

00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:19,839
and visualize in the desktop

00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:24,320
it looks like i did miss one of lionel's

00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:27,200
questions

00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:30,079
which was i was thinking i'd like to run

00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:33,040
a program that generates data

00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:33,920
that that can be run from within the zoe

00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:37,680
desktop app

00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:40,960
without running a job but run directly

00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:41,280
um so i'm not sure whether this answers

00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,280
your

00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:45,520
your question but something that comes

00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:50,079
to mind for me

00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:54,560
would be the vt terminal

00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:54,560
so for example if i open up vt

00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:05,119
and i log in

00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:08,320
as my user i could for example run

00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:10,800
a shell script that i have here

00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:12,000
right uh i think we showed one

00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:16,079
previously

00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:18,079
right i had the that um kill zoe script

00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:19,200
don't want to run it here now obviously

00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:22,000
because then we would

00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:23,440
uh shut down our zoe instance but that

00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,880
is something that i could do from the

00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:27,680
terminal

00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:28,000
we could also use apta app to do the

00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:30,800
same

00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,760
thing i don't remember whether we have

00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,839
it working now

00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:36,240
or whether we just have the framework to

00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:39,520
make it work

00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:42,000
but we could for example launch vt in a

00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:44,720
context by itself

00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,079
and then use app to add parameters to

00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:49,280
launch

00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:52,800
a script for it to start maybe like

00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:56,160
we launched the editor to

00:39:52,800 --> 00:40:00,000
plop open with a file

00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:02,640
like we did here that's one example that

00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,640
comes to mind

00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:11,839
maybe people have other examples

00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:21,119
all righty it looks like we are out of

00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,640
questions i want to thank you so much

00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:24,000
lenny for your presentation today this

00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:27,200
is super informative and

00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:30,640
very interesting um any any final

00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,640

that's awesome

00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:47,119

watching the demo seeing what the

00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,880
desktop has to offer

00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,880
seeing the cool things that we're

00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:02,000
working on and

00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:03,359
