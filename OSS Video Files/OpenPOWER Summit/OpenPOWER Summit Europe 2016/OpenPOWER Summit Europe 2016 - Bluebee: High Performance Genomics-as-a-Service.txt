so good afternoon everybody thank you

00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:22,970
all for being here I'm glad to be here

00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:24,920
in Barcelona myself so I'm sure you

00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:28,789
enjoying yourself as well my name is it

00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:30,590
Larsen from blue be a company

00:00:28,789 --> 00:00:33,460
specialized in high-performance genomics

00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:36,949
so we enable solutions that would help

00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:39,890
partners in the field develop and run

00:00:36,949 --> 00:00:41,989
genomics pipelines and practice reducing

00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:46,280
their overall cost and also enabling

00:00:41,989 --> 00:00:48,890
faster Diagnostics for patients in this

00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:50,780
presentation I will discuss our genomics

00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:55,129
pipeline that you're developing and a

00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:58,400
platform that enables doctors hospitals

00:00:55,129 --> 00:01:01,640
clinics to use genomics and run genomics

00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:03,530
pipelines easily in practice I will

00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,510
start with an introduction of the

00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:08,689
company blooby I will go ahead and

00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:10,640
discuss our platform itself and then I

00:01:08,689 --> 00:01:13,159
will end with a use case description of

00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:16,070
how we enabled one of our customers to

00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:21,200
solve their problems and challenges in

00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:23,570
the field so blue B is a spin-off of two

00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,250
universities with a spin-off of the

00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:27,470
Delft University of Technology in the

00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:30,130
Netherlands and Imperial College in

00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:34,610
London Imperial College London in the UK

00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:38,390
we develop a platform that enables fast

00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:41,600
secure and affordable DNA analysis in

00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:44,450
the field we started the company because

00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:47,740
we so the evolution that is going on in

00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:50,360
the genomics world we show that the

00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:52,760
players in the field are generating more

00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:54,710
and more data and facing more and more

00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:58,370
computational challenges that would

00:01:54,710 --> 00:02:00,050
represent a bottleneck of using this

00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:03,500
data actually to treat their own

00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:05,570
patients to use it in practice so we

00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:08,030
would like from our background or

00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:10,580
experience in computation to enable

00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:12,379
people in the field of personalized

00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:14,599
medicine be able to serve their

00:02:12,379 --> 00:02:17,060
customers their patients in a faster and

00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:18,680
more effective way we bring this

00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:20,569
together by combining a number of

00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:23,730
different characteristics or aspects

00:02:20,569 --> 00:02:26,370
from the high tech field so we work in

00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:29,519
hpc field high performance computing

00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:32,090
field bring our expertise to the to the

00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:34,530
game and we work enabling cloud

00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:37,709
solutions or as well as on-prem

00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:39,360
solutions for the genomics environment

00:02:37,709 --> 00:02:41,459
and also bring together some of

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,940
expertise that are being developed in

00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:48,750
the field of genomics itself from

00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:50,879
practitioners of using genomic data in a

00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:52,379
clinical environment and combining all

00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:57,180
those together of course and ensuring

00:02:52,379 --> 00:03:01,560
security privacy and data integrity for

00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:05,040
the end user now in any of these

00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:09,090
different pillars and we are bringing

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:12,530
together different players from the

00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:15,540
market in order to bring all these

00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:18,390
expertise together to present and

00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:20,190
develop our platform so from the HPC

00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:21,359
solutions we have access to the research

00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:23,250
going on in Delft University of

00:03:21,359 --> 00:03:25,140
Technology of course and number of other

00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:27,269
universities in addition to Imperial

00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:29,489
College London with regard to cloud

00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:32,220
computing or partnership we have a

00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:35,250
partnership with IBM SoftLayer and to be

00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:38,400
able to deploy our solutions globally

00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:40,260
and also from the genomics point of view

00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:44,549
we have access to a number of different

00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:47,069
leading players in the field that access

00:03:44,549 --> 00:03:48,810
our solution and also give us insight

00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:50,669
into their needs so that we can develop

00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:54,000
our solution effectively so we're

00:03:50,669 --> 00:03:56,790
talking about the Pasteur Institute from

00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,280
France talk about the dekalb set from

00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:04,769
Germany or UFC attracting in the

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:07,079
Netherlands and others to add to that we

00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:08,549
also have a very strong technological

00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:10,709
collaboration or a number of different

00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:13,560
players in the field specifically with

00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:14,930
IBM we have very close collaboration

00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,930
with the

00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:20,840
and a number of the research centers in

00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:24,500
the world and one of a distinguished

00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:26,780
member member IBM peterhof stay is part

00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:31,130
of our advisory board we are working

00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:32,870
very closely developing on power 8

00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:34,520
solutions and hopefully on port nine

00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:38,000
solutions we were an early developer

00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:42,130
early States developer on 48 using in

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:45,680
addition to their standard server also

00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:49,039
developments for Cathy integration using

00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:51,680
acceleration to implement accelerated

00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:54,229
solutions specifically for genomics on

00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:57,520
power 8 and also of course power H of

00:04:54,229 --> 00:05:00,199
layer user in in the cloud environment

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,849
in addition to that we use aspera for

00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:03,560
data communication as we know that the

00:05:01,849 --> 00:05:06,380
huge amounts of data being transferred

00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:09,020
back and forth between sequencing

00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:13,570
centers and between medical centers is

00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:15,919
causing a bottleneck in enabling the

00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:19,210
personalized medicine revolution from

00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:21,460
taking place and by adding the ease of

00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:24,530
transferring data from a spiritual

00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:27,190
platform enables us to do that faster

00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:31,789
and of course we are a firm believer in

00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:33,889
the community efforts that enables these

00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:35,900
kinds of solutions to come to practice

00:05:33,889 --> 00:05:39,190
so that's why we are part of the open

00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:41,810
power foundation actually we are leading

00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:43,400
one of the work groups with an open

00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:45,289
power the personalized medicine work

00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:48,880
group and we are trying to bring

00:05:45,289 --> 00:05:51,380
together along with open power members

00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,750
movement creating a movement that brings

00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:56,539
together developers of technology as

00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:59,419
well as users of that technology to

00:05:56,539 --> 00:06:02,259
enable a specific solution within that

00:05:59,419 --> 00:06:05,360
specific application domain in practice

00:06:02,259 --> 00:06:07,960
so talking about our solution in

00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:11,090
particular and how we use the open power

00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:13,220
technologies to enable and increase in

00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:16,909
performance I would like to discuss our

00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:19,430
main two axes developing our

00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:21,800
high-performance solution in on our

00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:23,599
platform so we use basically two

00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,070
different aspects that are more or less

00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:26,360
independent from each other that can

00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:28,550
contribute each other and increase

00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:30,020
performance for the pipeline

00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:31,850
we use on the one hand what we call

00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:35,390
distribution which is basically

00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:38,000
scalability trying to enable those

00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:41,990
pipelines used in practice genomics

00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,780
pipelines to be able to use a growing

00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:47,810
and scalable computational

00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:50,510
infrastructure now having this

00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:52,250
capability of increasing the amount of

00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:53,840
computation that you have on a scalable

00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:56,570
infrastructure enables you to increase

00:06:53,840 --> 00:07:00,080
the throughput that you're able to

00:06:56,570 --> 00:07:02,840
provide the users so for example in a

00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:05,600
medical clinical environment having more

00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:08,420
and more patients coming in requires

00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:11,180
having higher and higher computational

00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:12,980
capacity and enabling scalability for

00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:14,240
the pipeline's enables a specific

00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:17,870
medical center to increase the

00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:21,440
throughput transparently and enabling

00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:25,330
treating or diagnosing more patients as

00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:28,100
they demand now the other aspect of our

00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:30,740
performance improving capabilities it

00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:32,780
depends on acceleration we use what we

00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:36,010
call elastic acceleration in a cloud

00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:39,500
environment or in a on-prem environment

00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:41,120
where we are able to add for specific

00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:44,270
algorithms that are highly

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:47,510
computationally intensive an accelerated

00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:50,810
solution on GPU and fpga on specialized

00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:53,480
hardware that would enable reducing the

00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:56,420
total time needed to perform that

00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:58,040
specific algorithm or function on the

00:07:56,420 --> 00:08:00,770
computational platform what does that

00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:03,560
mean in practice it means that the time

00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:06,170
to diagnosis the latency of the whole

00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:08,000
analysis once a patient comes in with a

00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:11,030
specific condition throughout the

00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,900
sequencing analysis and then providing

00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:17,440
the medical provider with the

00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:21,260
information is able to be reduced

00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:23,120
enabling hopefully within for that

00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:24,890
specific patient to be able to have the

00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,380
results of the diagnosis within one day

00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:31,460
to be able to have a shorter latency

00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:32,990
enabling more faster Diagnostics with

00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:35,150
that specific patient so these are the

00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:36,979
two aspects and they impact actually the

00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:41,110
use cases in practice in two different

00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:41,110
ways orthogonal or independent ways

00:08:41,209 --> 00:08:46,709
in addition to that you would like we

00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:49,290
are enabling this kind of platform that

00:08:46,709 --> 00:08:51,750
we're developing over around everywhere

00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:54,329
in the world so we are adding our

00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:55,829
computational capacity in collaboration

00:08:54,329 --> 00:09:00,569
with the SoftLayer that we set for

00:08:55,829 --> 00:09:03,149
example to provide data centers close to

00:09:00,569 --> 00:09:05,699
the customers that would enable them to

00:09:03,149 --> 00:09:08,459
access our technology locally in their

00:09:05,699 --> 00:09:10,019
environment some of the customers are

00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:11,880
interested in having an on-premise

00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:14,190
solution and in that case we can provide

00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:17,130
them with a solution that is developed

00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:18,690
for them on site and in case some of

00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:21,000
those customers are not able to have

00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:22,649
such a solution on site we are also able

00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,139
to provide them with to do with a

00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:26,339
solution that is cloud-based but because

00:09:25,139 --> 00:09:28,380
of regulation we have to provide that

00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:31,350
solution actually within a specific

00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:34,699
geographical region and this widespread

00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:37,170
distribution of our compute centers

00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:39,470
enables us to comply with the

00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:42,660
regulations and provide that solution

00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:47,250
locally and did you get a geographical

00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:49,260
region of the of the customer and to

00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:53,329
bring this all together we actually

00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:56,040
provide an addition to that a platform a

00:09:53,329 --> 00:09:58,920
genomics computational platform that

00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:02,040
brings high performance computing brings

00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:06,079
customized pipeline analysis

00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:12,240
capabilities and wraps it up with

00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:14,220
security privacy and data integrity for

00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,470
the photos for the user and all of this

00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:18,690
is developed transparently from the user

00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:23,459
the issue an hour with the users are

00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:25,949
basically developers are geneticists or

00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:27,269
biology shins that have no interest in

00:10:25,949 --> 00:10:29,040
getting to know the details these are

00:10:27,269 --> 00:10:30,600
greatly details of the technology that

00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,519
you provide so with its kind of

00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:35,240
transparent interface they are able to

00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:40,500
use this all this wonderful technology

00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:43,709
transparently to further needs to wrap

00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:46,050
it up I'd like to present a use case

00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:49,500
that we have engaged with with the

00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:50,329
German cancer research center based in

00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:53,350
Heidelberg

00:10:50,329 --> 00:10:57,379
Germany they have a staff it's a huge

00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:59,949
genomics Institute one of the leading in

00:10:57,379 --> 00:11:03,230
the world they have a staff of about 200

00:10:59,949 --> 00:11:04,279
2,800 people they are working now in a

00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:08,829
number of different international

00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:11,480
projects and they are leading and

00:11:08,829 --> 00:11:13,790
bringing the personalized medicine

00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:16,399
revolution to the field within Germany

00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:19,220
so they are trying to deploy the

00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:21,709
personalized medicine pipelines to all

00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:24,470
every single cancer patient in the

00:11:21,709 --> 00:11:28,069
country ramping up from about 2,000

00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:30,769
patients in 2015 up to about 4,000

00:11:28,069 --> 00:11:33,319
patients 2017 and they had an issue a

00:11:30,769 --> 00:11:36,470
problem a challenge achieving this

00:11:33,319 --> 00:11:37,970
number for the use case one of the

00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:40,189
challenge just I go fast in the

00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:45,170
challenge it's a bit technical and they

00:11:40,189 --> 00:11:47,569
use a specific algorithm it's called VW

00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:53,089
mmm the first algorithm that pipeline

00:11:47,569 --> 00:11:55,639
that enables computation of the location

00:11:53,089 --> 00:11:59,689
of different genome snippets in a

00:11:55,639 --> 00:12:01,759
reference genome we since this is the

00:11:59,689 --> 00:12:03,860
first stage in the pipeline this is

00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:05,929
representing a bottleneck in their

00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:07,999
pipeline it uses at the time it used

00:12:05,929 --> 00:12:10,309
eighty percent of visit of their CPU

00:12:07,999 --> 00:12:12,669
infrastructure quite a big chunk of

00:12:10,309 --> 00:12:15,290
their available compute infrastructure

00:12:12,669 --> 00:12:17,779
the issue is that BW memory is a very

00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:19,459
scalable solution so you cannot really

00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:21,350
use more resources in the infrastructure

00:12:19,459 --> 00:12:23,629
to optimize it and get more performance

00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:27,619
it already uses all the infrastructure

00:12:23,629 --> 00:12:29,860
the challenges with already a you fully

00:12:27,619 --> 00:12:32,929
utilized infrastructure how are we able

00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:36,829
to even go beyond that and improve the

00:12:32,929 --> 00:12:37,819
performance on their infrastructure so

00:12:36,829 --> 00:12:41,540
we came up with a number of different

00:12:37,819 --> 00:12:45,079
solutions with gradual increase in speed

00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:48,079
up and efficiency the baseline is an

00:12:45,079 --> 00:12:50,209
implementation on an intel xeon standard

00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:52,970
server that should be our baseline a

00:12:50,209 --> 00:12:55,869
speed-up of one we implemented an

00:12:52,970 --> 00:13:00,439
accelerated version within an Intel

00:12:55,869 --> 00:13:01,540
environment that achieved within with

00:13:00,439 --> 00:13:05,430
fpga acceleration

00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:10,240
3.5 speed up on their solution we

00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:11,920
introduced a power 8 architecture into

00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,290
the environment to see how much

00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,029
performance we can get and by a change

00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:19,089
in the architecture and we were able to

00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:21,970
achieve 4.4 X improvement in speed up

00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:25,420
and by adding acceleration on top of

00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:29,259
this power 8 solution we're able to

00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:32,430
achieve a speed-up of 7.8 almost eight

00:13:29,259 --> 00:13:35,980
times faster than the standard baseline

00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:38,100
now what does that mean nice numbers it

00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:42,699
means that we are able actually to

00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:45,370
reduce up to 800 CPU hours for every

00:13:42,699 --> 00:13:48,790
single patient coming in for a whole

00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:50,079
genome sequencing experiments by this

00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:55,329
kind of reduction we are able to

00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:57,430
eliminate their BW mm implementation as

00:13:55,329 --> 00:14:01,480
a bottleneck in their infrastructure and

00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:05,560
enable them to onboard their new higher

00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:08,310
performance sequencing machines to be

00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:10,990
able to go to the next phase of

00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:12,970
optimizing their platform and also being

00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:14,769
able to treat ramp up to treat more

00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:17,519
patients with their with their

00:14:14,769 --> 00:14:21,100
infrastructure now to wrap it all up

00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:23,819
basically we are providing a platform

00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:27,089
that enables integration of

00:14:23,819 --> 00:14:30,990
high-performance genomics with

00:14:27,089 --> 00:14:34,089
acceleration and in addition to

00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:36,459
transparent application by the user to

00:14:34,089 --> 00:14:40,750
use these technologies providing on top

00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:44,579
of that secure and private data access

00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:47,019
and in addition we are enabling a

00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:50,680
reduction in total cost of ownership and

00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:52,209
also trying to help our customers to

00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:54,010
enable the personalized medicine

00:14:52,209 --> 00:14:56,189
revolution in the field thank you very

00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:56,189
much

00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:03,300
and

00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:15,080
