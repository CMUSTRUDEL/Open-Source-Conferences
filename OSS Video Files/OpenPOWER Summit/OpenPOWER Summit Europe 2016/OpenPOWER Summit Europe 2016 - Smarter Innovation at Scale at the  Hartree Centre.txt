so good afternoon everyone my name's

00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:23,320
Neil Morgan I'm from the hartree center

00:00:20,599 --> 00:00:23,320
in the UK and

00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:29,630
I'm going to talk to you a little bit

00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,560
this afternoon just briefly about some

00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:33,450
of the work that we're doing at the

00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:36,090
harshest entering collaboration with IBM

00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:39,239
research particularly looking at how we

00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:42,270
can support UK industry to adopt smarter

00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:43,860
innovation at scale so the hachi Center

00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:45,780
is actually part of these Science and

00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:48,210
Technology facilities Council within the

00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:51,210
UK that's one of the seven research

00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:53,940
councils and that's responsible for

00:00:51,210 --> 00:01:01,410
providing large-scale scientific

00:00:53,940 --> 00:01:05,360
facilities which include synchrotron etc

00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:07,560
and we also have expertise in hpc

00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:11,729
spanning a number of years at our site

00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:13,280
in dewsbury so the evolution of the

00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:16,110
hartree center actually comes about from

00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:20,340
the Tilsley report which was published

00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:22,259
in 2011 so this report actually pointed

00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:24,300
out that in order to enable economic

00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:27,240
impact within the UK we needed to make

00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:28,920
an investment into e infrastructure so

00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:32,009
we got our first initial tranche of

00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:35,220
funding in 2012 to set the centre up and

00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:38,399
this was used predominantly to support

00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:40,800
UK industry and to undertake industrial

00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:43,369
engagements around software modeling and

00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:45,869
simulation and that was quite successful

00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:48,270
so following that we got some fair the

00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:49,679
funding in 2014 and this was to expand

00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:52,140
the program of work at the hartree

00:01:49,679 --> 00:01:54,660
Center particularly with a focus on

00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:58,020
energy efficient computer and big data

00:01:54,660 --> 00:02:00,000
analytics so we're quite unusual in the

00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:01,380
UK in terms of the range of machines and

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,509
hardware that we actually have at the

00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:05,429
center so we've got a number of quite

00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:07,289
novel pieces of hardware which we use

00:02:05,429 --> 00:02:09,929
for our energy efficient computing

00:02:07,289 --> 00:02:13,470
program or get things like energy-aware

00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:15,360
scheduling etc and then most pertinent

00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:18,569
to today we got a third tranche of

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,459
funding in 2015 and this was to enable a

00:02:18,569 --> 00:02:23,340
five-year collaboration with IBM

00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:25,080
research particularly around data

00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,520
centric computing and cognitive

00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,260
computing

00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,730
picking up on something that someone

00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:33,000
said earlier one of the things that we

00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:34,560
noticed our tree one of the key drivers

00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,210
for us is the obvious obviously the

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,750
ending of the of Moore's Law is an

00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:42,030
economic model and we realize that

00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:44,370
optimization of workflow and big data

00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:46,860
analytics data centric computing was

00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:49,560
obviously key to driving real value

00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:51,150
within industry within the UK so we've

00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,220
got that extended program which is up

00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:55,770
and running now and we're very pleased

00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:57,450
to be able to say that IBM is actually

00:02:55,770 --> 00:03:00,180
found in the first Research Center in

00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:02,010
the UK and they'll be co-located with us

00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:05,340
and working at the Des brief so that's

00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:07,200
quite an exciting development for us so

00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:09,000
in terms of the mission for the center

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,250
this is this is the hartree center's

00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,740
mission to transform UK competitiveness

00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:15,720
by facilitating and accelerating the

00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:18,150
adoption of data centric computing and

00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:20,220
cognitive technologies and hpc is

00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:22,890
included in there and we're doing that

00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:25,740
through obviously collaboration not just

00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:27,830
with IBM but with other partners looking

00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:30,540
at driving research and innovation

00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:32,760
picking up on those motivating problems

00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:35,130
that industry brings to us to develop

00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:37,709
prototypes to deploy those prototypes

00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:39,990
and test their validity and capability

00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:42,060
but ultimately our mission is to drive

00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:44,130
better products and services delivered

00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:46,790
faster and cheaper for the benefit of

00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:46,790
the UK economy

00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:51,459
so in terms of our services then we

00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,140
obviously did quite a bit of

00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:54,849
collaborative work have already

00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:57,159
mentioned that over the last four years

00:03:54,849 --> 00:03:58,689
we've done 120 collaborative projects

00:03:57,159 --> 00:04:00,790
with a range of companies from different

00:03:58,689 --> 00:04:03,819
industries people like rolls-royce

00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:05,319
Unilever red bull racing and we're

00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:07,140
looking to expand that now through the

00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:09,510
work that we're doing in terms of

00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:13,390
cognitive computing and machine learning

00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:15,129
using the power rate platforms we've got

00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:16,630
real expertise in software and

00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:18,489
algorithms and this comes through the

00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:20,829
work that we've done as part of the

00:04:18,489 --> 00:04:22,389
scientific computing department so STFC

00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:24,880
has quite a strong scientific computing

00:04:22,389 --> 00:04:26,620
department we were to optimize our

00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:30,460
clients code but also we have our own

00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:32,530
codes that we've developed in-house we

00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:33,789
also provide training and skills so one

00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:35,380
of the key things that the hartree

00:04:33,789 --> 00:04:37,690
Center does is run an annual summer

00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:38,889
school so traditionally over the last

00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:41,500
number of years we've done that over

00:04:38,889 --> 00:04:44,100
three days and that's how to focus on

00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:46,810
HPC big data analytics and visualization

00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:48,370
but I plan for next year is actually to

00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:50,110
put in place an extra day which will

00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:52,150
start to look at cognitive computing and

00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:55,840
machine learning so looking to build on

00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:57,940
what we've already done we also provide

00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,710
platforms of service through what we

00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:01,240
call our encore service and this is

00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:02,860
where we've done collaborative work with

00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,840
clients but they'd still like to have

00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:07,030
access to our systems within the hartree

00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:09,310
center so we can provide that through

00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:11,380
the on-call service but as part of the

00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:13,180
next generation R&D work that we're

00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:14,919
doing we're starting to look at hpc in

00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:16,599
the cloud and how we can build an

00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:18,520
integrated framework so that will be an

00:05:16,599 --> 00:05:21,270
evolution from where we are now in terms

00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:23,590
of our current service offering and

00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:25,150
perhaps key to the work that we're doing

00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:27,340
in the real focus for the next five

00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:29,740
years as I say is this R&D piece around

00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:31,690
proof of technology so leveraging the

00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:34,090
capabilities with the power stack and

00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:35,590
providing real benefit for UK industry

00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:37,449
as a say in helping them to solve their

00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:39,150
problems working collaboratively to do

00:05:37,449 --> 00:05:42,730
that

00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:44,740
so in terms of our people between

00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:46,690
scientific computing department within

00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:49,510
STFC in the hartree center we have

00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:51,280
approximately 160 engineers with

00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:55,750
expertise in computational fluid

00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:58,360
dynamics chemistry engineering we work

00:05:55,750 --> 00:06:00,460
in life sciences quite a broad range all

00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:05,830
the things that you would expect from an

00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:07,540
hpc center in terms of our projects have

00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:09,270
already mentioned that we've done 120

00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:11,890
projects over the last number of years

00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:14,050
working in different areas engineering

00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:15,880
and manufacturing environment is a big

00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:18,400
one for us we work very closely with the

00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:21,010
Met Office in the UK we spent quite a

00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,590
bit of time helping the Met Office to

00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:24,940
improve the unified model which is key

00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:26,500
where the model that's used within the

00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:28,870
UK that's over a million lines of code

00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:30,580
so it's really complicated but we're

00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:33,310
also investing time and effort to

00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:36,250
develop new models more portable models

00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:38,940
more sustainable models so we've

00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:40,690
committed resources and expertise to

00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:44,080
support the development of something

00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:47,470
called a cyclone weather model obviously

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:49,900
we do range of projects in other areas

00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:51,370
as well and our case that these are

00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,750
actually available on the website so if

00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:54,310
you're interested in finding out more

00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:56,530
about the work that we do at the hartree

00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:58,210
center if you google how to send the

00:06:56,530 --> 00:07:03,160
case studies you'll find more detail on

00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:04,840
the work that we actually do so building

00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:07,720
on the R&D piece that we're doing at the

00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:09,400
moment within the hartree center one of

00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:12,550
the things we realized as we evolved

00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:15,400
from the blue jean key technology into

00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:16,960
power 8 was that power rates obviously

00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,730
much more flexible and helps us to

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,130
refine and improve the workflows for

00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:22,210
particular problems that we have one of

00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:24,610
the things that we're trying to achieve

00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:29,230
is integrated data analytics some

00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:30,760
modeling and simulation platforms so one

00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:33,220
of the things we couldn't really do with

00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:35,620
the blue jean key generation of hardware

00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:39,310
was as I say have that flexibility and

00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:40,870
deploy things like spark and Hadoop but

00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:42,820
we can do that now with power aids and

00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:44,770
what were hoping to do is drive and

00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:47,650
close the loop between experiment and

00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:48,880
computation so our thinking there is and

00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:50,020
we've got several projects that are

00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,920
running at the moment particularly

00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:54,200
looking at computer-aided for me

00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:56,840
asian so how we can include machine

00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:59,300
learning in there as well to automate

00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:02,990
the parameterization process which

00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:04,870
obviously helps to drive time reduce

00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:10,160
time to solution and get us to the to

00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:12,590
optimal solutions more quickly so my

00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,000
colleagues within IBM Research and at

00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:16,100
the heart center have actually developed

00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,550
this model in terms of different types

00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:21,760
of workflow in different solutions and

00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:24,260
traditionally you can see you've got

00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:26,900
linpack down here which is very compute

00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:29,930
centric and it's high spatial data

00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:32,000
locality but the router the reality is

00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:34,729
for as in hpc and the challenge we face

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,640
is that workloads don't reside here

00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:39,920
anymore workflows spread across the

00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:42,710
whole spread of data centric to compute

00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:45,490
centric floating-point operations to

00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:48,860
integer operations and low to high

00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:50,600
spatial data locality so what we need to

00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:56,060
do is find a way to generate new

00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:58,040
workflows that removes the the current

00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:59,810
manual process if you like once or to

00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:01,280
make news machine lately and cognitive

00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:04,390
computing to make this a much more

00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,390
automated process

00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:11,740
okay so in terms of the systems that

00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:13,480
we've got at the hartree Center we've

00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:16,810
got a range of hardware we've got to

00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:19,959
power 8 systems on site now the Panther

00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:23,050
system that you can see here is 32 nodes

00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:27,459
of power 8 that's twin k 80 GPUs it's

00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:29,649
got 57 terabytes of cappy flash memory

00:09:27,459 --> 00:09:31,450
that was installed in december of last

00:09:29,649 --> 00:09:33,760
year and we've been running on that for

00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:35,350
a while now our latest machine which

00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,420
only arrived last week which were really

00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:40,540
excited but excited about this paragon

00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:44,800
the top machine here latest power eighth

00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:47,680
generation has dual and Tesla p100 GPUs

00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:50,709
and includes envy link as well we also

00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:53,380
have a previous generation blue jean cue

00:09:50,709 --> 00:09:56,440
the be gas was activated sorry active

00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:59,709
storage flash memory 36,000 cause half a

00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:01,720
petaflop we have blue wonder our next

00:09:59,709 --> 00:10:04,750
scale machine approximately 8,000 cause

00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:06,250
and a date for analytics cluster and as

00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:07,630
well as those machines but as I

00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:09,610
mentioned earlier we have a range of

00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:12,130
emerging technologies so we're looking

00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:14,709
to FPGAs and how we can leverage fpgas

00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:16,810
for for some of our workflows and some

00:10:14,709 --> 00:10:19,810
of the problems we're dealing with data

00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:22,930
flow computing as an example we have

00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:25,660
Intel Xeon Phi we also have a an arm 64

00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:28,000
system which has just been instituted

00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:29,560
with it within the center so a range of

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,910
architectures that were using to

00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:36,490
benchmark and test bed with so just to

00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:40,140
summarize then basically at the moment

00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:42,910
we've got a research program with a IBM

00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:44,320
looking at life sciences science

00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:46,420
engineering and manufacturing in

00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:49,060
chemistry spanning four areas but

00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:51,880
supported by enabling technology and the

00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:53,649
enabling technology piece is really the

00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:56,050
the driver in the engine for the other

00:10:53,649 --> 00:10:58,329
areas helping to realize but the best

00:10:56,050 --> 00:11:00,100
solutions for for the problems with in

00:10:58,329 --> 00:11:03,720
these areas and it's really focused on

00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:06,640
large-scale machine learning algorithms

00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:08,709
visualization HPC in the cloud and ease

00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,570
of access is a key one so we're looking

00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:13,900
to develop iPad applications to allow

00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:15,100
people to do remote visualization and

00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:17,070
including things like uncertainty

00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:18,480
quantification as well this is of

00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:24,950
very important for our engineering

00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:24,950
client so thank you very much

00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,779
