	00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:14,830
now

00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:25,619
okay can you hear me I'll try to talk

00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:28,759
very softly um because I could actually

00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:33,390
talk to this room without the microphone

00:00:28,759 --> 00:00:37,140
so the good news is I'm the last

00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:39,329
presenter the bad news is on the last

00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,120
presenter when they first did this

00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:44,460
agenda I was actually way up at the

00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:47,699
beginning right after John's a nose and

00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:52,140
Calista and then they came to their

00:00:47,699 --> 00:00:53,670
senses so I'm the chair of the technical

00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,769
steering committee and what they asked

00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:57,629
me to do is give you an update on some

00:00:55,769 --> 00:01:00,539
of the work groups and things that that

00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:03,359
we've accomplished this year if you were

00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:07,650
at the summit in San Jose you may be

00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:10,020
bored but we'll we'll do what we can so

00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:12,090
I want to talk a little bit take you

00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,860
through a few key things we have a

00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:17,159
number of cappy related specs that were

00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:19,190
released over the year we did some stuff

00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:22,380
around the power processor architecture

00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:24,810
and in conjunction with the system

00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:26,550
software workgroup or primarily through

00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:29,460
the system software work group we we

00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:31,860
updated a completely new document

00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:33,210
infrastructure there's a resource

00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:39,420
catalog that you can get all this

00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:40,860
material from there's a speck that that

00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,330
is being developed through the memory

00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,850
work group I'll talk a little bit about

00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:46,410
that and and then I'm going to talk a

00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:48,390
little bit about some new work groups

00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:50,340
that we're doing and I'm going to try to

00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:54,750
do that all within less than 15 minutes

00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:57,750
so you can all get to the drinks okay so

00:01:54,750 --> 00:02:02,250
so within Cappy there's actually two

00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:04,200
specifications if you ignore the the new

00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:07,459
snap stuff you just heard there's two

00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:10,500
specifications one is

00:02:07,459 --> 00:02:12,420
one is a software level specification

00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:15,780
that's kind of an interface between the

00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:18,780
ISA and the software application that's

00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:20,849
called cai a and the other is the

00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:23,730
interface that talks down to the actual

00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:28,769
accelerator that's the the timing

00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:30,810
diagram that Bruce showed earlier the

00:02:28,769 --> 00:02:32,819
bits and bytes of it those two

00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:34,860
specifications have been completed and

00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:37,230
approved and they are released for

00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:42,269
public consumption and available on the

00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:44,400
resource catalog within the with an

00:02:42,269 --> 00:02:45,930
architecture part of things we have a

00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,239
hardware architecture workgroup and a

00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:50,640
system software work group there's

00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:53,760
several specifications that are

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,200
available on again through the resource

00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,319
catalogue the first one is an is a

00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:03,959
profile that talks about specific parts

00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:06,900
of the power is a 207 subset that's

00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:09,540
important for open power boring right

00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:11,519
it's a small document there's an i/o

00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:14,549
device architecture document that talks

00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:18,269
about important things like how how the

00:03:14,549 --> 00:03:20,340
software views the PCIe host bridge dull

00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:22,139
right but that's what that's the kind of

00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:24,389
thing we're doing as part of open powers

00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:26,880
to make those specifications available

00:03:24,389 --> 00:03:30,780
so people who develop applications and

00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:34,260
develop new hardware solutions can be

00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:37,549
compatible I already talked about the

00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:41,160
CIA and within the software work group

00:03:37,549 --> 00:03:43,169
the the most important thing that we're

00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:48,540
in the process of releasing right now is

00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:51,959
this little endian ABI application 64

00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:53,880
bit little endian ABI elf that's its

00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:57,419
full name doesn't matter what it says up

00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:59,760
there um it's been published through the

00:03:57,419 --> 00:04:01,440
system software work group and and now

00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,389
they're working on the next generation

00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,280
of it that will talk to or describe

00:04:03,389 --> 00:04:09,209
what's going on with p9 so that's that's

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:11,519
important work there and then I think

00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:12,900
there's a informal working session

00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,919
tomorrow morning if anybody's interested

00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,919
in being part of it

00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:25,730
so I mentioned that we have a framework

00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:27,770
for open powered documents basically

00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:29,930
what it is is rather than doing

00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:33,680
everything with word or a three make or

00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:35,510
some some you know proprietary solution

00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,400
we we went out to the open source

00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:40,730
community and looked for what are people

00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:43,640
doing for for document development and

00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:49,340
we picked up we actually borrowed a lot

00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:52,940
of this from OpenStack the using docbook

00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:55,520
which is XML tags it's all built around

00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:57,320
github repository so that all the work

00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:00,370
groups can work together to collaborate

00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:03,230
on their documents and when you generate

00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:07,430
the document when you're done you get

00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:09,140
two forms you get a web-based view

00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:14,000
showing over on the left and you can

00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:15,830
also get a pdf version at the end up

00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,790
looking like really professional really

00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:22,400
nice looking documents and and and by

00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:24,260
doing it with Doc book you know it makes

00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,419
it easy for us to go in and update the

00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:28,390
look and feel to make sure that

00:05:26,419 --> 00:05:30,440
everything is consistent and and

00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:32,300
compliant with the standards for the

00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:35,900
organization so so we really think

00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:38,390
that's a great thing to do there is a

00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,740
developer for those that you the care

00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:42,380
there is a document development guide

00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:44,330
this is actually the screenshots for it

00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:48,590
and of course it's available on the

00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:52,340
resource catalog which is you know

00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:56,090
perfect so so out on the open power

00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:58,490
website there is a link that leads to

00:05:56,090 --> 00:06:02,960
this resource catalog basically it's a

00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:05,750
it's a very generalized database if you

00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:08,660
will for for materials that we want to

00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:10,870
distribute and and it's used for

00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:13,610
distributing specifications but also

00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:15,650
product information and solution

00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:17,810
information of things that have anything

00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:20,510
that people want to share within the

00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:25,820
community can actually be added into

00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:27,620
that so and it's searchable and and if

00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:29,210
you do a nice job if we do a nice job on

00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:32,240
the entries for each one

00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:39,020
it actually gets searched well by Google

00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:42,740
and Yahoo I mentioned the open power

00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:44,419
memory bus specification this is this is

00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:47,599
a specification that is in development

00:06:44,419 --> 00:06:50,150
within the memory work group we have

00:06:47,599 --> 00:06:54,280
just got it to the stage where we think

00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:57,740
people could actually implement memory

00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:59,270
function units based on it so if you're

00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:01,160
interested in that you actually need to

00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:08,780
work join the memory work group to get

00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:11,300
at it but the idea here is on this side

00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:13,460
is the host processor with power 8

00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:16,310
that's currently DMI when we get to

00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:21,380
power 9 you'll see open cappy on that

00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:23,120
side and what we've done is we've

00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:26,599
defined this specification down the

00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,639
middle so that the actual talking back

00:07:26,599 --> 00:07:31,909
to the host the the bits and bytes of

00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:35,000
that is abstracted away this interfaces

00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:37,220
is net it's not possible to to put a

00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,860
abstract memory function unit designed

00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:44,240
to that interface so that it you can

00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:47,270
conveniently integrate new and different

00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:50,389
memory technologies I think there was a

00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:52,550
there's a demo or there was a mention of

00:07:50,389 --> 00:07:58,130
the group the work that Adam mcpadden

00:07:52,550 --> 00:08:00,199
had to done on and I can't remember what

00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:03,650
it was earlier today where they showed a

00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:06,620
new memory technology was actually

00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:09,199
integrated into a power system that's

00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:12,680
not an implementation of this so don't

00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:15,500
be confused that's a early

00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:18,289
implementation that IBM did to enable

00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:20,780
that that kind of activity and and this

00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:24,820
work is a bridge from that so this is

00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:24,820
kind of our open sourcing of that work

00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:31,520
and so so there's some other work groups

00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,169
close to mention there's 12 I'm not

00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,539
going to go through all 12 there's a few

00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:37,520
others that are important that we'd

00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:38,990
certainly like people to to get involved

00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:41,000
in because we think they're important to

00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:44,330
making the foundation go

00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,010
compliance workgroup 25gb

00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:48,530
interoperability mode work group which

00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:51,980
is really down at the electronic girly

00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:54,920
this physical signaling level for the

00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:58,280
those open interfaces that are coming

00:08:54,920 --> 00:09:01,010
off a p9 personalized medicine work

00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:03,110
group we have one called the FSI

00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:06,320
specification workgroup and that's about

00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:08,390
a service interface and then we have a

00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:12,680
much broader work group called the io

00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:16,420
work which is all about enabling adapter

00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:20,330
integration into open power systems and

00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:22,490
you know porting guidelines and test

00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:25,340
Suites and that kind of stuff for making

00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:29,570
it possible to integrate I owe more more

00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:33,170
robust io adapters and then lastly we

00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:35,270
have two new work groups the top one is

00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:38,320
open power working for physical sciences

00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:43,760
that was just recently formed on the

00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:47,570
chairs is Andre bvlgari le I'm sure i

00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:49,430
butchered that hungry and it's really

00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:51,740
talking about identifying and describing

00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:56,930
use cases around common work flows

00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:59,570
within scientific the scientific and

00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:02,390
experimental communities okay and then

00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:06,490
the last one is the ovum power ready

00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:10,790
work group that work group was set up to

00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:14,960
manage the ovum power ready definition

00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:17,030
and criteria document and look into the

00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:19,480
establishment of a plugfest where we can

00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:23,930
get together and show compatibility for

00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:25,760
for various solutions we haven't

00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:27,860
actually had our kickoff meeting for

00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:30,740
that yet so we don't have a chair but

00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:32,450
that will be happening shortly if any of

00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:37,250
you are interested in being part of any

00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:39,560
of those work groups you out to the if

00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:41,360
you remember you have to be a member of

00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:43,820
open power foundation to actually be

00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:47,480
part of these work groups with the

00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:49,370
exception of the open on the work group

00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,680
for physical sciences that one is

00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:53,180
actually open to the public so you'll

00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:57,530
need to get directly in touch

00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:59,960
with Andre to to do that but if you're a

00:10:57,530 --> 00:11:01,550
member of the open power foundation you

00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:03,890
can go out and join one of these work

00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:08,150
groups and and be very active in the

00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:10,690
development of these and i should say

00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:14,270
the the enhancement of the tech of the

00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:15,940
specifications we have here as well as

00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:18,230
new projects that we're putting in place

00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:21,170
for example within the accelerator

00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:23,090
workgroup there the snap environment

00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:25,660
came out of that work group and we're

00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:31,270
going to be doing more of that so i

00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:31,270
think that's it did I

00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:46,339
