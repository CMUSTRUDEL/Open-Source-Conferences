hi um first of all thank you very much

00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:29,300
for having me here i'm proud to be here

00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:31,519
with you today and i also have to

00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:36,410
apologize because I don't have a video

00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:40,100
and I will also be very less technical

00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:42,260
and not at all hardware focused so I

00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:47,540
hope you will still let me stay in the

00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:49,729
room thank you I'm representing more the

00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:52,729
open collaboration here today in this

00:00:49,729 --> 00:00:55,489
room my name is Judy covanta I'm I

00:00:52,729 --> 00:00:57,979
recently joined the OpenStack foundation

00:00:55,489 --> 00:01:01,790
we just have our large summit right

00:00:57,979 --> 00:01:03,739
across the street my role in building

00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:06,619
the foundation is ecosystem technical

00:01:03,739 --> 00:01:10,970
lead so I'm helping companies to embrace

00:01:06,619 --> 00:01:15,170
open sores and be able to succeed with

00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:18,200
with the OpenStack both from from usage

00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:22,070
perspective and also from community

00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:24,020
collaboration perspective a quick

00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:29,390
question how many of you are familiar

00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:33,350
with OpenStack Oh quite some hands

00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:35,930
amazing then quickly for those of you

00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:39,110
who didn't raise hands so OpenStack

00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:43,100
itself is is an open-source got that

00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:45,830
form cloud computing system as you can

00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:49,070
see on the slide we are providing the

00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:52,820
base set of services as compute

00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:59,870
networking and storage we are supporting

00:01:52,820 --> 00:02:03,860
several hypervisors like kvm San or the

00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:07,130
Ember and this cloud platform is capable

00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:11,090
of running above standard set of

00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:13,069
hardware resources and from northbound

00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:18,470
perspective we are offering a dashboard

00:02:13,069 --> 00:02:21,030
and a de facto set of api's beyond this

00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:24,000
what you what you see on

00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:28,080
a quite high level diagram we have

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:31,080
several services under the OpenStack

00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:34,230
umbrella so from software package

00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:38,580
perspective OpenStack is kind of a

00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:41,040
puzzle or like a Lego so you can you can

00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:43,500
pick these based out of services to have

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:46,590
your cloud up and running and after that

00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:51,300
you can you can decide what other

00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:54,239
services fit into your system so you can

00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:57,360
kind of build it really on demand and to

00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,730
fulfill your use cases for example we

00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:04,709
have a really interesting project which

00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:07,790
is about to to optimize the workload so

00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:10,800
the service is actually capable of

00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:12,600
reconfiguring the workload in order to

00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:17,610
provide kind of a green complete

00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:20,580
computing so you can remove the VM

00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:23,940
instances from compute hosts and then

00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:27,030
shut down those hardware resources which

00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:32,790
are not needed to serve the load on the

00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:34,230
system as I said OpenStack is a is a

00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:37,530
called platform it is actually a

00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:39,390
software package even if we as the

00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:42,209
community and the foundation we are not

00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:45,769
the vendor of this software package but

00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:48,810
we are very interested in seeing how

00:03:45,769 --> 00:03:52,200
OpenStack as a platform operating on the

00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:55,530
market because this is what drives our

00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:57,630
community and we would like to ensure

00:03:55,530 --> 00:04:00,510
that those of you who are who are using

00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:02,489
this cloud platform are are successful

00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:05,940
with it therefore we are running

00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:09,560
continuously running a user survey with

00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:13,709
which we are reaching out to more than

00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:16,669
2,500 users in the time period of one

00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:20,160
year it is still not a comprehensive

00:04:16,669 --> 00:04:23,460
market research but it is already a

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:26,190
really good set of data to see where we

00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:30,390
are and where we are going so I'm proud

00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:33,180
to say that we have sixty-five percent

00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:36,659
of the OpenStack deployments in

00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:40,110
production today which is about thirty

00:04:36,659 --> 00:04:44,340
three percent increase compared to the

00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:47,430
last survey so it seems that hopefully

00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:52,050
we are doing something good the survey

00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:55,289
is also used to to check that what our

00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:57,180
users think about our cloud platform

00:04:55,289 --> 00:05:00,120
which services they are using mostly

00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:01,530
which are the project services and also

00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:05,849
new technologies that they are

00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:13,229
interested at so

00:05:05,849 --> 00:05:17,139
you can see that these 2500 users are

00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:21,069
our kind of all around from all around

00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:24,479
the industry and serving OpenStack is

00:05:21,069 --> 00:05:28,509
serving many use cases there are many

00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:31,750
private and public clouds running

00:05:28,509 --> 00:05:33,610
OpenStack all around the globe I don't

00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:37,240
have the map today in this presentation

00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:39,819
with me but you could see red dots many

00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,889
in North America many in Europe more and

00:05:39,819 --> 00:05:44,680
more popping up in indy Asia region as

00:05:41,889 --> 00:05:49,840
well and I'm also proud to say that

00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:53,800
after six years of creating this this

00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:56,830
community we are now reaching out to

00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:59,710
other segments of the industry like

00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:03,520
telecom and you can also see that that

00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:06,490
we we are opening to research and big

00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:12,520
data as well for example one of our

00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:14,789
let's say oldest users is CERN so we

00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:17,770
kind of have a really good feedback on

00:06:14,789 --> 00:06:22,949
what workload OpenStack is able to

00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:25,990
handle and what are what are the next

00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:28,000
challenges for our community and also

00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:31,650
we'd be telecom and and I think the

00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:36,039
picture we are continuously looking into

00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:40,569
new areas and new technology like I OT

00:06:36,039 --> 00:06:42,759
or mobile edge computing so kind of the

00:06:40,569 --> 00:06:46,900
horizon is infinite for us in this

00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:52,020
community going back a little bit to our

00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:56,710
user survey we are also asking about

00:06:52,020 --> 00:07:00,069
that why people are adopting OpenStack

00:06:56,710 --> 00:07:02,949
why why it is a strategic decision for

00:07:00,069 --> 00:07:06,490
them that they are running with this

00:07:02,949 --> 00:07:10,360
open source cloud platform and as you

00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:12,550
can see standardization even if it's not

00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:16,120
the traditional way of standardization

00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:18,620
is still very important and not just for

00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:23,660
for the telecom industry and the telecom

00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:26,750
art but but for the whole IT his

00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:32,990
OpenStack is offering as I said a set of

00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:36,020
rest api's and it is used very widely we

00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:39,169
are we can be sure that what we are

00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:41,210
producing is is tested and not just test

00:07:39,169 --> 00:07:43,940
it automatically by machines but

00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:48,410
actually tested by users either in their

00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:50,720
proof of concept and test labs or or in

00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:53,479
their production environments so what we

00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:56,030
put together all the services are

00:07:53,479 --> 00:07:59,810
capable of operating all together and

00:07:56,030 --> 00:08:03,470
and the whole architecture works out so

00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:06,530
we with this way we are speeding up the

00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:10,190
process of introducing new new features

00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:13,580
and new services because we are we are

00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:15,770
spending let's say so the traditional

00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:18,699
way of standardization usually is that

00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:21,530
there are many people in the room with

00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:22,700
many sheets of paper and trying to

00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:24,860
figure out what's the perfect

00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:28,370
architecture and how the interfaces

00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:30,440
should look like and after that it works

00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:33,620
out on paper they go into implementation

00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:37,310
phase here we we are changing this flow

00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:38,690
so first we put together the

00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:41,959
architecture and the and the working

00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:44,120
code testing it seeing how it works and

00:08:41,959 --> 00:08:46,700
in parallel with this process the

00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:49,910
standardization in the traditional form

00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:52,820
can start and when we see that it works

00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:58,790
out it can be documented and called as

00:08:52,820 --> 00:09:00,950
as a real real standard one of one of

00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:02,440
the one of the things which is also very

00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:06,500
very important for us is

00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:09,410
interoperability so you can see that we

00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:13,310
have a nice stamp here which says

00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:18,290
OpenStack powered this is this

00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:22,230
represents a large set of tests so all

00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:24,720
the vendors who have OpenStack powered

00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:28,320
who have their products marked with

00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:30,930
OpenStack powered their products went

00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:34,620
through these tests successfully so

00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:38,310
those who consume those products can be

00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:41,040
sure that they they are not trapped

00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:42,780
there's no vendor lock-in anymore so

00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,940
where they where they see the stands

00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:48,210
they they know what api's they can

00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:54,810
expect and how they can work together

00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:58,470
and interact with this system so maybe

00:09:54,810 --> 00:10:03,990
partially this and the other things that

00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:06,870
I I mentioned already can or let us to

00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:10,770
the stage where i can say that the help

00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:13,830
of the fortune 100 runs on OpenStack so

00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:17,520
showing you a few examples we have

00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:21,330
walmart AT&T China Mobile state of China

00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:27,180
and Volkswagen in the list of our users

00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:30,150
and what's common within all these

00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:34,560
companies is that they are all the

00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:37,770
largest in their market segments so the

00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:45,950
largest retailer mobile company carrier

00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:50,190
company power and card manufacturer so

00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:56,370
jump a little bit even further from from

00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:59,640
technology I'm sorry again I usually I

00:10:56,370 --> 00:11:03,900
think I say it almost every day but it's

00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:06,240
really all about people and culture so

00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:10,800
you can you can have cool technology

00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:13,770
with you it it could enable many many

00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:19,020
things and the next steps but if you

00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:23,330
don't put the cultural changes into into

00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:26,760
the game then you might still not get

00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:30,390
that benefits and demands out of that

00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:32,579
technology as you would expect so one of

00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:36,269
one of the examples

00:11:32,579 --> 00:11:40,759
that we like to use is is is a user who

00:11:36,269 --> 00:11:40,759
came to us with with the challenge that

00:11:41,329 --> 00:11:48,209
from from the point of having working

00:11:44,489 --> 00:11:52,339
code to the point of delivering the

00:11:48,209 --> 00:11:56,220
software to their customers they spent

00:11:52,339 --> 00:11:59,759
44 days with it so they thought that

00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:03,119
that most probably the issue is purely

00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:06,149
only technology and most probably if

00:12:03,119 --> 00:12:10,670
they are using cloud but will just solve

00:12:06,149 --> 00:12:14,610
all their problems so they went ahead

00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:17,279
consumed OpenStack they spin on their

00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:20,869
cloud environment everything went quite

00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:25,350
well and then they started their process

00:12:20,869 --> 00:12:31,139
with older expectations and they got

00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:33,299
down to 42 days but they had a really

00:12:31,139 --> 00:12:37,079
really amazing cloud platform bed with

00:12:33,299 --> 00:12:39,860
them I can tell and still 42 days so

00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:42,119
it's it's not even visible in percentage

00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:46,649
so what what could have been the problem

00:12:42,119 --> 00:12:49,559
so they used the same way of of

00:12:46,649 --> 00:12:53,939
processes and business processes in

00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:56,639
house that day they used to have like in

00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:59,579
order to spin up a virtual machine for a

00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:02,790
developer they they had to fill out a

00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:05,189
form go through the security department

00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:08,519
and networking guys and everyone had to

00:13:05,189 --> 00:13:12,629
sign it so basically they they still

00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:14,910
couldn't get there to leverage all the

00:13:12,629 --> 00:13:17,879
things that the underlying technology

00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:20,819
could offer so they they went back to

00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:23,189
the drawing table again and they revised

00:13:20,819 --> 00:13:27,660
their processes and how they are working

00:13:23,189 --> 00:13:30,419
internally and they figured out how how

00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:32,220
to work out the network segments how how

00:13:30,419 --> 00:13:35,230
to make everything secure and how to

00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:38,920
automate the whole process of

00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:41,080
of getting to resources so finally they

00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:45,460
could get down to two days and by the

00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:47,410
end even 22 hours so so this is

00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:50,770
something that that can show you that

00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:53,410
it's really not enough to look always

00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:56,020
into just to technology because it's

00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:58,780
really interesting it's really cool but

00:13:56,020 --> 00:14:00,310
sometimes you also need to look into all

00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:02,860
those processes that you are using

00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:04,060
internally in order to be able to keep

00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:08,130
up with the market and the market

00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:11,650
changes and be and keep up with the pace

00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:14,830
and as I'm here as a representative of

00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:18,040
an open source foundation and in a large

00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:19,900
open source community i would like to

00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:22,840
also also share with you all the

00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:26,850
benefits that open source open source

00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:31,270
has because as I just showed previously

00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:35,050
we have representatives from from all

00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:37,180
all the industry like we have telecom we

00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:41,410
have we have enterprise we have many

00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:44,020
many use cases and users operators and

00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:46,840
the developers can work together to

00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:52,090
evolve the cloud platform that we have

00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:54,640
and this way we have in the road map on

00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:56,710
the radar way faster old all the new

00:14:54,640 --> 00:15:01,600
technologies and all those things that

00:14:56,710 --> 00:15:06,610
keep all our members excited these days

00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:10,690
like for example what we have popped up

00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:14,320
latest of course containers are still

00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:16,660
hot topic and very high and but beyond

00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:20,020
this we also have mobile edge computing

00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:22,630
or IOT and all the big data use cases

00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:25,870
that will that will keep us busy but we

00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:28,390
have both sides in the room so we can we

00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:30,880
can already kind of get feed give

00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:34,810
feedback and think about the next steps

00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:37,240
all together with with the users and

00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:40,600
developers so it's really all about

00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:42,790
collaboration and I'm really out of time

00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:47,749
so

00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:51,920
my message to you would be is to have an

00:15:47,749 --> 00:15:53,989
open mind and and also try to think

00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:57,019
about how to be more efficient

00:15:53,989 --> 00:16:02,029
internally and how to build an ecosystem

00:15:57,019 --> 00:16:05,959
around you and around open power to have

00:16:02,029 --> 00:16:08,480
a successful future and I have two more

00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:11,629
slides really just just to highlight

00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:15,649
that we haven't even running just across

00:16:11,629 --> 00:16:19,549
the street it ends tomorrow and our next

00:16:15,649 --> 00:16:23,360
one will be in North America next year

00:16:19,549 --> 00:16:27,379
so if any of you would be interested in

00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:30,589
OpenStack itself from a more internal

00:16:27,379 --> 00:16:34,239
perspective then come and visit and

00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:34,239
enjoy thank you very much

00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,820
you

00:16:51,329 --> 00:16:53,389
