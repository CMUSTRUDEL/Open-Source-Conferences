	00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:17,130
now

00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:19,710
well John already thanked everyone for

00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:22,980
spending the time but i'm still like

00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:25,520
left behind so I'm the last one between

00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:31,950
you and the drinks i hate to do that

00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:34,980
okay one more okay good so my name is

00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:37,739
Chloe ma I'm actually responsible for

00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:40,800
cloud marketing and mellanox and I'm

00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:43,950
here on behalf of my co-worker Scott

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,989
shouts who is on the technical steering

00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:50,999
committee whooping power a lot of you

00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:54,149
probably know Scott already so I'm here

00:00:50,999 --> 00:00:57,859
to represent mellanox to talk about how

00:00:54,149 --> 00:01:01,079
we can get your application application

00:00:57,859 --> 00:01:04,050
performance and scalability to a new

00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:10,080
whole new level through mellanox smart

00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:13,620
interconnect so I grew up in China in

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:16,260
the late 1970s and 80s China had a

00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:19,140
slogan so basically they said by the

00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:22,410
year 2000 we're going to realize for

00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:24,750
modernization and that's agricultural

00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:27,180
industrial defense and science and

00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:29,940
technology so we talked about it every

00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:34,320
day but it felt so far away because it's

00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:37,260
like still 15 years but by the time we

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:44,550
knew it to say year 2000 has come and

00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:46,740
gone and similarly 100g bps it's

00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:49,920
something that we talked about and

00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:52,220
dreamed about and as of last year

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:56,340
mellanox has announced our end-to-end

00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:58,950
100g solution and the future is really

00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:03,360
here and we're seeing very healthy

00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:05,820
adoption of a 100g technology not only

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:09,149
in high-performance computing but also

00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:13,349
in our hyper skill customers the cloud

00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:18,860
and Internet companies like Microsoft

00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:22,530
etc etc and we're also seeing adoption

00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:25,650
expanding to the smaller and more nimble

00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:28,040
cloud and high-performance scientific

00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:28,040
cloud

00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:36,780
so why do way what's what's motivating

00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:39,140
us to go for 100 gbps it's because we're

00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:43,050
actually generating a lot of data

00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:46,740
according to the then google CEO eric

00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:50,400
schmidt so Eric Schmidt said in 2010

00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:53,490
that the amount of data that we generate

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:56,600
in two days back then is equivalent to

00:02:53,490 --> 00:03:02,520
everything that we generated up till

00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:06,170
2003 so fast forward not till now we're

00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:10,050
generating even more data and data

00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:12,390
static data actually has little value so

00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:16,050
only when you crunch the data and

00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:20,010
analyze them and really derive insights

00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:22,770
the data is very useful so in order to

00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:26,340
do any data analytics you pretty much

00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:31,290
need to move the data and mellanox we

00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:35,400
enable the fastest data movement and to

00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:38,250
push science and technology to the next

00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:41,489
level to the new frontier we really need

00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:44,370
computing power that's five to five

00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:48,030
hundred to a thousand times more capable

00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:51,540
than today's super computer and what we

00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:55,830
have done so far is going from SMP to a

00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:58,920
clustered architecture from single core

00:03:55,830 --> 00:04:02,850
to multi-core but to really push

00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:05,220
performance to the next level doing the

00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:08,100
same thing just doesn't cut it anymore

00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:15,080
we really need a culture change so

00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:19,080
that's what we call the code design um

00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:23,730
so I think there is a famous venture

00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:26,600
capitalist from andreessen horowitz Marc

00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:29,970
Andreessen he said something famous in

00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:34,260
2011 he said software is eating the

00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:37,200
world and fast forward a few years this

00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:40,430
phrase is updated do you know do you

00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:44,430
guys know what's appended to that

00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:49,520
so it's software is eating the world but

00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:52,410
open source is chewing it up so

00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:55,050
basically if you look at some of the

00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:58,680
most innovative software development

00:04:55,050 --> 00:05:01,020
area it's pretty much all software open

00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:06,990
source based like OpenStack like

00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:10,830
containers and darker etc so the open

00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:14,010
source open design mindset can really

00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:17,460
inspire collaboration and innovation

00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:20,010
from all sorts of players not only in

00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:24,150
the hardware ecosystem but also in

00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:29,880
software and from the industry to the

00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:34,550
vendors and to the users so at mellanox

00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:38,190
we are a loyal member of open power

00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:40,830
because open power really aligns with

00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:45,000
what we believe so we believe in

00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:47,670
openness open standard open API open

00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:54,110
source open design and that's how you

00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:57,240
can really promote more innovation and

00:05:54,110 --> 00:06:00,390
open power actually proves it then

00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:02,940
because of the open development and the

00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:05,840
collaboration we actually get much

00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:10,820
higher performance on Power Architecture

00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:14,880
and the code design are the co.design

00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:17,190
mindset how can it help us break the

00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:20,010
application latency wall how can we

00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:22,490
shorten the latency if we look at what

00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:25,830
happened in the last 10 years the

00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:29,790
interconnect latency has been reduced

00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:36,360
from around the tens of microseconds to

00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:39,120
about 0.1 microseconds and it used to

00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:41,790
represent about ten percent of the

00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:45,120
overall communication framework latency

00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:46,890
but now because interconnect is getting

00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,150
faster and faster because of

00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:52,650
technological advancement it's only

00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:54,000
representing a very small portion about

00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:57,080
1% of

00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,760
overall communication framework latency

00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:02,570
but going forward I mean right now we

00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:06,150
only have zero point one microsecond if

00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:09,060
mellanox work ourselves to death we cut

00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:12,930
that number 20 it won't make a big

00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:16,230
impact so the solution the answer is

00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:21,840
really in code design so how can we move

00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:24,960
some of the functionality to from the

00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:29,700
for example the CPU to the interconnect

00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:32,640
and do things more efficiently so I have

00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:35,190
a just to give an analogy I had a

00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:39,210
co-worker so I'm from the San Francisco

00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:42,300
Bay Area I had a co-worker who lives in

00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:46,500
Santa Cruz and to commute to Silicon

00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:50,910
Valley is about an hour each way and in

00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:55,590
the pre-2007 days that's pre iphone days

00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:57,330
it was a torture for him because he

00:07:55,590 --> 00:08:00,510
couldn't really do anything while he was

00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:03,330
driving and he went through all the

00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:06,360
audio books in that he likes in four

00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:08,490
years and then he quit and found a job

00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:13,260
locally in santa cruz because he just

00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:16,169
couldn't take it anymore but in 2007 and

00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:23,520
onward the smartphone got connected and

00:08:16,169 --> 00:08:25,590
God created so as of 2010 he returned

00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:29,340
back to Silicon Valley working for

00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:32,849
google and now he takes a bus a shadow

00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:35,280
from Santa Cruz to Google campus so on

00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:37,469
the bus itself he could actually do a

00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:41,729
lot of work because they have Wi-Fi and

00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:44,970
everything so similarly if you can

00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:49,560
actually do a lot of the processing work

00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:51,540
when you're moving the data first it's

00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:58,410
more efficient and second you can move

00:08:51,540 --> 00:09:01,020
less data in this process so this is

00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:04,020
just a picture illustrating that we need

00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:07,320
more smarts and intelligence in the

00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:07,750
interconnect itself to be able to get us

00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:14,650
to

00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:18,250
the next level so this is a Kinect x5 is

00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:22,390
our next generation Nick cart so it

00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:26,050
supports the capi architecture that

00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:28,990
Bruce talked about and this greatly

00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:32,440
simplifies the memory management between

00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:36,490
the CPU and the coprocessor and the

00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:38,980
interconnect and also it provides a new

00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:42,220
level of integration that removes

00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:46,120
additional latency and so we could

00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:50,050
actually support collective offload in

00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:53,620
the Nick so that the kinect collective

00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:58,600
all flow can happen for all the workload

00:09:53,620 --> 00:10:00,910
in the same host and next we are

00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:04,390
actually going to introduce our next

00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:08,290
generation switch so this is also the

00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:10,870
world's first smart switch so instead of

00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:14,650
just doing the collective type of

00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:17,880
offload in the Nick itself we can

00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:21,610
actually do that in the switch so that

00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:25,900
even if you're collecting results and

00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:28,300
data from multiple nodes you can still

00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:33,250
finish the collective offload before it

00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:35,740
hits the head node and this is the name

00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:38,320
of the technology that supports this

00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:40,360
kind of offload is called sharp the

00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:44,380
scalable hierarchical aggregation

00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:48,010
protocol so the the effect is actually

00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:51,970
very obvious by offloading the MPI

00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:55,180
operations from the CPU itself to the

00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:58,810
network we actually can deliver more

00:10:55,180 --> 00:11:01,420
than 10 times of the performance so this

00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:05,710
is one of the benchmark the mini fe

00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:10,750
benchmark we are comparing the latency

00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:16,750
of cpu-based mvi approach mpi approach

00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:20,650
to more of a sharp based approach so at

00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:21,550
32 node cluster the difference is about

00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:25,180
tenfold

00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:28,870
so the latency of cpu-based is about

00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:32,230
tenfold of the smart collective afloat

00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:35,260
that offers offered by mellanox and when

00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:38,649
we grow the cluster to about 8k nodes

00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:43,269
the effect is more pronounced so we're

00:11:38,649 --> 00:11:46,720
seeing about 25 times a difference in

00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:49,660
terms of latency so this is just another

00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:53,470
set of benchmark the openfoam

00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:58,980
application we are seeing about 2.2

00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:58,980
times of improvement in terms of latency

00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:06,850
so how many of you actually know that

00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:12,730
mellanox also does Ethernet switches

00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:16,570
instead of okay okay great so basically

00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:18,040
like I think we did such a good job in

00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:20,620
high performance computing and

00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:22,600
infiniband that most of people still

00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:25,390
believe we are an infinite Bank company

00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:28,420
but our Ethernet business is actually

00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:30,760
the fastest growing sector because we're

00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:35,829
selling to a lot of the hyper skill

00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:38,770
players and this is our latest ethernet

00:12:35,829 --> 00:12:42,399
switch that supports any port speed from

00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:44,800
10 to 25 40 50 up to 100 so it's

00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:49,870
actually on par with what we could offer

00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:53,320
on InfiniBand and also in the beginning

00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:56,200
I talked about mellanox is a big

00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:59,350
believer of openness and in our

00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:01,110
hyperscale customers we see that they

00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:03,730
are doing a lot of infrastructure

00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:07,240
disaggregation and in terms of

00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:11,230
networking they not they actually want

00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:13,560
to disaggregate the switch operating

00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:16,510
system from the switch hardware itself

00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:18,699
so they can either write their own

00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:22,089
switch operating system to maintain the

00:13:18,699 --> 00:13:25,630
consistency or they could actually

00:13:22,089 --> 00:13:29,829
select from multiple switch operating

00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:32,829
system software vendors so and mellanox

00:13:29,829 --> 00:13:34,889
we support obes ernet so basically on

00:13:32,829 --> 00:13:38,220
our spectrum switch we

00:13:34,889 --> 00:13:42,049
actually run multiple switch operating

00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:46,649
systems we can run for example the edger

00:13:42,049 --> 00:13:48,629
the is called Sonic so basically it's a

00:13:46,649 --> 00:13:51,689
switch operating system that's using

00:13:48,629 --> 00:13:55,379
Microsoft Azure we can also run cumulus

00:13:51,689 --> 00:13:57,989
Linux we can run our own mellanox OS we

00:13:55,379 --> 00:14:03,089
can run HP I mean it's on called open

00:13:57,989 --> 00:14:06,119
switch etc etc so aside from the great

00:14:03,089 --> 00:14:07,790
performance that's we can provide we

00:14:06,119 --> 00:14:12,119
also provide you the greatest

00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:16,439
flexibility and in terms of upgrading

00:14:12,119 --> 00:14:20,220
from your existing 10g 225g from your

00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:25,529
10g down link for DG uplink 225g

00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:28,649
downlink 100g uplink basically 2.5 times

00:14:25,529 --> 00:14:32,449
of the performance you actually don't

00:14:28,649 --> 00:14:38,910
need any cable changes it's a very easy

00:14:32,449 --> 00:14:41,519
upgrade so as a summary we are a strong

00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:43,919
supporter of open power because we

00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:47,249
believe that only the opening ecosystem

00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:51,149
can inspire innovations and to meet our

00:14:47,249 --> 00:14:53,790
customers need and we believe that the

00:14:51,149 --> 00:14:55,709
intelligence to really get us to the

00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:57,799
next level in terms of boosting

00:14:55,709 --> 00:15:02,519
application performance and scalability

00:14:57,799 --> 00:15:05,790
we need a code design approach and move

00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:08,819
more intelligence to the interconnect to

00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:11,119
choose the coprocessor etc thank you

00:15:08,819 --> 00:15:11,119
everyone

00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,020
you

00:15:29,089 --> 00:15:31,389
