I'm Steve fields from IBM I'll do a

00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,540
little bit of discussion of some of the

00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,849
recent exciting announcements we've had

00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:24,680
and then Ronnie Barker also from IBM

00:00:22,849 --> 00:00:26,660
will pick up the mic and she'll talk

00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:28,279
about what's coming in a roadmap if you

00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:29,930
haven't met Ronnie get the newer today

00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:31,070
she's been a great add to our team over

00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:32,930
the last few months and she's going to

00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:35,269
do great things for open power so we're

00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:36,590
really excited to be here with her so

00:00:35,269 --> 00:00:37,910
I'm going to talk a little bit of as I

00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:39,620
said about some of the recent

00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:41,540
announcements mostly focused around high

00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:43,250
speed interfaces and Ronnie's going to

00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:47,000
talk about the power of map and power 9

00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:48,799
specifically so I think you all know

00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,920
there's some pre big trend sweeping in

00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:55,729
the industry right now that the demands

00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:57,290
of data and compute our are putting some

00:00:55,729 --> 00:00:59,989
pretty enormous requirements on hardware

00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:01,400
performance new memory technologies are

00:00:59,989 --> 00:01:04,309
going to reshape the economics of data

00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:06,470
centers micro processors are not getting

00:01:04,309 --> 00:01:08,689
it done with respect to cost performance

00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:11,810
generation to generation we're on a much

00:01:08,689 --> 00:01:13,189
slower curve than we once were and to

00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:15,050
top it all off none of us are getting

00:01:13,189 --> 00:01:18,350
bigger budgets so something's got to

00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:21,620
change are one of the approaches we've

00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:23,870
taken within the open power community as

00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:26,470
many of you know is to open up new

00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:28,910
on-ramps into our processors to allow

00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:30,200
accelerators and other devices to

00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:32,390
integrate into the system where natively

00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,620
and deliver more efficiency and

00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:35,630
ultimately more performance for lower

00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:36,830
costs so one of the exciting

00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:38,510
announcements we've had in the past

00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:40,700
couple of months was partnering with

00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:42,740
NVIDIA we announced an env link

00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:45,260
interface on a new version of the power

00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:48,350
8 microprocessor so its power 8 with MV

00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:49,970
link breaking the performance of the

00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:52,130
bandwidth bottleneck between the CPU and

00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:54,260
the GPU allowing the GPU to get full

00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:56,000
access to system memory allowing the CPU

00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:59,659
and the GPU to interact intelligently

00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,100
and efficiently now we've within IBM

00:01:59,659 --> 00:02:04,370
we've built a lot of great things over

00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:06,260
the years this is by far the best take

00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:07,750
off take up we've ever had on anything

00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:11,090
new we've introduced in the market

00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:12,739
everywhere we go we show this the new

00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:14,599
interfaces the new systems with them

00:02:12,739 --> 00:02:17,540
there's a lot of excitement there

00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:19,400
because the PCI van with bottleneck has

00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:20,740
been a challenge for many people for a

00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,930
lot of years

00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:25,690
the other thing John mentioned already

00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:27,970
is the launch of open Cappy this

00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:31,240
happened earlier this month a couple

00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:33,190
weeks ago as we looked at the progress

00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:35,980
we've made together with with many of

00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:38,830
you on driving Cappy value into the

00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:40,690
market it was clear we needed to take it

00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:45,820
to the next level both on a performance

00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:47,500
basis and an ecosystem basis so created

00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:50,770
a brand new interface that will be on

00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:52,870
our power 9 microprocessor 25 gigabit so

00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:57,040
much higher bandwidth and then Cappy

00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:59,430
over pci and lower latency the protocols

00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:02,380
totally streamlined to allow a

00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:04,270
lightweight layer in an accelerator

00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:05,800
device make it easier to build an

00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:09,640
accelerator device and get it get it

00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:11,620
integrated onto the interface so we'll

00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:13,990
get lots of new capabilities with open

00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:16,360
Cappy from a technical perspective but

00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:19,600
probably the bigger impact of what we

00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:21,130
did is opening it up to not just the

00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:23,020
power architecture but a broader

00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:28,240
ecosystem so we could pull in partners

00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:29,830
like Dell like HPE like AMD to help us

00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:34,180
create this accelerated world that we've

00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:35,620
all been working so hard for a lot a lot

00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:37,780
of discussions leading up to this event

00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:40,660
that led to these these partnerships and

00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:42,100
these members joining much like the

00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:45,550
early days of open power we're seeing

00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:47,560
seeing new members join every day so a

00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:49,720
lot of interest out there and clearly a

00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:53,830
lot of pent up demand for for interface

00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:57,100
like this in the area of attaching

00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:58,840
storage class memories we did a demo

00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:00,730
Adam mcpadden who they think is here

00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,910
somewhere did a demo at April at the US

00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:06,120
Open Power Summit showing storage

00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:08,320
questions showing ever spin imbrium

00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,270
running in a server slot we've got a

00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:13,330
more advanced version of that demo that

00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:15,880
will happen here at this event so this

00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:17,680
will be the this is the first real

00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:20,200
example of a storage class memory in the

00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:23,560
industry running as system memory and a

00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:25,870
server publicly so that's very exciting

00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:28,140
and lots more to come so with that will

00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:28,140
bring up

00:04:42,969 --> 00:04:44,999
