matters that's very strange title and I

00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:34,610
will try to make this work shut up on

00:00:28,789 --> 00:00:40,100
you yeah what the young I'm done that's

00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:43,370
a Star Wars sport okay now first water

evolution Wow what does it mean ok let's

00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:49,489
go through the agenda Oh Izzy for and I

00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:52,220
am with e4 computer engineering what is

00:00:49,489 --> 00:00:54,949
innovation in e4 why we call this

00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:58,460
presentation fast forward and we're from

00:00:54,949 --> 00:01:02,930
now final feel free to drop by in our

00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:06,560
boot when will open we are happy to talk

00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:09,740
with you guys now the company we are a

00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:14,450
small relatively small system integrator

00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:16,940
in italy founded in 2002 we pride

00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:20,540
ourself to be the best system integrator

00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:23,600
or all over the world and we bring new

00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:26,690
products to fruition new products is the

00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:30,080
key is the link is the life of our

00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:32,960
company I let you read we are basically

00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:38,560
focusing on anything which may innovate

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:44,780
in our customer base our core values are

00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:47,900
you see where there I can I let you read

00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:49,960
but you know we are ethically we pride

00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:52,490
ourself to be an ethical company and

00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:55,909
some are some key figures we were

00:01:52,490 --> 00:02:00,140
founded in 2002 to we have more than 50

00:01:55,909 --> 00:02:03,340
employees and so on we stole a thousand

00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:08,000
of unit at cerner and as you can see

00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:10,429
seventy percent of our staff is devoted

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,209
that we r and d is possibly the largest

00:02:10,429 --> 00:02:16,430
share all over the world but what is

00:02:14,209 --> 00:02:18,680
because we want to have our novelty

00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:21,819
products we want to innovate we want to

00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:26,040
bring innovation to our customers

00:02:21,819 --> 00:02:30,069
and here are some very quick milestone

00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:34,450
in 2002 5 we started the first infinite

00:02:30,069 --> 00:02:39,849
in cluster then moving on we have been

00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:45,599
on top of any innovation wave and last

00:02:39,849 --> 00:02:52,019
but not least we have install aid a

00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:57,430
first open power server in 2016 and in

00:02:52,019 --> 00:03:01,030
2017 we will have a I possibly a large

00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:03,719
cluster as you can see there we have

00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:07,840
been on at the top of any technology

00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:10,269
wave of for innovation and what means to

00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:13,840
us basically is trying to understand

00:03:10,269 --> 00:03:17,069
what is the most important innovation

00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:20,019
that the technology is providing is

00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:21,819
either finding new applications for

00:03:20,019 --> 00:03:25,239
existing technology or the one day or

00:03:21,819 --> 00:03:27,669
the other way around and then test

00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:30,489
validate and deploy so bring to market

00:03:27,669 --> 00:03:32,590
to what the innovation is and we

00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:36,099
listening to our customers so we are not

00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:38,590
just developing in a sort of black box

00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:40,750
we want to listen to our customer what

00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:43,209
they are looking for whatever light wave

00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:45,250
and whatever so these are two

00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:51,340
degree-of-freedom innovation and

00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:55,449
listening to customer is our DNA and we

00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:57,699
think that x86 is the current technology

00:03:55,449 --> 00:04:02,680
with the lever we sell a product based

00:03:57,699 --> 00:04:06,159
on x86 power is technology as of now but

00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:09,430
open power in now means innovation open

00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:11,859
power is open and teases the key values

00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:15,099
of the customer are not locket to a

00:04:11,859 --> 00:04:18,310
specific vendor as it happens right now

00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:21,459
but it can source it's a solution from

00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:24,400
different vendors so open it's an oddity

00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:26,409
but production-oriented there are a lot

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,990
of innovative things which just doesn't

00:04:26,409 --> 00:04:32,040
work we don't want to be there we want

00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:36,120
to deliver work working in your way

00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:39,600
and I don't think our us friends

00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:42,410
understand is it is a giant provocateur

00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,580
in in a stagnant world as of now

00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:47,730
innovation has been basically zero in

00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:52,320
the last ten years everybody is going to

00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:55,380
SC or I guess see you see the same the

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:58,320
same stuff all over the world all over

00:04:55,380 --> 00:05:02,010
the show floor the same structure the

00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:04,620
same notes the same InfiniBand cluster

00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:08,300
or whatever so in with this newer

00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:13,350
platform this is bring innovation to a

00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:16,040
very stagnant world and before for

00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:18,750
business reason is and will remain

00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:21,960
hardware agnostic we will continue to

00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:24,390
have our current proline we will stay in

00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:27,720
the same technology curve as the

00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:30,180
provider of our systems but at the same

00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:33,120
time we are building confidence that

00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:36,720
open power is the way to go for the

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:41,460
future and for for good for good reasons

00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:44,040
I mean the first one is defeated all the

00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:46,920
good technical features that our

00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:49,620
customers are looking for are there open

00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:53,840
published providing what the customer in

00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:53,840
the market are looking for natively

00:05:56,950 --> 00:06:06,830
sorry you have a point with the tour

00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:12,040
could come to our boat that's a sort of

00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:16,820
message to our friend with IBM okay

00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:23,500
because it needs a brinks innovations in

00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:26,870
what is now a very boring world it it is

00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:29,210
looking well the market is looking for

00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:32,870
the new solution and we will see a bit

00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:34,540
later and last modernise is very cool I

00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:36,680
mean everybody's talking about that

00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:40,150
everybody is trying to have something

00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:46,610
new in his computer centers on chinese

00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:49,550
place now we have to to agree on a way

00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:51,560
forward so we have the community right

00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:55,790
now which is engaged in this new

00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:58,040
exciting project we have products

00:06:55,790 --> 00:07:00,620
already working or it install it and

00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:03,380
keep feel free to drop in our booth to

00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:06,340
see them and we are at the very

00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:10,700
beginning of a major technological

00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:14,180
transition so the consumption how they

00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:17,570
compute of the power is used is on on

00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:19,070
the edge of a transition and you can see

00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:21,020
there are a couple of words you know

00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:23,900
their passwords where everybody can

00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:26,630
agree but we are experienced in this

00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:28,490
moment we are really at the beginning of

00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:31,970
the transition of technology and we have

00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:35,540
to stay on top of it we have to stop it

00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:38,240
we have to stop thinking the old way and

00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:41,720
we have to start again new way and and

00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:46,430
taste moment these days are the right

00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:48,919
time to jump in tis new technologies in

00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:52,190
and to go full steam head in front of us

00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:54,650
with this new product what's missing

00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:58,700
what we feel as a system integrator is

00:07:54,650 --> 00:08:03,169
missing is basically the usual suspects

00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:06,820
third party is v's calls we feel that

00:08:03,169 --> 00:08:09,550
the the architecture needs

00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:12,810
so as soon as we can to go full steam in

00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:16,300
the into manufacturing planning

00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:17,530
engineering automotive with this

00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:19,330
application without third-party

00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:23,500
application and you can name whatever

00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:26,530
you want you won't make a major strike

00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:30,400
in in this market so we need this we

00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:35,050
need to have these applications portal

00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:38,020
in available now that I pick a bit of

00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:40,900
you know self advertising we have a boot

00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:45,810
we will off to talk with our customers

00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:48,520
feel free to drop by we are keen to

00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:51,520
listen to what you say we are keen to

00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:54,940
talk with partners we want to create our

00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:57,370
own ecosystem on top of open power so we

00:08:54,940 --> 00:09:01,090
will listen you and the right notes and

00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:04,060
endured the rest the contacts are here

very strange name of this one or our

00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:15,910
city of which is somewhere it is city

00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:18,480
and if you have any questions thank you
