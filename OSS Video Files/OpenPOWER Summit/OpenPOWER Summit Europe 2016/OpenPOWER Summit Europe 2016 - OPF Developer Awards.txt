how is the day going for everybody good

00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:27,550
all right good uh-huh no we're short

00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:29,410
short fuse is all that's left I want to

00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:31,300
talk about for the second something

00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:34,750
we're very excited six months ago we

00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:38,890
started the developer challenge a great

00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:42,129
set of contestants put forward their

00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:43,390
ideas from all around the world mapping

00:00:42,129 --> 00:00:47,050
to everything we've been talking about

00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:49,570
today AI machine learning big data data

00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:52,620
analytics all sorts of industries all

00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:55,059
sorts of geographies commercial entrants

00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:57,340
people from the University students

00:00:55,059 --> 00:00:59,800
individuals and we had three

00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:01,899
competitions the open road test which

00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:04,899
was really anything goes whoever wanted

00:01:01,899 --> 00:01:09,190
to try it you proposed what you did we

00:01:04,899 --> 00:01:16,240
evaluated the code spark some great

00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:17,650
ideas and the AI sort of cup I was

00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:21,430
really impressed I was part of the

00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:22,960
review team I was like this could be 555

00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:26,470
105 you know there were a lot of

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,780
evaluations to work our way through but

00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:30,570
over six months we did it and we got to

00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:33,340
today where we're announcing the winners

00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:36,130
and let me walk through a couple of each

00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:40,930
one of them the open road test from the

00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:44,380
Netherlands was basically genomics very

00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:48,270
interesting the spark rally was

00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:53,110
interesting out of Canada it was a 911

00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:55,630
solution in the cup we actually had so

00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:58,479
much good interest that we couldn't pick

00:01:55,630 --> 00:02:00,969
one winner we bent or broke or

00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:05,500
completely ignore the rules and pick two

00:02:00,969 --> 00:02:10,060
winners something in the cancer space

00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:13,600
tensorflow and that team was out of the

00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:15,640
US and the valley and this one I love

00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,590
because it's a little outside our normal

00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,959
comfort zone here in terms of what we

00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:23,640
all talk about as technologists how to

00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:28,230
pick art and by art with an AI people

00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:33,360
learning solution very cool it was out

00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:36,720
of Papa India so we are going to be at

00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:39,780

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,010
week of November 14th where each one of

00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,620
the winners are going to have an

00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:47,330
opportunity to demonstrate what they've

00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:50,790

contestants so I wanted to just give a

00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:04,130
virtual round of applause to them and

00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:04,130
