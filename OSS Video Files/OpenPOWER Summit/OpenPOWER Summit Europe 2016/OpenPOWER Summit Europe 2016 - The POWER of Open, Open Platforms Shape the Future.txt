good afternoon ooh let's do the slower

00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:26,990
but at least everyone is awake now so my

00:00:23,869 --> 00:00:28,970
name is Gil Craven i'm here from coal up

00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:31,550
systems AG in fact you just source on

00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:34,100
that one slide we are one of three I

00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:36,910
believe open power foundation members in

00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:42,379
Switzerland we just joined this year and

00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:45,110
I was planning to talk to you I have a

00:00:42,379 --> 00:00:50,449
bit of an echo here to talk to you about

00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:52,670
our journey into open power how did we

00:00:50,449 --> 00:00:55,549
get here and what did we find in our

00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:58,549
perspective as to where we see the value

00:00:55,549 --> 00:01:00,199
in the open power foundation and it's a

00:00:58,549 --> 00:01:03,010
strategic value that I want to talk

00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:05,269
about to you now we came to power

00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:07,430
through the best of all possible ways

00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:10,460
which is business we had a request

00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:13,070
through IBM actually with a joint power

00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:15,110
installation somewhere where they said

00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:18,410
well their customers already on coal app

00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:21,320
but they won't call up on power can they

00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:25,010
do that and so that was how we

00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:28,310
technically got involved but it really

00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:30,290
didn't end there and all this I'm hooked

00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:32,390
very much to my own background which is

00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:34,880
with the open technology world i mean i

00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:37,040
i've been in the open source world and

00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:41,360
open standards world for the past 20

00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:43,430
years or so now let me briefly say who

00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,800
we are so collapse systems a swiss

00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:48,890
business we headquartered in Zurich and

00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:51,710
our team is European in fact we are

00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:55,940
extra key European business and in our

00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:59,450
sphere of what we do the only one we

00:01:55,940 --> 00:02:01,490
have no us money no US influence in the

00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:03,490
business in fact we've kept it strictly

00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:06,110
European and built it up from the ground

00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:09,860
from our backgrounds in Germany which

00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:12,650
you will see at this point in time we

00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:14,480
have our headquarters in Zurich that's

00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:17,060
where core development is the senior

00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,220
team is there that's where in fact all

00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:21,700
the management team is sitting as well

00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:23,620
we have a sales team in Vienna

00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:26,050
an office in Berlin where we have a

00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:28,450
support center and also some sales staff

00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:30,069
and a design team in the UK which in

00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:35,140
fact also helped me with that

00:02:30,069 --> 00:02:37,959
presentation what we do is very simple

00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:40,000
its collaboration software um it's the

00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:42,970
bread and butter for virtually anyone um

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,099
it's the system that always must work it

00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:47,709
is virtually always mission-critical it

00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:50,349
starts from email which is still growing

00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:53,349
at an amazing rate over calendar and

00:02:50,349 --> 00:02:55,090
tasks and notes and all the things that

00:02:53,349 --> 00:02:58,420
you do in order to collaborate with each

00:02:55,090 --> 00:03:00,750
other in fact we're growing along that

00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:02,680
trend with document collaboration

00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:07,120
real-time features and all these things

00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:09,970
coming and we do all of that in a highly

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,670
secure fashion Oh fire cloud of course

00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:14,170
all these kind of things so products

00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:18,360
that you will know that do similar

00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:23,349
things to us is a microsoft exchange

00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:25,150
office 365 Google Apps only that we take

00:03:23,349 --> 00:03:29,139
a different approach to this because we

00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:32,799
are a pure 100% open-source company

00:03:29,139 --> 00:03:37,870
always have been from the start our

00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:40,269
mission as a team as a company is to

00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:43,450
design and deliver a complete and

00:03:40,269 --> 00:03:45,609
intuitive collaboration solution and we

00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:50,230
do this through technology that is open

00:03:45,609 --> 00:03:52,450
private and secure we want this to be

00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:54,489
available to everyone because we believe

00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:57,730
it's actually a human fundamental need

00:03:54,489 --> 00:04:00,069
to be able to collaborate and we target

00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:04,380
all levels of society with the offering

00:04:00,069 --> 00:04:08,170
so we had general service provider our

00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:12,760
timeline dates back quite a while we

00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:15,220
started out with a solution in 2003 when

00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:18,039
the German Federal Office for IT

00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:20,799
security needed a collaboration solution

00:04:18,039 --> 00:04:23,710
that they could trust and in fact trust

00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:26,650
to the mint fully open interoperable and

00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:28,360
fully auditable as well so they found

00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:31,690
nothing in the market they tended loud

00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:33,670
and three companies warm that bid and

00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:36,370
then built what became

00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:41,170
hola and Koloff is being used at the BSI

00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:45,490
until today myself I started around here

00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:48,040
with colab in 2010 when we took the

00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:50,410
technology and spun it out from the BSI

00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:53,110
into its own company based in

00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:56,530
Switzerland to deliver this as a product

00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:58,900
and a service later on and of course

00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:01,350
then we joined the open power foundation

00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:04,210
but it's important to understand that

00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:09,580
our background has always been very much

00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:12,810
with the security field our values as a

00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:17,770
business as a team are centered around

00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:20,920
openness around privacy around security

00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:23,530
and scalability co-op has always been

00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:27,630
extremely highly scalable we have large

00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:30,220
installations 120,000 users and up and

00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:33,670
we've always had a micro service

00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:35,560
architecture and we've also been one of

00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:38,640
the first to adopt the no sequel storage

00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:44,680
methodology in the beginning actually

00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:47,380
that's the technical side we have in the

00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:50,140
business side an application service

00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:52,300
provider business side where we have our

00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:55,390
own software as a service instance that

00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:57,520
we are running with our own staff from a

00:05:55,390 --> 00:06:00,700
data center under our own control in a

00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:03,340
cage with our own hardware and deliver

00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:05,770
it to anyone who wants it we also work

00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:08,110
with application service providers such

00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:10,510
as a Vectra switch is one of the five

00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:13,120
largest microsoft platinum partners in a

00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:18,670
very large asp in switzerland with about

00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:20,350
400 in staff they are initially from the

00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:22,540
energy company so the energy companies

00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:24,820
pulled their IT departments and that is

00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:27,790
how they get started so for instance at

00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:29,650
this point in time the energy company of

00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:32,860
the canton of zurich is running coal up

00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:34,900
with the vectra's and we have our

00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:38,050
professional services department which

00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:40,020
then people use to run this on-premise

00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:43,750
right so cantar go is part of the reason

00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:45,790
so this is tri modal transport or the

00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:48,010
city of munich which is a fair

00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:50,500
well known reference of hours with about

00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:53,980
sixty thousand users using our system on

00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:55,960
premise there we support it in the third

00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:58,720
level typically with a partner in the

00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:00,490
second level and the local installation

00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:04,120
the IT people do the first level for us

00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:08,590
so very classical IT business we are in

00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:10,960
is V effectively so how did we end up in

00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:15,520
the open power foundation which is very

00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:20,850
hardware centric right and that question

00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:25,900
has to do with the interplay between

00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:29,110
security and trust and transparency you

00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:32,230
see security is essential to all our

00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:35,590
clients I mean if cantar go and the mmm

00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:37,990
has has an issue with their data set and

00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:40,420
that data leaks they say well maybe our

00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:43,630
own data is not an important but if we

00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:45,930
ship so many tons of chemicals from

00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:48,640
place a to place be for that company

00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:51,730
then their competitors would be able to

00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:53,770
draw a lot of um you know inference from

00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:56,290
that information that information has a

00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:58,600
value to our clients which is why we

00:07:56,290 --> 00:08:01,540
need to protect it I mean it is the

00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:03,550
nature of our systems in fact that if

00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:05,200
you have access to that kind of data you

00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:07,030
know virtually everything about the

00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:09,340
company what people are thinking about

00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:10,900
who they are talking to who they know

00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:12,580
where they have been and where they will

00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:15,370
be whom they are meeting you will know

00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:19,570
it all so protecting that information is

00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:24,340
central to all our clients now security

00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:26,620
is tricky right you want to verify as

00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:29,560
much as possible but if you were to

00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:31,960
verify everything all the time every

00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:35,169
step along the way it would drive you

00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:38,979
mad there's no way you could do this you

00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:43,000
must make assumptions about whom to

00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:44,290
trust were to place your trust um for

00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,360
instance in this case I mean that's

00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:49,570
actually my family over them in fact it

00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:51,880
the most important part of my family yes

00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:55,030
very very tidy and this is the trip

00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:56,440
bridge in the bernese oberland so and

00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:59,740
there's a couple of hundred metres below

00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:04,570
that bridge of nothingness right it's on

00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:07,390
glacier level before you trust in this

00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:08,830
bridge right like if you want to know

00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:10,720
that that purchase secure you need to

00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:12,750
trust that the engineer so build it

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,220
actually knew what they were doing and

00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:17,680
you know in Switzerland I think that's a

00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:20,050
very reasonable you know trust to have

00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:23,740
it's my experience I trust into its

00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:27,420
engineering in other countries maybe not

00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:30,550
so but what I'm trying to get across is

00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:33,280
security is always a question of trust

00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:37,300
where do I place it and where do I

00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:39,970
derive it from now Switzerland also has

00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:42,580
an amazing system of public record and

00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:44,470
transparency but it starts from the fact

00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:46,270
before anything is built they put up

00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:48,160
profiles to show where the buildings

00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:50,080
will be so anyone can go there and see

00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,610
what is being built there and you can

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,040
actually give your input if you disagree

00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:56,020
with that building going there and you

00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:57,970
think you have a case you can say

00:09:56,020 --> 00:10:00,010
something about it you can change how

00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:05,530
things are being done transparency is

00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:08,950
part of the system so where where do i

00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:11,080
get trust right I mean I for security to

00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:13,240
work I need trust but where do i get

00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:18,130
trust there's very fundamental models

00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:22,060
about how to obtain trust one is very

00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:26,890
old and well known its belief right i

00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:28,720
can just believe that I can trust I may

00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:31,810
not be able to understand but I may

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,430
believe that I can trust this um and

00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:35,950
it's fair enough I mean it simplifies

00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:40,089
life right without trust life would be

00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:44,350
too complicated the question is is that

00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:48,160
really the level of trust we want to

00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:50,890
apply to something as center of our most

00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:56,670
central and most crucial most valuable

00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:59,560
information I myself am a physicist so

00:10:56,670 --> 00:11:01,420
Richard Feynman is obviously one of my

00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:05,980
heroes and therefore

00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:09,460
I believe I'm rather with him I want to

00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:10,900
be able to understand what goes in there

00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:22,090
in order for me to make an informed

00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:27,340
decision about trust now the x86 world

00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:29,080
is much more on the previous slides the

00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:32,620
religious dogma because I just have to

00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:34,660
trust without being able to verify

00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:36,670
without knowing what is happening in

00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:38,980
there in fact I know that there are

00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:41,230
things in there that I cannot control I

00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:43,120
cannot even take control over them and

00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:46,810
that's been a debate in the open source

00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:48,820
world for a very very long time to us

00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:52,150
that's always been an issue but one that

00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:58,020
we saw no good solution to which is why

00:11:52,150 --> 00:12:00,940
many people just accepted it until now

00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:03,220
and this is what I realized when I

00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:06,510
stumbled upon open power because it's

00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:09,160
been a very well-kept secret I must say

00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:12,700
I'm sorry but you managed to hide it

00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:16,480
extremely good because I like in the

00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:19,120
open source community in which I am day

00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:21,400
in day out most people had never heard

00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:25,720
of this they didn't even know this

00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:27,670
existed and to me that was interesting

00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:30,480
and a shock and I realized there is a

00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:33,730
disconnect here that needs to be bridged

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:36,100
because for me the big selling points

00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:37,810
the ones that go beyond technology which

00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:40,510
is awesome in technology is fantastic

00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:43,540
right i mean it is better but it is also

00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:45,520
standing for different values it has

00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:48,370
that particular moment where something

00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:50,080
is not just the right thing to do but

00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:53,170
also technically better and the other

00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:56,530
way around um and that's you know

00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:58,930
openness control and build your own that

00:12:56,530 --> 00:13:00,610
you have this only open power can right

00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:03,160
now give you this and that for me is

00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:05,650
actually the reason why we said we want

00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:07,810
to be part of this we believe this is

00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:10,480
necessarily the future because we don't

00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:13,949
believe anyone else is in a position to

00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:17,079
make a similar value offering

00:13:13,949 --> 00:13:21,160
so we've done a little road show in fact

00:13:17,079 --> 00:13:23,740
in this case with with IBM and redhat

00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:26,949
together I'm showing for the very first

00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:28,870
time a completely open collaboration

00:13:26,949 --> 00:13:30,519
stack top to bottom from the heart where

00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:32,709
over the operating system all the way to

00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:35,559
the solution so we've done a very nice

00:13:32,709 --> 00:13:40,269
roto together to try to start and spread

00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:50,769
that message and we join the open power

00:13:40,269 --> 00:13:52,480
foundation and we did that thank you we

00:13:50,769 --> 00:13:55,300
did that because we are looking for you

00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:58,269
I mean all of you everyone in this room

00:13:55,300 --> 00:14:00,579
and everyone watching this later because

00:13:58,269 --> 00:14:02,680
we want to be a full part of this

00:14:00,579 --> 00:14:04,509
ecosystem we believe in ecosystems we

00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:06,220
leave in ecosystems innovation that is

00:14:04,509 --> 00:14:09,399
where we come from that is how we work

00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:11,350
that is how we live and we know in order

00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:14,649
to be to be a part of that you need to

00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:17,050
participate we want to help spread the

00:14:14,649 --> 00:14:20,800
word because we don't think that the

00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:22,720
secret should be so well kept we believe

00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,449
that the message needs to get out there

00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,999
which is why I myself find myself very

00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:30,100
often now speaking about the subject in

00:14:27,999 --> 00:14:33,069
different audiences from the FSF II

00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:36,399
summit to my vm events where I'm being

00:14:33,069 --> 00:14:40,600
invited and we're looking for

00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:42,610
like-minded partners anyone who's in a

00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,589
similar mindset is us who wants to work

00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:46,629
with us to make that story come true and

00:14:44,589 --> 00:14:49,420
bring it to fruition we're looking for

00:14:46,629 --> 00:14:51,610
you please approach me thank you very

00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:54,360
much because we want to collaborate in

00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:54,360
confidence

00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,220
