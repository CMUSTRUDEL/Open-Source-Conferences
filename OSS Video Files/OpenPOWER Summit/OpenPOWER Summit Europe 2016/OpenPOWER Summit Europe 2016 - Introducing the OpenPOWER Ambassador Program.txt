well it's a tough one to follow but I

00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:20,820
think I might have something to say

00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:23,340
about helping get the word out it has

00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,320
been a very well kept secret so my name

00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:29,040
is Randall Ross I'm a community manager

00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:31,950
at ubuntu I work for canonical and i'm a

00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:33,570
self acclaimed open power rebel I'm part

00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:36,030
of the rebel force I have been for a

00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:38,870
couple years now just out of curiosity

00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:41,730
how many people have heard of ubuntu oh

00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:44,970
look at that how many people run a boon

00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:47,720
to some almost almost the whole room how

00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:50,790
many people run a boon to on open power

00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:52,320
okay well quite have quite a few people

00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:55,500
still thank you how many people are

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:58,830
rebels everybody all right all right

00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:00,330
good good stuff so um I'm gonna cheat a

00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:02,879
little I have some notes here I want to

00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:05,370
stay on topic so I'm probably the only

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,950
one that is going to get prompted but

00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:10,020
I'm excited to be here today I have an

00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:12,120
announcement to make you're here at the

00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:15,210
world premiere of the open power

00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:17,780
Ambassador Program so you're here seeing

00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:20,610
this program revealed for the first time

00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:22,619
we're making history and you're here to

00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:25,560
hear the story right from the beginning

00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:29,820
so welcome I'm proud to introduce the

00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:33,000
open power ambassador program so I oh

00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:34,890
yeah I'll go back see I don't like words

00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,969
on slides but it kind of burns me

00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:38,369
because then I don't know what the

00:01:35,969 --> 00:01:40,079
slides are about so I have to read so if

00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:42,179
you forget what the slide is about I put

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,369
a prompt at the end of every slide so

00:01:42,179 --> 00:01:45,840
you don't have to read until I get past

00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:47,520
it I know what you're thinking when I

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,740
say Ambassador Program you're probably

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,990
thinking something like this room dry

00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:54,090
stuffy looks kind of like the european

00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,670
union or maybe United Nations but this

00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:59,399
isn't what we envisioned for the

00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:03,270
Ambassador Program this is the the exact

00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:06,810
opposite of what we envisioned we're

00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:09,929
looking for people who want to project a

00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:14,100
fun spirit a sense of collaboration a

00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:18,240
sense of openness not a political board

00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:20,040
of well you can see the photo so the

00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:23,580
opposite this photo fun open and

00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:25,909
game-changing is the goal how many

00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:29,879
people know where this bridge is

00:02:25,909 --> 00:02:32,250
not one person the cameraman knows so

00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:34,319
this is the bridge between Canada United

00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:36,870
States at the Windsor Detroit crossing

00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:40,650
the Ambassador Bridge very appropriate

00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:42,599
bridge for this conversation so we've

00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:46,319
been doing open power now for a few

00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:50,730
years and we're kind of a victim of our

00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:54,780
own success we have so many companies

00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:57,299
involved now so many venues where we

00:02:54,780 --> 00:03:00,629
need to get the word out but so few

00:02:57,299 --> 00:03:01,890
people to help us get the word out so

00:03:00,629 --> 00:03:03,629
what we're going to try and do is we're

00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:05,640
going to try and build a bridge from

00:03:03,629 --> 00:03:07,859
those of us in the foundation who have

00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:10,049
been living and breathing this for a few

00:03:07,859 --> 00:03:13,140
years now to those of you who are

00:03:10,049 --> 00:03:14,849
perhaps lurking outside the foundation

00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:16,590
or maybe just peripheral e involved or

00:03:14,849 --> 00:03:19,890
maybe your friends who aren't involved

00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:22,230
we're going to build a bridge from us to

00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:24,810
all of you and then we are going to help

00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:27,959
you build a similar bridge out to the

00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:30,930
general public so we don't continue to

00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:32,840
hear what we heard George say we're the

00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:35,160
best kept secret in the industry we are

00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:37,650
not going to be the best kept secret in

00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:40,650
the industry for very much longer so

00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:41,970
hopefully everyone in here is ready

00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:49,079
willing and able to help us build a

00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:52,349
bridge there's the cheat notes how many

00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:54,120
people use this radio before nobody yeah

00:03:52,349 --> 00:04:01,709
no one's that knows that old in the room

00:03:54,120 --> 00:04:03,870
I'm almost that old I'm sorry Greg that

00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:05,730
was unrehearsed by the way thanks great

00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:08,370
for putting up your hand actually i

00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:11,730
think i did use this radio once so what

00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:14,000
is the the Ambassador Program it's a

00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:16,560
program designed to spread the reach of

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,530
open power and awareness of open power

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,810
it's designed to equip people much like

00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:23,699
this radio in older years equip people

00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:26,099
with the tools they need to be

00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:29,130
successful in spreading the message and

00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:31,979
evangelizing the project and it's also a

00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:34,200
mechanism to foster closer collaboration

00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:35,550
between birds of a feather we want to

00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,680
get our ambassadors talking to each

00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:38,900
other and we want to get birds of

00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,300
feather sessions set

00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:42,830
so that we can share the messages that

00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:45,169
resonate and the messages that we can

00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:50,449
take to those who don't know about us

00:04:45,169 --> 00:04:53,600
yet okay I'm big on quizzes today does

00:04:50,449 --> 00:04:57,139
anyone know who this man is nobody in

00:04:53,600 --> 00:05:00,830
the room Greg do you know no okay just

00:04:57,139 --> 00:05:03,560
checking so this is blitz meet blitz the

00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:05,210
ambassador that's his real name blitz

00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,800
the ambassador he's a hip-hop artist

00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:10,250
should look him up I think he's from New

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:12,800
Jersey but anyways so I put blitz up on

00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:15,699
the screen because blitz obviously looks

00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,900
like a dynamic and passionate performer

00:05:15,699 --> 00:05:21,410
exactly the type of energy we're looking

00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:22,460
for in our ambassadors but don't worry

00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:24,979
you don't have to be a singer or

00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:26,060
musician you don't have to be blitz but

00:05:24,979 --> 00:05:28,360
we're looking we're definitely looking

00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:32,120
for passion we're looking for energy and

00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:35,690
I think this slide kind of personifies

00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:36,919
that so in a little more real terms

00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:40,430
we're looking for people who have

00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:43,060
demonstrated an ongoing commitment and

00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:45,680
sustained contribution to open power

00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:47,479
those who are aligned obviously with the

00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,729
goals of the foundation and the goals of

00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:52,039
the open power eco system and platform

00:05:49,729 --> 00:05:55,849
and definitely not in a conflict of

00:05:52,039 --> 00:05:58,240
interest that goes without saying those

00:05:55,849 --> 00:06:02,840
who are comfortable being on stage as a

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:05,000
public spokesperson because we tend to

00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:06,500
be on stage often we tend to be in

00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,080
booths we tend to be speaking at events

00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:12,050
so that's a skill we definitely like to

00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:15,139
have if you have or know people who have

00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:19,120
influence in a specific sphere that open

00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:22,070
power touches people who have followers

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,300
Social Credit large audiences maybe

00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:25,699
they've published something maybe

00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:27,789
they've they've got a willing ready and

00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:31,699
able audience then we definitely want to

00:06:27,789 --> 00:06:33,229
try to get them involved and and other

00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:35,720
legal stuff you know they have to be a

00:06:33,229 --> 00:06:40,330
legal age etc etc so that's that's what

00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:44,210
we're looking for someone like blitz

00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:47,979
okay so why on earth would you want to

00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:47,979
be part of it has anyone driven this car

00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:53,440
no one is driven this an ambassador car

00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:55,720
everything in this slide deck is about

00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,129
ambassadors so I had not known there was

00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,199
an ambassador car I think it's out of

00:06:57,129 --> 00:07:00,879
production a long time ago but anyways

00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:03,069
why would you want to be a part of the

00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:06,610
Ambassador Program what is possibly in

00:07:03,069 --> 00:07:08,889
it for you well what we can offer is

00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:11,590
access to open power resources that are

00:07:08,889 --> 00:07:13,740
only available two ambassadors things

00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:16,720
like early access to community resources

00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:20,789
such as compute community cloud

00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:24,699
computing resources things like free or

00:07:20,789 --> 00:07:28,150
heavily discounted passes to shows and

00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:30,219
events we're open power is an exhibitor

00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:33,550
our participant or a partner in some way

00:07:30,219 --> 00:07:37,020
and other goodies that I'll get to later

00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:39,039
on in the endless slides but basically

00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:40,990
you'd want to be a part of it not only

00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,699
to get the free stuff and the access but

00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:45,909
you want to get you want to demonstrate

00:07:42,699 --> 00:07:49,300
your commitment to open power and you

00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:52,659
want to show leadership in your field

00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:54,490
and also get networking opportunities

00:07:52,659 --> 00:07:56,889
with people who are like you people who

00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:59,620
can tell stories like you can two people

00:07:56,889 --> 00:08:04,090
who resonate with the messages that

00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:06,219
we're trying to to share that last slide

00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:07,599
I was there that last bullet point I was

00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:11,919
going to mention that but we can't offer

00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:13,300
you that yet unfortunately okay so now

00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:17,199
I've enticed all of you to become

00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:18,849
ambassadors that's great what is an

00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,400
ambassador what do you expected to do

00:08:18,849 --> 00:08:25,060
well once a year we have a parade in

00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:26,469
Iowa is it I want and just no no no

00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:28,680
nothing like that you don't have to get

00:08:26,469 --> 00:08:31,210
behind a tractor and wave to people

00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:33,579
although it's pretty neat gimmick maybe

00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:35,199
we should try it but what you're

00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:37,390
expected to do is an ambassador is

00:08:35,199 --> 00:08:40,990
demonstrate the values of openness and

00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:43,240
collaboration know and demonstrate the

00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:46,029
open powers foundation they will empower

00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:47,829
foundations goals and mission and be a

00:08:46,029 --> 00:08:50,620
brand ambassador much like a parade

00:08:47,829 --> 00:08:52,899
ambassador represent open power and a

00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:58,280
positive friendly and professional light

00:08:52,899 --> 00:09:03,690
and hopefully no floats with tractors

00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:05,190
okay another ambassador continuing did

00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:07,440
anyone drive this car this is a really

00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:08,790
neat one I don't like where the dog is

00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:14,040
chained but that's a whole different

00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:15,450
story yeah there's that mm-hmm isn't

00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:18,120
there a chubby chaser with something

00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:20,130
like that in it anyways what am I

00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:22,440
expected to do as a ambassador in a

00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:23,850
little more detail the think the types

00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:27,150
of things we envisioned this isn't an

00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:29,940
exhaustive list and this isn't a must do

00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:31,860
everything on the list it's just some

00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:35,040
suggestions of the types of activities

00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:38,370
that I think ambassadors would be useful

00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:40,370
and good at organize and participate in

00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:44,040
activities such as planning sessions

00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:45,720
face-to-face events in your locale so

00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,270
you don't have to necessarily travel too

00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:50,850
much you could do workshops

00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:52,910
presentations organize parties how many

00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:56,400
people have been to an open power party

00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:58,320
nobody there's an up oh one person all

00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:06,000
right there's an opportunity for more

00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:08,700
parties and Greg okay okay right blog

00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:12,900
articles create videos or be in videos

00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:16,080
recruit new open power members represent

00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:19,020
open power at conferences attend open

00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:21,000
power summits think we can all say we've

00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:23,970
done that share your activities with the

00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,250
broader community be big on social

00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:29,640
networks share your photos share your

00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:31,890
stories and check in periodically with

00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:34,650
the program the program directors other

00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:38,070
ambassadors to share best tips practices

00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:40,980
etc so what you get as part of the

00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:42,840
program first no financial compensation

00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:44,520
unfortunately but you do get as I

00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:47,130
mentioned earlier access to open power

00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:50,370
resources complimentary membership in

00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:52,110
the foundation sponsorship opportunities

00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:54,090
if we have open power related events you

00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:56,850
may be compensated for your

00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:58,380
participation in those events you'll get

00:10:56,850 --> 00:11:01,470
marketing materials you get your name on

00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:03,540
the list of official ambassadors access

00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:06,060
to ambassadors online discussion and

00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:07,830
collaboration area and everyone's

00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:10,740
favorite

00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:13,320
it's not on the slide vanity stuff like

00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:15,270
an email alias ambassador business cards

00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,370
and other things you can hang a handout

00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:18,720
and I had to create these because we

00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:21,870
don't have this merchandise yet but

00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,460
we'll get a merchandise kit I swiped

00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:25,980
someone else's and put our logo on it

00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:28,080
and so hopefully you can't so we will be

00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:29,730
putting together a merchandise kit The

00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:31,500
Ambassadors will have access to that kit

00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:37,110
you'll be able to order it for events

00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:38,760
and different opportunities and that's a

00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:41,100
pretty how many people have been to this

00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:44,610
theater nobody don't even know if it

00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:46,140
exists so how do I join so it's a

00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:49,070
multi-step process we're trying to keep

00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:51,210
it as as unbury cratic and as

00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:53,010
community-focused as possible so we've

00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:54,900
taken some of the Ambassador programs

00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:57,810
from other organizations and kind of

00:11:54,900 --> 00:12:02,490
melded them in taking best practices

00:11:57,810 --> 00:12:05,490
from say folks like Mozilla the boon to

00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:07,050
project some of the other foundations we

00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:09,150
looked at but essentially it's a

00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:11,060
nomination process can be self nominated

00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:13,380
or nominated by an open power member

00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:15,690
there's a brief application form

00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:18,240
essentially a wiki page that you modify

00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:20,250
there's a template just state why you

00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,580
want to be ambassador blah blah blah

00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:25,710
fill it out provide some references

00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:28,470
provide a statement and then pass a

00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:29,700
panel review and we have a panel we will

00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:32,750
soon be assembling a panel of

00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:35,790
ambassadors and the program directors to

00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:39,180
vet the incoming applications and grant

00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:43,710
people ambassador status and and then

00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:46,110
you're in easy and you're probably

00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:48,620
saying when pigs fly right when pigs fly

00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:51,690
so when is this program going to be live

00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:54,540
we are soft launching here and now so

00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:56,790
it's essentially live we still have a

00:12:54,540 --> 00:13:00,390
bit of work to do in terms of shaping

00:12:56,790 --> 00:13:02,910
the exact components of the program but

00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:06,330
we will be shaping those over the coming

00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:09,750
month so October November we are going

00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:12,180
to have a birds of feather session at SC

00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:15,120
16 in Salt Lake so if you are there or

00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:17,400
planning to be there please find us

00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,600
we'll put some notifications up on the

00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,819
website

00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:26,329
and we are going to be fully live in

00:13:20,819 --> 00:13:26,329
December so it's right around the corner

00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:31,370
we can't promise you one of these

00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:36,690
hopefully we won't have to stay here we

00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:39,569
can't promise you five star

00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:45,750
accommodations but it'll certainly be

00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:47,160
better than this we hope and I think the

00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:50,160
best part of it is you get to work and

00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:52,019
play with the rebel force and I like to

00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:55,230
like to call them the most fun and

00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:56,310
interesting team in modern computing so

00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:58,620
