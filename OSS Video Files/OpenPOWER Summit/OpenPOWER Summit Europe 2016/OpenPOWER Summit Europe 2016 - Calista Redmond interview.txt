so Dan olds here Calista Redmond you are

00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:24,380
the current president of the open power

00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:26,930
foundation here we are at your Europe

00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:28,790
event how's it going well so far has

00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:30,530
been great we had a packed house for our

00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:33,170
first day and a lot of folks have been

00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:35,930
sticking around here now in day 2 as we

00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:37,790
dive deep into some of the progress that

00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:40,190
we're making the opportunities that we

00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:41,570
have and the tools and resources and

00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:43,760
solutions that are coming out of the

00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:46,610
group and that's the thing that's

00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:49,040
surprising me is and I know you hate

00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:51,200
this term but the ecosystem is there now

00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:53,540
I mean with more than a hundred thousand

00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,280
applications that people can run that's

00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:57,290
a lot of applications that's a lot of

00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,870
things people can do yeah I think it

00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:02,000
speaks to the the larger sense that it's

00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:04,280
not just one company investing in the

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,930
future of this platform but its many and

00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,640
you know when you look at our growth

00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:10,520
over the last three years from the

00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:14,869
original five founding members to you

00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:16,759
know 275 today 275 Wow 275 it's a little

00:01:14,869 --> 00:01:18,950
bit of a meter that keeps taking forward

00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:20,150
each day you know we've got a lot of

00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:22,340
folks that are rolling up their sleeves

00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:24,500
and really investing and that's across

00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:26,659
the full spectrum so we're not just

00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:29,180
attracting the you know the legions of

00:01:26,659 --> 00:01:31,490
hardware optimizations and providers on

00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:34,340
that end but the software side as well

00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:37,580
that's the key right for any successful

00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:40,040
new processor new system it's got to

00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:42,920
have the software yeah how Nvidia did it

00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:45,020
and the full transparency of the open

00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:47,210
power model really allows those

00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:49,700
applications and workloads to fine-tune

00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:51,950
and to you know take advantage of the

00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:53,900
underlying infrastructure without that

00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:56,659
you're not able to achieve the magnitude

00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:58,250
improvements that you and that's quite

00:01:56,659 --> 00:02:01,400
an improvement with this new minsky

00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:04,189
platform minsky's lee Minsky is on fire

00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:06,430
that's something the industry is loving

00:02:04,189 --> 00:02:09,140
Minsky and you know it we originally

00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:12,200
envisioned Minsky would really take off

00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:14,540
in hpc few but when you look at the

00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:18,320
level of analytics and the you know

00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:20,900
level of influence of various data pools

00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:22,700
sure minsky's taking off across all

00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:25,100
forms of analytics and and really

00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:26,630
starting to take hold in the enterprise

00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:29,360
space as well and

00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:33,140
so do you think that that's primarily

00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,490
going into IBM legacy accounts or you're

00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:38,060
starting to pick up some new ones I

00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:40,190
think folks are taking a much fresher

00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:42,350
look at what power can do for their

00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:45,470
scale out as well as scale up workloads

00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:47,990
and we're not just you know reaching our

00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:50,150
install base we're also reaching far

00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:52,100
beyond that and it's really the proof

00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:54,140
points that we can establish with the

00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:56,180
development community you know each of

00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:58,250
them go to work every day looking at the

00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:00,680
challenges in front of them and if they

00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:03,650
can solve that and solve that in a

00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:06,020
meaningful and lasting way they become

00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:07,730
the heroes and it's the creating heroes

00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:09,800
out of that development community that

00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:13,070
really you know gets us excited to go to

00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:15,470
work every day well one heroic company

00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:17,320
was Connecticut I saw that presentation

00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:19,820
yesterday and that's going to be

00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:21,800
recorded it's been recorded will be

00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:23,570
uploaded so you guys will be able to see

00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:27,110
it sitting there at home for the home

00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:29,960
audience but jeez you're not a morning

00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:31,670
cartoons aesthetics yeah whatever you

00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,740
want to see you know watch them some

00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:36,170
bring the whole family yeah bring the

00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:38,090
family gather around the TV and watch us

00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:40,190
talk about open power and chips and

00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:42,890
stuff but kinetica was putting up stuff

00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:46,940
of near a thousand times faster by using

00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:48,410
accelerators in Minsky yeah wow yeah so

00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:50,750
I mean it's that magnitude improvement

00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:54,080
that you've got to establish with the

00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:55,700
end users it it's a little bit of a you

00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,860
know an emotional decision if you're

00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:59,840
going to transfer from one architecture

00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:01,940
to the other but it's kind of a

00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,130
no-brainer and easy to get new religion

00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:07,090
if you get that level of improvement if

00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:09,980
it's not like a huge Roger it's linux

00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:11,540
yeah i mean it's just linux a lot of

00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:13,700
apps you just have to recompile and

00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:15,650
they'll run it's not a big deal it's not

00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:17,720
a big deal and that's part of that

00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:20,209
emotional challenge right I mean folks

00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:22,040
look at something like power like whoa

00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:23,930
that sounds different then you know the

00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:27,260
legacy stuff that we've been running on

00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:29,540
but really it's not that hard it's you

00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:31,010
know port recompile and then oh guess

00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:33,350
what because of this level of

00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:36,530
transparency the number of dials that

00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:39,120
you can adjust has just you know leapt

00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:43,020
out of control so that's pretty cool

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,699
yeah that's very cool now so we talked

00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:46,889
about the legacy folks and you're

00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:48,570
getting in new net new customers and

00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:50,760
you're seeing a lot of that in

00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:53,190
enterprise not in hpc I would have

00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:55,770
thought that HPC would be first to so

00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:57,780
HPC has been first the you know the two

00:04:55,770 --> 00:05:00,419
key areas that we've seen the earliest

00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:02,850
adoption have been in your large scale

00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:06,120
out infrastructures to the hyper scales

00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:08,190
right yeah they're the guys who can you

00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:11,760
know custom designed their workloads and

00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:14,580
their systems around massive data

00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:16,710
centers my second to that has been in

00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:19,470
hpc where you've got a lot of

00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:22,110
customization going on there too both of

00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:24,720
those sectors have that next wave right

00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:26,610
behind them of enterprise I mean every

00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,590
Enterprise has some of their scale-up

00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:30,750
needs some of their deep thinking that

00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:33,270
needs to go on but at the same time

00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:35,940
there's not one client that doesn't have

00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:38,639
both an open strategy and a cloud

00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:40,680
strategy and so once you start tapping

00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,320
into that larger scale out

00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:45,570
infrastructure and you start to pull

00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:48,810
information from both public and private

00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:50,610
as well as hybrid clouds and you want to

00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:52,490
do so well you know protecting your

00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:56,160
crown jewels back on some of your own

00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:57,750
hot on prem systems you need to be able

00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,700
to pull all of that together in a

00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:01,919
seamless fashion and you can do that

00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:03,780
when you start to sort of leverage the

00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:05,849
linux and open source building blocks

00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:07,710
around it sure so that's where we really

00:06:05,849 --> 00:06:10,289
start to pull things together and you

00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:12,000
know move industries forward using some

00:06:10,289 --> 00:06:13,410
of these analytics what you that's

00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,530
really the interesting thing is that

00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:20,039
we've become in the last let's say five

00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:21,780
to ten years we've kind of been on

00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:23,699
moore's law but it's kind of been you

00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:26,789
know thirty percent here twenty percent

00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:29,220
there fifteen percent faster we've hit a

00:06:26,789 --> 00:06:31,440
plateau we of course believe people

00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:34,590
would say we've been stagnating in fact

00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:37,229
but then this thing comes along and

00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:40,410
we're talkin back in the you know 2x

00:06:37,229 --> 00:06:43,710
faster 3x faster with existing solutions

00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:46,260
so just as every client will have a

00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:47,789
cloud strategy and an open strategy I

00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:50,400
think you're going to see that every

00:06:47,789 --> 00:06:52,180
systems provider is going to incorporate

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,830
some level of acceleration into

00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:56,530
every system you see going forward yeah

00:06:53,830 --> 00:07:00,039
there's you cannot rely on moore's law

00:06:56,530 --> 00:07:02,020
and the cpu you know generation to

00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:04,000
achieve the price performance that

00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:06,639
you're looking for you've got to offload

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,380
some of that to acceleration and you

00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:12,039
know what iBM has been showing us with

00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:14,860
the power roadmap the power 9 roadmap is

00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:18,070
that not only are we opening up those

00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:20,770
that bust through Cappy and through envy

00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:23,889
link for fpga and GPU acceleration will

00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:25,660
also have pcie for coming out as well so

00:07:23,889 --> 00:07:29,680
that you know you've basically got three

00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:31,750
high-speed connects to be able to you

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,220
know really take advantage of that and

00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:35,320
you're also i mean you're partners with

00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:37,960
two of the biggest off loaders in the

00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:41,139
world with nvidia offloading into GPUs

00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:43,360
and mellanox offloading from the cpu as

00:07:41,139 --> 00:07:45,250
well right so that's a pretty good story

00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,490
when you put it all together yeah yeah

00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:50,770
so we're able to do a bit more of a

00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:53,050
composable system so that you have

00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:55,660
multiple systems providers integrators

00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:58,090
solution providers that can go after the

00:07:55,660 --> 00:08:00,520
very specific geographies or industries

00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:02,110
weds right they can each go after their

00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:04,780
sweet spot with something that fits

00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:06,729
rather than you know approach that with

00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:08,260
a system that's got a lot more bells and

00:08:06,729 --> 00:08:11,080
whistles and are really necessary

00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:14,740
because all of that takes investment an

00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:17,830
additional energy and other resource to

00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:20,349
to put together so get the right system

00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:22,509
for the right workload yeah and so it's

00:08:20,349 --> 00:08:24,820
been three years that you've been

00:08:22,509 --> 00:08:26,620
involved in this did you ever think was

00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:28,570
going to get to this point I think it's

00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:30,520
got a lot further to go oh I think it

00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:32,860
does to you know if you look at some of

00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:35,050
the advances that are going on with open

00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:36,669
foundations across the spectrum and you

00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:38,050
know many folks you know sit back and

00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:40,360
scratch their heads I go do we need

00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:44,320
another foundation yes we do in a lot of

00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:47,770
ways with the way that technology is

00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:50,380
being consumed from custom systems that

00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:53,740
you are you know getting directly in

00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:56,980
Taiwan to traditional systems providers

00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:59,290
to the hybrid cloud approaches in them

00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:01,900
you know the cloud approach of consuming

00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:04,060
technology in the first place the only

00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:04,819
way to make all of this seamlessly fit

00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:07,160
together is

00:09:04,819 --> 00:09:10,399
having those open building blocks yes

00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:12,439
and you had well you've got to have it

00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,989
and at the same time you know look at

00:09:12,439 --> 00:09:17,600
container strategies to right you've got

00:09:14,989 --> 00:09:19,970
to be able to protect and preserve and

00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:23,449
have the integrity of round transactions

00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:25,910
at every point in the process whether

00:09:23,449 --> 00:09:28,249
you're ingesting data from disparate

00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:30,229
locations because of the level of data

00:09:28,249 --> 00:09:33,799
that's being generated from phones and

00:09:30,229 --> 00:09:36,199
iPads and everything else to you know

00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:38,449
pulling together information that was

00:09:36,199 --> 00:09:40,039
never really envisioned to you know come

00:09:38,449 --> 00:09:41,660
together in the past for business

00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:44,359
decision making that's how industries

00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:46,939
change that's how you see new business

00:09:44,359 --> 00:09:49,220
models develop you know whether it's in

00:09:46,939 --> 00:09:51,289
genomics because we can accelerate the

00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:53,539
speed of genome sequencing and make it

00:09:51,289 --> 00:09:57,709
more attainable across the field for

00:09:53,539 --> 00:10:01,369
medical purposes LG purpose about one

00:09:57,709 --> 00:10:03,019
day exam sequencing exactly and that is

00:10:01,369 --> 00:10:05,839
that's the cut type of stuff that

00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:07,729
changes industries changes lives changes

00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,859
the way that we you know progress our

00:10:07,729 --> 00:10:12,199
society yeah we've got that potential

00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:14,959
but at the core of that you've got to

00:10:12,199 --> 00:10:17,569
have more composable systems more

00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:20,509
composable ways of doing business to do

00:10:17,569 --> 00:10:22,339
that and so you know you your original

00:10:20,509 --> 00:10:26,209
question was did you think that open

00:10:22,339 --> 00:10:28,399
power which is why I know I've taken us

00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:30,319
on a side path to that one so I did it

00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,839
but I have to forget I haven't forgotten

00:10:30,319 --> 00:10:35,059
now my mouth is bad bringing you back so

00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:37,819
you know did I think that open power

00:10:35,059 --> 00:10:39,679
would get to this point this fast yes I

00:10:37,819 --> 00:10:41,779
did really and I think we've got a lot

00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:43,939
further to go I think when you look at

00:10:41,779 --> 00:10:47,179
the level of infusion that we've had

00:10:43,939 --> 00:10:50,239
with our core sets of partners our core

00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:52,459
invested partners and as they start to

00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:55,899
become successful in year three we've

00:10:52,459 --> 00:10:59,539
gone from whiteboard idea yeah two

00:10:55,899 --> 00:11:02,419
prototypes and powerpoints to production

00:10:59,539 --> 00:11:04,279
right and in this production phase it's

00:11:02,419 --> 00:11:07,429
important that we have real solutions

00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:09,139
making real difference to the customer

00:11:07,429 --> 00:11:10,489
set and that's when others start to

00:11:09,139 --> 00:11:12,589
follow and that's when you're going to

00:11:10,489 --> 00:11:14,509
see now the level of adoption those

00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:15,830
client testimonials and those stories

00:11:14,509 --> 00:11:17,660
are really going to take off and

00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:19,250
I think we're about ready hit absolutely

00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:20,570
growth spurt we've quite hit the hockey

00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:22,790
stick I think we're I think we're

00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:26,900
teenagers at this point okay I think

00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:28,610
we've got a level to go yet and it were

00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:30,320
well positioned to do that I mean this

00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:32,480
is the right right time the right place

00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,940
and the right technology to do it the

00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,680
industry is hungry for choice them

00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:39,020
partners are hungry for choice and

00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:41,240
that's the level of investment that that

00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:43,160
we see going on across the board they're

00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:45,680
hungry for something that changes the

00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:48,320
equation yeah today it gets them breaks

00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,390
them out of that incremental improvement

00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,640
right exactly and it looks like it's you

00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:54,740
guys yeah thanks i think i think you're

00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:57,080
right great well thank you very much for

00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:59,290
taking the time you're welcome it's my

00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,290
pleasure

00:12:04,089 --> 00:12:06,089
Oh

00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,760
