well it's great to be in Barcelona it's

00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:25,970
starting to get cold and rainy in the US

00:00:23,779 --> 00:00:27,590
and dahlia on my way here I stopped by

00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:29,359
stock homes and it was kind of cold and

00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:31,130
rainy there tues it was beautiful here

00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:37,580
I'm appreciating that thanks so much for

00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:39,920
coming out we are very excited to have

00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:42,379
our first ever open power summit for

00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,170
Europe obviously we've been around for a

00:00:42,379 --> 00:00:48,110
few years and really excited that you

00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:50,089
know we're here in Europe to talk about

00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:52,580
what we're doing and in on the continent

00:00:50,089 --> 00:00:54,890
as well as how that the global reach and

00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:56,900
global influences sort of bringing us

00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:58,879
together and helping us to cultivate

00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:00,409
this community so thanks again for

00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:01,879
coming out hopefully some of you have

00:01:00,409 --> 00:01:04,250
gotten a chance to enjoy some of the

00:01:01,879 --> 00:01:05,960
OpenStack stuff across the street it's

00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:08,689
great when our communities have such a

00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:12,110
strong complement with one another so

00:01:08,689 --> 00:01:14,479
I'm the president John is the chairman

00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:17,630
together we are sort of co captaining

00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:19,820
this vessel our Twitter addresses are up

00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:22,850
there if you have something nice to say

00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:24,680
about us if you don't we'll have a smart

00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:28,180
reply back for you so don't worry about

00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:30,380
it you know there's a reason that

00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:33,470
communities like open power come

00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:36,020
together it's essential for all of us to

00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:38,600
sort of appreciate that the industry is

00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:40,790
not standing still in neither are we in

00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:43,400
fact I would assert that if you're in

00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:45,950
this room today you are not a spectator

00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:47,300
you're one of the folks that are rolling

00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:49,730
up their sleeves you're part of this

00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:51,740
community that is saying that we could

00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:54,260
do things different we could reinvent we

00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:57,470
could have new business models we have

00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:59,120
so much more to do right and there's a

00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:02,180
lot around us that's happening is

00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:03,890
already the explosion in data that the

00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:06,140
transaction grows the things that are

00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:08,899
happening just by a mere click of your

00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:11,890
phone when you tap that phone you may

00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:14,959
have just fired off 20 to 50 different

00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:17,090
transactions across a wide sphere of

00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:19,430
technologies

00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:22,580
that data could be used for something

00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:25,430
could be become useful insight to change

00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:27,980
how businesses work to reinvent how

00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:30,890
business happens or to reinvent how

00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:32,360
research happens how other ways that

00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:36,019
we're advancing our society are

00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:39,920
happening and that brings us to you know

00:02:36,019 --> 00:02:41,569
kind of the four is of analytics HPC

00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,120
used to be relegated to the hallowed

00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:47,060
halls of research and universities and

00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:50,150
you know the deep thinkers that deep

00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:53,299
thinking is just as important to retail

00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:56,030
supply chains to telecommunications to

00:02:53,299 --> 00:02:59,329
others across various industries that

00:02:56,030 --> 00:03:02,510
deep thinking needs to happen in real

00:02:59,329 --> 00:03:06,049
time all right sort of the time value of

00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:09,230
information we're no longer content to

00:03:06,049 --> 00:03:11,660
look at historical information in fact

00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:14,959
we're not always even content to look at

00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:17,269
information as it's happening we want to

00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:20,000
look at predictive information that can

00:03:17,269 --> 00:03:22,040
help inform us strategically can help

00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,620
inform us in the moment for our

00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:26,389
decisions we make impacting our business

00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:28,850
now to decisions that are going in the

00:03:26,389 --> 00:03:31,760
foregoing going forward for our business

00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:34,519
and this brings me to the last point

00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,590
here that you know I think as much as

00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:39,829
each of our end users and clients and

00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:43,239
folks have an open strategy they also

00:03:39,829 --> 00:03:46,150
have a cloud strategy regardless of

00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:48,889
whether they have a stronger on-prem

00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:51,709
strategy of running their data centers

00:03:48,889 --> 00:03:55,310
of facilitating their workloads they are

00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:57,680
still pulling in information from across

00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:59,419
multiple different domains to gather

00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,549
that insight so there are a lot of these

00:03:59,419 --> 00:04:03,530
industry things that are in motion that

00:04:01,549 --> 00:04:07,940
are causing us to sort of rethink the

00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:10,220
way we do business now I know uber is I

00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:13,220
think a little bit more popular in the

00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:15,650
United States in fact in Germany I don't

00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:17,389
think they allow it at all it was really

00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:20,269
hard for me to understand how to get

00:04:17,389 --> 00:04:21,609
from point A to point B and not here and

00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:24,219
in Spain

00:04:21,609 --> 00:04:25,990
and some calves here but you know the

00:04:24,219 --> 00:04:28,330
uber syndrome for those of you who are

00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:31,000
familiar with what uber is doing it's

00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:35,710
sort of disaggregating a business model

00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:38,469
of a sort of a taxi service or a black

00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:42,159
car service depending on what mode you

00:04:38,469 --> 00:04:44,860
operate in and relegating that to you

00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:47,319
know a community right a community of

00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:49,689
drivers who have cars and services to

00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:52,629
offer and a community event users who

00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:55,509
need a ride from point A to point B this

00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:59,229
has changed the business model for this

00:04:55,509 --> 00:05:03,400
part of our economy and by the way this

00:04:59,229 --> 00:05:05,680
notion of sort of you know I've got a

00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,930
service or good to provide and I need

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,599
one over here I mean that's like from

00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:12,400
the dawn of time right I think a lot of

00:05:10,599 --> 00:05:14,110
us used to call at the village you know

00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:17,889
like the village that's raising my kids

00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:19,990
right now so across the village we have

00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:23,560
goods to offering goods that we need

00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:25,960
right so this uber ization of a business

00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:29,440
model or this sharing economy that we're

00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:32,050
developing it it matters in IT as well

00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:34,779
right many of our strategies are

00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:37,150
predicated on open source technology

00:05:34,779 --> 00:05:38,979
open source software and those are the

00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:41,379
same types of elements that we're

00:05:38,979 --> 00:05:43,509
sharing I have an expertise and one to

00:05:41,379 --> 00:05:44,500
me someone else has a challenge in

00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:47,469
another let's bring those things

00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:50,169
together so that's now it's we're open

00:05:47,469 --> 00:05:53,289
power is coming from right the notion

00:05:50,169 --> 00:05:55,419
that if we bring profound transparency

00:05:53,289 --> 00:05:57,189
to the underlying infrastructure we can

00:05:55,419 --> 00:05:58,930
borrow some of the religion from open

00:05:57,189 --> 00:06:01,210
source software and bring it down into

00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:03,189
the hardware layers this will help us

00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:06,189
overcome things like the plateau of

00:06:03,189 --> 00:06:08,919
Moore's law where we can no longer rely

00:06:06,189 --> 00:06:11,680
on the next generation of transistors

00:06:08,919 --> 00:06:13,539
alone like the uncertain sisters scaling

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,339
right because we're starting to hit some

00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:18,279
of those walls we're starting to hit

00:06:15,339 --> 00:06:20,969
technical innovation walls in the CPU

00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:24,639
alone so we're going to rely on a

00:06:20,969 --> 00:06:26,939
variety you know a choice of

00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:29,319
technologies to tackle those challenges

00:06:26,939 --> 00:06:32,440
maybe you want to offload some of that

00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:34,689
work to a CPR to GPU for accelerated

00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:36,759
computing lots of different things

00:06:34,689 --> 00:06:38,769
you can do so we wanted to bring

00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:41,619
together the thought leaders in the

00:06:38,769 --> 00:06:44,769
industry who could help enact that level

00:06:41,619 --> 00:06:47,709
of innovation the fastest we've already

00:06:44,769 --> 00:06:50,319
talked about the growing demands of your

00:06:47,709 --> 00:06:54,369
workloads whether it's looking to get

00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:56,079
more deeper analysis or whether it's you

00:06:54,369 --> 00:06:58,089
know reflecting and reacting to the

00:06:56,079 --> 00:07:01,599
changes in your particular industry

00:06:58,089 --> 00:07:03,610
maybe it's shortening the the time to

00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:06,339
value of doing some genome sequencing

00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:08,949
that actually changes in industry the

00:07:06,339 --> 00:07:11,110
more you can do that right the IT

00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:13,119
consumption models this is also really

00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:15,279
important to us I mean whether you're

00:07:13,119 --> 00:07:17,559
consuming your IT by going directly to

00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:19,659
Taiwan and having a white box provider

00:07:17,559 --> 00:07:22,449
put together a system for your

00:07:19,659 --> 00:07:24,129
particular need or you're consuming your

00:07:22,449 --> 00:07:27,219
technology purely through the cloud

00:07:24,129 --> 00:07:29,529
there's a huge variety of options and we

00:07:27,219 --> 00:07:30,939
need to be adaptive to them so we're

00:07:29,529 --> 00:07:33,129
building out this community we're

00:07:30,939 --> 00:07:36,039
building a community because it's not a

00:07:33,129 --> 00:07:39,519
one-to-one transaction we are building

00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:41,829
an open power community that fosters and

00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:47,110
looks for that long term shared success

00:07:41,829 --> 00:07:49,269
of each one of its constituents so we've

00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:51,519
come a long way we're about three years

00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:54,249
old now so we're still kind of in

00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:56,349
toddler phase maybe we're in teenager

00:07:54,249 --> 00:07:59,319
phase you know it's hard to say in

00:07:56,349 --> 00:08:01,989
internet time right but we're up to 12

00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:04,119
work groups these are the base building

00:08:01,989 --> 00:08:06,479
blocks that as a community we're

00:08:04,119 --> 00:08:09,249
building together where we have shared

00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:11,559
specifications pieces of code reference

00:08:09,249 --> 00:08:14,529
designs other things that are useful to

00:08:11,559 --> 00:08:17,439
the broader community we've come a long

00:08:14,529 --> 00:08:20,259
way in our membership here's this a nice

00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:21,849
great snapshot of who we've brought on

00:08:20,259 --> 00:08:23,619
board across here if they're about 60

00:08:21,849 --> 00:08:26,229
different members here and they're very

00:08:23,619 --> 00:08:30,399
active and have been very deeply engaged

00:08:26,229 --> 00:08:32,559
across a variety of initiatives you'll

00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:34,750
hear about some of those today from

00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:36,069
these guys so I'm sorry it looks like

00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:38,079
people are still taking pictures take

00:08:36,069 --> 00:08:40,329
lots of pictures and by the way these

00:08:38,079 --> 00:08:41,919
will be available later as well but

00:08:40,329 --> 00:08:43,750
we're exceptionally proud of the

00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:46,300
traction that we're getting in Europe I

00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:47,940
mean we've got a lot of hpc stuff going

00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:49,920
on we've got a lot of scale out we're

00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:51,360
loads that we're seeing and this is

00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,220
because of the you know sort of the

00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,850
collaboration and innovation that we can

00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:58,920
bring together so again you're going to

00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:00,960
hear from some of these guys today but

00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,850
I'm going to hand it over now to John

00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:04,950
zonnos who's going to talk a little bit

00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:06,570
about you know so where do we go from

00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:09,660
here I've given you a little bit of a

00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:11,940
historical context setting bit and he's

00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:13,950
going to sort of help bring us to where

00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:24,650
do we take it from here what are some of

00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:27,810
those priorities thanks Alyssa so

00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:29,400
closest at the stage of what we've done

00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:31,560
over the last three years and I think

00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:33,150
it's great progress I'm going to spend

00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:35,700
some time talking about what we plan to

00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:37,800
do in the next year and beyond and

00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:40,070
really bear down on three tenants that

00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:43,140
we're going to focus our intention

00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:46,200
because we are seeing great traction and

00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:47,970
we are part of a very big revolution in

00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,920
the marketplace which which i like to

00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:52,410
call collaborative innovation which is

00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,360
breaking boundaries between companies in

00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:56,940
terms of talking through how you create

00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:59,060
new technology advances we're going to

00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:02,340
continue to be very focused on

00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:04,880
collaboration across both the software

00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:09,330
and the hardware side of the equation

00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:12,120
when I was first approached to be part

00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:14,970
of what we're doing in open power as

00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,560
well as our company and obviously with

00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:18,390
what we do with your bid to us and

00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:21,960
operating system where in many many open

00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:24,950
forums what really intrigued me it was

00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:26,970
an effort not only to be focus on

00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:29,100
collaboration and innovation around the

00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:31,080
hardware side of the equation because we

00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:34,200
have ocp and other great progress in

00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:36,180
that space but at the same time on the

00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:38,310
software side on the OSN on the

00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:40,470
application side and of course we have

00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:44,480
lots of innovation going on there linux

00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:46,800
foundation open networking oh noes odl

00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,540
well I have five minutes this is gonna

00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,010
be interesting where are they going to

00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:51,690
be behind schedule I apologize in

00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:56,020
advance

00:10:51,690 --> 00:11:00,730
so this is kind of how it usually goes

00:10:56,020 --> 00:11:05,320
with police they're not it was that time

00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:06,910
in the cab I know so the next thing is

00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:08,740
we're going to be focused on doing this

00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:11,980
across communities right this

00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:13,660
collaboration breaking boundaries

00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:15,690
between industries and individual

00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:18,730
companies also is weaving together

00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:21,280
across open communities currently with

00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:24,550
the Linux Foundation Open Compute HPC

00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:26,050
but also with OpenStack which obviously

00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:29,320
is right across the street and I'm sure

00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:32,170
many of you have spent the day at as an

00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:35,320
illustration of this what we see is an

00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:38,110
opportunity to weave these together to

00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:40,960
create solutions so for example penguin

00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:47,080
stack velocity IBM have come forward

00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:49,210
with an open an ocp framework with open

00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:51,820
power technology embedded with OpenStack

00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:53,230
so you know lots of open but what we're

00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:57,640
building those bridges and we're going

00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:59,770
to really focus on that in the next year

00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:01,230
and strengthen those bonds because

00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:03,460
that's really important because that's

00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:05,530
one thing I think we all may be

00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:08,710
experiences a little bit of what I call

00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:11,140
foundation fatigue I get one every other

00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:13,510
day in terms of to join and obviously

00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:15,460
there's all any only so many engineers

00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:17,350
in every company and only so many coders

00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:18,880
so we're trying to make sure investments

00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:21,220
in one foundation can be leveraged by

00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:23,880
another and I think that's very

00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:23,880
important

00:12:25,199 --> 00:12:29,829
we're also going to be focused on what

00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:34,120
we talked about composable pieces are

00:12:29,829 --> 00:12:37,959
Lego blocks the idea that components

00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:40,180
systems operating systems applications

00:12:37,959 --> 00:12:42,879
themselves are going to be woven

00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:46,899
together to create solutions we're

00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:50,079
seeing a very interesting change in the

00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:53,139
marketplace we see that cloud and open

00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:55,600
source models have enabled people to

00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:57,490
think about their data centers in

00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,410
different ways and they're starting to

00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:01,750
think about them from the application

00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:03,129
down you know what's my business problem

00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:06,160
what's the application that's going to

00:13:03,129 --> 00:13:08,139
solve that and given that the

00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,180
infrastructure like what we're doing

00:13:08,139 --> 00:13:12,160
with open power is transparent and

00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:14,529
visible the application can start

00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,540
thinking about what is out there in the

00:13:14,529 --> 00:13:20,860
hardware stack that I can really take

00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:23,290
advantage of to be most performant this

00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:26,139
is really relevant in terms of as close

00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:27,430
to pointed out taking HBC methodologies

00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:28,990
and bringing them into the enterprise

00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:32,139
because what does the enterprise care

00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:34,629
about rapid decisions rabbit business

00:13:32,139 --> 00:13:36,879
decisions that are really spark and not

00:13:34,629 --> 00:13:39,879
only smart but quick and how do we do

00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:41,829
that we do that with data analytics and

00:13:39,879 --> 00:13:44,050
the way the applications are able to

00:13:41,829 --> 00:13:45,610
perform in that level is to take full

00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:48,819
advantage of things that are in the

00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:50,529
hardware stack so we're breaking what I

00:13:48,819 --> 00:13:52,750
think has historically been some

00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:55,019
boundaries in terms of transparency and

00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:58,449
I think that's very exciting and

00:13:55,019 --> 00:14:00,250
everybody that runs an application is

00:13:58,449 --> 00:14:02,769
anybody not running some sort of

00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:06,279
application in their data center okay

00:14:02,769 --> 00:14:09,189
this is just obviously we're not awake

00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:12,879
now I'm not keeping you awake who has a

00:14:09,189 --> 00:14:16,180
data center anybody who touches a piece

00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:19,000
of hardware any time in their career all

00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:20,259
right I assume at some point you ran a

00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,529
piece of software on that piece of

00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:28,689
hardware Elise your phone right we love

00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:30,579
applications okay so the reason I bring

00:14:28,689 --> 00:14:32,860
this up this is the last part that we're

00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:35,589
really going to focus on this focus is

00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:38,769
about making sure we're building a real

00:14:35,589 --> 00:14:41,259
functioning ecosystem an ecosystem that

00:14:38,769 --> 00:14:43,649
looks across the software stack into the

00:14:41,259 --> 00:14:48,699
hardware stack and encourages innovation

00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:51,519
across both you know my mantra here is

00:14:48,699 --> 00:14:54,639
this is just about customer choice right

00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:57,009
and what what does that mean that means

00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:59,589
making sure the application is it

00:14:57,009 --> 00:15:03,339
performant as it can be because it's

00:14:59,589 --> 00:15:07,059
accessing hardware that allows it to do

00:15:03,339 --> 00:15:09,100
so and that can be any platform and what

00:15:07,059 --> 00:15:10,829
we're trying to do in open power is make

00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:13,660
sure what we do is encourage that

00:15:10,829 --> 00:15:15,699
transparency so developers are writing

00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:18,160
code and saying you know what I would

00:15:15,699 --> 00:15:19,540
really benefit from using copy you know

00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,790
and for example the announcement

00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:23,410
recently done around open kathy i

00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:27,040
thought was really interesting because

00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:29,050
that was across HP Dell and Google you

00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:31,300
know leveraging this copy technology

00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:33,730
what's important is not only the names

00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:37,149
but what's important is using technology

00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:39,370
that everybody can see early on and when

00:15:37,149 --> 00:15:41,769
they see it we're able to apply it in

00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:46,329
industries like genomic research

00:15:41,769 --> 00:15:48,370
financial services oil and gas retail

00:15:46,329 --> 00:15:50,350
because at the end of the day what do

00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:52,750
all these industry wants to do they want

00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:55,899
to make smart business decisions and

00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:59,589
they want to make it quickly so we see

00:15:55,899 --> 00:16:02,350
areas like data analytics genomic

00:15:59,589 --> 00:16:04,269
research university research these are

00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:07,149
the sort of people that were adding to

00:16:04,269 --> 00:16:09,730
the ecosystem as well as customers and

00:16:07,149 --> 00:16:12,190
partners and Telkom industries and other

00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:15,910
industries

00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:19,300
so I'm running a little bit over but not

00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:20,920
too bad so how do we know we're on the

00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:25,690
right track how are we building an echo

00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:29,620
system we have 275 members if I remember

00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:31,960
as of today in many many different

00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:35,350
segments as you can see more importantly

00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:38,050
that's an increase from 166 just at the

00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:39,820
beginning of the year but I'll give you

00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:44,130
a couple stats that I think are even

00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:47,800
more important from the perspective of

00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:51,060
somebody that is in the software half of

00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:53,950
this equation we have over a hundred

00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:57,370
thousand Linux applications running on

00:16:53,950 --> 00:17:01,540
power that's a sizable amount given you

00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:03,310
know I'll say a young young teenager

00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:07,569
that's been around for three years in

00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:12,459
open power we have more than 2,300 isvs

00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:15,610
that have written code on Linux to

00:17:12,459 --> 00:17:19,780
utilize the benefits of open power we

00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:22,449
have this sort of echo system every day

00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:24,760
trying to help those developers figure

00:17:22,449 --> 00:17:27,420
out how they can make their code most

00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:31,390
performant so we have people like

00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:34,090
kinetica who's utilize for database

00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:36,310
solutions in retail we have software

00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:40,030
that's both open source and proprietary

00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:44,260
in this model we are focusing in areas

00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:47,260
of university research genomics as i

00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:51,310
mentioned HPC in general oil and gas

00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:53,950
financial services telkom so for me the

00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:56,860
yardstick ultimately have we made

00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:59,350
advances in technology absolutely are

00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:01,090
those advances that open absolutely

00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:04,210
those are foundations of what we're

00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:07,330
doing equally important is that we see

00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:10,110
an ecosystem building that is taking

00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:12,070
advantage of that and what was really

00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:13,780
innovative to me in the beginning of

00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:15,730
this journey when we were first

00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:18,130
approached is that we're trying to build

00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:21,250
this foundation to drive innovation both

00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:23,650
on the software side as well on the

00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:25,870
hardware and making sure that

00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:29,320
cesses transparent and iterative and

00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:31,360
hopefully we're making the code better

00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:33,520
for whatever application can sit up on

00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,590
whatever platform in this case open

00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,270
power and we're helping the

00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:39,760
infrastructure providers make sure they

00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:42,250
talk to developers and drive innovation

00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:44,260
that's fully utilized so that's where

00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:49,980
we're going I think that stops our
