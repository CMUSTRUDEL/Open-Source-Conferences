Publication date: 2019-08-20
Playlist: OpenPOWER Summit NA 2019
Description: 
	Presented by Ching-Hsiang Chu, X-ScaleSolutions

This talk will focus on high-performance and scalable middleware for Message Passing Interface (MPI) and Deep Learning on This talk will focus on high-performance and scalable middleware for Message Passing Interface (MPI) and Deep Learning on OpenPOWER platform with NVIDIA GPGPUs and RDMA-enabled interconnects (InfiniBand and RoCE). The focus will be on two packages with commercial support being available from X-ScaleSolutions. The first package will focus on the OSU MVAPICH2 MPI libraries and their capabilities for high-performance computing with both CPUs (OpenPOWER) and GPUs (NVIDIA). The second package will focus on tight integration between the OSU MVAPICH2-GDR MPI library and the Horovod stack to provide high-performance and scalable Deep Learning with multiple frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch. Performance results from the SUMMIT system (#1 supercomputer in the World) with thousands of GPUs and POWER9 CPUs will be presented.
