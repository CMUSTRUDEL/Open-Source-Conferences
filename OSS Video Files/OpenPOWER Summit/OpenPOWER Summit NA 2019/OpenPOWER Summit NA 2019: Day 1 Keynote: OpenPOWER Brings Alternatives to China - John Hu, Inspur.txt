so happy to join the effeminate renewing

00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:08,130
reunion of open bar foundation and the

00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:12,300
so happy we have more members and more

00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:14,519
intending for for for this summit and we

00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:17,250
are very happy to be introducing super

00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:19,680
power system to to family

00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:21,090
the in purple system is the energon

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,240
venture company between

00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:25,650
inspir and the IBM to blue company and I

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,609
think it is the only company have a

00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:32,520
power power in the company name so the

00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:35,250
mission of years per power system is to

00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:41,180
extend the power footprint in the market

00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:47,190
especially in China and we now you know

00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:49,800
have en a bake power product not only

00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:54,570
the power mission critical part but also

00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:57,780
the open power part without using a in

00:00:54,570 --> 00:01:02,100
host design and they using JDM model we

00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:04,500
current from is per site is he an joins

00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:08,210
a development and manufacturing model

00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:11,850
for the huge customer like a BT in China

00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:14,520
actually is for heavy am have been a

00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:18,330
very big Maki share in China market

00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:20,070
especially for the beauty and we have a

00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:23,610
in spray hair and a big product

00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:26,549
portfolio and the for the IPS in super

00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:30,119
power system we can use in their product

00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:32,520
platform to design a new motherboard

00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:35,040
then we can leverage the market share

00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:39,689
and we also the leverage the eyepiece

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:44,159
which is already very versus ticket for

00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:47,549
the huge data center market for the sort

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,710
of scale data center and a we all should

00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:52,500
be living in the power system the open

00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:55,920
power based design is a more reliable

00:01:52,500 --> 00:02:02,299
design a more sophisticated design for

00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:04,369
the for the server we I used to design

00:02:02,299 --> 00:02:07,369
another kind of server and there

00:02:04,369 --> 00:02:09,590
currently we work with powernet open

00:02:07,369 --> 00:02:14,060
power for a long time to design to

00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:17,930
design the system for the for the

00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:20,959
engineering side we saw the power more

00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:23,209
focused on balance this system you know

00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:27,349
not only the price performance not only

00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:29,930
the power efficiency but also the

00:02:27,349 --> 00:02:32,480
robotic and the reliability is very key

00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:34,970
factor for design and power base in the

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:38,360
open power mysticism so the philosophy

00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:40,910
and the guideline for design system is

00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:43,569
you know you can feel the difference and

00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:46,459
I think that this difference is very

00:02:43,569 --> 00:02:49,340
very critical for custom expecially for

00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:54,190
the customer for super Securities and

00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:58,010
that giving the given I I think it is a

00:02:54,190 --> 00:03:01,579
introduced the mature technology into

00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:04,519
Vienna in a faster growth market to

00:03:01,579 --> 00:03:07,730
allow this market service super secure

00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:10,760
data center markets can benefit from all

00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:12,470
the good things in the history we saw

00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:15,739
that easy and a very important for our

00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:19,730
customer and also our customer feel the

00:03:15,739 --> 00:03:21,950
different then we also using open

00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:24,920
ecosystem that it's not only the

00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:28,760
software part open open but also the

00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:32,329
hobbit' part open we work very closely

00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:34,340
with OCP and we also very closely with

00:03:32,329 --> 00:03:37,340
open power foundation and in the future

00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:39,650
we will open more open power basically

00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:42,260
design to the community to allow you

00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:46,190
know the family to share the design and

00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:49,040
the to in in different regions using the

00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:51,500
same design using same set of open

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:55,130
source IP to extend the footprint of the

00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:57,019
open power we now have in a very bigger

00:03:55,130 --> 00:04:00,650
product portfolio for the open power

00:03:57,019 --> 00:04:04,160
system we shoe for in here we are we

00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:07,280
also have another two the first one I

00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:10,910
want to introduce is in a for you

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:13,659
storage storage intensive design based

00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:15,519
on our practice we sought

00:04:13,659 --> 00:04:19,959
the software-defined storage it is a

00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:24,240
very suitable workload for the open

00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:27,490
power platform because you know the

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:30,130
piece IEF upon the opener for the i/o

00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:34,900
bandwidth and also the last level cache

00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:37,900
and also the the the memory bandwidth

00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:42,160
and also define design the macro

00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:45,160
architecture of risk you know maybe we

00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:47,860
wish we should understand the risk is a

00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:50,680
very important in a wishing of the

00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:54,130
history and we also in many work looked

00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:56,349
especially for the for the storage

00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:58,900
workload we still benefit from the RISC

00:04:56,349 --> 00:05:01,870
architecture and the and a fine tune the

00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:05,740
design of a macro micro architecture of

00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:11,289
the core of the open power system and we

00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:15,270
found we can we can using one socket to

00:05:11,289 --> 00:05:18,880
driven Mohandas driver compared to

00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:23,530
compared to x86 because you know the

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:28,030
fine design of Thea of the CPU and at

00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:31,930
the same time we get the similar similar

00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:34,060
band a similar bandwidth and elated and

00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:38,259
even better in latency so it's meaning

00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:41,110
we're using two CPU to driven to times

00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:44,320
of hardest driver compared to you know

00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:46,240
the user for for CPU to driven the same

00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,789
kind same number of the hardest driver

00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:51,310
but we can got the same bandwidth and

00:05:48,789 --> 00:05:55,509
performance so that is a giving and a

00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:58,840
dramatic benefit for customer some some

00:05:55,509 --> 00:06:03,699
telecom carrier in China China Telecom

00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:07,360
and their media company Magoo using our

00:06:03,699 --> 00:06:11,280
solution to accelerate and get price

00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:16,240
performance benefits for the for their

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:21,029
media platform and we we now have this

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:23,949
one quitted from the x86 platform

00:06:21,029 --> 00:06:25,450
actually the chassis and the you know

00:06:23,949 --> 00:06:29,410
the for you

00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:34,360
for you for your hardest driver designs

00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:37,420
and used to be an x86 powerful but the

00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:40,060
replaced with open power motherboards

00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:43,390
this system becomes more powerful we can

00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:46,360
have a more bandwidth and the lower

00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:48,940
latency the second one is one you design

00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:51,100
I think this is the the first one you

00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:53,980
design for the open power that is in

00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:56,290
them you know the universal product that

00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:59,830
you can using for the front and a

00:06:56,290 --> 00:07:02,470
workload and also used for a management

00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:06,120
of the of the total system and also for

00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:09,760
some hide some some computing density

00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:12,340
perform medium need you know you can put

00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:15,970
more CPU more computing power in one

00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:17,230
rack and the third one they say in a to

00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:19,990
you design that is he and a

00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:24,150
general-purpose design this design is in

00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:27,550
a we we see that it's a modular design

00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:30,550
actually there is he in a kind of

00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:34,150
transformer we have many different kind

00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:37,990
of front and module and the back end

00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:41,500
module actually there is a three from

00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:42,580
and hardest driver-side module in in the

00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:45,310
front of the chassis

00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:47,650
and the back end we have a four four

00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:49,060
different kind of a module so we combine

00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:53,710
those different module with a

00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:55,780
motherboard together to create a 24

00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:58,060
different kind of a configuration to

00:07:55,780 --> 00:08:00,820
allow this platform can be suitable for

00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:06,430
different kind of workload the third one

00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:11,350
is he an AI dedicate design we can use

00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:19,000
in this for you design with 16 T 4 or 8

00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:22,990
you know T 100 with 100 higher have a

00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:26,210
more more computing power so for this AI

00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:31,280
platform we now have a very

00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:35,360
very very interesting PSA and we were

00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:37,850
one deal was was this platform so the

00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,690
last page ayah I want to introduce um

00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:44,690
currently I think it is biggest

00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:47,720
installation in one of our hyper secure

00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:53,720
data center customer one of the BT in

00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:57,050
China actually ste I think yes yeah so

00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:59,570
the fall for this one based on the bench

00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:02,710
market the first of all the customer

00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:06,220
need us to do the customization design

00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:08,930
the customer giving us a 500 different

00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:10,910
500 requirements for the BMC

00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:13,130
modification and based on the

00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:16,670
requirements of their data center and we

00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:17,960
do that modification based on our BMC

00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:20,180
design for weeks

00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:22,430
they're very very satisfied with that

00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:25,160
and that second very challenge

00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:29,540
requirement from customers they want the

00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:32,000
per per system the the the power

00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:35,690
conception per system need be lower than

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,820
600 watts to be fitting to their their

00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:40,610
rack so that is a in a very very

00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:44,140
challenged design that we you know

00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:44,140
exhausted every design

00:09:44,269 --> 00:09:50,910
masses to fate fit that requirement

00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:55,670
finally we have a 1080 person

00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:58,290
performance better compared to the x86

00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:59,970
platform and also for the power

00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:04,440
consumption we have a Jenny percent less

00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:07,980
and you know using the same level of

00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:11,399
working load and the same same benchmark

00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:17,730
for the performance so currently a

00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:21,149
customer have paid big we we have a more

00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:23,700
than five hand of five so five thousand

00:10:21,149 --> 00:10:26,250
you need to be installing him that in a

00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:28,829
data center that is he and a big one

00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:30,870
installation Ying hyper scale datacenter

00:10:28,829 --> 00:10:33,480
and that the workload is the big data

00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:35,490
analysis and we were extending this

00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:38,490
customer to the software-defined storage

00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:40,490
and I base to work loading this year so

00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:44,910
I think that is he and a very

00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:47,459
interesting showcase to you know to give

00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:50,250
us confidence open power definitely can

00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:53,910
work in the hopster data center and I

00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:56,850
carried the modern modern workloads we

00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:59,190
you know how saying the lossless area

00:10:56,850 --> 00:11:00,550
grows very fast you know thank you very

00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:06,200
much

00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:06,200
