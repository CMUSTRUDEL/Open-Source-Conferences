Title: OpenPOWER Summit NA 2019: Architecture Effects When Interacting with GPU Technologies
Publication date: 2019-08-28
Playlist: OpenPOWER Summit NA 2019
Description: 
	Presented by Christopher M. Sullivan, Oregon State University 

Oregon State Universityâ€™s Center for Genome Research and Biocomputing (CGRB) works closely with its users to determine the best computing platform for computational research. In the past several years we have seen many differences associated with architecture and GPU interactions. As we continued our testing we found tremendous benefits from using the OpenPOWER platform with Power9 processors and NVIDIA GPU. In an effort to truly determine the best platform for different types of GPU processing we created a set of test. We will be showing all the current data comparing some of the most bleeding-edge platforms and a demo of the machines racing each other. Our goal is to provide users with the ability to bring online the best platform for the work they are planning with GPU technology.
