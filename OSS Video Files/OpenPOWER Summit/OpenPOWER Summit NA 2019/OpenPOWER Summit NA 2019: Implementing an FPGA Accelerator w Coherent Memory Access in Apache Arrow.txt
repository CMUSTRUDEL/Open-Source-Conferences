	Presented by Noushin Azami, Texas State University

We aim to implement a fully homomorphic encryption algorithm using an FPGA accelerator in a way that eliminates the overhead produced by the device driver and memory format transitions. Fletcher is a framework that integrates FPGA accelerators with Apache Arrow, an in-memory format that reduces overhead when transferring data between platforms by creating tabular memory blocks.

Fletcher is programmed to function on top of IBMâ€™s CAPI SNAP which eliminates the need for a device driver in an FPGA accelerator, reducing the overhead of exchanging data between FPGA and CPU and giving the FPGA coherent access to data in the main memory.
