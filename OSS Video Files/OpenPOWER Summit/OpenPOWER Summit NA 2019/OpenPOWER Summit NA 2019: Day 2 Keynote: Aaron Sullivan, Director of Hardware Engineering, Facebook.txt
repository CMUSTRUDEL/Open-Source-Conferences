good morning so what's Facebook doing

00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:17,820
here I'll answer that by the time we get

00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:20,699
to the end of this message but let's

00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:23,670
start with this this is really about in

00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:27,150
our perspective just an extension of a

00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:30,240
big industry open source push Facebook

00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:32,969
has been part of this with OCP Facebook

00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,890
runs almost entirely on Linux almost

00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:38,610
everything we do starts with an open

00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:41,329
first philosophy and it's been a long

00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:44,539
journey in our industry to get from

00:00:41,329 --> 00:00:49,920
where we started and open hardware

00:00:44,539 --> 00:00:51,420
arguably I would say in 2010/2011 to

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,300
where we are today and we still have

00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,940
some distance to go to get the same kind

00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:59,280
of richness and develop our capability

00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,840
and other things that we have an open

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,789
source software but we're well on our

00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,299
way and this is a big step and that's

00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:08,130
why I'm here

00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:10,229
just a little bit of a story I think my

00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:13,820
whole career in some sense has been

00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:16,890
punctuated by watching open source

00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:21,540
approaches open source software come

00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:23,610
along and kind of slowly just displace

00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:26,130
whatever else is there and make it space

00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:30,659
in our industry and I have watched this

00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:32,850
in spite of what looks like just chaos

00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:34,259
and all kinds of other things that come

00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:36,630
with an open source movement

00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:40,680
I have watched beautiful pieces of

00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:43,619
technology with phenomenal engineering

00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,390
teams kind of just slowly adapt or in

00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:47,520
some cases if they fought it which is

00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:51,060
not the case here get pushed aside by

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:53,369
this mob of crazy engineers and

00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:55,979
revolutionaries and so forth and you

00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:57,840
know in the earlier part of my career it

00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:01,350
never made sense to me why this kept

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,320
happening I've stopped trying to make

00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:05,490
sense of why it happens it just happens

00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:09,869
that's pretty much that's pretty much

00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:11,730
the story so what I want to do with the

00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:12,660
rest of my time up here with you is talk

00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:15,810
about

00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:17,760
how that story works and share some

00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:19,980
wisdom that I've developed in the

00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,760
process of watching this same cycle play

00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:26,640
out in open hardware a few times over

00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:31,290
I'm up here with Facebook but I was part

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:32,790
of what were the early days of and the

00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:34,980
foundations of open power with a

00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:37,290
different company a few years ago and so

00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:42,000
I can tell you having been on the inside

00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:44,460
there the track record is strong and the

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,590
setting and the foundations are good for

00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:52,140
the story that I want to tell to have a

00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:53,790
very good ending so the question is if

00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:58,050
you look at all these stories of open

00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:59,610
source communities and what how they

00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:01,830
start on how they and all the rest of

00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:05,460
that you're you're probably best to

00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:07,830
think about our situation here as a

00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:09,720
group that's interested in this as one

00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:12,170
story here that always starts with a

00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:16,640
question why does the open source happen

00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:19,740
and to my point of view open source

00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,570
tends to start from some background

00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:23,940
setting it tends to start from an

00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:28,260
environment where we have a very rich

00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:32,160
set of resources all stacked in silos we

00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:35,040
have siloed IP we have siloed software

00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:39,660
we have siloed engineering teams and we

00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:42,570
have many of them my silo your silo

00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:45,750
their silo whoever it is and for some

00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:47,850
period of time that suffice is to meet

00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:49,560
all the needs of anybody who's drawing

00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:51,840
on the resources in that silo and it's

00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,670
probably the best way to do it and keeps

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,380
groups of people tight keeps them

00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:57,690
working closely together it keeps the

00:03:55,380 --> 00:04:00,030
chaos down keeps them focused but over

00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:02,250
time we start to have problems with

00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:04,590
those silos and our end users and our

00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:07,680
developers and others start saying I'm

00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:09,510
not getting enough out of this I'm not

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,980
getting what I want I don't have enough

00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:12,390
voice I don't have anything else and

00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:15,030
that's when things can start to get

00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:16,890
messy because most of the people that

00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:19,020
are in here that that want that are the

00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:20,310
biggest catalyst for change they're not

00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:22,410
the whole population but the biggest

00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:24,000
catalyst for change that they're not

00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:26,280
always known for being the sort that are

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,080
really thinking things through

00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,640
and if you developing a chip I think

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,170
almost anybody would say the most

00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:33,690
important thing is that you really

00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:37,410
thought things through before you built

00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:40,230
it and the whole ecosystem most those

00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:42,420
end users aren't as concerned about all

00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:43,860
of the particulars of the technology

00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:45,570
that needs to change they're more

00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:47,460
concerned and more motivated by the fact

00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:50,490
that at some point along the line what

00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:52,260
went into that silo in their perspective

00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:54,810
the value of it has become compressed

00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:57,680
it's not that it doesn't have value it's

00:04:54,810 --> 00:05:00,810
that it's not to them what it once was

00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:04,710
so they're motivated by the fact that

00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:06,030
they want more out of these silos and

00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:09,630
what's in them than what they had before

00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:11,610
and they may also feel like change is

00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:13,200
not happening fast enough or broadly

00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:16,410
enough or in the direction that they

00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:18,030
want and in my perspective and

00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:21,000
experience most of this is born out of

00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:23,310
the fact that we have too many groups of

00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,840
individuals sitting in silos with not

00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:27,390
enough differentiation between those

00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:29,940
silos and what we do best to do is break

00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:31,979
those walls down and get most of those

00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:33,810
resources that were once stacked in a

00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:35,600
silo doing similar things working

00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:39,919
together for something bigger and better

00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:42,600
and in our industry today the sources of

00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:45,840
challenge for innovation are not about

00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:47,640
money and they are not at least not

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,100
about lack of money or lack of

00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:51,810
investment they are about fundamental

00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:54,150
problems with the way that we construct

00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:56,760
systems and the materials we use to

00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:58,800
build them and the protocols we designed

00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:00,690
them to run with and the fabrics we

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:04,380
connect them with and so forth and these

00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:07,110
are some of our hardest problems so

00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:11,880
across all of these spectrums we need

00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:15,270
more creativity more innovation and a

00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:18,060
broader base of adoption on some common

00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:20,100
silos than what we have today if we

00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:22,710
really want them to take off today we

00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:24,750
have we have stories in our industry you

00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:27,570
can look back on of many competing buses

00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:28,740
of many competing firmware stacks of

00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:31,680
many of these other things and today

00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:33,720
what we really need is less competition

00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,070
between things are the same and more

00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:42,340
fundamental improvement in innovate

00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:44,170
that moves beyond all of that now if you

00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:45,970
were around when we had candy bar

00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:48,400
cellphones you remember how much money

00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:50,620
it cost and how much time it took to

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,780
build an infrastructure of I can use my

00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:54,850
phone anywhere

00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:56,110
you remember how maybe how hard that was

00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:57,640
if you were ever anywhere near a

00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:59,710
telecommunications this has not come

00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:01,630
quickly and it was hard fought and there

00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:04,150
was a lot of value to it but I think

00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:06,580
most of us know as valuable as that was

00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:08,590
our world is way different because we

00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:12,250
moved beyond what was a candy bar phone

00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:13,900
into something else if think about just

00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:16,270
for a minute what would be different in

00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:18,700
our economy in your day to day life and

00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:21,520
everything else if our innovation around

00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:23,680
mobile phones at some point for as

00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:27,910
awesome as they were just stopped at

00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:29,470
that last candy bar phone okay and then

00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:31,510
think about what happened when a few

00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:33,190
organizations came along and rethought

00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:35,110
what was going to go into that and

00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:38,920
decided to provide an engineering

00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:40,360
platform for Co developers for consumers

00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:42,520
for anybody else so that they could

00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:44,170
really expand what was possible in that

00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,010
space and start solving more of their

00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:46,750
own problems

00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:49,120
this took fundamental innovation in the

00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:50,590
system a really good software stack and

00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,710
some great community management but you

00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:55,960
could say that you know our world has

00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:59,440
changed dramatically just because of

00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:02,800
that little piece of glass and metal and

00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:07,450
silicon in your pocket sort of being

00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:08,830
revamped and shared so maybe that's a

00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:11,170
compelling reason to say we should let

00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:13,120
more people get involved here like Ken's

00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:14,830
announcement like like everything that

00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,240
we're seeing with open power but a lot

00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:18,280
of people will ask a question if I share

00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,630
this with everybody and I tell them all

00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,940
we're going to open governance and

00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:24,340
everything else and I have all these

00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:27,490
dreamers so forth out there isn't this

00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:28,990
gonna ruin what I built I mean there's a

00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:31,150
lot of revolutions out there that happen

00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:33,310
in the world that you know get messy

00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:35,979
they don't end well let's not pretend

00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:38,740
that doesn't happen okay let's not

00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:41,050
pretend that periodically a revolution

00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:44,080
turns into something like this it's it's

00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:46,360
a legitimate question but I also don't

00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,400
think that for the most part in our

00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,860
industry when we hit these conditions we

00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,190
have

00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:54,290
any reasonable rational choice but to

00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:56,930
actually take that next big step and

00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:58,850
adapt right because which thing

00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:01,490
generates economic value that's going to

00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:05,149
get everybody moving forward and keep

00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:06,920
our this segment of our industry viable

00:09:05,149 --> 00:09:09,620
and keep all of the investment

00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:11,180
innovation there I think I think the

00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:14,120
answer is obvious even if it seems

00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:16,310
strange and risky sometimes and so if

00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:18,410
you're sold on that and you say this is

00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:21,440
great you know this is the outcome I

00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:23,690
want and it all sounds nice and all the

00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,880
rest of that but you know I'm also aware

00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:28,130
of the risk if I'm moving along in that

00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:29,899
direction how do I know whether or not

00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:32,450
I'm headed down the road towards

00:09:29,899 --> 00:09:33,740
something that's really good or I'm

00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:35,750
headed down the road towards some kind

00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:38,839
of disaster or a mess and I'm gonna

00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:40,459
regret this later okay I think an

00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:41,810
open-source software we understand that

00:09:40,459 --> 00:09:44,360
pretty well and I think an open-source

00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:46,100
hardware we're still figuring it out so

00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,959
let's talk for a few minutes about

00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:50,360
what's different fundamentally between

00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:52,760
doing open-source Hardware is a big

00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:54,199
community and software and there's a lot

00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,610
of stuff I'm not going to touch on here

00:09:54,199 --> 00:09:57,260
but here I think is what's most

00:09:55,610 --> 00:10:00,680
important when you're working in this

00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:02,300
space almost never do you get to have a

00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:05,269
clean sheet when you're doing open

00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:07,459
source hardware almost always you're

00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:08,930
coming from some type of legacy it's

00:10:07,459 --> 00:10:10,190
already been implemented it's already

00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:11,660
been documented it already has a

00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:13,459
community of Engineers it already has

00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:14,720
really popular ways of being used and

00:10:13,459 --> 00:10:17,000
all of those things have a lot of

00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,730
inertia and if you're gonna reinvent

00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,550
something it's hard to start in that

00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:25,100
space from scratch and get anywhere

00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:26,959
quickly or at all so the best thing to

00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:29,660
do is actually open up what you already

00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:31,040
have and share it with everybody but

00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:34,130
that you know that presents some

00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:36,640
difficulty because what everybody wants

00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:39,579
to do is take your big beautiful vehicle

00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:41,899
and strip it down to its parts and

00:10:39,579 --> 00:10:44,390
modify little bits and pieces here and

00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:46,430
there and in the end what you want is an

00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:48,589
outcome you want a vehicle that somebody

00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:51,740
can actually drive despite whatever's

00:10:48,589 --> 00:10:54,680
going on with the modifications and and

00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:57,260
and letting people in to investigate it

00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:58,550
and to modify it and then to validate it

00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:01,010
and ship it and all the rest of that

00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:01,450
it's costly consumes a lot of time and

00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:05,170
attention

00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:08,140
and it's risky so it's important in this

00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:10,330
particular case that we have all of the

00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:11,860
necessary tools and Mike use the word

00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:16,150
plumbing I'm gonna use that again

00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:17,770
plumbing in order for a movement like

00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:19,150
this to thrive and one of the hardest

00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:21,640
parts about open-source hardware

00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:24,750
development today is that there is not

00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:28,000
nearly the kind of plumbing we have

00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:29,770
relative to open source software if you

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,490
worked in open source software in the

00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:33,100
middle 90s

00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:36,400
you might remember people push patches

00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:38,710
to like basically Usenet groups people

00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:40,750
people were storing code on you know

00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:43,420
what what is less sophisticated than

00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:45,670
your average reddit thread is today and

00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:47,620
somehow you're supposed to make this all

00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:50,260
work and it's supposed to compile nicely

00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:52,270
into today it's it's almost I think it's

00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:54,370
almost impossible to imagine that you

00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:56,380
know kernels were born in that space all

00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:58,480
this software that was Linux was born in

00:11:56,380 --> 00:12:00,640
that space because when you look at the

00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,760
toolset they have now it's so powerful

00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:05,680
by comparison hey I mean it just it just

00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,900
makes everything easy to get in and

00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,160
develop and test and fork and you know

00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:11,590
make all the changes and all the rest

00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:13,780
set so it's primed to let everybody's

00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:16,060
creativity run amok and still get a

00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:18,100
pretty good outcome in an open source

00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:19,840
hardware we actually need to install

00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:22,030
more of that plumbing and what I think

00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:25,660
is one of the most special parts about

00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:28,120
this announcement is it brings a lot of

00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:32,350
potential and a lot of initial value to

00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:33,910
that plumbing question ask yourself what

00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:37,330
development tools do we have out there

00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:43,260
that are open today to work in this

00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:45,850
space not enough but more with this

00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:47,470
think about the difference between when

00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:49,390
you're writing open source code and

00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:53,200
you've got compilers or jits or anything

00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:56,830
else like that about how agile that is

00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:59,050
and you need the same thing in your EDA

00:12:56,830 --> 00:13:00,730
and your other toolkits to come along

00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:02,530
and you need you probably want that with

00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:03,940
really good reference implementation so

00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:07,690
people have a place to start from

00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:10,000
to get moving faster this I don't think

00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:12,670
we've solved yet but it's great to just

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,410
send your source and get it compiled and

00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:15,150
test and ship it and we don't have

00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:18,150
anything

00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:20,520
in a fab today we'd have anything like

00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:24,720
that invalidation but things like this

00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:28,320
will get us much closer sooner than on

00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,760
the course we were on you know well

00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:35,250
can't I don't know when you started this

00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:40,320
but let's say yesterday or a month ago

00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:41,820
or a year ago and then finally there's

00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,200
there has to be a market space that

00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:46,830
developed here that's a little bit more

00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:48,330
complicated than downloads it's it's not

00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:50,310
that it's not that a lot of this

00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:53,430
probably won't work in the same sense of

00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:55,170
source code and data that is

00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:58,260
interchangeable and you can use but in

00:13:55,170 --> 00:14:00,210
the end shipping a chip require shipping

00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:01,770
product shipping open product requires

00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:03,270
an ecosystem that can support open

00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:05,910
product and that to take some time to

00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:07,740
develop but there's the right sort of

00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:12,180
fundamental basis here for all of these

00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:14,220
things to happen and then the last part

00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:16,589
is licensing I don't think our industry

00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:19,589
has fully cracked open source hardware

00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:22,620
licensing yet and patent protection and

00:14:19,589 --> 00:14:24,900
everything else but again I think today

00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:29,970
this is a huge step in the right

00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:32,880
direction for our whole industry if you

00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:34,529
were around when Linux was first getting

00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,890
hot and people had a lot of questions

00:14:34,529 --> 00:14:40,440
about it the biggest concern was is this

00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:42,900
legally viable am I gonna get myself in

00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:45,720
trouble if I adopt and use this am I

00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:49,529
gonna get sued and you know some things

00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:53,339
happen in that space and part of what

00:14:49,529 --> 00:14:55,620
had them ending well or some really big

00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:57,570
organizations with really rich patent

00:14:55,620 --> 00:15:00,360
portfolio is deciding to step in and

00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:02,010
back that movement and make sure it was

00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:04,529
safe for everybody else that wanted to

00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:06,270
innovate and take some risk there so

00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:07,650
this group is to be commended for

00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:10,110
helping us move along in that direction

00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:13,080
I think there's more work to do so in

00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:14,820
summary you want a vehicle to move this

00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:17,520
forward and move it quickly you need all

00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:19,350
of these things in the truck and I think

00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:23,100
basically what's been announced here is

00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:25,140
a really big step forward and something

00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:27,680
very sensitive for all of these things

00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:29,880
in the truck

00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:32,490
so I want to switch gears and talk about

00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:34,140
one more thing I'm gonna play a video

00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:35,820
for you for a moment and I think this is

00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:37,530
a great metaphor for how open-source

00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:40,650
movements come along when you start from

00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:43,560
something that had a proprietary legacy

00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:44,580
and is moving out into the open I just

00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:48,050
want to pick I want you to pay attention

00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:51,390
to how you feel while you watch this

00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:52,770
okay basically we have lots of things

00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:54,840
out there in the world that go through

00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:56,640
fundamental change from one thing into

00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:58,920
something else entirely

00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:01,260
we watch this happen in nature it's not

00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:04,410
a surprise but sometimes when it's

00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:05,700
happening right in front of us in the

00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:06,960
moment it's happening there are a few

00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:09,330
moments that look a little grotesque

00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:12,630
it's a little uncomfortable it's a

00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:14,940
little like yeah you know I understand

00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:16,560
how this happens in the end but I'm

00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:19,290
watching this go on I'm in the middle of

00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,850
it I'm not quite sure it's headed the

00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:22,440
right way there's a little uncertainty

00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:26,280
right I mean that butterfly could be

00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:28,080
dead just now or it just pops out and

00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:30,210
you have something new and beautiful

00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:32,490
there and what what I'd like you to take

00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:34,530
away is we've had this happen often

00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:38,660
enough in open source that this is

00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:38,660
probably the most likely outcome here

00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:43,800
but it's not going to take away the

00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:45,390
mystery and kind of the weird moments

00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,310
for anybody that's along for this ride

00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:48,960
you don't get to get away from that

00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:52,650
that's actually part of what makes it

00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:54,420
exciting if it were a certainty most of

00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:58,680
us wouldn't be here it would be boring

00:16:54,420 --> 00:17:01,050
you wouldn't be working on it so this

00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:03,840
magnitude '''l shift we're talking about

00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:05,670
here is about getting onto that new

00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:07,350
platform and kind of reinventing

00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:09,960
something that we already think we know

00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:15,720
into something else entirely that solves

00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:21,090
all kinds of new problems it also needs

00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:23,160
to end in kind of a boring way okay we

00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:25,680
need to get as quickly as possible in

00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:28,740
this space from all this excitement and

00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:31,440
all this possibility to I can buy this

00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:33,330
anywhere I want it I can use it any way

00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,870
I want it I can talk about it like it's

00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:38,400
everyday and its routine there's a lot

00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:40,030
of commerce and interaction around it

00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:43,570
that should be the

00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:45,370
goal right that should govern a lot of

00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:47,020
how we think together working in these

00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:48,400
communities yes we want the most

00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:50,890
exceptional engineering the most

00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:53,260
fascinating stuff but is this gonna get

00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:55,690
us to a good market is this gonna get us

00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:59,740
to this is just normal is it gonna get

00:17:55,690 --> 00:18:01,960
us to boring but super useful and

00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:05,770
reliable in some sense in that different

00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:07,690
world so I think those are the governing

00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:09,460
principles just imparting advice here

00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:11,020
based on what I've experienced working

00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:14,080
in other open-source communities the

00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:17,710
first thing is just forming a new thing

00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:22,120
here but it's really easy for this to

00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:23,710
turn into another silo there are open

00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:25,450
source movements that compete with each

00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:26,950
other there are open source movements

00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:29,440
that look at other movements that aren't

00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:31,960
as open or are closed and say I don't

00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:34,720
want anything to do with you right and

00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:37,150
we end up with new silos and that like

00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:40,360
happens for some good reasons but it's

00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:42,400
really way way better if we all put some

00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:44,080
energy into making sure and we're doing

00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,880
our best to keep everybody out of the

00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,100
silo even if you got a pull on them a

00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:49,990
little bit even if it's a group we need

00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:54,250
to exert some pressure on each other

00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:55,600
stay out of the silos make sure that

00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:57,370
what we're doing here will integrate

00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,320
with a larger developer community

00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:01,660
because the power of open source is and

00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:03,550
just you know for practical purposes an

00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:06,880
infinite resource pool of Engineers that

00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:08,530
is happy to be in your space they're

00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:12,670
happy to wander wherever they want to go

00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:14,350
they don't feel restricted at Facebook

00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:16,660
we have this expression that's been used

00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:17,980
for years this journey is 1% finished

00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:19,360
and it doesn't matter how many years

00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:21,850
you've been at Facebook or what you've

00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:24,280
accomplished or how far you've come you

00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:27,070
always seem to end with this message of

00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:30,550
journey 1% finished so you're building a

00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:32,680
new data platform and you've been doing

00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:34,630
it for years and you're making all these

00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,500
massive improvements and you're sharing

00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:36,880
it and you're growing this huge

00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:42,760
community you keep coming back every

00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:44,500
year and saying 1% finished I you know

00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:46,240
for a little while it confused me why do

00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:49,800
we keep saying that why don't we say 5%

00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:51,780
finished 2050

00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:54,090
and I you know I think basically the

00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:56,760
metaphor is this you've got to remember

00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:57,860
that for most of these things even with

00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:02,550
all the progress you've already made

00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:04,520
there's still a big open very

00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:07,500
interesting oops

00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:09,870
very interesting future in front of us

00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:11,370
with a lot of potential and it's easy to

00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:13,500
start thinking about getting to the end

00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:16,530
as if when I get there I'll just be done

00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:19,620
and that kind of causes us to undercut

00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:21,240
the total potential we can unlock okay

00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:23,670
so I got into our I got into this

00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:25,920
industry in my career just as we were

00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:27,780
stopping a lot of really fundamental

00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:29,550
innovation in computer systems and

00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:32,280
computer architecture and really

00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:34,640
focusing on just incremental version

00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:37,140
improvement don't change things too much

00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,880
make sure the system is stable the

00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:41,270
architecture is stable the design

00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,770
principles are stable and this ran from

00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:45,780
the the core of the systems through our

00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:47,430
firmware our compilers the software you

00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:49,590
wrote everything else I came into the

00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:51,030
industry around the birth of Java nobody

00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:52,980
wanted to pay attention to the hardware

00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:55,860
anymore they just wanted software

00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:57,600
productivity and I think it's pretty

00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:59,040
cool to look further back from that when

00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,510
we had all of these strange systems in

00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,890
our industry some of which were alien

00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:03,870
and see all of this fundamental

00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:06,300
innovation going on because I could see

00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:08,700
where the world had come from to get us

00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:10,560
where we are today and I kind of like to

00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:13,980
imagine we get in a time machine and

00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:15,060
move forward a few years from now and if

00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,860
you're a part of this and you're working

00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:19,140
hard on it this gives you a chance to be

00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:20,910
one of those individuals to say I was

00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:22,890
part of something that presented one of

00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:26,460
those magnitude '''l shifts in our

00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:28,380
industry yeah it was once this way and

00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:30,510
then a whole bunch of us got together

00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:32,700
and did something that seemed a little

00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:35,010
crazy and we made it into something else

00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:36,840
entirely and that's part of the legacy

00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:39,660
of what you get to say you contributed

00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:42,870
and you were a part of for somebody else

00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:45,540
to take from there so for me this is

00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:48,350
probably some significant step of

00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:54,960
ushering in this new era in our industry

00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:55,500
and it's not a really big crowd it never

00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,120
is

00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,890
these stories they tell there's never

00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,820
millions of people it's usually a

00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:04,220
relatively small room

00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:06,050
it's usually fairly well convicted set

00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:08,660
of people and some open questions and

00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:10,220
then you work on it and something else

00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:12,230
entirely new comes out of it so I'm

00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:13,760
really excited to be a part of this

00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:16,280
today to share in this announcement and

00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:18,260
I see really good things coming forward

00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:19,610
and I think over the next few

00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:21,830
presentations you're gonna see some

00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:24,200
often awesome stuff that shows this is

00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:26,980
already well underway even beyond what

00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:30,059
you've seen so far thank you

00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:30,059
