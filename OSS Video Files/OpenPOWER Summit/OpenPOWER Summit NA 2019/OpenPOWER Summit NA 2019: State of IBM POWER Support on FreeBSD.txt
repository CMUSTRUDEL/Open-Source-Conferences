Title: OpenPOWER Summit NA 2019: State of IBM POWER Support on FreeBSD
Publication date: 2019-08-28
Playlist: OpenPOWER Summit NA 2019
Description: 
	Presented by Piotr Kubaj

FreeBSD is currently the only open-source operating system other than Linux that can run on modern POWER platforms. Its advantages (ZFS file system, jails, and conservative approach) encourage some users to use it instead of Linux-based systems.

In Piotr's project, he built the whole package repository on a POWER9 server and fix software that fails to build. In this talk, he reviews the state of things on three currently supported POWER architectures - powerpc, powerpcspe and powerpc64. He also speaks to the challenges encountered when porting software to FreeBSD on POWER and the current work in progress.

	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,750
okay so my talk is about the current

00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:11,990
state of freebies Deon power

00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:15,389
architectures it's not only about the

00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:17,789
usually used power pieces its default

00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:21,720
which is for example power line I also

00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:25,439
talked a bit about the SPE chips used in

00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:27,560
for example Milotic boards or Amiga

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:33,780
boards

00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:36,510
so yeah about me I'm occupied I'm in

00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:39,960
notes and VBS this is admin sherry from

00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:43,440
Poland and I also work on FreeBSD parts

00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:47,129
parts in freebsd as third-party software

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:50,870
it's not for example cardinal it's not

00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:55,770
about compilers Lipsy things like that

00:00:50,870 --> 00:01:01,050
it's well desktop environments but also

00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:05,220
server software so everything that and

00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:08,250
you said may actually need I also got a

00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:13,040
FreeBSD Foundation grant for improving

00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:16,020
support for power in FreeBSD ports so

00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:19,890
that way I didn't actually test whether

00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:25,740
everything works on my under my desk on

00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:28,369
my workstation and I'm interested in BSD

00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:33,990
systems in the hall for example also

00:01:28,369 --> 00:01:37,790
like openbsd netbsd etc but I don't do

00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:41,909
any development on them and free

00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:45,990
open-source teamwork that's how I got

00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:49,470
into a power previously I played with

00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:52,619
coreboot and open BMC on AMD 64 might be

00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:57,360
someone who knows about as a stage II PE

00:01:52,619 --> 00:02:03,960
deceased imports they are quite widely

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:09,090
used in Kabul community ok so what is

00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:10,280
actually V BSD it's a unique system not

00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:15,490
renewed

00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:19,030
it has a non direct heritage from the

00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:25,880
unit's developed at Bell Labs

00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:30,170
so after Bell Labs unix time bsd

00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:33,620
developed by Bertie University then they

00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:38,900
stopped developing hit and BSD split

00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:42,050
into three BS the end and BSD so it can

00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:45,610
each time the long way from actually

00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:52,340
sixties but it's not operating system

00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:56,560
with code from sixties its model turns

00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:59,840
on servers desktops laptops as BCS

00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:04,360
senior bought computers like raspberry

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:10,459
pi BeagleBone it also done some power

00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:22,930
from PowerPC 32-bit like twenty-year-old

00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:29,350
Marx up to power 9 so actually why use

00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:32,810
FreeBSD why not just in the porch II the

00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:35,690
depository of third-party software makes

00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:39,350
it really easy to compile it Aston

00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:43,160
packages for example non default options

00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:47,019
some things may be set off something's

00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:50,410
non-default may be sat on we can change

00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:56,239
the default versions of software like

00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:57,920
PHP Python you can use different open

00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:02,570
SSL library for example different

00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:06,140
version or we can use different MySQL

00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:10,990
version by default

00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:14,360
and it's really easy to just deviate

00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:19,760
Testim depository if you have lots of

00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:22,370
servers to use it on there's also that

00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:27,860
FS available it's also available on

00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:29,600
cinet but it's really tricky to use the

00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:34,030
toughest on the root file system on

00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:38,990
denotes this requires some extra steps

00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:44,540
configuring custom in ETFs yeah it's not

00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:50,600
really user-friendly on TBS d it's very

00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:53,630
easy on amd64 you can just click on it

00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:58,040
via installer it takes a few minutes

00:04:53,630 --> 00:05:01,940
only on power it requires additional

00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:04,910
steps it's not as easy but I guess it's

00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:08,300
easier still than on Linux on power you

00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:14,350
need to compile a custom channel with

00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:14,350
ZFS compiled in and then you need to

00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:25,060
create your own instead you need to

00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:29,380
install a via shell so we kind of like

00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:32,270
gentle people do so create manually

00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:35,300
partitions that the first dataset and

00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:41,150
then just let the Installer copy

00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:48,260
averages everything it's kind of harsh

00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:53,240
but it works and it's stable even on

00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:57,040
power and another advantage is that

00:05:53,240 --> 00:06:02,440
there are JS JS kind of a kind of like

00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:07,220
Alexi only notes or previously openvz

00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:09,569
but it's much more major Jase Jase was

00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:12,529
introduced in

00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:15,110
the end of 90s or something like that

00:06:12,529 --> 00:06:21,719
but they are still constantly developed

00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:27,330
guys make it possible to run some other

00:06:21,719 --> 00:06:30,240
version of VB SD or some I don't know

00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:38,520
you can have some custom libraries etc

00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:43,349
and they make it impossible to exit from

00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:45,990
the Jade to the Hoth system so it's kind

00:06:43,349 --> 00:06:49,830
of like part of it virtualization it

00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:57,800
turns on the host Cardinal but the just

00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:57,800
system is totally separated okay

00:06:58,849 --> 00:07:06,209
the other difference is about

00:07:01,229 --> 00:07:10,439
development model init is just a mix of

00:07:06,209 --> 00:07:13,559
everything someone just puts it and

00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:16,619
there comes out a distribution FreeBSD

00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:20,309
is developed obvious this actually I've

00:07:16,619 --> 00:07:22,490
developed as coherent system with

00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:27,349
Cardinal Lipsy

00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:32,129
everything is bundled and if you want

00:07:27,349 --> 00:07:35,909
some additional packages you can install

00:07:32,129 --> 00:07:37,800
twist it just fine there are some binary

00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:42,059
packages you can also compile from

00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:45,389
source from the port 3 that makes it

00:07:42,059 --> 00:07:50,719
possible to use all three bsd version

00:07:45,389 --> 00:07:54,539
but it needs to be supported and current

00:07:50,719 --> 00:07:58,589
packages with new for example up a

00:07:54,539 --> 00:08:01,889
server there were also many benchmarks

00:07:58,589 --> 00:08:04,169
that network performance is better than

00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:07,289
only notes for example that's why

00:08:04,169 --> 00:08:09,869
netflix a dance on CBS d because they

00:08:07,289 --> 00:08:15,890
have a better network bandwidth

00:08:09,869 --> 00:08:17,700
throughput and maybe about everything

00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:22,590
[Music]

00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:24,700
about some preferences but VBS is a

00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:27,550
little like it's like well it's

00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:33,430
conservative if it's not broken don't

00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:36,790
fix it so yeah many people like it many

00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:45,660
people don't like it it still dance in

00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:50,370
it D from origin are BSD yeah that's it

00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:55,300
what about issues on power specifically

00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:58,780
on power architectures are big and

00:08:55,300 --> 00:09:03,340
y'know FreeBSD and PowerPC SPE and

00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:05,680
PowerPC 32-bit only began Deon you

00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:11,200
there's actually no hardware that is

00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:13,780
little-endian so that said about PowerPC

00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:17,710
seats default is now little and yun only

00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:22,660
nodes on other systems and there's a big

00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:25,930
push from companies to make renewable

00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:31,150
and Iannone maybe not the kernel itself

00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:33,940
but many applications also some problems

00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:38,910
with for example note to get its on the

00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:38,910
Kantian systems but the problem is that

00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:48,190
users of PowerPC 64 most users that

00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:51,480
there are no companies most users most

00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:56,340
users actually home yourselves that

00:09:51,480 --> 00:10:00,310
mostly have old power mark machines

00:09:56,340 --> 00:10:03,430
there are some developers and users that

00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:07,060
have new Raptor machines but they are

00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:12,130
not many the number is increasing but

00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:17,620
it's still little so if you were to move

00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:21,000
to little and young we would lose my

00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:24,040
don't know maybe most of our power users

00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:28,040
so that's why this move is unlikely to

00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:32,470
happen soon it will probably happen when

00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:32,470
more users have little-endian machines

00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:41,630
the other problem is that such a move

00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:44,389
what it would be kind of difficult

00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:47,889
because we assume in many places that

00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:53,230
power is big-endian only so you need to

00:10:47,889 --> 00:11:04,630
fix many ifs if condition conditionals

00:10:53,230 --> 00:11:07,310
okay and some upstream developers of

00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:10,069
many software we believe that I will

00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:13,370
veto is kind of connected to little

00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:15,800
endian in Contra so they say we don't

00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:23,560
support big endian because we support on

00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:23,560
a levite or that this M if it's not true

00:11:24,459 --> 00:11:32,120
and three BSD actually is switching to a

00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:39,190
veto so on but it will be still big

00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:43,100
endian so many if deaths in crowd

00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:49,579
usually need to be written by written

00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:51,680
like that and now we can t have if

00:11:49,579 --> 00:11:56,720
therefore little-endian

00:11:51,680 --> 00:12:00,560
and not for called elf equal to such

00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:04,459
things need to be fixed but we can just

00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:07,190
fix every if there to be checking for

00:12:04,459 --> 00:12:15,860
call elf because there there may be some

00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:18,170
ng honest issues then so yeah aunty I

00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:23,810
guess this is the biggest problem

00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:32,300
Phoebe SD switch to LLVM a few years ago

00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:36,620
on amd64 i386 then on arm but there were

00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:40,449
no developers interested in power so it

00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:40,449
still uses GCC 4.2

00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:48,880
along with meats and spark so there is

00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:53,940
some work on what cantatas and freebsd

00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:58,240
will switch to LLVM probably nine

00:12:53,940 --> 00:13:03,399
probably next month so yeah it will

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:06,940
support everything C++ 17 C 11 there

00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:10,839
will be probably some rough edges at the

00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:11,440
beginning something is will be needed to

00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:19,420
be fixed

00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:24,250
but to work okay so yeah

00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:30,339
GCC 4.2 clashes with some software when

00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:34,029
compiling with flux like auto and trying

00:13:30,339 --> 00:13:37,600
the most patches workarounds for this

00:13:34,029 --> 00:13:42,370
ancient compiler but there are also many

00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:44,220
patches related to for example antennas

00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:48,000
[Music]

00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:53,050
being a different system than Linux and

00:13:48,000 --> 00:14:02,730
OS X OS X because many software supports

00:13:53,050 --> 00:14:07,779
to my quest okay another problem with

00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:11,800
CBS d is actually that there are no code

00:14:07,779 --> 00:14:16,029
volumes for CBS d for example there's

00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:20,440
some if death in notes is deaf AIX if

00:14:16,029 --> 00:14:26,440
they have even Mac OS but there's no if

00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:29,610
they're for FreeBSD I played a little

00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:34,370
with open glass it's very widely used

00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:39,529
and there are many many if there's for

00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:43,360
many functions and as it happens it can

00:14:39,529 --> 00:14:46,610
all be fixed if I just replace all

00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:54,530
checks for minutes to be checking for

00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:55,749
VBS dmg notes then it just works and

00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:59,680
[Music]

00:14:55,749 --> 00:15:03,800
actually that is not all because power

00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:07,430
often doesn't power on power 8 and power

00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:16,069
9 is little-endian only so we need to

00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:33,189
optimize for power 6 and older and

00:15:16,069 --> 00:15:37,519
another place flag flag and I guess some

00:15:33,189 --> 00:15:41,990
widely known IBM developers recently

00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:45,920
added power feature detection in flood

00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:49,129
it's awesome yeah but it uses get aux

00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:53,920
Val function which is non-standard

00:15:49,129 --> 00:15:58,059
GD p-- C extension and there's no if def

00:15:53,920 --> 00:16:02,660
for other option for other systems

00:15:58,059 --> 00:16:06,079
FreeBSD actually has Alf aux-in for

00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:09,610
function because it's a little

00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:13,210
incompatible with that area as well so

00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:17,290
it was made on purpose that

00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:21,610
it has a different time and there was no

00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:24,160
if death so did the developer assumed

00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:26,860
everyone was longing in notes or that

00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:50,050
that I worked well so what's available

00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:52,840
everywhere this well now yeah I yeah I

00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:55,390
actually checked why I am these six

00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:59,140
different walks it looks like they don't

00:16:55,390 --> 00:17:03,670
use that aux Val they just checked some

00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:13,180
registers directly and that's why it

00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:17,170
works so there are also some stupid I

00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:35,310
don't know how to call it another way of

00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:43,240
them architectures and we need to fix

00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:48,240
such parts okay so with so many things

00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:53,890
not working what actually works

00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:55,630
recently we succeeded in getting ready

00:17:53,890 --> 00:18:02,410
on time as channel driver

00:17:55,630 --> 00:18:06,310
it supports radians up to HD 7000 it's

00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:11,170
enough for my 4k display there's no

00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:17,560
acceleration but there will be some work

00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:20,170
on that there's audio via snd HD HIV it

00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:24,190
settlement rival it also works on amd64

00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:26,679
everywhere it supports standalone PCI XP

00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:32,230
starts and HDMI instead

00:18:26,679 --> 00:18:36,909
some lady on FAMAS it works I guess

00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:43,370
peripherals like USB and via neediest

00:18:36,909 --> 00:18:47,779
they work that FL some wrote it requires

00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:55,039
custom installation but what stable je

00:18:47,779 --> 00:18:59,269
is this Egyptian we can have accepted

00:18:55,039 --> 00:19:03,500
good with also Ward's it also needs

00:18:59,269 --> 00:19:10,880
another channel options like that FS but

00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:15,139
yeah it works but one issue is that boot

00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:24,710
file system is to be unencrypted but

00:19:15,139 --> 00:19:28,070
that's it and about available versions

00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:33,080
there's the newest release is twelve

00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:37,210
point out and only twelve added support

00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:39,830
for power nine eleven is supported but

00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:41,269
still supported by three BSD security

00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:42,950
team but there's no support for

00:19:41,269 --> 00:19:44,870
powerline so if you want to try on

00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:47,260
powerline when you actually need twelve

00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:52,580
back to a spot on the lease itself

00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:58,100
actually has an inter stripped bark so

00:19:52,580 --> 00:20:02,029
it won't good currently to be released

00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:09,230
twelve point of 12-21-12 twelve point

00:20:02,029 --> 00:20:13,880
one does work and there are no strange

00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:18,750
things happening edges thirteen current

00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:24,530
so just had allows to use

00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:29,880
the new radians because 12 has on the

00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:33,930
Magus driver from Innova 3.08 or

00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:36,960
something like that it's pretty old and

00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:45,180
their experimental images of talent that

00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:49,290
use LLVM those are a veto there seem to

00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:53,730
be now stably stability problems about

00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:59,190
many parts needs fixing

00:20:53,730 --> 00:21:02,160
so currently what on that there's one

00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:08,970
minor issue that 32-bit binaries on

00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:11,510
PowerPC don't the LD link are in our AVM

00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:15,620
doesn't support him in such binaries

00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:19,890
there are some features in other vm 9

00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:25,490
and i hope it will work because

00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:29,220
apparently those images use no link to

00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:36,900
point 17 which is about 10 years old

00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:45,480
just like GCC regarding the ports tree

00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:48,960
itself last November when it was a few

00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:53,310
months after power 9 some people already

00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:55,770
got their systems and there were many

00:21:53,310 --> 00:22:00,630
developers more interested in power on

00:21:55,770 --> 00:22:04,730
FreeBSD so we can see that about less

00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:04,730
than half packages were built

00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:15,470
then with its many issues in the tunnel

00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:22,159
in base system libraries in Perth itself

00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:31,330
and the last month about 25 29,000 built

00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:31,330
so yeah it's huge what was done

00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:40,549
previously cute five opened last last

00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:46,039
didn't work now they work other software

00:22:40,549 --> 00:22:50,470
that was web browsers auto browser for

00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:55,400
example works other cute WebKit browsers

00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:58,929
they are ok but they have problems with

00:22:55,400 --> 00:23:02,720
Java Script is probably some Indians but

00:22:58,929 --> 00:23:05,150
so yeah eternity on FreeBSD in power

00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:12,880
don't have and the JavaScript enabled

00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:18,110
browser browser sports game MPV player

00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:22,909
Matt lost my my science a new pad PDF

00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:29,980
which is PDF viewer desktop environments

00:23:22,909 --> 00:23:37,150
like KD XFC and many many other software

00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:37,150
so quite many things were country and

00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:43,880
there's this work to switch all power

00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:48,620
comes to LLVM at we probably happened

00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:51,919
next month when other vm9 is smudged to

00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:55,340
freebsd client will be used for

00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:59,289
completion and al-led for linking so we

00:23:55,340 --> 00:24:02,870
probably will remove you know LD

00:23:59,289 --> 00:24:06,740
completely and on top of that we switch

00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:12,919
to a little together with a switch to

00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:16,760
plan PowerPC 32-bit recently switched to

00:24:12,919 --> 00:24:18,539
secure PRT this switch also effects

00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:22,709
32-bit binary

00:24:18,539 --> 00:24:29,699
sixty four-bit power so that's another

00:24:22,709 --> 00:24:34,169
news regarding GPIOs I an AMD GPU driver

00:24:29,699 --> 00:24:41,089
try introduced four new radians what

00:24:34,169 --> 00:24:46,789
just fine on FreeBSD amd64 so yeah and

00:24:41,089 --> 00:24:50,669
it probably will be ported to power but

00:24:46,789 --> 00:24:53,249
the driver itself only notes assumes

00:24:50,669 --> 00:24:56,999
that it turns on little endian so

00:24:53,249 --> 00:25:01,319
currently it doesn't even run on the big

00:24:56,999 --> 00:25:03,690
endian denotes and Linux users on big

00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:06,779
and young need to use the old lady on

00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:14,629
driver but there's the company called

00:25:06,779 --> 00:25:18,659
Hyperion the manufacture PowerPC boards

00:25:14,629 --> 00:25:20,999
on that's an Amiga OS they are not open

00:25:18,659 --> 00:25:24,899
power the you don't an host boot patty

00:25:20,999 --> 00:25:28,649
boot etc they have their own femur bath

00:25:24,899 --> 00:25:33,199
those boards those scipios began young

00:25:28,649 --> 00:25:38,759
they are not IBM CPUs they use fishtails

00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:47,269
CPUs but it's also power and Hyperion

00:25:38,759 --> 00:25:50,309
created AMD GPU driver for the OS

00:25:47,269 --> 00:25:57,629
there's also a problem currently with

00:25:50,309 --> 00:26:02,489
note nodejs beets some small patches are

00:25:57,629 --> 00:26:09,259
needed but as much a bad process HM ice

00:26:02,489 --> 00:26:09,259
I was when running now Jaso

00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:18,660
actually Jeff told me about Gustavo

00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:22,010
tomato deviously Gustavo no matter as

00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:25,950
far as I know is currently working on

00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:32,480
fixing node and then we can get to build

00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:32,480
Firefox because dust already works

00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:42,330
Patti boot plugin work because we

00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:47,850
currently boot Cardinal directly there's

00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:53,970
no patent put dragon much means that we

00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:59,220
can't have loadable modules on board on

00:26:53,970 --> 00:27:03,120
amd64 we don't need ZFS module compiled

00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:06,270
in we can just add loader to load the

00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:10,020
module on power we can't do it because

00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:14,400
there's no patty boot calendar but it's

00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:17,730
in work there's some loader for power

00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:21,660
platforms that was done for PlayStation

00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:25,500
3 and PlayStation freelance some old

00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:27,930
version of patty boot so it will be it's

00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:36,080
actually currently being ported to power

00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:40,160
line and something about how to CSV for

00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:45,990
Amiga boards GCC currently removed

00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:48,420
support for dolls because it was kind of

00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:51,690
bad route or something like that but

00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:52,520
what it may have been not readable but

00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:56,730
it worked

00:27:52,520 --> 00:28:03,270
and there's world by FreeBSD community

00:27:56,730 --> 00:28:07,890
to use LLVM and it will be probably

00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:09,840
working in hell vm 9 so freebsd may

00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:16,430
actually have better support zone for

00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:16,430
those scipios ok

00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:54,349
[Music]

00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:19,990
yeah because it it's really about that

00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:21,170
from support community because you can

00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:26,610
[Music]

00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:30,500
such for example my craft board with no

00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:30,500
in words because we need DCC

00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:47,520
yourselves as far as I know only some

00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:48,130
developers use it so yeah that's not

00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,760
much

00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:54,690
[Music]

00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:58,470
yeah I don't know actually the totally

00:29:54,690 --> 00:30:06,230
only a few developers but there are many

00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:10,320
users of PowerPC yo I can't say how many

00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:15,260
but if something takes usually on the

00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:21,179
mailing list on my IRC someone tells us

00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:23,850
yeah we have users but we can't we don't

00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:29,400
count how many downloads are done for

00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:33,900
each architecture so yeah and many

00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:39,900
questions this is my email and what

00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:44,010
anybody wants to write to me or I'm on

00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:47,010
IRC also and if anyone wants to check

00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:52,890
how FreeBSD is doing from power the

00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:58,710
PowerPC 64 channel that's when most ppl

00:30:52,890 --> 00:31:00,880
the devs yeah

00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:10,500
yeah

00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:15,040
do you have any users on servers no I

00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:19,800
guess no professional companies as it

00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:23,460
may be some individual users because

00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:26,670
well there's a problem that after power

00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:32,130
after last tower marks there were no

00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:36,880
available easy available power board so

00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:40,420
it was difficult to bring support to

00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:45,540
FreeBSD to power some for example power

00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:51,510
7 on the booth paradigm it became

00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:55,170
physically feasible to do so I guess

00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:59,890
there will be some users but only when

00:31:55,170 --> 00:32:05,760
power support is in place just like MVCC

00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:05,760
for okay

00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,910
I guess that's it

00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:20,989
let's let me actually let me go down the

00:32:18,409 --> 00:32:24,369
path that Lance was on so in the Intel

00:32:20,989 --> 00:32:27,200
side what are the common uses of FreeBSD

00:32:24,369 --> 00:32:29,210
in the marketplace etc you know what

00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:44,869
what are most people using FreeBSD for

00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:47,149
then can you can you talk in the

00:32:44,869 --> 00:32:49,639

base for the products but they don't

00:33:08,989 --> 00:33:17,599
actually use T BSD on servers they just

00:33:14,989 --> 00:33:24,139
build products using FreeBSD right for

00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:26,059
