Publication date: 2019-08-28
Playlist: OpenPOWER Summit NA 2019
Description: 
	Presented by Piotr Kubaj

FreeBSD is currently the only open-source operating system other than Linux that can run on modern POWER platforms. Its advantages (ZFS file system, jails, and conservative approach) encourage some users to use it instead of Linux-based systems.

In Piotr's project, he built the whole package repository on a POWER9 server and fix software that fails to build. In this talk, he reviews the state of things on three currently supported POWER architectures - powerpc, powerpcspe and powerpc64. He also speaks to the challenges encountered when porting software to FreeBSD on POWER and the current work in progress.
