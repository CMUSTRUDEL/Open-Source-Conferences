Title: OpenPOWER Summit NA 2019: The POWER of Supercomputers at Your Fingertips
Publication date: 2019-08-20
Playlist: OpenPOWER Summit NA 2019
Description: 
	Presented by Rafael Sene, IBM

A healthy ecosystem is fundamental for any computer architecture to thrive nowadays and developers are the fuel that keeps it moving and evolving. They need access to resources that can empower them to get the most of their applications and amaze their customers. As the architecture that is the core of the #1 and #2 fastest supercomputers in the world, POWER is where they need to be, but how developers can leverage it as part of their daily activities? This presentation will demonstrate how everyone can get FREE access to the POWER architecture and start building, porting and tuning their applications right away. It will show how to build on POWER using GitHub, Travis CI, and GitLab and how to get FREE access to POWER resources.

okay so here we go my let's get it said

00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:10,830
my name is rafael sanam from IBM Brazil

00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:14,070
I work part of the book the power

00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:17,840
systems organization currently work on

00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:20,490
the cloud squared doing different set of

00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:23,070
things there especially on cloud private

00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:26,039
and more recently working OpenShift on

00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:29,670
power so today I'm going to talk about a

00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:33,270
little bit how we can anyone can get

00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:37,620
access to power for free and there is a

00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:38,760
so different sets different set of

00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:44,750
configurations that you can try

00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:44,750
different environments and here we go so

00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:49,920
just talk I talked a little bit about me

00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:52,620
moving forward if you need to talk to me

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,480
just my mail or which email this is

00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:59,760
affecting me holding a power line

00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:02,340
processor it's everyone and today how

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:06,060
are we going to make your house make

00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:08,670
your journey to power easier and that's

00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:11,640
important because this one the first

00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:15,299
pace of new open source projects if you

00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:17,220
look at at this picture this is going to

00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:19,560
tell a lot about what's going to on

00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:22,380
recently especially on the cloud native

00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,630
foundation there's a bunch of new

00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:28,310
projects that emerge from all the place

00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:33,540
and usually those projects

00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:38,490
born on x86 and for us working on power

00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:40,799
you should we have the hard work on with

00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:43,979
a project get start to get too much

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:46,950
attention and then it is considered to

00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:49,200
be should be run on power we start

00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:51,630
engaging the community or we start to

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,780
doing the build then the last step is to

00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:57,360
once we have ported tests and doing have

00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:00,630
done everything that we really need to

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,100
do to make that project run on power we

00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:04,020
need to start contributing back the

00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:08,069
change and this is the process that

00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:09,989
takes a long time eventually the

00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:13,370
community may not accept power as a

00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:15,620
first class citizen in there

00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:18,739
list of supported architectures and we

00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:20,629
may end up using alternative like

00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:27,379
hosting that packaging and different

00:02:20,629 --> 00:02:30,230
place or say it put putting that in an

00:02:27,379 --> 00:02:33,200
FTP server or anything like that and

00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:34,610
that does not work well because every

00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,489
time you have a new update in the

00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:40,370
community and the community moves fast

00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:43,610
we need to go there okay the package is

00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:46,579
doing all the tests again and kind of we

00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:49,940
are locket in this cycle where if we're

00:02:46,579 --> 00:02:52,370
not if power is not accept as a first

00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:55,730
first class citizen in a specific

00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:58,879
community we need to do our jobs and get

00:02:55,730 --> 00:03:00,920
that package put someplace in some place

00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:03,620
where people can use that for instance

00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:06,349
this is my last attempt to add support

00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:08,930
for power in an open source project so I

00:03:06,349 --> 00:03:13,760
have a page living there for about one

00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:16,129
move it's a very small page and no

00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:19,040
answer so far from the maintainer this

00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:22,940
is for a sticky recipes is a solid back

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:26,500
at the cut two that are used by Valero

00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:30,560
Valero is an open source - also for

00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:34,700
that's used for backup and restore in

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:37,099
data from kubernetes cluster and it's

00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:39,349
evil ever used by IBM much called the

00:03:37,099 --> 00:03:41,239
manager so there is a change of the

00:03:39,349 --> 00:03:43,519
penances that we need to get solve it to

00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:45,799
get that working power where well this

00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:48,560
is one of that the all of the departs

00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:50,629
and to overcome the situation I had to

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:54,980
build this by myself

00:03:50,629 --> 00:03:58,099
whole state at UNICAMP and the other guy

00:03:54,980 --> 00:04:00,940
work on Valero had to use my pre-built

00:03:58,099 --> 00:04:05,030
package it to contribute the changed

00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:08,120
back to Valero we know that this is

00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:10,970
important because the adoption of open

00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:14,000
source software comes from developers

00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:16,070
organically downloading using it so that

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,760
happened with Valero when people start

00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:22,180
using Valero - for their backup backup

00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,180
there

00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:28,930
kubernetes environment

00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:30,670
it became we all know too that anyone

00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:33,700
was used and that was not to run on

00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:36,040
power and then we had to catch up and

00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:39,160
trying to make and make that runs on

00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:42,070
power so making developers making

00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:43,750
developers life easier and ensuring to

00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:46,480
ensure that they have they can have

00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:50,770
access to power is critical so they can

00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:53,050
add the support as part of their working

00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:55,450
day without too much effort I would say

00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:58,600
at least we should be providing easy

00:04:55,450 --> 00:05:02,530
access so they can do the muchacabra

00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:03,760
doubt any any any big issues out so the

00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:06,580
world is new charge

00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:08,380
we cannot be locket with a specific

00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:10,240
architecture considering that the most

00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:14,860
important one and forgetting about the

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:17,890
order so power is there power is a so

00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:19,510
it's powers the two fastest computer in

00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:22,570
the world so this is the place where

00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:25,050
developers should be all to be

00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:29,680
developing the pointer application so

00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:31,480
let's do let's start to talk about how

00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,720
we can move check all the things on

00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:37,450
power this is the first chapter so and

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:40,780
the first chapter I will talk about the

00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:44,500
power SDK back in 2011 we started

00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:47,500
developing the SDK basically the idea

00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:49,720
behind that was that I can't collect

00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:53,230
them the knowledge of those people that

00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:57,160
are experts on power create a set of

00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:59,500
tools and make that available for

00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:02,440
developers so they can use that for

00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:04,270
porting their application to power so as

00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:07,000
part of the SDK we had a to call it

00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:08,710
migration advisor by the way this is the

00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,880
chart that represented back in Oakland

00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:14,169
percent in 2016 about the SDK the

00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:17,050
migration divisor was a 2 that we

00:06:14,169 --> 00:06:19,930
develop it so you could import your

00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:23,590
sauce your source code C C++ inside of

00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:28,030
the SDK run verification and migration

00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:30,250
divider would point where where your

00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:33,190
application could fail on migrating from

00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:34,480
x86 power eventually we would provide a

00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:37,750
quick fix for this one

00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:40,990
for specific issue then just pressing

00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:45,220
that link you could convert the code

00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:49,000
from x86 to power automatically but

00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:51,280
that's the first step but back there the

00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,700
access to power was not that easy so we

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:57,070
had to do some something else and what

00:06:54,700 --> 00:07:00,630
we did was to integrate kim kiyul user

00:06:57,070 --> 00:07:04,390
mode and the IBM power simulators so

00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:06,100
we're using kimu user mode anyone could

00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:10,690
cross compile their application on x86

00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:14,170
and run that on the x86 as a process and

00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:16,990
that work it and we did we also

00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:21,670
integrated the IBM power simulator back

00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:25,060
in 2016 it was only the power 8 this is

00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:27,670
a make the simulates a real power

00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:29,260
machine it's of course is low but that

00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:30,970
help is if you do not have a power

00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:33,460
machine around so we can get started

00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:38,500
right away without in NSS to buy a

00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:41,740
machine so we this was an eclipse-based

00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:43,240
ID that at the end we converted to a set

00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:46,090
of open source tools that are available

00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:49,060
at github and one can grow there and

00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:50,920
clone and start using but the SDK is no

00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:53,080
longer under development so we stopped

00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:56,350
at that it's already it's still

00:07:53,080 --> 00:08:00,010
available and anyone can use so but the

00:07:56,350 --> 00:08:03,400
SDK was not enough and that take us to

00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:04,290
the chaplet shed true which is free

00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:07,570
access to power

00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:09,850
so we free access to power we could

00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:11,290
somehow create a florid field where

00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:13,660
developers can get the research they

00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:15,730
need before I asking the developers are

00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:20,740
the be and the resource are the flowers

00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:22,990
there believe you have have seen the the

00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:25,270
presentation but that Clause did a few

00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:28,540
minutes ago about UNICAMP in at UNICAMP

00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:31,150
we did the mini cloud basically an open

00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:33,400
stack environment where everything runs

00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:35,290
on power and you can ask for account

00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:37,270
there we are going to approve the

00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:41,620
Pantheon depending on what we are going

00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:43,390
to do there and that's it power for

00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:44,950
machine for free we have another

00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:46,980
environments like like Oregon State

00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:50,160
University that you can go there and

00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:53,959
for resources that are freely available

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:57,240
and that's important so instead of

00:08:53,959 --> 00:09:00,660
having only a tool that could that

00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:03,480
anyone could use to try power on your

00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:05,730
x86 now we have a free access to power

00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:07,800
so we can start off via virtual machine

00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:11,220
login that machine and do whatever you

00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:16,470
want we we start a very small I'd say

00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:18,480
back 2014 only 11 users a little bit

00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:22,079
concerned about where that's going to

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:24,920
end and eventually the community starts

00:09:22,079 --> 00:09:27,810
to using that we realized that that were

00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:30,000
free resources available for power and

00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:32,519
they came so we have a bunch of

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:37,440
developers from different communities

00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:39,779
not those community does not use our

00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,639
resources at their main resource for

00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:43,470
power but developers when they need to

00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:46,589
port or they need to test something on

00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:50,070
power eventually they asked for us for a

00:09:46,589 --> 00:09:54,480
free virtual machine so since 2014 we

00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:56,699
have more than 1,000 requests which is a

00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:01,170
considered a good number for a mini

00:09:56,699 --> 00:10:03,540
cloud and we are continually growing so

00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:05,819
those requests usually people do all

00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:09,660
sorts of things like make software

00:10:05,819 --> 00:10:13,260
multi-platform create enable software on

00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:17,100
power somehow I studied Linux and that's

00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:19,470
important because when we do offer free

00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:22,050
access and when the free access is no

00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:25,529
longer a solution for this specific

00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:27,779
commute they buy power and that what

00:10:25,529 --> 00:10:31,199
happened with mono they start they use

00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:33,660
it our resources for several years I

00:10:31,199 --> 00:10:36,269
would say for free and when the free

00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:38,310
resources were no longer enough for

00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:41,579
their need they decide to buy a power

00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:44,040
machine so free access creates a

00:10:41,579 --> 00:10:46,410
opportunites this is cool for IBM for

00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:50,910
the partners that are playing that

00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:54,329
making playing on make power accessible

00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:55,140
system but cool this isn't this is this

00:10:54,329 --> 00:10:58,020
enough let's say

00:10:55,140 --> 00:11:01,020
providing free access power gas having

00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:03,390
to that people can use it to migrate to

00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:05,730
their applications to power or simulate

00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:09,630
power on x86 machine unfortunately no

00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:12,540
and that take us to the chapter 3 of our

00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:16,589
journey which is we need to beware

00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:18,480
developer is developer are sorry if you

00:11:16,589 --> 00:11:20,130
want to make power if you want to ensure

00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:24,180
that power is the first first-class

00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:26,730
citizen in the development world we need

00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:29,100
to ensure that we know we are where they

00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:31,230
they are doing their job essentially

00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:33,720
those developers here will be the ones

00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:39,690
making the decision about which server

00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:42,060
to use which application of how Ben F go

00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:43,620
is to use multiple architectures so we

00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:46,680
need to ensure that they have the

00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:48,990
opportunity to play with the the fastest

00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:53,190
architecture in the world could say and

00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:55,440
we should make that easier and by being

00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:58,640
on where developers are I mean that we

00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:02,930
should be here at github and get lab

00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:06,630
they we have more open source to source

00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:08,700
code management tools like bitbucket but

00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:13,529
though these two are the most used at

00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:15,720
once and I would say github is the

00:12:13,529 --> 00:12:17,220
biggest one we all know that and we

00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,470
should be there we should be part of

00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:22,980
that and when to ensure that when a new

00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:25,170
project starts or someone want to do

00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:28,740
some POC or whatever they want to do

00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:30,930
with a different architecture we can we

00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:33,870
are there power is there that then that

00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:38,250
we should make that easier so start with

00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:40,560
github the first the first and the

00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:44,040
easiest way to get your builds on power

00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:46,170
at github is using trewsy i so we have

00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:48,899
you out here who is work directly on

00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:52,470
that and Travis is a host that serves

00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:54,990
that we can we can configure and start

00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:58,680
to building your application very

00:12:54,990 --> 00:13:02,339
quickly it's a it's easy to configure

00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:06,510
it's easy to maintain and it's used by a

00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:08,880
lot of people you can say that they they

00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:11,200
are them the most the Travis is the most

00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,480
used CI to out there for

00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:16,810
open-source projects that are hosted at

00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:19,810
github so you can see that by this big

00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:22,839
number they are they are this is a huge

00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:26,440
number so this is one of the safest play

00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:27,970
that we we need to be if you want to

00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:31,029
succeed with power with your open source

00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:33,250
community we must be there and to start

00:13:31,029 --> 00:13:35,470
the build on power using Travis all you

00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:37,450
need is this flag

00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:40,149
we have another one call it architecture

00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:44,019
but this is also will get your building

00:13:40,149 --> 00:13:48,430
on power and and how you do that that's

00:13:44,019 --> 00:13:51,910
pretty simple so step one login in your

00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:54,700
thread in the tribes org simple you can

00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:57,640
log in with your github account step to

00:13:54,700 --> 00:14:01,110
enable your project also simple just

00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:04,380
turn on Travis for your specific project

00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:04,380
step 3

00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:10,540
this is the most important part this is

00:14:07,329 --> 00:14:13,750
the recipe that's going to be executed

00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:16,660
by traps so this is a very very simple

00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:20,170
example just to show how we can do that

00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:21,730
how you can do that you need to write we

00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:24,579
need to create this travesty I'm a

00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:26,079
recipe and inside it is file we are

00:14:24,579 --> 00:14:28,000
going to describe what's going to happen

00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,589
if you are beaut this is a very simple

00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,060
build

00:14:28,589 --> 00:14:33,339
example how you can do that but we have

00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:36,820
a more complex one like this one which

00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:39,519
use it by pops this kyboot the open

00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:43,540
power is kyboot so they are using Travis

00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:46,449
to Butte to test their software on

00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:48,910
different set of rating systems and you

00:14:46,449 --> 00:14:52,839
can do that so you can expand that and

00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:55,420
do whatever you want on power so so in

00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:59,019
this case here sorry let go a little bit

00:14:55,420 --> 00:15:00,880
in this case he is building on x86 and

00:14:59,019 --> 00:15:03,670
on power at the same time basically

00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:06,459
execute in the same set of comments on

00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:08,649
both architecture validate in the same

00:15:06,459 --> 00:15:10,120
architecture at the same time what

00:15:08,649 --> 00:15:13,810
dating different architecture at the

00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:15,250
same time when you start in building you

00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:17,740
configure your project and started

00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:20,490
building user Travis you you can see

00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:23,510
that you're going to see these in your

00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:26,180
computers or merge request

00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:28,690
and this is indicates that Travis is

00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:30,620
doing something with that specific

00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:34,699
specific piece of code that was

00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:36,110
submitted and when you do that so when

00:15:34,699 --> 00:15:38,510
you start the beauty of trails you can

00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:40,310
see that you can login that you'll see

00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:42,740
the progress of your build you like this

00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:45,470
one so this is that it's more example

00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:49,310
that I showed you so this is just your

00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:53,180
name your name output here so you can

00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:57,019
see that this is PPC 60/40 so first this

00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:58,970
is the first two works very well you can

00:15:57,019 --> 00:16:02,110
talk to Garrett if with more details

00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:06,709
about what's going to happen but this is

00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:09,949
available it's in alpha so does not is

00:16:06,709 --> 00:16:11,589
not publicly available so you can start

00:16:09,949 --> 00:16:14,720
using that that's going to be

00:16:11,589 --> 00:16:16,910
interesting to see you're using traps on

00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,910
power so more documentation about that

00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:22,130
is here just to just learn how you can

00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:26,420
increase your recipe to starting build

00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:28,550
on traps so also this is a cases that we

00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:31,040
have we have internally at IBM we also

00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:33,440
have a tribes enterprise deployed and at

00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:37,010
IBM we have we have added the capability

00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:39,380
to build not only x86 and on power but

00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:40,760
also built on Z so anyone inside IBM can

00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:43,040
be used on the three plan or the three

00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:45,019
architectures at the same time we

00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:48,260
started with drives at IBM back to Tel

00:16:45,019 --> 00:16:50,000
17 as a requirement for the cloud

00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:52,970
private IP em quad private development

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:56,209
so we would like to make power at the

00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:59,839
same have power to help the parity with

00:16:56,209 --> 00:17:04,220
x86 so to do that we should join again

00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:06,799
join join the the journey that you were

00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:09,260
doing for ICT and beware developer there

00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:12,049
developers were so that means that those

00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:16,939
developers were using Travis and somehow

00:17:12,049 --> 00:17:20,390
we should be there so we started to

00:17:16,939 --> 00:17:22,480
integrate that back in 2017 as I'm as

00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:24,290
I'm H so it was required for ICP

00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,329
development IDM called private

00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:28,160
development and today we expanded that

00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:29,919
so anyone inside IBM came build own

00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:33,740
power and that's interesting because

00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:37,070
again like what like it like we did with

00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:40,490
UNICAMP providing free access to power

00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:43,880
did this happen inside IBM too so when

00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:46,910
people so important note we didn't

00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:50,390
disclaimed is that internally so we

00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:52,220
didn't send in in May or didn't publish

00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:54,860
anything internal is saying that you can

00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:56,900
build on power using threads at IBM

00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:58,880
people start to discover it's covering

00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:01,370
this by themselves and today you have

00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:06,170
more than two to two hundred thousand

00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:08,270
views from power and not only for ICP

00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:12,410
but for instance e we have a project

00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:15,200
doing testing testing for doing a set of

00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:16,790
tests for the Linux kernel power using

00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,850
Travis they have a bunch of recipes that

00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:22,360
do all sorts of things with a new kernel

00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:25,550
or that's going to be in the next

00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:27,050
operating system for that's going to run

00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:29,960
on power so that's interesting to see

00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:32,090
people are using so why again what I did

00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:35,480
we just offer something that developers

00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:37,400
really wanted to use and they start

00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:40,430
using that so that's that's very

00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:42,980
interesting to see happen inside IBM so

00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:47,600
this is the integration between github

00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:50,200
and Travis CI what we have more so

00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:53,990
people made does not like github because

00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:59,000
no it's not Microsoft thing and they can

00:18:53,990 --> 00:19:02,150
somehow be using git lab and get lab is

00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,310
a similar to github where you can host

00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:07,250
your source code source code there but

00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:08,720
it's better on managing really a

00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:10,520
software release for it so you can go

00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,530
from the source code management to

00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:16,250
managing issues and doing the the the

00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:20,120
ICD there and they have a software

00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:24,230
called get lab runner which is agent

00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:28,010
that runs in your server and this

00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:31,310
connects to to the get lab master will

00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:34,600
say and when this process is completed

00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:38,480
he started to listen for building quests

00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:42,410
so the good news is that this get

00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:44,720
reliable Runner is was written using go

00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:47,180
lank and that runs on power out of the

00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:49,910
box so we do not need to do anything

00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:50,770
else to make this to start the building

00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:54,340
on power using

00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:59,800
laughs so how you can do that first time

00:19:54,340 --> 00:20:02,530
signing your get live account this is

00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:08,230
this is the point where gitlab is

00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:11,610
different from Travis I want Travis you

00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:17,590
do not need to provide your back-end

00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:20,350
tribes can have their own servers and

00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:21,910
they can take when you use tribes you

00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:24,840
just need to configure your recipe there

00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:29,110
for gitlab you need to have your server

00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:31,720
and this is interesting especially if

00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:33,760
you want to have some particular

00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:38,020
configuration like you want to use GPUs

00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:40,120
or you want to have a server with a

00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:44,260
specific configuration that is not

00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:45,700
available on Travis for instance so yeah

00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:48,670
this is where they are different so you

00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:53,070
need to provide your own back-end to

00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:56,710
start using gitlab and for instance here

00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:59,230
in this deck in this example installed

00:20:56,710 --> 00:21:02,170
that on a boon to machine virtual

00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:04,210
machine at UNICAMP so for this example

00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:07,480
I'm using a virtual machine at UNICAMP

00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:11,890
where I got my VM and start installing

00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:14,410
my get detail a prerunner then I need to

00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:16,690
go back to my my project that kit lab

00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:21,480
and configure that so go to the CI CD

00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:25,450
got runners then I'm going to have here

00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:30,220
path plus a key that I should should use

00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:33,310
to connect my server to this getting get

00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:38,680
lab master when I do that so I have a

00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:41,560
step to execute so basically to the

00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:44,200
configuration set in the correct URL

00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:48,130
here and this is the most important one

00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:51,460
the flag this is as a result in Travis

00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:54,160
that we have that OS tag here we are

00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:56,830
going to use the Ubuntu PPC 64 you can

00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:59,320
define your own but do not need to use

00:21:56,830 --> 00:22:02,590
this but this is just an example how we

00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:04,150
can do that when you configure your

00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:08,190
github runner to

00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:11,850
a cure did you let master would say

00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:14,860
you're going to see this one so observe

00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:16,930
from this for my project I have a

00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:23,500
specific a runner dedicated runner

00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:26,860
that's all you will build jobs which

00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:30,670
contains this flag so this is my power

00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:34,060
VM attach it to my project in gitlab and

00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:37,060
this will enable me to do all sorts of

00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:41,110
testing and building and whatever I need

00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:43,930
to do on power from gitlab so similarly

00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:48,490
to Travis you need to describe a recipe

00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:52,300
here a young go file there's no one to

00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:55,450
run porting from Travis - jeez file so

00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:57,190
it has its own syntax so you need to

00:22:55,450 --> 00:23:00,160
just take a look on documentation how to

00:22:57,190 --> 00:23:03,550
do that but in this example so I have

00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:06,550
set the tag ubuntu PPC 64 li like I have

00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:10,300
configured in my kit in my my initial

00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:13,120
steps so when I do this and I send a

00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:15,460
pull request or do the traditional

00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:18,520
development workflow it's going to build

00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:21,340
I'm going to build my my project on

00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:26,380
power so it's hard to see here but I

00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:28,960
promise this is PPC 64 le and yep so

00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:31,990
this is how we can build on power using

00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:34,240
git lab that's interesting because again

00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:36,100
like we did with UNICAMP

00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,440
like we did with Travis Travis

00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:41,950
externally and tribes at IBM we offer

00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:44,290
this as a possibility so there's no

00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:47,080
charge for people doing that go to

00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:49,510
UNICAMP go to us osu get grab your own

00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:51,280
vm and started with that and there is

00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:55,270
two interesting parts that when we did

00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:59,440
that people start using like this guy we

00:23:55,270 --> 00:24:02,430
have a thread on on an issue it get get

00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:05,260
lab repository where we want them to

00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:08,140
formally support that on power or add

00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:10,690
power lifted as a supported platform and

00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:14,020
this guy is part of their discussion

00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:17,110
somehow when I joined the thread saying

00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:19,060
that they attest that on power it works

00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:22,990
got my VM at UNICAMP and did the other

00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:25,690
tests that required that guy saw this

00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:28,600
saw the link and hand he asked it for a

00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:32,380
VM a teeny cab he started to using that

00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:38,800
and he enabled his project called a/c

00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:41,560
unit at on power so this wasn't expected

00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:46,090
at all but this is a good result so

00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:48,040
people started using by getting the

00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:52,060
knowledge about how to do that and this

00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:55,870
is important so very simple steps very

00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:57,370
very easy steps on how to do what we

00:24:55,870 --> 00:25:02,200
need to do on power so there is no

00:24:57,370 --> 00:25:03,250
blocker so the resources are available

00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:06,850
so anyone can do that

00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:09,820
and in the case of get lab you can get

00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:12,300
more resources here to understand how

00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:18,640
you can configure your build script

00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:22,420
using it lab so what next we we tried

00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:25,690
the SDK where we put together a set of

00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:28,350
tools a tooling mechanism that would

00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:32,680
help developers moving for x86 power

00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:34,690
then we enable them enable people to use

00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:37,360
it to have the access to power for free

00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:39,580
using the clouds the public cloud I

00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:42,070
would say that we have in some

00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:47,110
universities around the world and now we

00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:49,720
are somehow trying to be part part of

00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:53,440
the party and join developers where they

00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:57,610
are I would say that the the basal layer

00:25:53,440 --> 00:26:01,720
is there and of course we need more

00:25:57,610 --> 00:26:05,680
power so maybe more resource available

00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:10,530
easy available so people can get the

00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:13,960
resource even with easily I would say

00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:16,030
better documentation so as sometimes

00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:18,460
added support for a different

00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:21,040
architecture is not trivial especially

00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:22,840
if a given community or project or the

00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:26,230
people work on those specific projects

00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:29,710
does not are not familiar with this one

00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:30,260
so convincing then that is basically the

00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:32,810
same

00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:34,880
not enough so we need to have a better

00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:38,240
documentation around power how to do the

00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:40,640
porting how to how to maintain somehow

00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:43,700
your software how to do basic stuff like

00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:45,560
create a virtual machine or using docker

00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:47,480
can I use comp or of course you can use

00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:49,730
dark on power how how I can do that so

00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:51,800
this is this is a frequent questions a

00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:55,310
question that I received I also received

00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:57,200
a question from a guy asking if power

00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:59,360
was operating system instead of

00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:02,750
architecture so basic question that

00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:05,810
should be a better good place it to for

00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:08,360
an answer and this is part of about say

00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:11,090
our work today to get better

00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:14,480
documentation and better information

00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:15,500
around around power so people can access

00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,600
that easily

00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:19,550
and of course we need more defects a

00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:22,010
democracy so we need people to engage

00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:24,140
more developers join conference talk

00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:24,800
about power talk about the possibilities

00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:26,690
on power

00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:31,090
well how they can do that how they can

00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:34,870
use that talk about that power is not

00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:37,780
say it's not different from axis Eric's

00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:40,430
x86 is for if you are using Linux Oh

00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:42,770
barking now let's power little engine so

00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:45,080
it's easier to recompile application if

00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:47,060
you of course if you need to tweak that

00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:50,300
for performance it that's another story

00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:52,550
but that should not be an issue at all

00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:54,410
so we need more advice you need people

00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:56,870
talking about that and we need to

00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:58,790
express the world about power so with

00:27:56,870 --> 00:28:02,750
that so this concludes this presentation

00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:04,610
so thank you everyone so I hope you now

00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:06,650
understand how easy it is to build on

00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:08,030
power if read if you're part of any open

00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:10,010
source community and you want to start

00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:12,680
adopting power you know right the

00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:14,210
resources the resource are you know how

00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:15,650
to build on power using trebs you know

00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:20,350
how to build on power using git lab

00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:20,350
you'll start doing this so thank you

00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:29,130
questions do have questions no questions

00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:40,660
[Music]

00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,820
[Music]

00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:59,380
yeah

00:28:54,820 --> 00:29:03,150
for we have we have another company not

00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:05,710
IBM that puted the package for power and

00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:08,140
especially they built the get lab

00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:11,770
running for power to be installed on ro

00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:13,480
o noble to you supported by the fall so

00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:15,610
you do not need to do anything else and

00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:19,450
yeah there's a big thread on trying to

00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:22,180
get that formerly supported and that so

00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:24,370
stick it too long to evolve all the

00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:26,850
pieces are there we just did sign off

00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:29,800
from the Gaeta lab focus on getting that

00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:32,470
available so yeah another his desk for

00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:34,120
like any other and your depart into

00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:37,180
power so they need support something

00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:39,160
that they are not familiar if so yeah we

00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:42,850
also we just need to try to continue

00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:44,680
trying and talk to them about that until

00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:46,630
they are convinced that okay this is not

00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:51,040
a big deal so led to this and supporting

00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:53,230
put a eating our website but at that

00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:56,550
that's that's the easiest way to get

00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:59,350
power get labs the easiest way so today

00:29:56,550 --> 00:30:01,530
not Travis's disease get life is almost

00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:01,530
there

00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:05,370
more questions

00:30:06,149 --> 00:30:10,549
No okay thank you okay

00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:16,440
[Applause]

00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:24,710
[Music]

00:30:28,009 --> 00:30:35,599
no that's that's how often all the time

00:30:52,039 --> 00:31:00,709
so well we have a bunch of issues resent

00:30:56,129 --> 00:31:03,659
so I'd say rescues want valerio's one

00:31:00,709 --> 00:31:11,999
docker has become an issue for us I

00:31:03,659 --> 00:31:16,169
believe on getting much ark yeah no they

00:31:11,999 --> 00:31:21,029
binary itself so we have much more if

00:31:16,169 --> 00:31:23,359
you look at that landscape for the cloud

00:31:21,029 --> 00:31:23,359
native

00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:30,180
I don't know that's just another skip

00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:45,580
this one but this is this is not color

00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:48,760
code this is what they provided this

00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:50,320
their main webpage like all the

00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:53,500
software's that are part of the cloud

00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:58,240
native foundation somehow and they can

00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:59,890
be incubating or graduated and this is

00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:02,890
not listed back tetra this is just an

00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:07,600
example how quick that kind of cloud

00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:09,730
native software evolves and we cannot

00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:11,500
keep up with that if you do not have

00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:13,960
those community adopting power by

00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:15,580
themselves we cannot we cannot we do not

00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:20,320
have enough arms to do the park all the

00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:22,750
time and this is just to illustrate that

00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:25,060
so this change is not all the time but

00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:26,470
you can you can visit despite this page

00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:28,240
mostly and you see that there is new

00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:30,730
software here and the event with these

00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:33,520
new software will become a new thing and

00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:34,960
this new thing it was born on x86 and

00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:37,150
eventually need to get that new female

00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:39,040
power and then we start to get a new

00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:41,140
female power oh there's our new release

00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:42,970
of this new thing oh this new thing is

00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:45,040
not the older thing and the old thing I

00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:47,740
needed to start work with than other

00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:52,060
ones so it's an endless catch-up

00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:54,910
situation so we need to start with good

00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:57,130
de vacas Eon engage with those community

00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:59,170
so if you're using Travis let's try

00:32:57,130 --> 00:33:01,690
tribes on power you can this a we can

00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:04,180
allow tribes to fail on power if you

00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:08,190
need to turn to to avoid you and your

00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:11,440
boots to happen but let's let's start so

00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:14,530
step-by-step babe steps do one thing of

00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:17,470
a neighbor tribes configure a build test

00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:18,760
case and eventually your software will

00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:21,010
be running on power the same weights

00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:26,080
were not actually six that applied for

00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:27,640
any any order so I see that so you can

00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:30,850
see at UNICAMP who have a bunch of

00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:34,160
repository that we had to build some of

00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:37,230
these applications like container D

00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:39,360
what else what docker dock we have to be

00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:41,549
a doctor and put amazing availab at

00:33:39,360 --> 00:34:19,300
UNICAMP recently because the latest

00:33:41,549 --> 00:34:22,379
version was out there so much more

00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:22,379
[Music]

00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:34,980
[Music]

00:34:40,850 --> 00:35:04,470
the other summer just elated they just

00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:33,170
want acceptance we've got how we change

00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:33,170
forever 21 percent eighty years old

00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,869
[Music]

00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,640
we're not

00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:40,900
[Music]

00:36:54,339 --> 00:37:12,050
we have today we have 100 medium we put

00:36:58,369 --> 00:37:14,329
stars there yeah and then I believe with

00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:18,020
everyone here you get hurt they are not

00:37:14,329 --> 00:37:29,030
using its led that's Travis is the best

00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:41,119
option for them Serco she is more for

00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:43,849
web development at sea yeah but I

00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:46,819
believe this is very focused yeah I

00:37:43,849 --> 00:37:48,589
never use a circle see I I see all the

00:37:46,819 --> 00:37:51,290
way I'm watching on YouTube be video I

00:37:48,589 --> 00:37:53,869
see their propaganda on my face

00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:55,790
but I haven't never used that I'm not

00:37:53,869 --> 00:37:58,760
sure if this fits our needs here with

00:37:55,790 --> 00:38:00,920
this community I don't think so

00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:03,140
Travis is a good option if Drive goes

00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:07,839
away for some reason we still have get

00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:07,839
led but people are on github so

00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:13,660
we need an assessment roughly three

00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:16,480
years ago that's before this Exodus that

00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:19,620
assessment said 42 percent of all

00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,620
profits in the industry

00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:36,210
[Music]

00:38:44,749 --> 00:38:49,459
today Travis is the best place yet to

00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:57,020
[Music]

00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:10,160
[Music]

00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:12,740
yes okay okay see what's over at IBM

00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:15,380
when we started using tribes for ICP we

00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:19,700
didn't miss any release so every release

00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:22,010
of IBM Cod private was launched it at

00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:23,270
the planet date in time and all the

00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:26,240
bills were there on the three

00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:28,070
architectures power Z and x86 so we

00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:30,109
reduced the amount of work by enabling

00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:32,810
power as part of their developer

00:39:30,109 --> 00:39:35,359
workflow they so let's say instead of

00:39:32,810 --> 00:39:37,730
doing acts first then test power they

00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:40,160
were doing developer the they're doing

00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:43,490
testing on power in X at the same time

00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:46,579
so in that time saver that we cannot

00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:48,500
imagine how important is that so so yeah

00:39:46,579 --> 00:39:51,560
that that's that's been Africa so we

00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:53,960
need to spread this that making our

00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:57,470
software mu charge is not hard and save

00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:59,690
times so this is the most important

00:39:57,470 --> 00:40:02,180
resource we have so if we can do one

00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:04,520
things one thing at once and that works

00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:06,800
for everything you need that would be

00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:09,890
the better the beautiful word for

00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:13,490
development let's see it so we are we

00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:18,700
are making progress let's see where is

00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:18,700
the next chapter for us is okay

00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:23,280
