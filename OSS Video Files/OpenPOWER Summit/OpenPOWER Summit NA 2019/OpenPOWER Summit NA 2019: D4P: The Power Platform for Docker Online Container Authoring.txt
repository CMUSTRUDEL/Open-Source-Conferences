Title: OpenPOWER Summit NA 2019: D4P: The Power Platform for Docker Online Container Authoring

Description: 
	Presented by Abdul Dakkak, UIUC

The current POWER container community lags behind that of some other architecture. Part of this is because software developers are unable to publish docker images without access to a Power system. Docker for Power (D4P) is a platform to develop and deploy Power containers within a web browser without access to a local Power system.

The aim of D4P is to enrich the Power container ecosystem by providing both a platform for developers to create docker containers and for Power community to find docker images. Already, we have built and published over 200 docker images that are available in the D4P image catalog. User
contribution is key to extend D4P's catalog.

D4P is available online https://dockerfile-builder.mybluemix.net and slated to be the hub for the Power
community to create, discover, and use docker images.
