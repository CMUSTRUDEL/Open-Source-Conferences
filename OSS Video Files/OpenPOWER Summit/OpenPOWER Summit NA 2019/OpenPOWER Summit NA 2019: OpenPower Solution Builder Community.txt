Description: 
	Presented by John Pace, Mark III & Christopher Sullivan, Oregon State University

The OpenPower Solution Builder Community is for those who design, implement, operate and maintain Power and OpenPower solution stacks. The Group is self-governing and provides a means for builders to share insights and innovation. There are three primary elements 1) questions & answers and pointers to relevant information, 2) best practices on building hardware-software solution stacks and reference architectures, 3) innovations of applications, libraries, methods, and approaches. The initial focus is solution stacks around the IBM POWER9 AC922 integrated GPU Server but will expand to additional systems and workloads. You do not need to be an OpenPower member to participate. This talk will discuss the community formation, topics that are active, and will solicit participation.
