hi so i'm steve fields chief engineer

00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:06,330
for power systems so I lead the

00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:09,240
architecture and design of IBM power

00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:10,650
servers based in Austin Texas most of

00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,210
the time some of you know it's too hot

00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:14,130
for me to live in Texas right now so

00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,719
home base for the summer is Portland

00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:17,970
Oregon this year so starting last year

00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:19,980
actually so I wanted to spend a few

00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:22,680
minutes talking about where we where we

00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:26,449
come as a as an open power group over

00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:29,189
the past six years and we have totally

00:00:26,449 --> 00:00:31,619
transformed a lot of stuff I mean we've

00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:33,480
completely changed how servers get built

00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:36,000
how firmware gets written how

00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,770
applications get developed how servers

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,079
get deployed and managed on our platform

00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:42,149
to the point where you know people can

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,579
build industry standard servers use them

00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:46,320
with industry standard skills it's it's

00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:48,719
an amazing transformation many of you in

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,700
this room have helped with that so thank

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,430
you very much for that and in addition

00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:55,640
you know as as Tim will tell you more

00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:59,370
and we created together the first

00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:01,680
completely open software firmer stack

00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:04,110
for server market it's quite an

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,280
accomplishment and I think it's it's a

00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:06,930
trend we'll see elsewhere in the world

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,180
as people understand the value of what

00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:12,920
we've done together we've shown the

00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:15,330
world the value of the i/o subsystem and

00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:17,939
the performance to be had if you really

00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:19,439
take hardware accelerators and make them

00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:21,020
first-class citizens and your servers

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,729
attaching them with intelligent buses

00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:25,439
and and you're really trying to to

00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:27,270
deliver system value with them as

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,979
opposed to you know what a lot of people

00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:32,220
have done in the past which is provide a

00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:33,659
PCI slot and of course we built the two

00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:38,369
fastest supercomputers in the world

00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:39,780
together so we've come a long way and so

00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:43,409
now I'm going to shift into a little bit

00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:46,500
of where we're headed as as IBM and as

00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:49,649
it relates to open power so some of the

00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:52,110
key focus areas you'll see from us in

00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:54,780
the near future so we're going to keep

00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:58,530
doing more and more on coherent hardware

00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:01,590
acceleration as you'd expect we're

00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:05,670
making a big transformation in the

00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:08,099
memory subsystem so we see AI and

00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:10,950
in-memory workloads driving a large need

00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:12,660
for more capacity memory costs a lot

00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:13,270
even even with the price reductions

00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:16,600
we've all seen

00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:18,850
this year so getting getting the costume

00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:21,520
in line for high-capacity memory is

00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:23,590
important to us we're going to be doing

00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,760
more cores in a socket higher

00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:26,830
performance networking higher

00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:30,070
performance accelerators we need more

00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:33,040
bandwidth and you know using slow

00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:34,660
parallel DDR DRAM interfaces coming off

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,970
of a processor is not a good way to go

00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:39,940
after a lot more bandwidth we have on

00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:41,860
the order of 1,800 pins tied up on our

00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:44,410
power 9 processor today just to do eight

00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:47,170
channels of ddr4 it's hard for us it's

00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:49,060
hard for system designers if we try to

00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:52,000
double that it's it would be a huge

00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:54,010
challenge for all of us so we'll talk

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,410
about how we're gonna change our memory

00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:58,750
subsystem to get more bandwidth without

00:02:56,410 --> 00:03:00,280
incurring that pain and then we're

00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:02,170
living in a world where there are a lot

00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:05,200
of new memory technologies in the oven

00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:08,110
at various memory companies and we want

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,700
to get to the point where of a variety

00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:11,890
of memory technologies are exploitable

00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:13,890
within the server ecosystem and not just

00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:17,140
new ones either I mean it could be

00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:18,880
existing technologies that just haven't

00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:22,959
played in the server world yet so for

00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:24,970
example an LP DDR high bandwidth that

00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,980
low capacity and take the cost of

00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:28,570
bandwidth down significantly so we're

00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:31,390
creating a memory architecture that I'll

00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:34,570
show you in a minute that enables all

00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:36,160
that flexibility and then I won't be

00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:38,740
talking much about this today but we

00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:40,180
also have plans to pretty significantly

00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:42,340
increase the capability of the open

00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:44,700
source firmware stack and corner tot if

00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:49,480
you want to ask more about that

00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:52,930
so this is our processor roadmap I think

00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:55,630
in 32 minutes this will be shown at hot

00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:57,580
chips by by some leaders from our

00:03:55,630 --> 00:04:02,500
processor design team so if anyone asks

00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:04,090
you heard it first so we've we had going

00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:06,430
back to the focus areas of hardware

00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:08,620
acceleration and transforming the memory

00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:10,570
subsystem we had some pretty nice plans

00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:15,550
that we liked a lot in our power 10

00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:16,510
design point but power tens 2021 today

00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:20,890
is 20 19

00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:24,510
we have a new a new CMOS technology to

00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:25,890
bring online for for us for power 10

00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:27,390
if you've been following the news over

00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:29,370
the past year or so you know that we

00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:32,280
have a newfound repart nur that we're

00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:34,170
bringing online to so we wanted to make

00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:36,180
sure we could get that acceleration

00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:39,930
value that memory value into the market

00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:41,490
kind of decoupled from the to bring up

00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:43,830
of the new technology the new foundry

00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:46,560
and the power tank or design so we added

00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:49,560
a third element to the power 9 roadmap

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:52,170
using 40 nanometer CMOS so same course

00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:55,440
caches technology as as the existing

00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:57,570
power 9 processors but making some some

00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:01,080
key transformations in the focus areas

00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:03,000
that I talked about so this is a chart

00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:07,530
that should look very familiar to you

00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,940
it's it's almost all the same as what

00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:11,640
we've shown you for the past few years

00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:13,350
on couple of years on power 9 two key

00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:15,810
differences no three key differences so

00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:17,910
in vlink we'll get to the next

00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:19,860
generation of every link to enable

00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:23,040
ourselves for next generation NVIDIA

00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:26,970
GPUs open capi is going from open capi

00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:29,250
3.0 to open capi 4.0 and that gives the

00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:31,110
attached device the ability to cache

00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:34,110
data from system memory coherently with

00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:35,850
the processors as well as posted rights

00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:37,380
and a few other things and you know the

00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:40,350
guys will go into lots more detail in

00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:43,290
the technical talks I'm sure and then

00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:44,820
omi open memory interface is is the new

00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:47,100
memory subsystem that we've architected

00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:49,290
and I'll show you a little bit about

00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:53,190
that and then I think Pete will be up

00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:55,710
next to show you some more so in in

00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:59,010
power 9 and for a long time we've been

00:05:55,710 --> 00:06:00,870
doing what we call our buffered memory

00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:03,540
subsystems or disaggregated memory

00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:06,240
controllers so the the left side of the

00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:08,520
page at the top is is the power 9

00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,250
scale-up processor where we have an

00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:12,780
external sent to our memory buffer these

00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:16,290
memory buffers are great for giving us

00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:19,200
high capacity high bandwidth in extreme

00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:21,930
resilience of the memory subsystem but

00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:24,270
you know they burn power they cost money

00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:26,760
they eat up board space and so to be

00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:28,530
able to build lower cost lower power

00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,490
denser servers that maybe didn't need

00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:31,500
all the bandwidth than all the

00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:33,870
resilience with power and I and scale

00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:35,760
out in 2017 we introduced the direct

00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:37,220
attached memory subsystem first time in

00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:40,040
many years we've done that

00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:43,490
and like I said it's worked out really

00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:45,140
well for us for for what it does but as

00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:47,360
we try to take that architecture and

00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:49,430
scale the bandwidth up significantly and

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,950
we get major packaging challenges chips

00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:54,350
I challenge is bored wiring challenges

00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:56,930
so where we're going is to a common

00:06:54,350 --> 00:07:00,430
memory subsystem that takes the concept

00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:02,930
of a disaggregated memory controller and

00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:06,410
essentially standardizes it in a way

00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:10,190
that it can become the memory subsystem

00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:14,240
for the whole family of future systems

00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:16,160
so it will be able to do the high

00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,380
capacity high bandwidth highly resilient

00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:21,260
enterprise things that we do and are in

00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:25,070
our high-end and IBM servers it will be

00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:28,370
able to do you know standard commodity

00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:31,460
industry standard servers at good cost

00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:35,480
points and as I hinted before it will

00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:37,610
open the door for us using other memory

00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:40,490
technologies besides DDR DRAM and the

00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:41,840
reason for that is the the intelligence

00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:44,090
of the memory controller moves out of

00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,100
the processor into a memory controller

00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:49,460
that sits on the DIMM on what's called a

00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:51,560
differential dam or a d-10 and so you

00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:54,590
know this allows us to break the mold

00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:56,780
between a processor and a generation of

00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:58,550
DDR memory so the simple example of what

00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:01,070
this will do for us is we'll be able to

00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:03,530
build systems that start with ddr4 when

00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:05,240
ddr5 gets cheap enough to use no

00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:07,250
processor changes no motherboard changes

00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:09,110
required just plug in ddr5 dims instead

00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:11,120
of ddr4 Demps I'm not going to go any

00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:14,030
more into this because I don't want to

00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:16,010
steal pizza under too much but so we end

00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:17,770
up with a chip that looks like this

00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:20,090
there's a lot of detail on this page

00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:22,550
much of it is the same as what you've

00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:23,840
seen before from us on on power 9 so I'm

00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:28,250
not going to go into a lot of detail

00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:30,650
just want to reiterate that it's it's a

00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:32,570
power 9 chip in every way except we're

00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:34,219
increasing the capability of the

00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:35,990
accelerator attached subsystems and

00:08:34,219 --> 00:08:38,030
vlink can open capi and we're

00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:39,830
transforming the memory subsystem and as

00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:43,039
I said all these things lead us into

00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:45,760
power 10 so look forward to more great

00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:50,679
things from us thank you

00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,679
