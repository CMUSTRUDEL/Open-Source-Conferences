	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,470
so good morning everyone Nikolai

00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:07,649
seminoff I'm a product manager at Lladro

00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:10,500
we are Platinum Member dedicated to

00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:13,200
delivering open power-based solutions to

00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,969
enterprise customers we have exhibited

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,850
the Western system many times but today

00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:21,119
we have more products to reveal and I

00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:24,449
think I'm going to share what benefits

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:26,820
and advantages we see in the power

00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:31,619
technology or open power platform for

00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:34,140
our enterprise storage products so the

00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:37,290
foundation was set up to spur innovation

00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:40,440
while engineering power based solutions

00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:42,450
for data intensive workloads but the

00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:46,350
barebone of this ambitious goal has

00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:49,590
always been the ecosystem our ecosystem

00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:51,110
of hardware vendors academia partners

00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:56,059
and s.vs

00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:59,129
creates diverse variety of power

00:00:56,059 --> 00:01:00,420
implementations because it's the

00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:04,470
implementations that bring

00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:06,659
sustainability and growth and the core

00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:08,610
priority of the foundation is to support

00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:14,100
the development of such a sustainable

00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:16,710
ecosystem through sharing technology

00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:19,670
through providing intellectual resources

00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:25,560
enabling workgroup cooperation and

00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:27,360
hosting events and then we expect that

00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:31,020
more power based solutions would emerge

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:34,439
as derivatives of this ecosystem around

00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:37,079
the foundation and at the initial phase

00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:40,070
the foundation gained a lot of success

00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:44,939
onboarding a lot of companies

00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:47,220
institutions and individuals but it's an

00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:54,360
organic moment to grow to the next

00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:58,770
maturity level and will it's time to

00:01:54,360 --> 00:02:01,320
evolve the and that at that evolutionary

00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:05,310
moment it's extremely important to hunt

00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:08,030
and search for the new markets for the

00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:12,739
new workloads to cover for the new

00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:12,739
implementations for the new niches and

00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:22,020
we live in a changing world the data is

00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:24,990
exploding we observe this ongoing data

00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:27,900
explosion from a variety of different

00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:31,170
sources and the volume of it grows

00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:35,520
faster than our capabilities to handle

00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:39,480
it to store to analyze for forming

00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:43,800
valuable insights and high-quality

00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:46,500
decisions and that's why the storage

00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:49,080
market is evolving so fast these days to

00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:53,010
match the challenges that enterprises

00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:55,380
face like rapid digitalization the

00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:58,650
necessity to connect and collect

00:02:55,380 --> 00:03:04,709
everything and expansion of data privacy

00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:08,370
and sovereignty laws we see high demand

00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:13,170
for robust scalable high performance and

00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:15,060
cost efficient storage systems and they

00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:19,830
must be ready for the workloads of this

00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:22,890
new era of data that we live in and as

00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:27,390
data volumes grow from petabytes to

00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:29,790
exabyte and beyond the time it takes to

00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:33,420
bring the data to compute becomes the

00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:36,239
essential bottleneck and so the main

00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:38,070
focus it requires rethinking how the

00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,950
storage and compute systems have been

00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:44,100
designed and the main focus of efforts

00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:46,440
in this area has been on reducing the

00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:48,570
data access latency and improving the

00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:51,780
rate at which the data can be read from

00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:53,730
or written to the storage there have

00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:56,280
been several attempts to solve this

00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:58,769
problem some of them have failed some of

00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:01,820
them are still ongoing but one way or

00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:04,769
another this ongoing transformation

00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:07,560
gives new perspectives for open power

00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:11,459
members to cooperate in the same field

00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:14,250
and this field we want to bring

00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:16,380
everyone's attention to is storage it's

00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:20,489
a huge market it's growing enormously

00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:22,740
and it has vast communities around both

00:04:20,489 --> 00:04:25,289
hardware and software components and

00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:26,780
this great opportunity likewise for the

00:04:25,289 --> 00:04:29,720
foundation and the member

00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:32,760
we are pleased today to share our

00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,560
experience and our success we are

00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:37,350
convinced that open power technology is

00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,810
perfect for storage it delivers

00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:43,230
outstanding performance and great IO

00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:46,139
capabilities including the PCIe Jam for

00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:49,190
in p9 generation and all of these

00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:52,410
features come with an affordable price

00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:54,240
also customers interact with storage

00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:57,740
systems through high level interfaces

00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:00,300
and therefore they primarily care about

00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:02,730
capacity performance and functional

00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:06,320
features some of which are compute

00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:09,180
intensive there is much level much lower

00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:14,340
chip architecture competition in this

00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:16,620
market so perceiving these advantages of

00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:18,930
the technology platform for the storage

00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:21,210
systems we have been able to prove our

00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:23,400
views with real-life scenarios and

00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:26,250
customers by releasing the new

00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:29,729
innovative storage platform called

00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:31,650
tatlin it's based on the open power

00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:34,140
architecture and it has been so

00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:36,990
competitive and so on time for this

00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:41,310
ongoing storage market transformation so

00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:43,200
in the first year of sales it allowed us

00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:45,840
to gain the dominant position on the

00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:50,010
local storage market according to IDC

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:54,289
Enterprise tracker today it has reached

00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:57,150
the 800 petabytes of raw capacity

00:05:54,289 --> 00:05:58,970
installed in storage systems all over

00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:02,039
the country and running in production

00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:05,039
but this is just the beginning because

00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:08,039
we are already very close to reaching

00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:16,530
and breaking through the milestone of

00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:19,380
one exabyte by end of 2019 so leading by

00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:22,440
this example we are encouraging all open

00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:24,770
power members to put their focus towards

00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:30,090
the storage niche to deliver more of

00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:33,360
diverse and competitive power based not

00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:36,360
only compute products and then this can

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,400
be of a mutual interest both for the

00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:41,370
foundation and the members

00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:43,620
- by leveraging resources of the

00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:46,380
foundation we can make the open power

00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:48,270
the default platform of choice for

00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:53,100
storage systems which aligns with the

00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:57,150
strategy of the foundation and also it

00:06:53,100 --> 00:07:00,540
will help with expanding the use cases

00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:02,790
and promoting this ecosystem around the

00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:08,950
open power foundation that we are all

00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:13,860
eager to develop thank you

00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:13,860
