so from left to right with Derek chow we

00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:14,730
have Timothy Pearson Alan Clark Steve

00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:19,770
your last name escapes me

00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:22,699
thanks and on the left is Bobby you guys

00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,699
want to introduce yourselves

00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:27,750
certainly my name is Bobby wynacocha I'm

00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,179
with a company called metronome I also

00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:32,189
run the open

00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:34,610
domain-specific architecture project for

00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:37,950
the Open Compute Project

00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:40,260
my name is tarek Chu I'm Architects in

00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:46,530
Microsoft Azure and a research scientist

00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:51,059
at UT to me the Pearson with CTO Raptor

00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:54,469
computing systems good morning I'm Alan

00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:57,180
Clark I work for Susa who delivers

00:00:54,469 --> 00:00:59,250
Enterprise Linux software on many

00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:02,969
different architectures we built

00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:04,979
software from the edge to the core to

00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:07,350
the cloud and one of the reasons I'm

00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:09,390
here I know I'm new to this audience but

00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:11,939
believe it or not it actually was

00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:15,930
heavily involved with power back in the

00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:17,820
predecessors days and totally enjoyed

00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:22,439
loved these announcements today by the

00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:24,299
way it's awesome my name is Steve a bear

00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:25,950
I'm the co-founder and CEO of Nimbus

00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:27,479
which is a cloud computing company

00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:30,000
focused on high performance and

00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:31,290
accelerated computing space all right

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,079
excellent

00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:36,770
so today is about open source hardware

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:39,840
but I thought it might be interesting to

00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:42,899
talk about open source a little bit sort

00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:47,579
of how did open source start and really

00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:49,680
what how important has open source being

00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:51,930
and and let's start first with software

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,430
and I'm actually very interested in

00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:56,610
hearing from each of you what was kind

00:01:53,430 --> 00:02:03,149
of the the seminal moment the that up

00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:04,920
for you with regard to open software you

00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:07,649
want to start Derek or sure sure okay I

00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:10,410
can start well I think my seminal moment

00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:10,979
when I was a grad student downloading

00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:13,170
Linux

00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:16,200
first time I don't get fit on six three

00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:18,450
and a half inch you know floppy drives I

00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,370
loaded it up and I'm like wow this this

00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:24,060
is really much worse than the son of a

00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:28,459
Solaris AIX that I was using so but it

00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:28,459
very clearly changed very quickly uh-huh

00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:35,580
so for me it was a long time ago

00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:37,530
actually that I I was tasked and we were

00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:41,040
I was with a proprietary company and I

00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:43,170
was tasked with developing an SDK and an

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,299
SDK isn't something that you go out and

00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:47,640
sell and make tons of money on right and

00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:50,190
I looked and I said well it's already

00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:51,930
out there there's stuff available why

00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:54,959
don't we just use that and the company

00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:57,239
had never done open-source prior to that

00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,430
they didn't understand that they didn't

00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:02,010
understand the governance that mr.

00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:03,810
Cunningham talked about right so there

00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:06,239
was a lot of Education there but it was

00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:09,180
that moment for me that once we joined

00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:11,549
and participated I went aha we can move

00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:13,859
fast we can move rapidly you know we can

00:03:11,549 --> 00:03:15,090
innovate we can collaborate I don't have

00:03:13,859 --> 00:03:18,180
to build it all myself

00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:21,299
so I delivered something very quickly to

00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:23,760
the market a solution that was widely

00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:26,970
adopted was his you know de-facto

00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:29,940
standard just everything outweighed my

00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:36,660
doing that all with a team of engineers

00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:38,280
by ourselves for ourselves from my

00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:39,989
perspective I have to go with the the

00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,790
Linux you know the experiencing Linux

00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:43,079
for the first time and actually you know

00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:46,470
observing it with a little bit of

00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:47,910
skepticism you know and I think you know

00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:50,459
one of the talks earlier you know

00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:52,380
talking about some of the the risks and

00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:54,900
rewards associated with it but I think

00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:56,940
that um you know as someone who had a

00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,680
background in electrical engineering and

00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:00,540
then you know seeing it happen in

00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,060
software and now this announcement from

00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:05,340
today is is pretty fascinating for me

00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:08,579
from a hardware perspective but you know

00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:13,049
from again more personally I think I

00:04:08,579 --> 00:04:15,000
can't imagine having you know even as I

00:04:13,049 --> 00:04:17,340
started Nimbus you know it was so much

00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,310
of the beginnings were based on the

00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:22,740
availability of open-source software to

00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:24,360
be able to unleash innovation much more

00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:27,110
quickly and I would venture to say

00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:29,669
that most startups in technology today

00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:32,729
particularly in software are you know

00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:34,409
happen only as a result of you know the

00:04:32,729 --> 00:04:36,990
birth of Linux and the ability to move

00:04:34,409 --> 00:04:38,699
so quickly so for me that's that's been

00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:40,110
the big one and I think you know today

00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:42,150
what's been announced it's gonna be

00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:44,490
really interesting to watch and let's

00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:46,080
you know go 20 years forward and look

00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:51,780
back on this moment is really going to

00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:54,210
be interesting so from my perspective

00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:57,150
and echo the same thing that first

00:04:54,210 --> 00:05:00,689
experience with open-source was probably

00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:02,129
in the early Red Hat days and it really

00:05:00,689 --> 00:05:04,199
left a lot to be desired at that point

00:05:02,129 --> 00:05:06,539
compared to competing solutions but what

00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:09,120
really started to push myself and

00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:13,289
eventually the wraptor companies over to

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:15,629
open-source was that over time that

00:05:13,289 --> 00:05:17,819
ability to actually dig in to change

00:05:15,629 --> 00:05:19,379
things to mold it into what your company

00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:21,300
needs to remove things that you don't

00:05:19,379 --> 00:05:23,189
want in the software that becomes vital

00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:26,159
and then over the years especially in

00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:29,009
the 2000s you know in 2010's here it's

00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:31,379
become even more so where the only way

00:05:29,009 --> 00:05:33,180
you can innovate is by actually having

00:05:31,379 --> 00:05:34,589
that base to build on if you had to do

00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:36,740
everything to novo you're going to run

00:05:34,589 --> 00:05:40,949
into so many problems so much time spent

00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:43,710
and it's just it's it's impractical this

00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:45,870
allows us to build on everyone else's

00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:47,580
work you contribute the work back and

00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:50,159
essentially everyone can find something

00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:52,889
that they're a niche for themselves or

00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:56,699
the companies and you know basically

00:05:52,889 --> 00:06:01,169
offer that many more solutions than

00:05:56,699 --> 00:06:03,419
whatever otherwise be possible my

00:06:01,169 --> 00:06:05,400
personal favorite is Python I'm sorry

00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:11,189
it's Python I'm a pretty incompetent

00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:12,689
developer so I think something that

00:06:11,189 --> 00:06:15,810
makes other people productive more

00:06:12,689 --> 00:06:18,479
easily where they can fly I it's kind of

00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:20,729
underappreciated in my mind so any kind

00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:23,219
of open-source hardware that reduces the

00:06:20,729 --> 00:06:24,719
tax of building in my mind is something

00:06:23,219 --> 00:06:26,009
that's going to be interesting and I

00:06:24,719 --> 00:06:33,089
think today's announcement kind of plays

00:06:26,009 --> 00:06:34,889
into that so and actually since I'm an

00:06:33,089 --> 00:06:36,940
analyst I'll throw a data point out

00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:41,890
there open-source is

00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:47,440
grown to a point that by 2022 we expect

00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:50,140
that 50% of all the AI hardware in the

00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:53,860
world will be running open-source

00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:56,140
software not commercial AI software and

00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:59,590
that I think it says something right

00:06:56,140 --> 00:07:03,340
about what's going on let's switch to

00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:06,120
two open source hardware how important

00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:09,040
is is open source hardware in general

00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:12,550
for the the sort of the ecosystem the

00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:16,300
tech industry as a whole who wants to go

00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:18,720
first ok so so from our perspective what

00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:20,830
we've observed for a long time is that

00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,720
there has been a trend

00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:26,080
obviously for faster and faster chips

00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:28,120
but it's also been kind of consolidated

00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,740
when you really look at things you have

00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,900
a tremendous amount of luck and

00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:34,420
essentially one or two vendors for the

00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:36,850
most parts two vendors and this whole

00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:39,010
idea of whether or not those two vendors

00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:42,250
really have your company's interests

00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:44,350
mined or not for the most part they

00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:45,700
don't care they get the can't care at

00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:47,200
the scale they're at they have to

00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,940
produce a single chip it's gonna work

00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:51,550
across essentially every single market

00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:53,050
segment roughly I mean obviously have

00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:55,630
some variations there's the same basic

00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:58,419
design and really we're at a point here

00:07:55,630 --> 00:08:00,430
where that sort of one-size-fits-all

00:07:58,419 --> 00:08:02,620
mentality is really starting to break

00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:04,120
down you're getting to the point where

00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:06,370
you have various companies that have

00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:08,169
vastly different requirements and even

00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:11,080
in the best case there's almost no way

00:08:08,169 --> 00:08:12,790
that a single core design a single chip

00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:16,690
design is actually gonna fit all those

00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:20,800
requirements so so where we're at is if

00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:22,419
there's a single ice that is only able

00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,130
to be manufactured say by a couple of

00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:26,080
vendors you're at the point where you

00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:27,910
had massive software inertia

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,560
they can't be overcome even if you came

00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:31,390
up with hardware could develop the

00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:33,460
harbor on your own you're not able to

00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:35,589
actually manufacture that you can't fill

00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:37,180
your own knee so for instance the

00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:39,700
announcement today is absolutely vital

00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:42,099
for companies that have requirements

00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:44,500
that the larger vendor simply can't meet

00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:47,470
it removes permanently the whole problem

00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:48,420
of the software inertia locking you in

00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:50,220
to a spur

00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,810
at the core that may not actually from a

00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:53,399
hardware perspective do what you want or

00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:55,889
may do things more importantly that you

00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:58,350
don't want so from this point on we have

00:08:55,889 --> 00:09:00,649
the potential to permanently remove the

00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:03,630
software ownership concerns and to

00:09:00,649 --> 00:09:11,760
essentially allow diversification in

00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:14,130
hardware for the first time so that's

00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,850
great I you're exactly right I'd add two

00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:20,550
things one is support ability and

00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:22,740
reliability right as it was mentioned

00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:25,230
earlier you know black boxes are hard to

00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:28,139
support and one of the reasons a company

00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:30,029
I work for is a full open-source company

00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:32,579
as we want to be able to support our

00:09:30,029 --> 00:09:34,470
customers they want to know what they're

00:09:32,579 --> 00:09:35,940
running right they want to understand

00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:37,440
they want to be able to look at they may

00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:40,410
not want to change it but they want to

00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:45,209
understand what's running in there in

00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:47,850
their environment and so having open

00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:50,360
hardware it just continues that trust

00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:53,459
building with with our customers right

00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:55,440
enables us to support them we're not

00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:57,209
going to change the hardware but we want

00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,449
to work with those that do and make sure

00:09:57,209 --> 00:10:02,910
that we're perfect that our solutions

00:10:00,449 --> 00:10:06,089
and the solutions within the community

00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:08,399
are running in an optimal state right so

00:10:06,089 --> 00:10:10,620
we get that diversification but it also

00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:13,470
opens it up it enables us to support

00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:17,220
that diversification and give those

00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:24,240
customers the reliability that they're

00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:26,040
looking for so I would say a couple

00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,720
things that come to mind you know from

00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:30,930
from my perspective with open hardware

00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:34,980
first I think anton's talk got me really

00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:36,300
excited I want to go after this and to

00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:40,350
the Nimbus cloud spend up an alveolar

00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:41,490
that microwatt PowerPC I remember from

00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:43,050
my days at Altair

00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:45,569
you know when we talked about you know

00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:49,079
getting IP blocks and processors you

00:10:45,569 --> 00:10:51,060
know embedded in you know the FPGA there

00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:52,800
was always a blocker on oh is that IP

00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:55,470
available or you know would the

00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,089
processor fit and there were stuff you

00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:59,130
have to keep sacrificing in order to get

00:10:57,089 --> 00:11:01,350
these types of things embedded and so to

00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:03,270
have you know the first POC you know

00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:04,860
you could it wasn't even trying to

00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:06,750
squeeze it on it literally barely took

00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:08,100
up any space that was fantastic so I'm

00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:10,020
super excited about that and what that

00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:11,700
means and and we want to go back and

00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:13,140
have our guys start and ever all of you

00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:15,150
are invited you know we can you know

00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:17,190
spin up some al vos and start

00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:20,460
downloading some hardware is pretty

00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:23,460
exciting I think the second thing but

00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:24,990
that I that I take away that I it really

00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:27,990
struck me as Ken was talking this

00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:31,380
morning in his announcement is the the

00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:33,690
whole notion of open governance to

00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:36,510
determine you know kind of how the

00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:37,860
hardware is is propagated and I think

00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:39,570
that's a really I hadn't thought about

00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:41,730
it you think is sort of you know more of

00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:43,440
the freewheeling rebel you know Isis

00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:46,230
floating around and people you know

00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,940
hacking on it but the open governance is

00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:49,530
a really important piece for I think

00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:52,560
what what was just said about building

00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:55,200
trust but allowing the ecosystem to

00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:57,720
showcase the the demands you know that

00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,190
of the users for what the hardware needs

00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,750
to do and then you can go off and build

00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:03,780
those sort of the world's best

00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:07,680
processors so very very exciting from

00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:09,360
from my perspective yes I I agree with

00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,090
with everything you guys all said this

00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,430
is super exciting I think that we but

00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:17,070
this is really a very very first step I

00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:18,540
mean I used to be a COPI I uh there was

00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:20,820
a project called ramp for research

00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:22,730
accelerator for multiprocessors what we

00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:25,410
tried to do is we tried to implement

00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:27,660
large-scale multiprocessor systems and

00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:29,250
FPGAs and if I we went to IBM and said

00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:33,120
will you give us the source code for the

00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:36,900
PowerPC 405 and they like no right and

00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:38,310
effectively fundamentally IBM and and

00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:40,260
many other companies IBM was not the

00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:42,150
only one basically saw their you know

00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:44,520
this hardware is their secret sauce but

00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:46,350
as as companies have changed and and are

00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:51,060
really making their money in other ways

00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:53,010
I think kind of providing this this very

00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:56,070
high quality industrial grade hardware

00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:57,840
and RTL and all of the the tooling and

00:12:56,070 --> 00:13:00,750
and other components that are necessary

00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:02,400
well will uplift the entire industry and

00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:04,470
allow us to make much more progress the

00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:07,709
way software is done you know open

00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:09,760
source software is done right

00:13:07,709 --> 00:13:11,850
so the interesting thing about

00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:16,959
open-source software in my mind is that

00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:19,329
two or three people can start and build

00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:20,800
a viable product by reusing a lot of

00:13:19,329 --> 00:13:23,769
open-source software very little labor

00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,300
and somehow open-source hardware has to

00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:28,839
get to that point where you don't need

00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:30,760
this massive investment to make a new

00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:32,260
product from open source hardware so

00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:34,390
somehow the software guys have figured

00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:36,519
out the consumption model for the open

00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:40,839
source product that three people can do

00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:42,370
Instagram on a weekend and that but

00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:45,399
there's still a huge budget when you do

00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:47,290
hardware and so what if you can change

00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:50,500
the consumption model because with open

00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:53,410
source and then iterate on improving the

00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:54,730
product once it takes off that's the and

00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:56,950
I am assuming is going to be different

00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:58,930
from hardware versus software and we've

00:13:56,950 --> 00:14:01,959
seen a lot of new hardware initiatives

00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:05,350
right recently as a yes

00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:06,970
and so do you think that with open

00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:08,829
source hardware it will be easier than

00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:12,790
what these sort of startups have to go

00:14:08,829 --> 00:14:13,570
through well that's the I think one of

00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:15,370
the interesting things is because

00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:17,290
hardware engineers have to look so deep

00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:18,850
into the future they're typically much

00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:20,019
more unwilling to make performance

00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:22,300
compromises and area and power

00:14:20,019 --> 00:14:24,339
compromise so if you're if you don't

00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:25,810
have to make a big bet 18 to 24 months

00:14:24,339 --> 00:14:27,610
into the future but you can iterate on

00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:29,980
your bed very rapidly there be more

00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:32,440
willing to accept compromises so if the

00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:33,940
consumption model is I give you a chip

00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,529
light or I give you a verified hard

00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:37,390
matter on a particular process known or

00:14:35,529 --> 00:14:39,430
something like that it may not be

00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:41,709
optimal for your application but if the

00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:44,740
cost of changing your mind is not too

00:14:41,709 --> 00:14:46,480
huge you'd be willing to accept that I

00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:48,190
think that the big difference between

00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,959
hardware software is the depth to which

00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:57,089
into the future into which you make your

00:14:49,959 --> 00:14:59,260
bets so let's talk a little bit about

00:14:57,089 --> 00:15:02,470
specifically today's announcement and

00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:05,649
and I'm curious how each of you respond

00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:07,959
to it from the from the perspective of

00:15:05,649 --> 00:15:10,890
you know the business that you that you

00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:14,050
around or work at what does it mean for

00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:16,360
for your business for your products for

00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:19,360
what you're trying to do and talk a

00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:20,980
little bit about how you think you know

00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,110
is it does it allow you to diverse

00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:26,949
fight to differentiate does it things

00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:28,779
make things simpler more complex a a

00:15:26,949 --> 00:15:30,430
couple of those things if you could

00:15:28,779 --> 00:15:33,959
address those you want to start see sure

00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:36,940
I think my reaction there's there's

00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:39,570
certainly just taking it all in and

00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:42,130
processing it in and from a cloud

00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:44,889
company perspective who invests in

00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:47,320
skills infrastructure the immediate one

00:15:44,889 --> 00:15:50,139
and when we do both power and x86 and

00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:53,680
one concern I have is a point that Aaron

00:15:50,139 --> 00:15:55,750
made regarding being careful not to go

00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,760
back into silos and sometimes you have

00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:59,949
open source movements that compete with

00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:01,690
other open source movements and and so

00:15:59,949 --> 00:16:05,949
you can see that there you know there's

00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:08,680
risks of the open hardware initiatives

00:16:05,949 --> 00:16:11,680
you know sort of clashing with other you

00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:13,360
know Hardware approaches so I think

00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,339
that's something that you know we're

00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:17,760
gonna have to see how that how things

00:16:15,339 --> 00:16:21,310
start to play out but I think

00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:23,529
philosophically highly energized because

00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:25,209
it is the path forward I think that in

00:16:23,529 --> 00:16:27,970
you know with Moore's law you know

00:16:25,209 --> 00:16:31,300
coming to an end you know innovation in

00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:33,069
silicon as opposed to sort of you know

00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:34,569
running down the path of you know

00:16:33,069 --> 00:16:35,980
shrinking transistors it's now more

00:16:34,569 --> 00:16:38,110
about opening up how do we configure

00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:40,480
those transistors in unique and optimal

00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:42,329
ways to solve our problems efficiently

00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,490
and quickly and so I think from a

00:16:42,329 --> 00:16:47,110
ecosystem standpoint you know that's

00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:49,839
something we are very much you know

00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:52,569
wanting to foster and continue to to

00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:54,850
drive from a business perspective you

00:16:52,569 --> 00:16:56,079
know it's always you know how is this

00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:58,209
how is that all going to start to shake

00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:59,470
out so I think we're gonna you know be

00:16:58,209 --> 00:17:01,300
along for the ride and be a part of that

00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:07,000
ecosystem so we can help you know steer

00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:07,990
it and participate with the ecosystem go

00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,919
down the road okay

00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:13,959
yeah so I I guess from our perspective

00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:17,380
if you need to understand we we support

00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:21,370
a wide range of hardware platforms right

00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:24,669
from from the x86 is to the mainframes

00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:27,970
to the powers to arm to you know you

00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:30,130
name it we're probably there so I'm very

00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:32,370
excited about this one as I mentioned

00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:35,710
before as the supportability

00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:37,300
perspective but to as I also mentioned

00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:40,300
earlier we were supporting and building

00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:42,640
software all the way from the edge to

00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:45,700
the cloud to the core right so all these

00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:48,700
different environments and our customers

00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:51,520
pick the hardware not be well they pick

00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:55,450
the hardware because it solves a problem

00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:57,430
right be it large cash you know

00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:59,830
multi-threading whatever they're they're

00:17:57,430 --> 00:18:01,900
basically looking to solve a problem and

00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:03,670
they're want to do it you know the least

00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:06,340
expensive way and get the most for their

00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:11,020
buck right fastest performance type of

00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:12,970
stuff empower you know the power

00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:15,700
consumption models all those things come

00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:17,680
into play so I'm excited about this

00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:20,170
because I to me it means we're going to

00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:23,320
be able to get a diversity of workloads

00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:25,330
running on on these chipset excuse me

00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:27,250
chipsets and different hardware

00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:31,300
environments different software

00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:33,130
environments and so I'm excited about

00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:37,570
the diversification the potential

00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:39,880
diversification use of of this power in

00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:45,100
different environments and are being

00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:46,990
able to support that so from our

00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:48,430
perspective you know a little bit of

00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:50,380
background about Raptor many of you

00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:54,190
already know we actually selected open

00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:55,870
power several years back largely because

00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:59,050
of our focus on owner control and

00:18:55,870 --> 00:19:00,850
security our philosophy is that the

00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:02,590
owner of the computing hardware should

00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:05,140
always have full control of it should

00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:08,530
only answer to them if they purchase it

00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:10,510
and really what this announcement does

00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:13,480
for us is it allows us to guarantee

00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:16,180
going forward barring some major shift

00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:17,830
in the industry that we will always be

00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:19,480
able to do that even if we have to

00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:21,640
manufacture custom silicon we will

00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:23,650
always be able to offer that and up

00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:26,440
until today that was not always a

00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:28,540
guarantee you know we do what we can but

00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:30,150
this announcement guarantees going

00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:33,160
forward that they'll always be possible

00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:35,050
it also allows us to greatly diversify I

00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:37,210
mean everyone who's used one of our

00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:40,870
existing machines right which are now

00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:43,300
open eyes some machines knows how large

00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:45,380
that that power nine device actually is

00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:48,590
it's it's a server chip

00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:50,510
fits and desktops barely this

00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:52,730
announcement finally opens a door to

00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:55,550
hate maybe power can actually go down

00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:58,160
maybe we can maybe we can replace the

00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:59,270
arm core and our BMC with a Power Core

00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,700
you know things that we've been working

00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:03,620
on for a long time suddenly become

00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:06,920
possible and viable for the first time

00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:08,540
this is this is great now you guys have

00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:10,420
been on this on this journey with

00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:14,240
Oakland power for quite some time right

00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:16,280
so this must be a sort of a seminal

00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,290
moment for you to is wrapped her yes it

00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:20,450
is we've we've really been behind the

00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:22,490
scenes I'm working with the open power

00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:25,520
foundation and and to some extent with

00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:27,830
IBM obviously to try to really kickstart

00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:30,050
this and and try to make this happen and

00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:32,660
it's amazing to have so I have watched

00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:35,000
it actually organically grow well within

00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:37,370
IBM within the foundation and you know

00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,740
finally take root take flight you know

00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:42,320
here today like I said it's it's

00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:46,040
something that we can finally get rid of

00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:48,290
that that lock in for software side and

00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:50,270
we can finally really see the

00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:55,460
diversification on down the hardware

00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:57,860
side I'm gonna sound like a broken

00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:59,720
record but the intriguing thing about

00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:02,150
the open power thing is it's kind of a

00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:03,620
releasing that I say after a whole bunch

00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:05,180
of applications have been baked in and a

00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:07,820
whole ecosystem has been baked in its

00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:08,930
and so the other part lever is the is a

00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:10,750
got release and then you're trying to

00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:14,210
figure out what to do with it and so if

00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:16,640
you can make it easy to consume

00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:18,350
applications not the ISA that you have

00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,890
the applique you have the accelerator

00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:24,440
you have and somebody can come along and

00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:26,450
leverage 80% of the open ecosystem to

00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:29,540
build their unique accelerated really

00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:31,370
quickly so there's an emphasis on

00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:33,920
consuming and developing an application

00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:35,540
as opposed to just the ISA I think that

00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:38,390
would be pretty exciting that's it's a

00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:42,380
pretty unique role available to open bar

00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:46,910
and how you're seeing sort of leverage

00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:48,770
occasion with in Medtronic more the

00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:51,050
potential is in the open domain-specific

00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:52,280
architecture we're trying to the the

00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:54,010
group as a whole is trying to build an

00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:57,370
open interface between chip lifts and

00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:58,960
where you can assemble a

00:21:57,370 --> 00:22:01,870
monolithic guy that he can assemble a

00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:03,430
product as a collection of dye and we

00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:05,110
still have the group has settled on a

00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:06,370
logical interface between chip let's and

00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:08,740
how these chip let's work together a

00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:10,390
single die now something like an

00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:11,470
ecosystem exists where you've got an ISA

00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:13,059
and the consumption model of how

00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:18,100
accelerators interact with the IC

00:22:13,059 --> 00:22:20,380
becomes very interesting so speak from

00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:22,330
an academic wearing my academic hat I

00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:24,760
think this is fantastic I think this

00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:26,410
could really enable a lot of research

00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:29,530
which frankly is kind of stalled because

00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:30,820
we haven't had access to the appropriate

00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:33,550
IAS and actually the good

00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:35,530
implementations of those is a so if IBM

00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:38,290
and other companies continue to to push

00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:40,840
out you know I love your your your your

00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:42,640
little core there but if if we could

00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:44,890
actually look at some of the real

00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:47,020
implementations along with the ecosystem

00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:49,120
and allow you know allow us to modify

00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:51,520
them and if they could run on an FPGA

00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:55,510
this must be fantastic I think it would

00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:59,350
really enable a lot more research but

00:22:55,510 --> 00:23:02,080
what does the impact some sort of

00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:03,670
competition in the industry will will we

00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:06,960
see increased competition because

00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:09,760
because of a phenomenon like this or

00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:12,520
more sort of collaboration and

00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:20,470
competition anybody have any points of

00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:22,179
view on that so from my perspective it's

00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:24,250
really going to depend on where we go

00:23:22,179 --> 00:23:25,480
from here in terms of actually like you

00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:28,330
were seeing with what the hardware

00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:31,690
design what is actually available if we

00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:33,850
can rapidly develop essentially a set of

00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:35,920
course you know definitely in

00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:37,990
collaboration of that you know an IBM

00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:40,120
and other players here there's a

00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:42,040
potential for the power si to actually

00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:45,070
become the DOM and that is a in my

00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:46,510
opinion that being said the competition

00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:48,130
is actually gonna get more fierce from

00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:49,570
here on the hardware side just because

00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:51,130
you have a common eye cell which

00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:52,870
basically allows that software to run on

00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:54,040
any hardware does not mean they're gonna

00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:55,720
have less competition you have more

00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:57,280
you're gonna have hardware vendors that

00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,780
say they're gonna be able to and and

00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:01,210
probably right it's rightfully so

00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:02,170
accelerate certain workloads far beyond

00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:04,390
others you know you can see

00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:07,060
specializations so it's not gonna be

00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:08,950
competition like we know it today where

00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:10,340
you have basically two or three major

00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:13,090
players I'll try to knock each other

00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:15,169
out of the race it's gonna be more of

00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:16,789
for a specific workload you're gonna

00:24:15,169 --> 00:24:17,929
select one vendor for another workload

00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:19,190
you might select another vendor for

00:24:17,929 --> 00:24:21,260
general-purpose computing might select

00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:22,429
even yet another vendor that sort of

00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:24,799
thing and we're already seeing this

00:24:22,429 --> 00:24:26,630
occur with accelerators right the only

00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:28,429
the only vendor that is really saying

00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:30,950
hey you can do all your own workloads as

00:24:28,429 --> 00:24:32,450
it will be the FPGA vendors everyone

00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:34,309
else is saying hey our accelerator can

00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:35,960
do this workload arcs r2 can do that

00:24:34,309 --> 00:24:38,270
workload and you select whichever one

00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:41,890
you need fundamentally I think we're

00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:44,299
gonna see the same thing for CPUs yeah

00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:50,630
anyone else have any point of view on

00:24:44,299 --> 00:24:52,190
that huh Steve yeah III think that you

00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:54,380
know arm is an obvious one that's gonna

00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:56,419
be interesting because it's based on you

00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:58,190
know royalties and IP licensing of their

00:24:56,419 --> 00:25:00,890
course so I think you know it's gonna be

00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:02,960
disruptive from from a processor

00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:06,039
standpoint I'm it'll be interesting to

00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:09,049
see what happens on the x86 side

00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:11,899
longer-term you know as as this you know

00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:14,210
continues to gain momentum and I think

00:25:11,899 --> 00:25:17,360
though what's interesting is having even

00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:19,190
the move of Hardware being opened what

00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:22,399
that will do with the software developer

00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:24,710
ecosystem knowing that there's an open

00:25:22,399 --> 00:25:26,600
hardware and that it could have a

00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:28,669
stronger gravitational pulled and we

00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:31,220
might predict and I think that's going

00:25:28,669 --> 00:25:35,210
to be interesting to observe over time

00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:38,090
as well my hope is this will encourage

00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:41,029
other companies to open I you know it's

00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:43,070
it may be hard for arm and Intel to do

00:25:41,029 --> 00:25:44,480
that because they have this these

00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:46,490
they're dominant positions in the

00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,230
marketplace but you know if if there's

00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:51,289
momentum behind this which I think

00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:53,929
really requires releasing more and more

00:25:51,289 --> 00:25:55,399
into the open into the open platform and

00:25:53,929 --> 00:25:57,710
this really has to probably be driven by

00:25:55,399 --> 00:25:59,120
IBM that you know at some point yeah

00:25:57,710 --> 00:26:01,130
there may be so this tipping where

00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:03,260
people like well I'll just use this it's

00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:05,210
good enough then you know I can I can

00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:05,600
modify it the way I wanted to the way I

00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:13,039
want to

00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:15,140
so somebody brought up this question

00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:16,789
about security how do I know that you

00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:18,620
know if I buy a third party chip later

00:26:16,789 --> 00:26:21,470
it's not a malicious chip Latour it's

00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:23,000
somehow impact me in some fashion and if

00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:24,500
you're building a CPU chip but you might

00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,789
come to the point where somebody says it

00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,049
has to be an open eye I say so that I

00:26:25,789 --> 00:26:30,169
know what's baked and I know what the

00:26:27,049 --> 00:26:31,610
expected behaviors or an open

00:26:30,169 --> 00:26:34,039
implementation so I have some full

00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:37,580
insight into what it's supposed to do

00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:41,630
and so the one interesting sort of leg

00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:43,309
up seems to be that open implementations

00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:45,679
and open eye and says may actually be

00:26:43,309 --> 00:26:47,690
preferred just like Linux seems to be

00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:49,340
the sort of OS of choice for hardening

00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:51,789
systems yeah that you might have a

00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:55,370
similar advantage in the hardware world

00:26:51,789 --> 00:26:56,690
a few other just streaming thoughts here

00:26:55,370 --> 00:27:00,440
on that and Derek may have some

00:26:56,690 --> 00:27:02,690
perspective with you know Microsoft but

00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:04,130
that what the hyper scalars choose to do

00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:06,110
with this will be interesting and not

00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:08,210
just you know the u.s. hyper scalars you

00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:12,830
know knowing that there's already work

00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:16,940
going on to create their own silicon to

00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:19,399
be able to unlock from sort of the the

00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:23,809
traditional vendors you know potentially

00:27:19,399 --> 00:27:25,610
completely is is interesting to see what

00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:28,309
dynamics that creates in the market I

00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:30,320
think also from you know you know the

00:27:28,309 --> 00:27:33,799
system OEMs that again have followed

00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:35,690
this cycle for decades you know of sort

00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:38,179
of the way technology hardware is

00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:41,360
released developed and so forth so I

00:27:38,179 --> 00:27:44,630
think that again this is feels very

00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:46,220
disruptive and I think the the the

00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:48,110
reactions that people experience are

00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:50,780
gonna be everything from you know

00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:53,120
dismissive like no big deal

00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:54,919
business as usual but then you know

00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,480
allowing that small community to keep

00:27:54,919 --> 00:27:58,549
you know driving something that

00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:01,130
potentially gets you know quite large

00:27:58,549 --> 00:28:03,320
but but I think that the the hyper

00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:06,380
scalar reaction to it again and you

00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:09,080
already seen that tug with epic you know

00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:12,110
an AMD making inroads arm you know

00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:14,750
having some footprint inside of AWS

00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:19,220
you know and so this this could be a

00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:21,529
game changer from that perspective so so

00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:24,980
so Aaron was earlier saying you know

00:28:21,529 --> 00:28:28,570
historic day dude do you do you guys

00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:31,599
agree today

00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:33,969
I definitely think it is like I said I

00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:37,509
was involved with the predecessor to

00:28:33,969 --> 00:28:39,099
this organization and and I'm excited

00:28:37,509 --> 00:28:42,309
about this because we're addressing the

00:28:39,099 --> 00:28:44,529
things that that just wasn't the right

00:28:42,309 --> 00:28:46,299
time for them to happen back then but

00:28:44,529 --> 00:28:49,299
they were also barriers and so I'm

00:28:46,299 --> 00:28:50,589
seeing those barriers fall and that's

00:28:49,299 --> 00:28:52,779
why I'm excited about today's

00:28:50,589 --> 00:28:54,820
announcements is because I think it's

00:28:52,779 --> 00:29:02,769
going to definitely accelerate this

00:28:54,820 --> 00:29:05,769
environment anyone else I think we could

00:29:02,769 --> 00:29:08,079
probably allow some questions at this

00:29:05,769 --> 00:29:11,919
point from the audience if there is any

00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:13,599
interesting an interest in posing a

00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:17,079
question I'm not sure if their

00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:19,089
microphones going around we could use in

00:29:17,079 --> 00:29:21,779
our room is probably small enough I

00:29:19,089 --> 00:29:21,779
guess we have some microphones

00:29:21,869 --> 00:29:30,539
anyone have a question for any of the

00:29:27,339 --> 00:29:30,539
panelists over there

00:29:45,749 --> 00:29:50,979
well Asher at this point why don't know

00:29:48,759 --> 00:29:52,719
if we've tipped over to 50% Linux or not

00:29:50,979 --> 00:29:55,719
but we're very if we have it it's very

00:29:52,719 --> 00:29:57,789
close and so we're already seeing this

00:29:55,719 --> 00:30:01,960
is you know this is the way the world's

00:29:57,789 --> 00:30:04,509
going I and it turns out I mean

00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:06,070
Microsoft is block github we probably

00:30:04,509 --> 00:30:08,739
check in more into Linux then than

00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:10,509
anyone else I mean at least from you

00:30:08,739 --> 00:30:12,639
know what Microsoft is doing we're very

00:30:10,509 --> 00:30:15,460
we're very supportive of the open source

00:30:12,639 --> 00:30:17,080
and we think that's the word that at

00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:20,609
least in my opinion of what Microsoft

00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:20,609
sees that's where things are going

00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:05,359
[Music]

00:31:06,389 --> 00:31:14,799
I know academics who basically arm when

00:31:12,639 --> 00:31:17,739
and very politely said stop working on

00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:19,869
building an arm I say RTL or simulator

00:31:17,739 --> 00:31:22,710
or whatever this is something which has

00:31:19,869 --> 00:31:25,719
been you know I think has really kind of

00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:27,700
stopped or slowed down research and that

00:31:25,719 --> 00:31:29,200
that should be done I think the the fact

00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:31,089
that you know this is open from a legal

00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,159
perspective is is critically important I

00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:34,479
think is is going to be a standard it's

00:31:33,159 --> 00:31:37,379
going to be something that I think other

00:31:34,479 --> 00:31:37,379
people should be following

00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:43,330
yourself sir canoes idea was not in

00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:46,150
decorating when they said they were in

00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:49,690
the forefront of only open the invention

00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:57,900
network was several discrete was fully

00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:57,900
created within the corporation effective

00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:07,990
Thanks

00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:10,030
one of the big things hardware companies

00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:12,490
are sort of open-source software seems

00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:15,820
to have settled on a free model in terms

00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:18,490
and the big open question is given the

00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:20,260
big investment in developing and

00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:22,660
implementing and validating hardware

00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:24,430
with a freeze the viable model or

00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:27,100
there's there has to be some other

00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:30,340
licensing model which still enables fast

00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:31,750
consumption but and that seems you have

00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:34,030
huge difference between hardware and

00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:37,600
software that universally hardware

00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:40,000
companies are not comfortable with free

00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:43,060
licensing as you know we've put in a lot

00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:46,090
of person years worth of labor into this

00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:49,150
into validating analog circuit or a new

00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:53,020
process node or debugging and

00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:56,530
verification and free is a loaded word

00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:57,850
so that's that's a big then that's I

00:32:56,530 --> 00:33:00,040
don't know how it gets resolved but

00:32:57,850 --> 00:33:04,870
that's a big issue really that keeps

00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:07,150
hitting us in our project but software

00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:10,810
developers have to do all that to right

00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:12,790
now so it's I know that hardware has its

00:33:10,810 --> 00:33:14,020
own set of challenges but yeah if you

00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:16,060
look at how much work the software

00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:19,390
developers do to develop and verify and

00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:22,600
deploy and all that people can change

00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:25,150
their minds and the hardware cycle is so

00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:27,130
extended that the penalty is severe and

00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:33,850
that I don't know what the answer to

00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:35,530
that is fundamentally I'm not sure which

00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:37,720
we're opening the ice I was really gonna

00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:39,040
open those kind of challenges I mean

00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:41,440
you're you're gonna have people

00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:44,170
collaborating I would expect largely on

00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:46,270
FPGA type of limitations only those that

00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:47,740
actually pass it's still going to come

00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:48,970
down to business concerns only those

00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:50,660
that you can demonstrate to the

00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:52,760
appropriate business leaders

00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:53,930
you know the people in that space are

00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:55,520
actually gonna make their way to real

00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:57,380
silicon at least in the commercial

00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:58,910
sphere academic sphere may be a little

00:33:57,380 --> 00:34:01,970
bit different but fundamentally we do

00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:04,550
have a prototyping tool you could think

00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:05,600
of it may be more in the early days of I

00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:08,210
don't know a mini computer revolution

00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:10,070
that sort of thing where yes you needed

00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:11,510
for a large project actually commit

00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:13,520
serious resources you needed to have

00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:15,560
time and friends as a mainframe or a

00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:18,560
large machine yes you could do your

00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:20,210
initial work on a much much smaller much

00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:22,310
more limited box but if you were

00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:24,770
actually gonna commit and go forward the

00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:26,570
project you went up you paid the money

00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:29,510
for the resources for to actually create

00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:30,860
the product and I guess for silicon I

00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:32,720
guess how is that a whole lot different

00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:34,940
we at this point in time we have a ton

00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:38,450
of old process nodes we have a ton of

00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:40,429
information what we currently lack and

00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:44,389
this was brought up before is the actual

00:34:40,429 --> 00:34:47,179
open tooling to take something from HDL

00:34:44,389 --> 00:34:49,790
or even RTL and actually convert it into

00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:52,340
anything that can be made at any of

00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:53,870
those fans and that's something is gonna

00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:55,159
need to see serious work before we can

00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:57,380
even think about the commercial

00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:59,240
considerations of really open silicon

00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:01,220
this is a first step this allows

00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:03,380
companies that have the resources and

00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:05,300
want to commit to design create

00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:07,340
manufacture their own silicon that does

00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:08,870
not solve those underlying problems yet

00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:11,150
and that's where the community as a

00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:12,380
whole I think still needs to say and

00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:13,340
this one's actually we're gonna need

00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:15,080
boundaries

00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:18,380
surely to kind of commit to this whole

00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:20,180
concept is that that how do I put it the

00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:22,880
older process know what information is

00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:24,890
not proprietary or that it can be

00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:27,830
brought in in the standard interchange

00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:29,720
format and open tooling where we can

00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:31,670
actually do the design work I should do

00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:33,560
the validation or do the simulation work

00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:35,240
and prove that something's gonna work

00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:41,330
before you actually commit to

00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:44,960
manufacturer I just said that sounds

00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:48,710
like a lot of fun actually it does I it

00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:52,870
just makes you want to get in there any

00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:52,870
other questions up there

00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:13,810
Cristobal question who wants to take it

00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:17,950
I think that's carrot isn't it Wow it's

00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:20,650
nice to see you dude so I to me it's a

00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:23,410
it's part of a trend right so you and I

00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:27,220
have been in this business for a long

00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:31,510
time and you know we talked about the

00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:33,550
early days of Linux and and the years it

00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:36,400
took for acceptance of Linux into the

00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:40,060
enterprise right and then all these

00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:42,100
other projects I think it was Ken that

00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:44,170
showed the slide of IBM's contributions

00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:46,780
to the different projects over the years

00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:50,230
but what you're seeing is the speed of

00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:52,390
adoption right it didn't take the 25

00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:54,490
years for lineage it did for well it

00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:56,470
didn't take Linux 25 years but we can

00:36:54,490 --> 00:37:00,820
argue when it tipped the scales into the

00:36:56,470 --> 00:37:03,730
enterprise right with but you can see

00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:06,040
the impact and and the impact is my

00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:09,400
point is it takes much less time

00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:13,510
nowadays for that impact to be real and

00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:16,420
to be adopted by not just fringe and not

00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:18,370
just early adopters but to be hardcore

00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:19,930
enterprises right you can't fly in an

00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:22,600
airplane today without it being run on

00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:25,990
Linux you can't you know those planes

00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:28,300
are directed in the skies by Linux your

00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:32,080
phones everything we do is is it is

00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:34,660
touched by open source and the speed of

00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:38,920
adoption is is totally accelerated so

00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:41,080
five years from now it's I think we're

00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:44,170
gonna be blown away simply because the

00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:48,700
adoption curve is so fast nowadays and

00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:51,940
it's not just open source my point is is

00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:53,470
the adoption of collaboration through

00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:57,310
open environments through open

00:37:53,470 --> 00:38:01,600
governances and so forth is changing our

00:37:57,310 --> 00:38:03,550
world right so like I said a minute ago

00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:04,810
it's going to be fun to dabble in the in

00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:06,880
the silicon

00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:08,530
and I think it's going to happen I think

00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:12,880
we're gonna be surprised of what's gonna

00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:14,500
happen in the next five years so I'll go

00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,880
a step further and maybe this isn't

00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:18,220
quite a five-year vision might be a

00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:21,310
little further out but I was thinking

00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:23,859
about it as we were talking about you

00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:25,480
know the RTL for for these you know the

00:38:23,859 --> 00:38:27,970
instruction set architecture that

00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:29,770
becomes data available when you bring

00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:33,609
that into the ecosystem in the number of

00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:35,440
people the number of implementations or

00:38:33,609 --> 00:38:38,560
you know the ability to scale that

00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:42,390
horizontally becomes data so then you

00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:45,250
imagine that being used with you know

00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:46,900
deep learning you know an AI and you

00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:48,790
start to think about what can happen now

00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:53,050
when we take the machines themselves and

00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:55,540
allow machines to take that you know now

00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:56,859
that it's open it's all data that can be

00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:58,660
used and fed into these neural networks

00:38:56,859 --> 00:39:00,069
and allow machines to actually design

00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:09,400
themselves which i think is really

00:39:00,069 --> 00:39:11,020
interesting I think there's a theme one

00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:13,540
interesting thing is now you can do a

00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:15,160
new many core architecture you're kind

00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:17,640
of like limited if you're going many

00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:19,990
core right now it see there are more

00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:21,609
risk five this this is a really

00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:24,819
interesting thing where you can see 128

00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:27,700
256 the micro board is some cousin of

00:39:24,819 --> 00:39:30,310
the micro board because then you know

00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:32,140
academic innovation in interconnect

00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:33,460
between many core so what I'm thinking

00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:36,280
is in five years there'll be at least

00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:37,720
one or two many core PowerPC

00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:39,790
architectures that might actually be

00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:45,520
specifically interesting to our company

00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:53,680
and as a use case so I think there's a

00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:55,119
new so I'd say that it's kind of hard to

00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:57,339
look that far in the future in some ways

00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:58,810
but you know one of the first things

00:39:57,339 --> 00:40:00,130
that this is gonna do the most obvious

00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:01,690
low-hanging fruit is it's going to

00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:04,180
enable the ability for people to

00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:06,220
actually trust their computers again if

00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:08,410
you if you purchase an open iso chip the

00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:10,839
first step obviously at least where we

00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:12,010
are right now is that you can go down to

00:40:10,839 --> 00:40:13,510
the firm where you can go down to the

00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:14,920
iso you can verify everything you can

00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:17,410
know what's actually happening with that

00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:18,400
device I think that over the years and

00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:20,289
there's where I say I'm a little

00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,849
wrong timing because I know as from a

00:40:20,289 --> 00:40:24,880
hardware background how long this can

00:40:21,849 --> 00:40:26,200
actually take but over time what we'll

00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:28,240
see is that it'll be able to peer

00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:29,859
further and further down into that stack

00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:31,660
and you'll be able to know more and more

00:40:29,859 --> 00:40:34,119
that what you have in front of you is

00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:35,500
actually doing what it's supposed to do

00:40:34,119 --> 00:40:37,569
is not working against your interest is

00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:39,160
not going behind your back so to a

00:40:37,569 --> 00:40:41,289
certain extent in an era where people

00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:42,760
are giving up Google they are steel

00:40:41,289 --> 00:40:44,380
leaving their cell phones outside

00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:46,210
somewhere or whatever when they're doing

00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:47,589
sensitive infrared sensitive work when

00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:49,119
you literally go into a company it says

00:40:47,589 --> 00:40:50,529
no cellphones no you know they're

00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:52,690
literally technologies are being banned

00:40:50,529 --> 00:40:53,770
because of security concerns all of a

00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:55,240
sudden we can actually see the

00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:57,190
technology go back into those

00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:59,230
environments and actually assist rather

00:40:57,190 --> 00:41:01,059
than have to be issued based on these on

00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:05,109
these concerns so it's that's a really

00:41:01,059 --> 00:41:07,089
big really big deal there fundamentally

00:41:05,109 --> 00:41:08,710
though going forward - I suspect what

00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:10,510
we're gonna see is some degree of

00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:12,730
consolidation in the software space

00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:15,849
right now I mean just right off the bat

00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:18,700
right now even an even in the commercial

00:41:15,849 --> 00:41:21,880
software space we see vendors having to

00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:23,470
support x86 arm power even to some

00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:26,410
extent risk five this place really

00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:28,240
coming up - and bluntly from from a

00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:30,130
software a QA perspective what we're

00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:32,380
seeing right now is that that's a bad

00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:33,700
experience overall each one of those

00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:35,710
software packages

00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:37,539
he has a dominant architecture the

00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:39,539
developers are using and that for the

00:41:37,539 --> 00:41:41,260
most part with the exception

00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:43,359
unfortunately rare exception of some

00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:45,520
software houses they take QA seriously

00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:46,930
means that the development architecture

00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:50,140
is the only one that the software is

00:41:46,930 --> 00:41:52,349
properly functional on I realized that

00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:54,789
with open-source thankfully there's more

00:41:52,349 --> 00:41:57,039
community QA that goes into it so that's

00:41:54,789 --> 00:42:00,279
been largely smoothed over but

00:41:57,039 --> 00:42:02,289
especially for those vendors that are

00:42:00,279 --> 00:42:05,109
still using at least proprietary license

00:42:02,289 --> 00:42:07,869
or you know sort of an open-source but

00:42:05,109 --> 00:42:09,309
don't touch model ELISA there's a

00:42:07,869 --> 00:42:12,160
significant concerns instead of a

00:42:09,309 --> 00:42:13,589
drannit QA so as you go in the future I

00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:16,420
would expect that there'd be some

00:42:13,589 --> 00:42:17,740
consolidation assuming that things are

00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:20,020
executed correctly that we don't have

00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:21,700
with every vendor having a problem kind

00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:23,890
of situation that there'd be some

00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:27,490
consolidation running around an ice ax

00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:29,980
or a couple of ices so as to avoid that

00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:31,089
whole software issue and then from that

00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:33,430
point on like

00:42:31,089 --> 00:42:36,489
I do see hardware diversification

00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:39,369
literally accelerators and steroids the

00:42:36,489 --> 00:42:42,039
ability for the CPU itself to be swapped

00:42:39,369 --> 00:42:43,359
out or to be modified or purchase

00:42:42,039 --> 00:42:46,210
whatever to meet a specific application

00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:51,729
so very much a heterogeneous computing

00:42:46,210 --> 00:42:53,559
some future I would think yeah so for me

00:42:51,729 --> 00:42:55,479
I'm hoping that it's gonna be longer

00:42:53,559 --> 00:42:57,609
than five years but I'm hoping that the

00:42:55,479 --> 00:43:00,460
open source you know kind of hardware

00:42:57,609 --> 00:43:02,079
welcome will look very similar to open

00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:04,900
source software that we're gonna have

00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:06,999
technologies that allow us to prototype

00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:09,249
develop to play and actually build real

00:43:06,999 --> 00:43:12,069
chips that that allow me I can do it in

00:43:09,249 --> 00:43:14,049
three months for $10,000 instead of you

00:43:12,069 --> 00:43:16,509
know what it takes you all know very

00:43:14,049 --> 00:43:18,219
well what it takes today and if that

00:43:16,509 --> 00:43:19,749
happens along with a you know the

00:43:18,219 --> 00:43:20,979
continued advancements in open source

00:43:19,749 --> 00:43:23,859
software we can actually start thinking

00:43:20,979 --> 00:43:27,269
about really open systems which I think

00:43:23,859 --> 00:43:27,269
are when you multiply the two together

00:44:10,090 --> 00:44:13,990
I guess from our perspective that's

00:44:12,370 --> 00:44:16,060
that's part of the announcement that I'm

00:44:13,990 --> 00:44:17,980
excited about because as we've talked

00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:20,590
about it builds that trust all the way

00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:21,880
down right the different layers but one

00:44:20,590 --> 00:44:24,280
of the things our customers are looking

00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:25,900
for is consistency across all the

00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:27,370
different as I mentioned we run on all

00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:31,180
these different architectures and

00:44:27,370 --> 00:44:33,580
platforms and devices and so forth right

00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:38,950
and but our customers are expecting

00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:41,350
expecting consistency and the excitement

00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:43,870
I have on this is our ability to help

00:44:41,350 --> 00:44:47,410
them achieve that consistency right the

00:44:43,870 --> 00:44:49,240
consistent feel look use reliability

00:44:47,410 --> 00:44:52,420
sustainability all the abilities that

00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:54,970
you can name but the key word there is

00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:58,060
is consistency it's going to enable us

00:44:54,970 --> 00:45:01,360
to bring and help them maintain that

00:44:58,060 --> 00:45:05,370
consistency across all their deployments

00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:05,370
whatever architecture those will be I

00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:10,300
mean to me the interconnects more

00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:11,860
important than the is a much more right

00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:14,320
because for exactly the same reason I

00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:17,440
now I can put plug or wrist five with a

00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:19,330
you know AMD with a Intel processor an

00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:21,550
ARM processor all in the same system and

00:45:19,330 --> 00:45:27,670
have them all use the same interconnect

00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:29,860
that's fantastic anything the

00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:33,400
interconnect has a potential to help

00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:35,650
disaggregate inside a package and maybe

00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:36,820
make new commodity chip less like a

00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:39,040
memory chip that is an obvious thing

00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:40,830
that that could potentially be possible

00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:45,100
because of it is aggregated interconnect

00:45:40,830 --> 00:45:48,610
so that the the ability to sort of build

00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:51,490
heterogeneous systems will be driven by

00:45:48,610 --> 00:45:52,900
the interconnected memory deviate a

00:45:51,490 --> 00:45:54,580
little and I'd say here that the

00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:56,350
interconnect will important it's a

00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:57,760
package we can't have all of the other

00:45:56,350 --> 00:46:00,340
you mentioned for instance integrating

00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:02,470
AMD chips but the simple fact is without

00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:04,360
you having access to AMD's technology

00:46:02,470 --> 00:46:10,840
there is no interconnect there is no

00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:13,750
connection again the hope will be that

00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:15,280
as people say hey you know this is a

00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:16,810
great interconnect I'll start developing

00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:19,570
for it other people like well I'll adapt

00:46:16,810 --> 00:46:21,430
to it and then yeah hopefully it'll move

00:46:19,570 --> 00:46:24,680
in the right direction

00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:27,100
one can always hope but I would just

00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:29,840
kind of mention in the industry you know

00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:31,460
look look for ages at AMD's

00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:33,170
hypertransport versus i think is intel

00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:34,340
quickpath they do the same thing they

00:46:33,170 --> 00:46:35,870
don't talk to each other and you know

00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:38,270
despite all the advantages of being able

00:46:35,870 --> 00:46:39,770
to do that it hasn't happened so I think

00:46:38,270 --> 00:46:42,380
there's some sea change it would have to

00:46:39,770 --> 00:46:44,810
occur at those those companies to make

00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:47,420
it happen but you know the open ice is a

00:46:44,810 --> 00:46:49,520
good step in that direction so so we

00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:50,870
have one minute left so let's do one

00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:53,230
more question and then very quick

00:46:50,870 --> 00:46:53,230
answers

00:47:00,670 --> 00:47:03,760
[Music]

00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:45,470
what was going first

00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:46,880
alright Derek you want to go first so

00:47:45,470 --> 00:47:48,710
for me it's it's the ability to

00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:50,750
interject connect the components right

00:47:48,710 --> 00:47:53,030
so what winds up happening is as anyone

00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:54,980
who's done RTL development knows that we

00:47:53,030 --> 00:47:57,110
tend to optimize our interfaces too

00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:59,240
heavily so that if I try to put plug one

00:47:57,110 --> 00:48:00,920
block into another block that haven't

00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:02,900
been designed together it's probably not

00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:05,000
gonna happen so having an abstraction

00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:07,130
that allows me to you know effectively

00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,660
do function calls like we do I mean

00:48:07,130 --> 00:48:10,490
there's a standard C function call it

00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:13,100
doesn't matter which compiler produced

00:48:10,490 --> 00:48:15,680
the the the the executable the object

00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:17,570
file I can go and call across the you

00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:20,210
know the two between two different I can

00:48:17,570 --> 00:48:21,830
one one piece of C code can call a

00:48:20,210 --> 00:48:23,840
function that was developed potentially

00:48:21,830 --> 00:48:27,380
by another compiler until we get to the

00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:28,970
point where we what we can go and snap

00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:30,080
things together very quickly I think

00:48:28,970 --> 00:48:31,040
we're gonna have a hard time because

00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:33,500
people are gonna be spending all the

00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:37,280
time writing gaskets between the various

00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:38,660
components build on that some and I

00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:39,740
would say that I think one of the key

00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:41,150
things we're gonna need in the

00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:45,320
relatively short term is we're gonna

00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:47,480
need open FPGA tooling or obviously a

00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:49,550
six hard silicon there's a lot of

00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:51,710
challenges there that's not a short term

00:48:49,550 --> 00:48:53,840
as a medium to long term issue but in

00:48:51,710 --> 00:48:56,240
the interim we need to be able to be

00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:58,430
able to develop that technology and for

00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:59,900
the most part that's gonna require the

00:48:58,430 --> 00:49:03,260
community to come in here and actually

00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:05,030
collaborate on and basically add that

00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:06,650
new functionality the tooling and that's

00:49:05,030 --> 00:49:09,200
something we can't do if we don't have

00:49:06,650 --> 00:49:11,030
open tooling available to target these

00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:12,980
FPGAs now there are a few projects that

00:49:11,030 --> 00:49:13,820
are for instance available now but you

00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:17,330
know I'll just bring up an interesting

00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:20,060
issue the for instance of micro watt

00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:21,680
core this VHDL those projects makes up

00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:23,480
verilock so there's just this

00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:24,830
interoperability concerns all up and

00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:27,280
down the stack even starting at this

00:49:24,830 --> 00:49:29,840
relatively high level of software

00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:32,030
alright we're out of time and I think

00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:35,780
you know what was earlier said you know

00:49:32,030 --> 00:49:37,339
we were 1% there as a lot of work still

00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:40,619
to be done but it's

00:49:37,339 --> 00:49:43,319
exciting moment for the for the industry

00:49:40,619 --> 00:49:45,390
thank you gentlemen for your your

00:49:43,319 --> 00:49:48,630
comments your insights and thank you

00:49:45,390 --> 00:49:49,349
audience for your your questions great

00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:51,110
discussion

00:49:49,349 --> 00:49:54,789
thanks very much

00:49:51,110 --> 00:49:54,789
