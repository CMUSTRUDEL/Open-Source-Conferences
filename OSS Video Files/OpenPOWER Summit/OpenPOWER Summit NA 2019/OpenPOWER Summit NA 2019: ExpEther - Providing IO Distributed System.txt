	Presented by Gursimranjit Singh, NEC Corporation of America

ExpEther technology virtualizes PCI Express over Ethernet. Using ExpEther, one can configure a computing system with scale-up headroom by plugging arbitrary PCI Express-based I/O devices distributed on an Ethernet LAN. ExpEther enhances the PCI Express bus by extending connection distances, supporting device numbers beyond the limitation of local PCI port counts as well as alleviating localized electrical power and heat dissipation restrictions that a conventional box-type computer would encounter. In addition, with full support of the PCI Hot-Plug protocol, dynamic reconfiguration of the computing platform is also possible.
