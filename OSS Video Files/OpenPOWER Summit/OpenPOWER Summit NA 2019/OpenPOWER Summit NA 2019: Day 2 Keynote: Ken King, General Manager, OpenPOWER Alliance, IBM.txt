thank you and good morning

00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,099
there Hughes comments kind of cracked me

00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:10,200
up a little bit about Christmas and

00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:11,910
opening presents you know feels a little

00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,080
bit like Kris Kringle here on stage even

00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:14,280
though my team probably chuckles

00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,490
whenever they ask me for money it's more

00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,900
like Scrooge but now I'm really excited

00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:21,960
I really enjoy coming to these events

00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,519
and every year and you know here in

00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,099
China and we do them in Europe as well

00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:28,289
and you know engaging in and

00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:30,420
experiencing all this you know new

00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:32,219
innovation and capabilities that are

00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:34,770
come out through this community and it's

00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:37,050
really a lot of fun to watch collaborate

00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:39,360
and experience it today is more exciting

00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:41,309
for me because I get to deliver some of

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,719
it and I think what some of the stuff

00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:45,030
we're going to talk about today and what

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,620
I'm going to be providing to you I think

00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:49,020
is game-changing for the open community

00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:53,550
and so let's let's get started let's get

00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:54,980
into it so first just a reminder I think

00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:57,690
everybody has seen this chart before

00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:00,359
right you guys all know why we started

00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:02,609
open power we all saw the fact that

00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:04,409
Moore's law was dead or declining and

00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:06,960
they you weren't seeing any longer the

00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:09,479
2x performance every two years over 18

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,299
months and the need to be an accelerate

00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:16,770
up and down the stack accelerators

00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:18,869
software networking connectivity storage

00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:20,790
etc and the ability to be able to do

00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:23,340
that is becoming even more important as

00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:26,040
we move forward when you look at the

00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,720
explosion of data the algorithms and

00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,130
artificial intelligence and their need

00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,110
to be able to process that more

00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:33,420
effectively we're seeing custom hyper

00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:35,900
scalars and others that are hiring their

00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:39,210
own chip designers developing their own

00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:41,280
accelerators and their own memory

00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:44,579
controllers and their own capabilities

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:47,130
in that stack to advance and accelerate

00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:48,930
the performance of these systems that

00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:50,729
are necessary to drive the workloads of

00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:52,979
today and especially of tomorrow and

00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:55,680
that's only done effectively through

00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:57,390
open innovation so this is what we've

00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,399
been doing with open power for the last

00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:02,310
five years has been important towards

00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:04,860
that objective but we needed to take it

00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:07,259
to the next step and we see transition

00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:09,090
happening in the industry that justifies

00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:10,830
taking it to the next step we're seeing

00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:13,290
this innovation happening in different

00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:15,689
ways with open hardware we're

00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:18,329
different players different new open

00:02:15,689 --> 00:02:19,859
eisah communities come into play and and

00:02:18,329 --> 00:02:22,200
the effect that they're having on the

00:02:19,859 --> 00:02:24,359
industry is demonstrating the need to

00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,790
continue to drive an open type of

00:02:24,359 --> 00:02:29,280
computing environment and governance

00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:31,079
structure to drive that innovation and

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,640
we're taking that to the next step with

00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:34,200
power but with that said let me just

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,629
remind everybody we have made

00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,519
significant progress to date with the

00:02:36,629 --> 00:02:39,750
350 plus members we have in the

00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:42,180
foundation we've had hundreds of

00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:43,859
innovations we have over over 40

00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,299
different different types of server

00:02:43,859 --> 00:02:47,549
solutions have come out in the market

00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:49,920
more than 20 different vendors that have

00:02:47,549 --> 00:02:51,450
delivered open solutions in the

00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,040
community along with a lot of different

00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:56,340
work being done at every different layer

00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:58,319
that stack and we've delivered we the

00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:00,780
community have delivered that all the

00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,669
way down from low end and workstations

00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:04,370
like raptor has delivered all the way up

00:03:02,669 --> 00:03:06,239
to the top supercomputers in the world

00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:08,340
the number one and number two

00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,439
supercomputers at Oak Ridge and Lawrence

00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:12,750
Livermore they was done through a

00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:15,299
community of innovation many different

00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:17,129
players there were over 20 involved in

00:03:15,299 --> 00:03:20,220
that people like Mellanox and Nvidia and

00:03:17,129 --> 00:03:22,349
Red Hat Samsung Seagate Super Micro I

00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:23,879
can go on and on many different players

00:03:22,349 --> 00:03:26,790
they were involved in the delivery of

00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:29,760
that through an open ecosystem so this

00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:33,419
initiative this foundation this

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:35,220
community has been very effective but as

00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:37,620
we see the industry shifting even

00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:41,489
further and quicker to open hardware

00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:43,680
environments we know as a leader having

00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:46,169
an enterprise scale instruction set

00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,510
architecture with high levels of

00:03:46,169 --> 00:03:50,010
security and high levels of performance

00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:51,569
we can provide that leadership to the

00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:54,150
industry without open hardware and we're

00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:55,829
going to do that so if you look at where

00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:57,569
the future of computing goes we are

00:03:55,829 --> 00:04:00,000
looking at purpose-built processors

00:03:57,569 --> 00:04:02,970
right we are looking at a different way

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,409
to innovate in an open community versus

00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:07,109
your standard traditional ways to

00:04:04,409 --> 00:04:09,060
deliver Hardware okay we're looking at

00:04:07,109 --> 00:04:11,639
heterogeneous computing being critical

00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:14,220
and as I said innovation up and down the

00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:16,079
stack is required to do that the only

00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:19,549
way to effectively do that as a

00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:23,099
community is through an open environment

00:04:19,549 --> 00:04:26,430
iBM has been leading that ever since the

00:04:23,099 --> 00:04:27,130
beginning of the open thrust in the

00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:30,010
community

00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:32,260
2019 99 I think it was we spent a

00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:34,030
billion dollars we committed a billion

00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:36,370
dollars to Linux before anybody else was

00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:37,990
even serious about Linux and this is

00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:39,040
only a subset of the things we've done

00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:40,770
you're talking about the Eclipse

00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,420
community developing and creating

00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:45,790
jointly with the community an open

00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:48,190
developer toolkit environment for being

00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:50,560
able to create software with Eclipse we

00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:53,440
were we were critical contributors at

00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,970
kubernetes to docker to OpenStack as far

00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,320
as driving helping drive those

00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:58,300
communities forward and of course

00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,430
working closely with Red Hat on the

00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:02,410
Linux kernel and then of course the

00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:05,920
announcement with Red Hat all those

00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:07,540
initiatives on the software side IBM has

00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:09,910
been a leader from the beginning and

00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:11,980
driving the advancement of those

00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:15,340
critical software capabilities in an

00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:16,750
open ecosystem type of approach we

00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:21,070
started doing that in the hardware side

00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:24,220
in 2013 with open power and then in 2016

00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:26,980
with open copy and driving a much more

00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:30,100
open approach to coherent accelerator

00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:31,540
and memory interface standards and now

00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:34,150
we're taking those things to the next

00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:36,250
level so we're gonna talk today I'm

00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:38,980
gonna talk today about what we're

00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:40,150
calling our open chip design environment

00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:43,210
we have a number of different things

00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:46,150
that we're announcing today around this

00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:49,720
next step with open power and the open

00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:53,050
community and open copy first and

00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:57,180
foremost we're taking the power

00:05:53,050 --> 00:06:02,080
instruction set architecture okay we are

00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:05,290
licensed empower foundation so that

00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:08,260
anyone can implement on top of it

00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:09,580
royalty free with patent rights and

00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:13,210
that's going to be done through the

00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:15,790
community okay we are going to be doing

00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:17,050
it in an open governance model that open

00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:19,000
governance model is going to be done

00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:22,690
through an open governance work group in

00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,950
the open power foundation where it's a

00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:29,010
majority vote to enable enhancements

00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:30,930
extensions and implementations or new

00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:32,770
instruction set architecture

00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:35,200
capabilities that are added to the

00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:37,240
instruction set architecture very

00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,830
significant that announcement to do it

00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,090
through an open governance model through

00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:44,090
the community

00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:46,070
we are taking open copy and oh my the

00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:48,230
open memory interface and we are

00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:50,990
contributing that to the community

00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:52,940
through the open copy consortium those

00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:56,120
are that RTL those reference designs

00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:58,040
will now be available to the community

00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,510
it will be contributed it will be now be

00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:01,940
part of the community versus I've been

00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:03,770
controlled and we are hoping over time

00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:06,980
the objective is not just to get those

00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:09,590
to be more driven as industry standards

00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:11,870
but to drive convergence with other

00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:14,780
standards like cxl and we've gotten a

00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:16,220
lot of support in in with early

00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:19,400
discussions with a number of members of

00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:21,830
the community for that convergence

00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:24,140
approach very important very powerful

00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:26,710
members who we think will be catalysts

00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:29,870
in helping us drive that convergence

00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:33,020
also under the open under the open power

00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:35,840
ice a contribution you'll hear more from

00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:37,940
Anton and a couple I think two or three

00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,110
presentations after mine that we are

00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:40,970
putting a soft core out there we're

00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:42,830
contributing a soft core that's gonna

00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:44,510
make it easier for people to be able to

00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:46,520
do implementations on top of the ice ax

00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:48,770
leveraging that soft core as a tool as a

00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:52,310
baseline that is now contributed to the

00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:55,130
community and then last but not least as

00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:56,720
a demonstration of the importance of us

00:07:55,130 --> 00:08:00,800
putting this into open governance

00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:03,440
principles the open power foundation is

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:06,620
going to be moving as an entity to be

00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:08,060
part of the Linux Foundation and it will

00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:09,800
now be part of the Linux Foundation it

00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:12,890
will still be an entity it will have its

00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:15,410
own board its own decision-making but as

00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:17,090
an entity of the Linux Foundation so

00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:18,290
this doesn't change anything here with

00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:20,360
this community this community is still

00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:22,010
just as critical but we're making a

00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:24,320
statement to the industry that it's

00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:25,880
going to be part of what I would

00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:28,280
consider the Linux Foundation one of the

00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:30,710
leading players in the market in the

00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:33,680
world around open governance structures

00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:35,150
of principles okay this is the

00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,589
announcement we consider this

00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:39,830
game-changing we consider this big we

00:08:36,589 --> 00:08:41,210
have before we made this we have

00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:43,849
reviewed this with lots of different

00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:46,310
industry players and we've gotten lots

00:08:43,849 --> 00:08:49,670
of endorsement lots of excitement

00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:51,800
actually out there in the industry you

00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:52,800
can see the names on the list we've

00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:56,149
gotten support

00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:59,389
an endorsement and an excitement from

00:08:56,149 --> 00:09:01,489
you know some of the leading open

00:08:59,389 --> 00:09:04,050
operating system vendors in the world

00:09:01,489 --> 00:09:05,999
some of the leading server vendors in

00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:08,910
the world leading accelerator vendors

00:09:05,999 --> 00:09:12,420
leading interconnect vendors leading

00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:14,759
hyper scalars in the world some major

00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:18,149
research institutions in the world and

00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:19,679
you know we didn't go to everybody out

00:09:18,149 --> 00:09:21,420
there we went to players we thought were

00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:25,199
important I don't remember a single

00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:26,279
player not saying to us that wow this is

00:09:25,199 --> 00:09:28,230
something this is going to make a

00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:30,059
difference in the industry so we're

00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:32,910
really excited about what we will be

00:09:30,059 --> 00:09:36,779
doing once now we execute on this

00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:40,589
announcement and what I really would

00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:42,389
really I enjoy about this is you know as

00:09:40,589 --> 00:09:46,290
I said before you know iBM has

00:09:42,389 --> 00:09:50,249
demonstrated our ability to be leaders

00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:54,329
in the open community for since the

00:09:50,249 --> 00:09:57,920
beginning we are now IBM is now the only

00:09:54,329 --> 00:10:00,779
processor vendor in the world this open

00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:02,279
from the lowest levels of the hardware

00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:04,799
the instruction set architecture and the

00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:07,259
firmware all the way up through the

00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:09,929
software the server software stack and

00:10:07,259 --> 00:10:12,899
power is the only architecture that is

00:10:09,929 --> 00:10:14,610
open all the way from the lower levels

00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:17,429
lowest levels of the hardware up through

00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:19,319
the server software stack that's a

00:10:17,429 --> 00:10:21,689
statement of our commitment to this if

00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:23,129
anybody I shouldn't even say this but I

00:10:21,689 --> 00:10:24,689
will if anybody says well you're opening

00:10:23,129 --> 00:10:26,850
it up and you're moving it under this

00:10:24,689 --> 00:10:28,649
and oh is that is there any D commitment

00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:31,799
from IBM no this is a further commitment

00:10:28,649 --> 00:10:33,929
from us our row we're out powered the

00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:36,600
left 10 power 11 power 12-hour roadmap

00:10:33,929 --> 00:10:38,699
is is committed for the future and we're

00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,799
accelerating that but in an order for

00:10:38,699 --> 00:10:42,179
for the industry to get the benefits

00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:44,309
that they really should be getting out

00:10:42,179 --> 00:10:47,009
of the power architecture we want to

00:10:44,309 --> 00:10:49,139
drive more innovation in the ecosystem

00:10:47,009 --> 00:10:50,459
not just IBM but in the entire ecosystem

00:10:49,139 --> 00:10:52,499
when we started doing that but the

00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:54,480
foundation pretty effectively we want to

00:10:52,499 --> 00:10:55,499
go to the next level a big with that and

00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,040
that's what this announcement is all

00:10:55,499 --> 00:10:58,079
about

00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:02,040
so let me close it by bringing up Mike

00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:04,529
Dolan who is the S the VP of strategic

00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:06,270
programs for the Linux Foundation just

00:11:04,529 --> 00:11:08,040
to give us a couple of

00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:09,540
minutes if you could take us through why

00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:12,000
you think this announcement is important

00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:14,070
both the Linux Foundation as well as for

00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,660
the open source community yeah I think I

00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:17,760
think this is an exciting announcement

00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:20,100
for us we've been working with the open

00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,170
power foundation on the side you know

00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:25,050
for a long times we have a good working

00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:27,840
relationship but as we look to where

00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:30,000
things are going in the industry you're

00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:32,340
starting to see an incremental evolution

00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,890
from a lot of the cloud infrastructure

00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:36,840
being open-source some of the industry

00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:38,820
applications being open source you see a

00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:41,940
number of industries gravitating towards

00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:43,470
an open development model and while that

00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:45,750
started in open source software and

00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:47,970
Linux was a perennial example of what

00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:50,940
you can succeed with when you get to an

00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:53,550
open infrastructure you're looking at

00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:56,580
now evolutions of that into open

00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:59,010
hardware open power is one example

00:11:56,580 --> 00:12:01,710
chips alliance is another example of

00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:03,030
where organizations are saying you know

00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:05,040
it was great that we were able to do

00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:07,020
that for source code but can we do that

00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,120
for hardware can we do that for the

00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:11,880
instructions of architecture the

00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:14,070
firmware the verification and testing

00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:16,830
tooling and things around it can we get

00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:19,650
to a better place if we have a core

00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:22,110
plumbing that we can build on and that's

00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:23,820
where it's not about giving away all of

00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:27,180
the intellectual property it's about

00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:29,340
putting a core plumbing set out there

00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:30,660
that everybody can build upon and be

00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:32,940
able to build their own value-add

00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:35,280
solutions and additional things that

00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:38,100
scratch their edges or address their use

00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:40,230
cases that maybe it's not something the

00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:42,630
entire world needs but they're allowed

00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:44,850
to adapt and evolve the architecture to

00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:46,410
where they need to go and this is

00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:47,730
something where I think open power is at

00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:50,070
the forefront of that on the hardware

00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:52,110
side of things certainly we're seeing

00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:55,470
collaborations even beyond just you know

00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:57,660
the hardware to open data IBM was

00:12:55,470 --> 00:13:00,420
actually also a significant contributor

00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:02,130
to community data license agreements and

00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:05,100
things where we're working on open data

00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:06,750
we're working on open software we have

00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:08,850
open specifications and hardware that

00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:10,710
we're open specification standards that

00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:12,690
we've been working on so across the

00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:14,340
various technical areas where people

00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:17,040
collaborate we're starting to see more

00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:18,510
and more open collaboration and I think

00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,340
that that's a powerful thing if you look

00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:21,080
at a

00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:23,900
a lot of these examples it's not just

00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:27,640
Linux anymore we now have hundreds of

00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:29,810
examples of software specifications

00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,490
hardware designs that you're all

00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:33,260
dependent upon whether you know it or

00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:34,850
not but you're building value-added

00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:37,160
solutions and other capabilities around

00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:39,350
it and because you have that base layer

00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:40,490
that is open and shared you're able to

00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:42,320
do that with a much faster

00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:44,900
time-to-market you're able to do it in a

00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:47,360
much more compatible interoperable way

00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:49,430
so that things start to work together at

00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,110
a better level and so I think it's

00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:53,060
exciting I think we've been you know

00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:54,440
working together for a while so the

00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:56,750
partnership with the Linux Foundation I

00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:58,670
think is is an evolution of where we

00:13:56,750 --> 00:14:00,620
were at but I work forward to working

00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:02,390
with you and seeing where we can take

00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:04,910
this next because I do think there's a

00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:07,190
lot more this is I think step one for us

00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:08,690
it's there's a lot of steps to come in

00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:11,290
the future and we're certainly excited

00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:14,650
to see where it can go thank you Mike

00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:14,650
all right folks

00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:21,610
thank you Mike now that the presents are

00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:23,110
unwrapped from under the tree I hope you

00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:24,459
guys are as excited as we are and we

00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:26,350
really look forward now the

00:14:24,459 --> 00:14:27,850
announcements out now the hard work is

00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:30,570
going forward and we look forward to

00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:34,739
working with everybody on that thank you

00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:34,739
