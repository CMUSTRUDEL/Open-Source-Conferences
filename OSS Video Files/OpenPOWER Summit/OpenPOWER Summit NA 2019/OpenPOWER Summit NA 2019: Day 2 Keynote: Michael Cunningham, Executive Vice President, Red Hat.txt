the ubiquitous clicker was missing good

00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:06,960
morning everyone it's great to be here I

00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:09,269
was asked to share some of my

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,519
experiences and observations about open

00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:14,429
collaboration and I'm looking forward to

00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:18,330
do that but first let me tell you all

00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:20,010
that I am excited to be here at an

00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,650
epicenter of free and open source

00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:24,480
hardware I'm excited to be here because

00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:27,689
Aaron well-demonstrated

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,789
you all are at a cutting edge of open

00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:31,740
collaboration you know kind of things

00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:33,329
have been sorted out as Aaron pointed

00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:36,000
out in free and open source software

00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:37,710
free and open source hardware we're

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,059
still working things out and to be here

00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:41,270
on a day when there are some really

00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:44,430
important announcements regarding

00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:47,039
technology on the processor on Io and on

00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:48,840
memory but from my perspective really

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,539
interesting announcements regarding

00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:54,000
governance governance is really very

00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:55,770
important to make it all work to make it

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,680
a place that's safe to come out and play

00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:00,989
but a bit about me first of all I was

00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:04,680
trained as a in mathematics I was an

00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:06,630
engineer a million years ago doing radar

00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,000
and satellite communications engineering

00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:11,040
and then about 30 years ago I went to

00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,950
the darkside then became a lawyer I

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,900
began to sprout little red horns at that

00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:17,640
time as you would expect and to the

00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:20,549
extent that I did anything that had

00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:23,040
socially redeeming value probably didn't

00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:24,659
I'm a lawyer after all it was because of

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:29,280
that logo in the lower right hand corner

00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:31,320
red hat so for the past 15 years going

00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:35,820
on 16 years I've been the general

00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:38,040
counsel of red hat and I've had from

00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:40,799
that perch the chance to observe a lot

00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,689
about the power of open collaboration so

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,180
let me offer you just a couple of

00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:48,299
observations about that first of all

00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:51,210
I've seen red hat go from the bad girls

00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:53,490
and bad boys who were renegades trying

00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:55,200
to get a seat at the table trying to be

00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:58,799
relevant and trying to talk to

00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:02,070
enterprises to becoming in fact an

00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:04,320
infrastructure software supplier to the

00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:06,000
established world whether that's the New

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,250
York Stock Exchange the Chicago

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,950
Mercantile Exchange the White House

00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:13,180
etcetera so in a very short period of

00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:15,400
time going from the

00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:19,299
sort of rebel mindset to actually a

00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:22,000
provider I've also seen us go from a

00:02:19,299 --> 00:02:25,599
company that was a mom-and-pop shop kind

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,200
of a local dry cleaner to a company that

00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:31,510
was an SP 500 new york stock exchange

00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:33,670
traded company so we arrived we thought

00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:36,400
we had become a big fish and in fact we

00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:38,379
had become a big fish in the oaf in the

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,659
ocean in our mind but of course there

00:02:38,379 --> 00:02:43,420
are whales in the ocean big majestic

00:02:40,659 --> 00:02:46,419
creatures that occasionally swim by you

00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:49,450
and recently we encountered a large blue

00:02:46,419 --> 00:02:52,000
whale who asked if we were interested in

00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:55,150
being part of their enterprise so that

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,540
was pretty exciting stuff more

00:02:55,150 --> 00:03:01,659
importantly I have seen incredible value

00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:05,109
chains created these are value for

00:03:01,659 --> 00:03:08,379
customers value for employees value for

00:03:05,109 --> 00:03:10,209
the entirety of the ecosystem and for my

00:03:08,379 --> 00:03:12,459
time at Red Hat I think we were just

00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:15,939
under 200 million dollars in revenue

00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:18,669
just one example of it and by the time

00:03:15,939 --> 00:03:22,000
we were acquired by the large blue

00:03:18,669 --> 00:03:25,090
mammal we were just under four billion

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,659
in revenue and it turns out that the

00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:30,310
mammal had you know some gold in its

00:03:28,659 --> 00:03:31,900
belly from cleaning up treasure at that

00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:33,729
at the bottom of the ocean and other

00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:37,000
great places and coughed up a little bit

00:03:33,729 --> 00:03:40,269
for us as well so value creation was

00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,030
there but that's not as important as why

00:03:40,269 --> 00:03:45,250
was wet Red Hat rewarded obviously it

00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:48,699
wasn't rewarded in slide presentation or

00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:50,859
creation but we'll pass over that for

00:03:48,699 --> 00:03:52,629
the moment it was right when we did the

00:03:50,859 --> 00:03:54,159
rehearsal so it's one of those gremlins

00:03:52,629 --> 00:03:57,280
of technology that'll bite you

00:03:54,159 --> 00:04:00,099
we were rewarded quite simply because we

00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:04,030
were able to liberate innovation more

00:04:00,099 --> 00:04:06,849
quickly that's it if you reduce it down

00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:09,639
to its essence that was it and it wasn't

00:04:06,849 --> 00:04:13,449
innovation that we did yes we are a

00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:15,879
large contributor to Linux we are by no

00:04:13,449 --> 00:04:18,340
means a majority contributor we're by no

00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:20,829
means even a dominant contributor we

00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:23,139
have a swath of stuff that we do we help

00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:25,150
literate liberate innovation by helping

00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:27,480
to foster an ecosystem with many other

00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:33,190
people and then making that

00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:35,620
to a variety of users so with that as a

00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:37,720
background of some of my experiences let

00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:40,060
me offer some observations on open

00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:43,830
collaboration I'm going to do this

00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:46,270
through a series of aphorisms that were

00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:47,170
generated from my head of government

00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:50,220
affairs

00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:52,450
he's a North Carolinian it was the

00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:54,400
youngest elected member of the North

00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:58,360
Carolina Assembly many many years ago

00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:00,010
and one day he was talking to me and he

00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,240
was talking in a southern accent which

00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:03,340
I'm not going to do very well and he

00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,960
goes you know Mike when I'm in the halls

00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:06,970
of Congress and I have to explain what

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,400
open source is to maybe a senator or a

00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:10,720
congressman and the whole time I have is

00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,280
to ride up in an elevator

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:16,300
I have to find a way to do it and I

00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:18,880
found it and let's see if we can get it

00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:21,610
to work and this is his aphorism this is

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,890
Mike I got to tell you nobody's as smart

00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:25,660
as everybody so if you take the

00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:29,410
collective wisdom and the collective

00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:33,220
creativity of a large body of people it

00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:35,200
by definition has to be better and more

00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:36,940
powerful than a single individual of

00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,470
course that whole notion of we're all

00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:40,540
Einsteins and they're gonna come up with

00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:42,580
the equals mc-squared is you know

00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:44,440
there's a couple Einsteins out there and

00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:46,990
thank goodness we'll have them but most

00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:48,580
of us make incremental improvements and

00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:50,290
those incremental improvements gets

00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:52,720
assembled by different and other people

00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:54,850
so this idea that nobody is as smart as

00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,940
everybody another thing that's true is

00:05:54,850 --> 00:06:00,340
that nobody's as fast as everybody we

00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:03,240
get everybody moving you got a network

00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:06,340
of people that are Co inventing their

00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:08,200
converging-diverging going together so

00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:10,540
if speed of innovation is quickly

00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:14,500
nobody's as good as everybody doing it

00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:17,650
together this is a really important one

00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:18,850
gee I never saw it that way he only came

00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:20,320
up with the first one but I'll continue

00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:22,180
with the southern accent case or my

00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,500
attempt at one and probably offend some

00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:27,100
southerners in the audience but that's

00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:29,410
not my intent this really goes to the

00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:32,700
diversity of the innovation pool we

00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:36,220
absolutely want gender diversity and

00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:38,380
national diversity and you know all

00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:40,460
sorts of other components but we want

00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:43,100
diversity of roles of

00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:45,289
plays and things that people do in the

00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:48,830
community and in particular the user

00:06:45,289 --> 00:06:50,780
community you know there's a corollary

00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:52,880
to this I call the Satchmo corollary

00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:57,199
which is nobody knows the trouble I've

00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:59,870
seen so if I'm a producer of technology

00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:01,940
I will not know intimately the problem

00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:04,400
that the user is experiencing as well as

00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:06,500
the user I may not know about other

00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,870
problems that the user is experiencing

00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:10,639
which I haven't identified and I sure as

00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:13,550
heck won't know whether the solution is

00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:16,220
elegant and beautiful for solving their

00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:18,650
problem coming from their perspective so

00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:20,449
the inclusion of users in the innovation

00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:22,520
community is huge

00:07:20,449 --> 00:07:24,740
Red Hat never produced the Apple Newton

00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:27,229
we never could have produced the Apple

00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:29,389
Newton perhaps an innovative product but

00:07:27,229 --> 00:07:31,460
well before its time because no user was

00:07:29,389 --> 00:07:33,860
asking for it when you get it to open

00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:36,440
collaboration of your users you have

00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:38,419
relevance the users help make sure

00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:44,389
everything you're doing is relevant it's

00:07:38,419 --> 00:07:46,220
very very powerful its cost effective

00:07:44,389 --> 00:07:47,419
you know if you don't have everybody on

00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:49,849
your P&L you're going to produce

00:07:47,419 --> 00:07:52,909
something so somebody else is somebody

00:07:49,849 --> 00:07:57,699
is cheaper than your somebody another

00:07:52,909 --> 00:08:00,349
great effect from open collaboration

00:07:57,699 --> 00:08:02,060
this is obviously didn't come from my

00:08:00,349 --> 00:08:06,650
southern this came from Eric Raymond

00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:09,889
which is a paraphrase of many eyes make

00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:13,099
all bugs shallow at a time of Spectre

00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:15,169
and heartbleed and the considerations of

00:08:13,099 --> 00:08:17,840
all of society about information

00:08:15,169 --> 00:08:19,550
security the opportunity to collaborate

00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,159
in an open way about security is

00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:25,219
extraordinarily powerful extraordinarily

00:08:22,159 --> 00:08:26,870
powerful nobody trusts a closed

00:08:25,219 --> 00:08:28,280
environment where you can't look in

00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:31,070
where you can look in you can help

00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:32,779
identify the problems and as importantly

00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:35,209
you can help remedy the security

00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:37,870
problems very very quickly as some of

00:08:35,209 --> 00:08:39,950
you are aware some of the heartbleed and

00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:43,399
Spectre problems were actually

00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:48,079
compensated for in software after they

00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:50,720
were discovered last and perhaps the

00:08:48,079 --> 00:08:53,779
most important is I like playing here

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,170
because it's fun and safe so you need an

00:08:53,779 --> 00:08:56,360
echo

00:08:54,170 --> 00:09:00,140
system that makes people want to come

00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:01,070
out and play the minimum is that it

00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:04,580
seems fair

00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:07,130
you have good governance and that there

00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:09,710
are any trap doors like an IP that if I

00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:12,020
use my effort and energy to participate

00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:13,640
is going to come and hang me or leave me

00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:15,680
in some position of harm with the

00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:18,020
organization of it that's the base

00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:20,450
minimum when you're really successful

00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:22,820
when you create an environment then that

00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:24,440
is fun to come and play because cool

00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:27,050
people are coming to play and do

00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:30,670
exciting things you unleash a whole

00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:33,560
other way that's engagement and passion

00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:37,100
this is just a brief story of engagement

00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:39,680
and passion at Red Hat I have you know a

00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:41,360
large significant number of the most

00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,670
experienced open-source lawyers in the

00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,390
world one of them responsible for

00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:48,500
writing large portions of the gplv3

00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:50,000
came to me and said he wanted to go to a

00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:53,030
conference the conference was in Europe

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,250
as you know acts we have to rotate this

00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:57,080
around and we're gonna let why go and he

00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:59,240
said you said Mike you don't understand

00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:01,120
open source is my life and I'm going in

00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:05,120
respective or whether you pay for me

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:06,890
okay please go but that passion that

00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,200
really connecting into things that

00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:11,300
people care about that they want to

00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,610
participate in really opens up

00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:16,780
incredible stuff and so when you take

00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:20,120
all that stuff you could have a

00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:21,590
OpenOffice pie chart on the Left which

00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,510
somebody's going to get a bigger slice

00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:25,940
and it's good and the person who's got

00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:27,830
the green slice is happier but when you

00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:29,660
add the open collaboration force

00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:33,160
multipliers which I just went through

00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:35,990
which are creativity and wisdom speed

00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:38,620
much greater relevance in all likelihood

00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:41,420
if you have a diverse community cost

00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:45,110
security improvements and passion and

00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:46,880
engagement the open office pie chart pie

00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:48,650
becomes in fact a cherry pie and

00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,990
everyone's pieces are much bigger and

00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:53,990
much more exciting let me leave you with

00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:55,460
just one final thought innovation is

00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:57,830
something you should leave and feel

00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:59,650
really good about innovation is one of

00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:03,740
the few things in the world that takes

00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:06,650
1+1 and makes it 2.7 innovation is

00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:07,699
therefore among the most likely things

00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:10,399
to lift the law

00:11:07,699 --> 00:11:12,439
of humanity all over the world can be

00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,660
misused for sure but it is more likely

00:11:12,439 --> 00:11:16,850
to do that if you are liberating more

00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:18,049
innovation in the world chances are

00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:20,269
you're going to be lifting the lot of

00:11:18,049 --> 00:11:22,459
humanity while doing your job while

00:11:20,269 --> 00:11:24,139
doing interesting technology while

00:11:22,459 --> 00:11:26,380
creating a new movement in free and

00:11:24,139 --> 00:11:32,019
open-source hardware thanks so much

00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:32,019
