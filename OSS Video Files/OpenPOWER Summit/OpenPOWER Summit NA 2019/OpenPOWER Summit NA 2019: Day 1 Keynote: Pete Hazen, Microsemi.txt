good morning everybody it's great to be

00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:06,899
here in San Diego with all of you and to

00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:09,840
be here

00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:12,690
part of the power ecosystem we're very

00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,309
committed and excited about some new

00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:19,710
capabilities that were rolling out as

00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:22,170
Steve mentioned so I am responsible for

00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:24,449
our data center solutions business at

00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:26,420
microchip I think many of you may be

00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:29,640
familiar with microchip as a

00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:32,550
microcontroller company we have a broad

00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,930
range of products that go that serve a

00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:37,010
number of different market segments

00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:41,190
including consumer embedded automotive

00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:44,340
back in May of 2018 microchip acquired

00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:47,399
micro semi and expanded into aerospace

00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:50,969
and defense communications as well as

00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:54,170
data center solutions and within the

00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:57,030
data center solutions group we are

00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:59,640
focused on connecting managing and

00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:03,329
securing the world's information by

00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:06,330
enabling connectivity solutions across

00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:08,250
storage memory and compute in a

00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:10,080
microchip we very much believe that the

00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:13,680
future of the data center is going to

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:17,970
rely very heavily on flexible platforms

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:20,009
and composable platforms and so we're

00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:25,020
directing our energies into those spaces

00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:27,470
across storage memory and compute so a

00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:31,759
few comments about what we're currently

00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:34,500
focused on we are looking at three

00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,570
distinct market segments storage

00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,909
infrastructure solutions endpoint

00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:40,140
solutions and memory infrastructure

00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:43,970
which I'm going to talk to you about

00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:48,630
today and follow-on to Steve's topic of

00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:50,670
memory so first in storage we have our

00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:53,579
i/o controllers and our smart raid

00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:57,380
solutions we also have the industry's

00:01:53,579 --> 00:02:00,329
highest port density SAS expanders and

00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:05,180
we are now very much focused on bringing

00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:08,610
all of those to Gen four speeds

00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:12,420
including our industry-leading flash I'm

00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:13,260
sorry switch tech product line with PCIe

00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,569
S which is

00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:19,769
that enable connectivity between CPUs

00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:24,239
GPUs as well as storage and memory we

00:02:19,769 --> 00:02:26,909
also very much focus on enabling nvme

00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:29,310
SSDs which are the fastest and largest

00:02:26,909 --> 00:02:32,430
growing segment of storage as we look

00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:35,790
forward and then finally we've augmented

00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:39,180
our product roadmap now with the new

00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:41,819
focus on memory infrastructure and a

00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:44,370
couple weeks ago we announced a new

00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:50,640
product called the smart memory

00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:52,650
controller and basically the SMC 1000

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:56,849
has 8 25 gig

00:02:52,650 --> 00:03:00,659
omi connectivity that is required for

00:02:56,849 --> 00:03:03,420
next-generation CPUs and and SOC s for a

00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:06,720
variety of high performance computing

00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:09,750
including AI and a subset of that in

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,459
machine learning so we talked about this

00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:17,400
at flash memory summit a couple weeks

00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:20,750
ago this is a broad industry trend open

00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:23,609
power is leading in that transition and

00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:26,970
this product specifically is designed

00:03:23,609 --> 00:03:32,209
and optimized to work with the IBM power

00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:35,069
9 prime processor if we think about

00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:37,980
composable memory infrastructure we see

00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:40,919
innovation across two vectors near

00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:43,680
memory and far memory and the near

00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:47,370
memory innovation is really about how do

00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,840
I get more bandwidth to my CPU as Steve

00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:52,019
just showed in his roadmap

00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:55,109
you know the processor number of cores

00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:59,220
is increased from 8 to 12 and now to 24

00:03:55,109 --> 00:04:01,470
and we're limited by the number of pins

00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:06,030
and the real estate that we have

00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:07,769
available on the package and so it's

00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:09,389
really the serialization of memory

00:04:07,769 --> 00:04:11,579
that's going to enable us to open up

00:04:09,389 --> 00:04:15,599
that bandwidth to serve the needs of

00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:17,549
these applications second is far memory

00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:20,699
innovation and this is really all about

00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:22,680
pooling memory resources and then

00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:26,670
sharing those across one or more

00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:28,800
machines and that requires

00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:31,470
number of capabilities including fabric

00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,020
capabilities that that were investing in

00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:37,950
as well we've been working with a number

00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:40,470
of partners in the ecosystem that are

00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:43,320
focused on these new open load/store

00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:46,230
standards obviously including open Cathy

00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:49,470
but also the recently announced compute

00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:52,410
express link see Excel consortium as

00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:54,720
well as Gen Z so there's no doubt this

00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:58,290
is a very important trend that's going

00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:04,470
to drive a new market segments around

00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:06,660
memory infrastructure if we look at the

00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:10,410
key trends around latency and bandwidth

00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:12,840
this is from an industry paper that is

00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:15,480
plotting the trends in terms of latency

00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:18,240
and bandwidth over time there's really

00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:20,280
two takeaways to this when you look at

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:24,150
the number of cores that are increasing

00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:27,570
the amount of memory bandwidth per core

00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:31,020
is actually going down and likewise the

00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:34,560
latency per member per CPU core is going

00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:37,650
up and fundamentally this is driven by

00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,570
the fact that our DRAM buses on our CPUs

00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:42,420
are limited both in terms of quantity

00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:46,590
and performance we can't fit any more

00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:48,570
pins on the chip and there are power and

00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:52,950
performance implications for the current

00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:54,840
architecture that leads us to the

00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:57,180
product that I want to spend a few

00:05:54,840 --> 00:06:00,510
minutes sharing with you we call this

00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:05,070
the smart memory controller SMC 1000 it

00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:09,090
has basically two interfaces 8 by 25 gig

00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:15,860
omi interface to the processor and a 72

00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:18,630
bit ddr4 3200 interface to our DRAM and

00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:20,820
there's really three primary values to

00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:23,630
this the first and foremost is the

00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:29,660
bandwidth essentially we're replacing a

00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:33,840
288 ddr4 interface I'm sorry to 288 pin

00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:36,900
ddr4 interface with an 83 pin omi

00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:40,219
interface so effectively we're able to

00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:42,739
quadruple the bandwidth with

00:06:40,219 --> 00:06:45,259
this solution that is moving the memory

00:06:42,739 --> 00:06:47,659
interface to a serial interface and

00:06:45,259 --> 00:06:51,319
secondly and Steve touched on this is

00:06:47,659 --> 00:06:53,629
media independence so by moving that

00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:56,300
controller outside of the CPU we can now

00:06:53,629 --> 00:06:58,789
couple the innovation and development of

00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:01,189
those controller solutions with the new

00:06:58,789 --> 00:07:05,149
memory whether it be some form of DRAM

00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:08,300
flash or storage class memory and then

00:07:05,149 --> 00:07:11,389
finally the benefit of lower total cost

00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:15,409
of solution you have lower silicon costs

00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:17,779
in your CPU you have fewer pins and you

00:07:15,409 --> 00:07:23,679
have the ability to drive overall lower

00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:27,499
costs with with less complex packaging

00:07:23,679 --> 00:07:29,899
so this product will be available in the

00:07:27,499 --> 00:07:33,409
market in the form of D Dems they'll be

00:07:29,899 --> 00:07:35,059
both 1u and to you we've been working

00:07:33,409 --> 00:07:38,779
with our partners at smart modular

00:07:35,059 --> 00:07:42,709
samsung electronics as well as micron

00:07:38,779 --> 00:07:45,889
and the production availability is

00:07:42,709 --> 00:07:50,419
aligned with the the power p9 processor

00:07:45,889 --> 00:07:53,599
and samples are available today if you

00:07:50,419 --> 00:07:55,429
join us out in the for year later we

00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:59,059
have a demonstration over at the smart

00:07:55,429 --> 00:08:01,369
modular booth and mr. Jay Bennett will

00:07:59,059 --> 00:08:05,499
be over there with us and be happy to

00:08:01,369 --> 00:08:08,869
talk to you more about our new solutions

00:08:05,499 --> 00:08:11,300
so please come and join us we're really

00:08:08,869 --> 00:08:15,229
excited I think this very much is the

00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:17,300
first step in a number of areas related

00:08:15,229 --> 00:08:21,800
to memory infrastructure as I mentioned

00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:24,649
earlier the power ecosystem is leading

00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:26,899
in this space with IBM's processor

00:08:24,649 --> 00:08:27,949
architecture many others are going to

00:08:26,899 --> 00:08:30,619
follow through some of these other

00:08:27,949 --> 00:08:33,709
consortiums that I mentioned first with

00:08:30,619 --> 00:08:36,680
near memory innovation followed by more

00:08:33,709 --> 00:08:40,250
fire memory innovation we also have a

00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:42,579
technical presentation today at 4:45 so

00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:46,339
I invite you to join us for that as well

00:08:42,579 --> 00:08:47,720
so with that I'll say thank you for your

00:08:46,339 --> 00:08:50,500
time and looking forward to working with

00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:54,759
all of you thanks

00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:54,759
