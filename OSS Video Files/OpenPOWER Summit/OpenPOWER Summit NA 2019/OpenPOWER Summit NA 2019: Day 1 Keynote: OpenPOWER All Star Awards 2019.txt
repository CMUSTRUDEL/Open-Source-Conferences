so I have a particularly pleasant a

00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,879
couple of duties to perform this morning

00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:09,450
hopefully not that without too much

00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:14,070
feedback a couple of awards last year we

00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:17,430

00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:19,289
award the Sui last year's presented to

the Lord recipients I guess more

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,750
precisely determined the deliberate

00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:32,070
deliberated on by the board and this

00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:36,090
year is saw that would actually make

00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:39,000
sense to to present two of them so first

00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:40,739
open power all-star award for this year

00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,780
goes to some of who's worked tirelessly

00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:44,070
to keep the open power website and all

00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,920
infrastructure that goes with it

00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:49,379
up-to-date running and current and

00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,210
recently oversaw a fairly major revamp

00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:53,010
of the the entire website

00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:55,399

least

00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:09,010

00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,180
I mention it with the two recipients

00:01:22,899 --> 00:01:26,590
aren't actually aware that they were

00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,880
this was in on the cards for them it

00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:29,229
took a little bit of subterfuge to

00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,390
ensure they'd actually be here but it

00:01:29,229 --> 00:01:35,020
seems that yes I have panned out so

00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:36,429
