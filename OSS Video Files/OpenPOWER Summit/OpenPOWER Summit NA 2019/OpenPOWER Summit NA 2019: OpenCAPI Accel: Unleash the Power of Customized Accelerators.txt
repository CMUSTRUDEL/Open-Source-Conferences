Description: 
	Presented by Yong Lu, IBM

OpenCAPI Acceleration Framework, abbreviated as OC-Accel, is a platform to enable programmers and computer engineers to quickly create FPGA-based accelerations. The acceleration action's software part and hardware part share the server host memory data through OpenCAPI interface. With it, people can quickly design an accelerator and benefit from the bandwidth, latency, coherency and programmability advantages of OpenCAPI.
