Description: 
	Presented by Todd Rosedahl, IBM 

This talk will provide an overview of the existing power measurement, power management, and performance-boosting capabilities of the POWER architecture. Various levels of the hardware/firmware and software stack will be described. Then, it will focus on a new data collection method enabled by OpenBMC that provides a rich data set including performance metrics, temperatures, and power consumption. This new technology has been deployed at scale at ORNL with excellent results. Additionally, a newly emerging power/performance-optimizing application, called GEOPM, will be described.
