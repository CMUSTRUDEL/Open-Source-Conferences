	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,759
okay so my name is Ned gamble and I'm

00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:08,760
going to talk about the open power ready

00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:11,580
workgroup what we do I'm going to go

00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:14,730
through the process for certifying a

00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:16,830
product as being open power ready why we

00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:18,750
want to do it there's an open power

00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:20,400
buddy logo that will talk it out I'll go

00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:23,279
through all the different system

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:26,640
components and what it takes to to get

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:28,439
them certified and yeah I don't think

00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,240
this is gonna last anywhere near 45

00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:35,210
minutes so the good news is we'll all be

00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:37,290
first in line for the free drinks so

00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:38,520
again my name is knitwear I don't know

00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:40,890
if I've even said this my name is Ned

00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,390
gamble I work on the open power

00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:43,829
enablement team and I'm also the

00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:48,200
chairman of the open power ready

00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:51,480
workgroup so what is open power ready

00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:54,120
open power ready is a trademark that we

00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,280
want people to display on their systems

00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,289
on their components to plug into systems

00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:02,670
under software applications operating

00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:05,430
systems and basically the workgroup will

00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:07,680
certify that that those components meet

00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:10,320
the criteria that's defined in the open

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,390
power ready criteria document and that

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,490
document is produced by us in the

00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:16,080
workgroup I think we're on what Rev 2

00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:18,060
now Jeff and we're due for a rev three

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,820
of the open power ready criteria

00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:24,060
document we're on to and I think we're

00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:25,470
in need of a three and that's that's my

00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:28,470
job as the chairman is to make that

00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:31,409
happen and the other thing that the work

00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:32,850
group does is review candidate products

00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:34,740
so if you have a system and open power

00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:36,390
already a system that you designed with

00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:38,180
an open power processor and you want it

00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:41,130
to be certified as open power ready

00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:43,590
there's a website where you can go and

00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,890
fill out some basic information submit

00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,270
it

00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:48,149
hopefully it'll meet all the criteria

00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:49,500
and it'll be either and it'll almost

00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:51,420
certainly be approved if it meets the

00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,460
criteria and if not we'll work with you

00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:57,070
to figure out what was wrong with the

00:01:53,460 --> 00:02:01,300
application and try and get it certified

00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:04,210
so we're gonna talk about the open power

00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:06,300
birdie logo why people want to certify

00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:08,229
their products as open power ready

00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,610
there's different open power ready

00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:12,370
categories like I mentioned their

00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:16,740
systems IO adapters software operating

00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:19,360
systems tool chain things applications

00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:21,190
so I'll touch on the high level version

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,290
of a high level discussion of the

00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:27,190
criteria for what it takes to get

00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:28,510
certified but really you need all the

00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:31,060
details are in the document there's a

00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:32,350
web link there for the document we'll

00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,880
talk about how to join the workgroup

00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:36,370
we're definitely looking for new members

00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:38,230
because almost everyone in the work

00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:42,840
group works at IBM and we'd like to have

00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:47,590
members from the community join so

00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:49,450
please join and there's a web link which

00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:51,640
I'll show you on how to apply for

00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:53,080
product certification and there's a

00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,670
thing on the website called a resource

00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,510
catalog and that's a list I think we're

00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:56,709
up to about a hundred and fifty

00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:57,850
components on it right now

00:02:56,709 --> 00:03:01,959
are things that have already been

00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:04,090
certified as being open power ready any

00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:08,890
questions at this point it's pretty

00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:13,269
basic stuff so this is the open power

00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:14,680
Brady logo I think we have some t-shirts

00:03:13,269 --> 00:03:16,180
there I don't see any double extra-large

00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:20,680
people Frank you might be able to wear

00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:23,230
one the other two are going to me so

00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:26,049
where do we want people to display the

00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:29,590
logo that would be on their websites on

00:03:26,049 --> 00:03:32,830
the products themselves Jeff where would

00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:34,180
people go to get a like an actual logo

00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:36,480
and people just have to kind of print

00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:38,870
their own there is an officially blessed

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,889
source to get

00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:41,889
[Music]

00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:52,900
okay so I yeah I so there is a place to

00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:54,220
get an official version of the logo I

00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:58,540
haven't been on board long enough to

00:03:54,220 --> 00:04:02,470
actually get a new logo source request

00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:04,989
but I guess there is one so websites

00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:07,750
products product packaging documentation

00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:08,890
and advertising is you know where we

00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:11,500
want to see this displayed

00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:16,590
the idea is to is to build confidence

00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:18,310
and coverage and recognition at the logo

00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:20,620
that's what we want

00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:23,610
so why see why would people want to seek

00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:29,020
open power with certification

00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:31,120
it's the idea is everybody's product is

00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:33,850
displaying the logo it says that it's

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,669
gone through a review process it says

00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:38,320
that systems if it has to open power

00:04:36,669 --> 00:04:40,030
every logo and an operating system has

00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,039
an open power rating logo they both have

00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:43,930
the certification they're both going to

00:04:42,039 --> 00:04:45,729
work together the i/o adapter if it has

00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:50,560
the the certification it'll work with

00:04:45,729 --> 00:04:52,030
the operating system in the system so

00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,820
again the criteria for the certification

00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:57,539
is is covered in the in the document at

00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:57,539
that web link

00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:05,460
so the different categories our systems

00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:07,020
aisle adapters capi adapters capi 1.0

00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:10,080
which is pretty much one sees

00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:11,070
end-of-life capi 2.0 which is still

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:15,710
around on power 9

00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:17,850
capi 3.0 software operating systems

00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:22,290
toolchain application and software

00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:24,510
applications so this is sort of a

00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:29,790
high-level view of what the criteria for

00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:31,710
certification is for for systems

00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:34,140
so obviously this if it's a system it

00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:36,870
needs to have a processor in it that

00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:38,610
supports the power instruction set

00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:42,140
architecture basically a power 8 of

00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:44,100
power 9 power 9 prime power 10 processor

00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:45,810
it should have a piece of the system

00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:47,970
should have a PCI bus on it connected to

00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:49,650
the processor the processor has a PCI

00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:53,010
bus but the system needs to support a

00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:57,570
PCI attached adapter needs to have a

00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:59,010
boot management chip that's required for

00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:00,810
the processor to come out of reset it

00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:05,100
has to have either a B M C or some

00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:08,220
customers actually use FPGAs it has to

00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:10,169
have a system level X Emma XML file now

00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:11,640
all these things are not required it

00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:13,380
just needs to be a sub subset of these

00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:16,080
things it's not required to have an XML

00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:18,030
file to build your host boot code but

00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:21,300
it's just one thing that says this

00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:24,390
follow the open power open power

00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:26,040
ecosystem methodology but if you decided

00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:27,990
not to have an XML file it doesn't

00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:31,890
preclude you from getting the open power

00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:34,440
ready certification the system should

00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:37,050
support opal the open power abstraction

00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:39,180
layer should have at least one boot

00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:42,600
device either local or saying the stat

00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:48,780
stand attached storage or support a

00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:50,760
pixie boot it should support an

00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:52,890
operating system I know that might

00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:54,360
preclude some people but again not

00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:55,979
everything is required I do think your

00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:59,820
system could be open power certified if

00:06:55,979 --> 00:07:03,180
you'd like and should run some sort of

00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:05,669
exercise or either HDX suspend some sort

00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:08,599
of exercise or to say that that you know

00:07:05,669 --> 00:07:08,599
the system is functional

00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:14,280
so the criteria for open power radii

00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:18,720
adapters it's pretty basic just needs to

00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:23,220
be a PCI supported PCI gen3 for power

00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:27,990
eight and four for power nine this also

00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:32,580
implies PCI Gen 1 to support is also

00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:34,620
supported and the device needs to plug

00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:36,690
in to an open power ready system so if

00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,650
you have an open power rating system you

00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:39,090
want to have an open power already

00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:41,190
adapter you need to demonstrate that

00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:45,180
that adapter works in at least one open

00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:46,260
power recertified system so I don't

00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:49,770
think there's really any point in doing

00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:52,170
than to copy 1.0 let's pretty much old

00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:54,690
news capi 2.0 which is supported on

00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:57,570
power 9 it supports it needs to plug

00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:59,310
into a PCI 10 for physical layer there

00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:02,910
needs to be host boot code to configure

00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:03,720
the adapter there's some other documents

00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:06,540
that are in the open power

00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:11,100
recertification document that port that

00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:13,950
point to what an open copy or a copy to

00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:17,070
Paulino device needs to be capable of

00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:19,380
and those things sort of a there are web

00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:22,050
links within the open power ready

00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:26,870
certification document so there's lots

00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:29,460
of and then of course open capping

00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:34,010
basically the same thing obviously open

00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:36,770
capi has its own custom physical there

00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:40,640
but the other requirements are the same

00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:40,640
host boot to configure it

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:49,189
any questions operating systems so the

00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:51,350
operating system this might be an area

00:08:49,189 --> 00:08:55,160
where we could maybe do a little bit

00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:57,230
more defining for our third pass of the

00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:59,059
open power rating criteria document this

00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:00,319
is a pretty basic requirement just

00:08:59,059 --> 00:09:02,809
basically says that the operating system

00:09:00,319 --> 00:09:10,249
needs to boot up and run on an open

00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:12,019
power rating system but are there as

00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:14,179
anyone ever had any problems with an

00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:16,209
open power with an operating system

00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:18,529
running on an open power rating system I

00:09:16,209 --> 00:09:21,040
had to see the audience with at least

00:09:18,529 --> 00:09:21,040
one question

00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:47,790
furgus

00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:57,329
so you're referring to our issue with

00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:59,399
GPUs so I I think maybe that's something

00:09:57,329 --> 00:10:01,860
that we could look at exploring you know

00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:06,360
adding that Jeff what he's talking about

00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:10,319
is so Tim works for rap is you know the

00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:11,100
chief engineer for raptor and he has a

00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:14,399
big problem

00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:15,810
with his basically desktop systems his

00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,089
customers don't want to have to plug in

00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:19,649
a serial console to manage the system so

00:10:18,089 --> 00:10:22,769
he would like to have he would like

00:10:19,649 --> 00:10:25,110
there to be some way where the monitor

00:10:22,769 --> 00:10:26,790
lights up very early in the IPL process

00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:29,459
and would display sort of a petit boug

00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:30,870
menu where they couldn't then install

00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:34,769
the operating system without having to

00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:37,470
plug in another another manager another

00:10:34,769 --> 00:10:40,649
management console so would that qualify

00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:43,800
but you know is that a bar that we could

00:10:40,649 --> 00:10:45,680
someday maybe create for GPUs to be open

00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:48,740
power rating

00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,740
[Music]

00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:11,840
that logo or basically sync this part

00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:31,580
if we say it was properly expected the

00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:33,350
same day same ease and use expert

00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,800
configuration steps they just work

00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:37,000
together

00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,000
so I guess

00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:51,889
the figuration departments literally

00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:51,889
posted a training system

00:11:56,259 --> 00:11:59,709
both parts

00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,220
[Music]

00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:24,959
[Music]

00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:24,959
I press the pulses

00:13:40,689 --> 00:13:49,149
you know we can always provide this

00:13:45,169 --> 00:13:49,149
definition and that's the

00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:58,610
so you know I'm very familiar with with

00:13:56,810 --> 00:14:00,440
Tim's pain points and I know this is one

00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:01,580
of his most painful pain points and I

00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,320
think it's probably gonna be one of the

00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:06,620
tougher ones one of the tougher nuts to

00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:07,850
crack one of the maybe easier ones

00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:10,130
though was another one of your pain

00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:11,720
points I think you discovered a bug in

00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:14,540
one of the Linux distros with the AMD

00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:16,730
GPU it was a Linux distro that we said

00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:18,560
was open power ready certified a very

00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:21,230
very limited simple test would have

00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:25,490
found this bug in the distro on the

00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:27,740
power platform so I guess sort of a

00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:29,920
question there maybe an easier problem

00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:33,320
to solve is there any way we can do a

00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:35,540
little bit more testing of our distros

00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:37,670
on power before we say it's open power

00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:39,650
ready not just boots up and we see a

00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:42,290
login prompt IBM obviously doesn't a lot

00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:43,910
more testing on its things before it

00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:45,920
sells on IBM we'll make sure that if it

00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:47,450
sells it we tested it on all these i/o

00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,160
adapters but if we're going to say a

00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:52,430
distro has an open power ready

00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:54,800
certification is there maybe not just

00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:57,040
testing it on IBM's adapters but testing

00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,040
it on

00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,799
[Music]

00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:13,760
could be

00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:44,570
you are right

00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:53,779
[Music]

00:15:50,889 --> 00:15:57,529
don't have a solution for that and if we

00:15:53,779 --> 00:16:01,660
make it too granular is make them lose

00:15:57,529 --> 00:16:01,660
its meaning completely but it

00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:26,100
well please join the workgroup you gave

00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,100
it the office

00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:44,750
some of the district

00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:04,970
yeah sorry I think the question there

00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:06,620
would be what you know who certifies the

00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:10,160
operating system to be open power ready

00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:13,069
and I obviously should know this but you

00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,209
know what is the what is the entity that

00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:16,220
does it I think we kind of ride along

00:17:14,209 --> 00:17:18,290
IBM's the operating systems kind of ride

00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:19,970
ideas coattails because if IBM sells it

00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:22,160
and supports it IBM did a whole bunch of

00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:24,500
testing on it but if a new distro comes

00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,720
out and it's not on IBM's list of

00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:28,700
distros that it supports but our Linux

00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:31,670
guys think it should work and it kind of

00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:39,740
does work we think we go ahead and give

00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:40,970
it the logo but really no I certainly

00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:43,930
wouldn't I certainly wouldn't

00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:43,930
uncertified

00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:10,160
[Music]

00:18:11,289 --> 00:18:16,309
but well IDM didn't do an open open

00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:17,539
power ready certification IBM did a this

00:18:16,309 --> 00:18:53,960
is ready to be sold to a customer

00:18:17,539 --> 00:18:56,990
certification I mean that IBM and we'll

00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:58,700
look at it maybe that's something that

00:18:56,990 --> 00:19:00,559
we could add to the to the criteria our

00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:02,149
willingness to look at issues as they

00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:04,419
arrive I don't know I don't think that's

00:19:02,149 --> 00:19:04,419
in there

00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:19,660
you're a contestant

00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:42,159
okay oh good discussion so software tool

00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:45,070
chains there's a document that specifies

00:19:42,159 --> 00:19:47,139
that it's it's reference in the open

00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:49,200
power ready certification document which

00:19:47,139 --> 00:19:51,729
is there's a link for that in here

00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:54,729
applications again pointing to a couple

00:19:51,729 --> 00:19:58,320
more documents which are in the

00:19:54,729 --> 00:20:00,729
certification document and then once

00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:03,100
someone has a product an operating

00:20:00,729 --> 00:20:06,009
system adapter system that they want to

00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:08,799
certify there's a link and the open

00:20:06,009 --> 00:20:10,509
power foundation to to submit to fill

00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:13,659
out and submit it and then that comes to

00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:15,429
me and we review it and actually we

00:20:13,659 --> 00:20:19,690
reviewed one today and approved it for

00:20:15,429 --> 00:20:22,629
four inspir and open power Brady

00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:24,039
workgroup gym recently joined we're glad

00:20:22,629 --> 00:20:25,269
to have you on board anyone else that's

00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:27,249
interested in joining again we're

00:20:25,269 --> 00:20:33,099
looking to encourage membership from

00:20:27,249 --> 00:20:35,919
non-ibm people yes so that's an easy way

00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:37,509
to join there and the workgroup

00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,999
activities again that's what we talked

00:20:37,509 --> 00:20:42,629
about in this pitch promote product

00:20:39,999 --> 00:20:45,340
certification defined requirements

00:20:42,629 --> 00:20:49,210
maintain the resource catalog certify

00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:52,179
new products and hold monthly meetings

00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:55,929
which I've been negligent on but hope to

00:20:52,179 --> 00:20:58,440
fix that very soon and that's it any

00:20:55,929 --> 00:20:58,440
more questions

00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,679
kuchi

00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:16,669
already teaching I think it's a Klaus

00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:20,520
the intentions that have an intermediate

00:21:16,669 --> 00:21:23,010
place between operating system and

00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:27,419
application right I mean you have to

00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:31,140
contemplate that an application is built

00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:40,320
with a tool chain compiler in particular

00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:43,350
it's been an environment if you went

00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:48,210
straight from if you went straight from

00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:50,900
advocare from application to OS you

00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:55,400
would lose sort of that ability to

00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:55,400
perhaps those around

00:21:55,830 --> 00:22:06,920
[Music]

00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:44,849
[Music]

00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:53,509
[Music]

00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:13,570
if it were ran run on a virtual

00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:15,399
virtualized yeah it would still be it

00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:17,440
could still be certified bare metals not

00:23:15,399 --> 00:23:19,259
a requirement virtualized operating

00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:34,509
system not a requirement they're both

00:23:19,259 --> 00:23:35,979
possibilities but if we had a hypervisor

00:23:34,509 --> 00:23:38,710
when we had an operating system running

00:23:35,979 --> 00:23:40,419
on it would we not certify it if we had

00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:43,570
a hypervisor and an operating system

00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:44,529
running on it would that not be I think

00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:46,889
the problem is we don't have a

00:23:44,529 --> 00:23:46,889
hypervisor

00:23:56,450 --> 00:24:00,530
we haven't had that

00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:22,380
sure but what we're talking about here

00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:26,490
is open power certification sure you can

00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:28,620
have the post image if you want to call

00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:30,750
it that right the bare metal operating

00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:35,610
system providing services to do less

00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:37,680
than are necessarily thinking about the

00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:41,730
bare metal image and IO is a great place

00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:46,160
right back to make it right and only has

00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:50,280
riders or virtualize sorts of i/o in the

00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:51,770
moments back so so back you know back to

00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:54,650
the question we've only known

00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:57,630
certification of bare metal environments

00:24:54,650 --> 00:25:00,870
KB enemy you could argue is just an

00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:04,080
application by itself but we not put in

00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:14,070
you know the idea of a hosted or a

00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:16,770
virtual on top of my head whatever body

00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:23,480
this is necessarily other than more

00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:23,480
information details but London

00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:32,390
is KVM open power already that we have

00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:35,410
is that certified is that in the

00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:35,410
resource I should know this

00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:04,830
well yeah that's I told this to Jeff all

00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:06,330
the time and I'm sure you're sick of

00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:08,789
hearing it but I'm a hardware guy that's

00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:10,740
not my area of expertise and that's why

00:26:08,789 --> 00:26:13,669
I rely heavily on Jeff stop and it's

00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:13,669
very much appreciated

00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:42,390
[Music]

00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:08,840
all interesting topics for workgroup

00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:13,860
meetings any more questions

00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:15,270
what's your workgroup maybe maybe I'll

00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:20,940
learn something definitely I would learn

00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:25,009
a lot so okay anymore all right thanks
