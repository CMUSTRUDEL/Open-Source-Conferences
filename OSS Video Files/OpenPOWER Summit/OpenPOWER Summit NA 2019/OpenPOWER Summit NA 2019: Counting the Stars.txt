Publication date: 2019-08-28
Playlist: OpenPOWER Summit NA 2019
Description: 
	Presented by Jez Wain, Atos 

There are 200 billion stars in the Milky Way. The European Space Agency's Gaia project has mapped about 1% of them. The stars now need to be classified in much the same way as we classify animals and plants. Atos working with the University of Geneva has investigated the use of machine learning to help with this classification problem. Jez's talk describes the Gaia project before presenting the approach taken to construct and optimize a neural network capable of classifying the different star types. The techniques used are applicable to many different supervised machine learning problems. The talk will conclude with the initial results and a look towards future work.
