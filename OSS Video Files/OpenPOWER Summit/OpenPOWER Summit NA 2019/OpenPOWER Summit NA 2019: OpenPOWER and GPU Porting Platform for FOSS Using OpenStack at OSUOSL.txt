Publication date: 2019-08-28
Playlist: OpenPOWER Summit NA 2019
Description: 
	Presented by Lance Albertson, OSU Open Source Lab

The Oregon State University Open Source Lab (OSUOSL) works closely with Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) projects to provide them with a stable environment to improve their OpenPOWER porting needs. Since 2011, we’ve deployed and managed an OpenStack cluster powered by POWER9 and POWER8) used by over 100 projects. In this talk we will describe the technical challenges we have faced from setting up the initial cluster, to managing new users’ needs, tooling involved for managing the system, upgrading OpenStack and its components and other related topics. In addition, we’ll discuss a continuous integration platform we deployed which includes access to Nvidia GPU hardware along with a few other new services that are upcoming.
