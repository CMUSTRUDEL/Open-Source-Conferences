	Presented by Brian Pan, H3 Platform Inc. 

H3 Platform will talk about their Composable AI box â€“ Falcon II. This is the 1 st PCIe Gen4 Fabric GPU box, and could connect with Power 9 server, the only model with PCIe 4.0 capability, as a GPU expansion box. Falcon II could load up to sixteen GPGPUs and share the GPGPU up to four Power 9 servers. With the dynamical allocation capability, &nbsp;Falcon II could compose systems with different GPGPU and host ratio to meet the different resource requirement of AI applications. For example, 16 GPGPUs to 1 Power 9 server, 2 groups of 8 GPGPUs to 1 Power 9 server, and 4 groups of 4 GPGPUs to 1 Power 9 server.
