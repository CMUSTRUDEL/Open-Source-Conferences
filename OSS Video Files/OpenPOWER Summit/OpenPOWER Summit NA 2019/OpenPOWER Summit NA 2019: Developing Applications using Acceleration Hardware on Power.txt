Title: OpenPOWER Summit NA 2019: Developing Applications using Acceleration Hardware on Power
Publication date: 2019-08-20
Playlist: OpenPOWER Summit NA 2019
Description: 
	Presented by Gerrit Huizenga, IBM

This session will share the goals of the newly chartered Accelerated Application Ecosystem Working Group, which will help identify resources needed when porting accelerated applications to Power specific hardware accelerators.  This session will provide an overview of some of the available accelerators, some of the existing porting resources, and solicit information from ISVs and software developers on any gaps in the software ecosystem today.

so I blamed you for me being up here oh

00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:09,300
wait there's Jeff he's back so open

00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:12,960
power Foundation recently set up a

00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:15,630
charter for a new work group that's the

00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,609
accelerated application ecosystem work

00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:21,090
group say that three times really fast

00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:23,609
and I get dizzy the whole point of this

00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:25,800
is to look at all the things like GPUs

00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:28,050
FPGA is open cap et cetera that's coming

00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,699
along and figure out how to translate

00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,000
all this cool hardware stuff in the

00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:34,290
stuff that software folks can understand

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,280
there's a lot of documentation on some

00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:37,320
of this but there aren't a lot of

00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,399
libraries and that sort of thing so I'll

00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,780
tell you a little bit about what the

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,780
goals are as we go through here but

00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:46,710
that's kind of a very high level

00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:48,420
presentation to get started we are newly

00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,969
charted one of the goals will be to of

00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:53,760
course identify which accelerators are

00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:55,890
in scope the answer at the moment is

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,890
everything that's not on the core more

00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:02,460
or less so that's a lot of stuff

00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:04,229
potentially we are trying to look to

00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:07,010
connect with some ISPs on this there are

00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:09,180
a few ISPs that have actually done some

00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:11,369
software development around accelerators

00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:13,830
there are more universities probably

00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:16,350
that have done work there but the goal

00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:17,970
is to broaden that entire ecosystem and

00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:19,920
pulling the is V so the goal is to

00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:21,869
connect them to the knowledge that they

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,920
need to have we obviously need to

00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:24,810
understand a few things about the

00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,729
existing accelerators like are there

00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:28,890
common patterns in what the accelerators

00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:31,409
do are there common libraries that

00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:32,700
should be used that sort of thing we

00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:37,250
need to know what porting resources

00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:40,380
there are and the the kind of stage two

00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:42,000
is to actually generate an ISP survey

00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,680
process I'll tell you that the group

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,689
that's formed on this didn't really want

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,000
to spend any time on the chartering work

00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:49,979
or on the survey process they just want

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,970
to get to work and fix the problem but

00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:53,100
we're trying to stay a little bit

00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:58,079
ordered here and I think it's gonna be

00:01:53,100 --> 00:02:00,869
for the better in the long term so me

00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:02,280
this will be short I do have one story I

00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:04,680
don't know if any of you remember I've

00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,910
heard of the backs eleven seven eighty I

00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:10,440
used to work at Purdue University and

00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:11,819
our hardware guys opened up the cover

00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,110
one day and said boy there's a lot of

00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:15,600
extra wires in here

00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:17,820
I could put a sidecar on maybe like

00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:19,470
another process or even in fact maybe

00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:20,790
we've got a processor here from one of

00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:23,880
our other machines to die let's see we

00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:26,550
can wire it in they did the wiring in I

00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:31,250
did the software for a lot of that first

00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:33,660
bsd version to support SMP actually and

00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:35,940
it's probably not a lot different than

00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:37,980
adding GPUs and FPGAs today I've been

00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:40,560
doing this kind of stuff for a while

00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:42,030
look at all these extra wires pins on

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,700
the socket whatever it might be it's a

00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:47,160
little different but I've been doing

00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:50,090
stuff like this for a long time both as

00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:51,930
a driver person and a few other things

00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:54,989
also is one of the architects for the

00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:56,610
Linux for the LTC and one of the

00:02:54,989 --> 00:02:58,350
architects when IBM started to get

00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:03,450
involved in cloud so I've been around a

00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:04,980
block or two it just got I said who

00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:06,540
wants to be the next chair for this

00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:08,640
workgroup everybody else jumped back

00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:12,600
from the phone and so I was left holding

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:16,410
the mic so you get to hear from me about

00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:19,010
some of this this is not my forte though

00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:21,000
in the common sense of the open power

00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:22,260
accelerators right now so I'm coming up

00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,780
to speed we've got some really good

00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:26,580
people that are involved on our

00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:29,700
workgroup they've got a lot more

00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:31,350
awareness of some of the capi open capi

00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:34,500
work that's going on some of the FPGA

00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:37,200
work so this is going to be a synthesis

00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,549
of some of the experts along with some

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,750
of those things that I do or can bring

00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:44,489
to the team this is and I'm going to

00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:46,410
show you a few of these slides are just

00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:47,580
kind of taken out of our chartering

00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:49,799
documents and that sort of thing so

00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:52,920
there's nothing nothing too fancy in

00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:54,299
here but we are basically going to try

00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:57,930
to collect all the information that

00:03:54,299 --> 00:04:00,150
relates to accelerators put it somewhere

00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:03,510
where you can get a fingertip guide to

00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:05,880
it if you're a developer and provide as

00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:08,130
much as we can in terms of resources to

00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:10,680
enable people to make use of these

00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:12,420
accelerators they're pretty clearly I

00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,730
think if you're here you at this summit

00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:17,130
in general you've heard open Cappy

00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:20,579
you've heard accelerators FPGA GPU it's

00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:22,020
definitely the big wave here it is and I

00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:23,889
think the way I saw it presented is it's

00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:26,490
the way to get past von neumann's

00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:29,110
and limitations on the on the

00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:31,180
infrastructure out there today so I

00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:35,560
think this is actually going to be very

00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:37,240
valuable there's a bunch of steps and

00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,500
this this is a laundry list I don't want

00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:44,229
to read a laundry list to you I'll leave

00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:46,599
it out there but one of the big initial

00:04:44,229 --> 00:04:49,629
steps is to put together this is V

00:04:46,599 --> 00:04:51,340
survey and there's a lot of questions

00:04:49,629 --> 00:04:54,729
that have come up on our working groups

00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:56,699
so far about what ISPs need to know

00:04:54,729 --> 00:04:59,860
there's some that are very technical

00:04:56,699 --> 00:05:03,159
like what is the open capi spec where do

00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:05,020
I get hardware what types of API is what

00:05:03,159 --> 00:05:06,340
I need to use there's some that have

00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:09,969
come up that are a lot what I'll call

00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:12,219
softer or on the marketing side like why

00:05:09,969 --> 00:05:14,590
would I want to use an accelerator what

00:05:12,219 --> 00:05:16,719
markets might I be after if I'm using an

00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:18,550
accelerator what workloads would

00:05:16,719 --> 00:05:20,770
actually run better if I were using an

00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:22,810
accelerator so we're going to try to get

00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:25,270
into some of those questions and kind of

00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:28,060
it I'll say a little bit a higher level

00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:31,389
view of how to how to address some of

00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:32,560
those one of the goals here is to put

00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:34,479
together this survey and I'll show you

00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,240
kind of a preview of it that we've we've

00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:40,090
got started but we'd like to have a few

00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:42,219
ISPs participating with us in generating

00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:43,840
the questionnaire so we've got actual

00:05:42,219 --> 00:05:45,550
detailed insights from people that are

00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,690
actually trying to do this but then we

00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:49,060
want to be able to go out and we're

00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:50,889
gonna look for references for key ISPs

00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:52,479
they could go answer that's with us

00:05:50,889 --> 00:05:54,069
probably in a sit down session where we

00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,599
can say here are the kind of questions

00:05:54,069 --> 00:05:57,849
we're working through what's your take

00:05:55,599 --> 00:06:00,520
on this what do you need try to get real

00:05:57,849 --> 00:06:01,690
customer driven input about what needs

00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:06,759
to happen here for the accelerator

00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:08,169
working accelerated applications there's

00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:10,419
a bunch of stuff in here summarized

00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:12,610
disposition prioritize the requirements

00:06:10,419 --> 00:06:15,310
Jeff has made it very clear that we need

00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:16,930
to share our findings perhaps more

00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:19,840
broadly within the open power foundation

00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:21,990
as we generate them so if somebody says

00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,520
y'all this accelerator stuff is great

00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:26,580
you got everything on open cap III that

00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:29,289
oh but I can't find anything about FPGAs

00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:31,000
then we're gonna prioritize around FPGAs

00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:32,680
right we're gonna get that input and

00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,190
actually make decisions there we might

00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:36,290
take some of it back to other

00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:38,330
working groups within the open power

00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:41,390
foundation so if the open copy group is

00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:42,830
doing a bunch of work maybe we'll just

00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:44,270
say here's what we learned from the ISPs

00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:46,430
you might want to figure out how to

00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:47,990
handle this or we might find out that

00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:49,430
it's really a software issue or maybe

00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,960
there's an open source community we need

00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:52,370
to interlock with and see if we can

00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,200
bring some things on board so it's it's

00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:56,060
kind of open up in the air at the moment

00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,800
is - exactly how we get to our end goal

00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:59,540
but our end goal is pretty clear right

00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,910
we want to get a lot of input on how to

00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:03,500
get there and I think we've got some of

00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:06,560
the right people participating to help

00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:10,610
with that that's probably good enough

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,420
there so I just mentioned we might be

00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:13,430
working with other working groups

00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:16,640
there's a subset of the ones we expect

00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:18,730
we'll be working with a lot of those I

00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:20,480
think are represented here I'm actually

00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:22,070
joining some of those other working

00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,570
groups right now as an observer to try

00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:27,260
to pull data from them to be able to

00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:30,200
kind of collect and collate information

00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:33,800
we might need but that's that's kind of

00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:38,270
a high-level go there our working group

00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:41,419
today is small we get quorum most of the

00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:44,690
time we're working on building that out

00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:46,310
but we are looking for people

00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:47,570
individuals that are active in some of

00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:51,350
the other working groups to help cross

00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:53,210
pollinate we are looking for members who

00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:54,830
are looking to broaden the ecosystem

00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:57,530
maybe to help sell product help bring

00:07:54,830 --> 00:08:03,470
ISPs on board for their own their own

00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:05,570
custom hardware we are looking most most

00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:07,160
of all for ISPs right that's going to be

00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:08,270
where the prime input is and that's

00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:11,540
going to be the prime measure of our

00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:13,070
success over time is how many software

00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:16,460
applications we can bring to the

00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:18,470
accelerated ecosystem and then we've got

00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:19,820
also the whole open source community

00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:21,770
sign that's where I've got some tie-ins

00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:23,990
today as well

00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:26,540
you know how to how to get them some of

00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:28,760
the information how to get them maybe

00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:31,520
access to hardware so they can do test

00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:33,620
and development may be figuring out

00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,060
which libraries may need some interfaces

00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:38,349
put in or some standardization of

00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:38,349
interfaces that sort of thing

00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:41,570
so apparently deliverable is this

00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:44,839
questionnaire which I already talked

00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:47,810
about I'm expecting also one of our big

00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:50,700
deliverables will be a

00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:54,480
one place to go one place to find

00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:56,190
information you know at worst case it's

00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,630
one of those sites that you go to that

00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:59,760
just has links to a thousand other

00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:01,020
places at least it's all in one I'm

00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,730
hoping it's gonna be a lot better than

00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:05,280
that I'm going to show you at the end of

00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:07,560
this another project that I've worked on

00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:09,530
that's similar there's some overlap but

00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:12,600
I'll show you kind of what we did there

00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:16,200
building up the power ecosystem not

00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:17,400
specific to accelerators we're gonna do

00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,990
a working list of the identified

00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:21,600
requirements so we're gonna synthesize

00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:23,810
all the input from our ISPs into what is

00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,580
hopefully a prioritized list some clear

00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:29,690
clear direction on what we need to do to

00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:32,720
make this ecosystem better overall and

00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:34,740
there's a chance that we might identify

00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:38,160
other working groups that need to be

00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:42,030
chartered we have one very vocal member

00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:43,950
that's very interested in the chip on

00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:45,180
chip optimization some of the special

00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,290
instructions that are out there and how

00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:48,420
they're not very well documented

00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:49,920
compared to what Intel does that's

00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:51,720
actually at the moment outside of scope

00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,460
I'll talk to that for in just a moment a

00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,720
little bit more but that might be

00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,760
something that we want to do separately

00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:02,670
from what we're doing in this working

00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:04,410
group so this is almost a repeat but

00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:06,510
it's again this is the kind of the

00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:11,310
activities that we'll be doing in kind

00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:12,810
of a in order sort of flow so we're

00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:13,860
doing right now the definitions and

00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:16,200
trying to plan what the interview is

00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:18,540
going to look like we're gonna then look

00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:21,180
for is vs so if you are an ISP in this

00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:23,760
room I would love to talk to you after

00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:26,310
this session if you know of an ISV

00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,660
please connect them to myself or to Jeff

00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:29,390
or somebody on the technical steering

00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:31,260
committee and we'll get them brought in

00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:33,510
because we definitely want to get that

00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:36,300
kind of input and then we want to

00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:37,500
summarize all of that and we're instead

00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:40,260
of positioning we're going to

00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:41,430
disposition the is V input and then of

00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:43,650
course we're going to publicize and

00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:45,990
share what we find so we're not we are

00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:49,140
actually a Jeff correct me here we're a

00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:50,830
public workgroup what's our public

00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:53,980
workgroup

00:10:50,830 --> 00:11:01,690
so we can share the outcome of most

00:10:53,980 --> 00:11:03,850
everything that we generated cool I got

00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:04,870
to keep that in mind too good that

00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:06,339
because we will get some input

00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:08,260
occasionally from people like I have

00:11:06,339 --> 00:11:09,370
fees that will have to be clear that

00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:10,839
whatever they're giving us is non

00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:13,510
confidential that we'll be able to share

00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:15,040
it or aggregated so topics in scope

00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:18,850
development libraries Hardware API

00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:20,320
development you know I can envision this

00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:23,290
has happened in the past and as part of

00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:26,680
the kernel community that the hardware

00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:28,480
api's might really stink from a software

00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:30,459
developer perspective so there may be

00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,140
some feedback back and forth between the

00:11:30,459 --> 00:11:34,810
two on how to clean up simplify make

00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:37,410
things more accessible there's obviously

00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:40,089
some documentation I've in the past week

00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:42,610
seen more documentation and I know what

00:11:40,089 --> 00:11:43,959
to do with and if I were an ISV I

00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:46,240
wouldn't even know where to start on

00:11:43,959 --> 00:11:49,180
some of it because there's copious but

00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:51,279
not focused on developer needs at the

00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:54,070
moment it's exploiting everything about

00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:56,770
the hardware or open capi but not what

00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:59,860
do I need to do my day job so we'll try

00:11:56,770 --> 00:12:02,470
to do some some reduction of that and

00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:03,790
then there may also be you know this I

00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:05,050
kind of just threw in there because of

00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:06,370
past experience but there may be some

00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:09,279
configuration constraints on some of

00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:11,230
these accelerators you know you maybe

00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,820
can only have three FPGAs on a system or

00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:15,670
you can't do an FPGA on the same

00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:17,529
something as some other GPU you know

00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:19,180
what what these things that people need

00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:20,500
to do in there people need to know when

00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:22,750
they're configuring the hardware that

00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:26,410
are not the typical things ananias we

00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:29,380
would have to think about and those are

00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:31,990
just examples for accelerators in scope

00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:36,699
this is kind of a list that we pulled

00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:38,890
together there's probably more and if I

00:12:36,699 --> 00:12:43,930
left stuff out feel free to tell me

00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:46,029
where we aren't so so smart to think we

00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:48,279
got them all right we're always willing

00:12:46,029 --> 00:12:50,440
to get more input there there is a big

00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:52,180
category at the bottom where we all see

00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:56,279
things about accelerated storage network

00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:59,380
and memory technologies that could be a

00:12:56,279 --> 00:13:00,699
large set of things you know we're still

00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,959
kind of exploring the bounds of that I

00:13:00,699 --> 00:13:03,070
saw some more at the keynotes this

00:13:01,959 --> 00:13:05,740
morning that I hadn't

00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:10,060
prior and I'm sure that there will be

00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:11,470
more of that over time here's the stuff

00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:13,420
I referred earlier is kind of out of

00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:15,730
scope we're not going to go into things

00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:17,320
like the on ship annex accelerators and

00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:19,510
some of the specialized instructions out

00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:21,760
there so we're putting it up so it's

00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:25,540
clearly not the stuff that we're working

00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:27,040
on just to be clear on that so to give

00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:30,760
you an idea as to what we're gonna ask

00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:32,290
the ISVs and don't laugh if you see a

00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,160
silly question just tell me how to fix

00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:34,420
it

00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:38,500
well you can laugh because I might laugh

00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:39,970
with you but there are there are some

00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:42,340
classes of ifv's we've already

00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:44,830
identified there's those who've already

00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:46,990
ported an application to acts 86 or

00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:48,730
develop an application probably on x86

00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:51,520
they're using an accelerator like an

00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:54,520
FPGA or GPU and they want to bring that

00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:57,460
over to power one of the things we

00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:59,320
realized when when thinking about the

00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:01,060
questionnaire is if they've got an

00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:03,190
existing application we could run some

00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:04,600
basic tools over it like ldd and find

00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:06,310
all the symbols that they're using find

00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,900
out which libraries they're using we

00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:09,280
could get some insight to help figure

00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:12,790
out if all those things are available on

00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:16,750
power or not or what the big gaps are so

00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:18,310
a porting porting environment is

00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:19,450
probably easier to deal with than

00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:21,880
somebody that's actually starting new

00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:25,090
development on power to use an

00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:26,770
accelerator we've got some general

00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:30,130
generate questions about frameworks or

00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:31,030
programming models you know a lot of

00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:32,800
people are talking about the Aero

00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:35,020
framework for instance and what it's

00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:38,020
been enabled to do and there are a lot

00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:40,780
of instantiations of the Aero family I

00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:44,050
guess like PI arrows the Python primary

00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:46,540
connector there and I think I've got a

00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:49,180
list of those yet right here so the open

00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:51,550
ACC the CUDA environment open MP openmpi

00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:53,470
Apache Aero there's a there's going to

00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:55,180
be a series of those we're still trying

00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:58,510
to put that list together again we're

00:14:55,180 --> 00:15:00,400
taking input on that list some of those

00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:02,290
may never be accelerated some of those

00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:05,710
may just intrinsically wind up having to

00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:07,060
be accelerated I kind of mentioned this

00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:08,740
what markets would you be able to extend

00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:11,380
into if you had hardware acceleration

00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:12,730
for instance if you're in the banking

00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:15,250
industry but you want to go into Wall

00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:16,240
Street maybe a little tweak here with

00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,740
some acceleration

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,899
you get into some of the workloads there

00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:21,310
or maybe you're in one of the labs and

00:15:19,899 --> 00:15:23,410
you want to go into something in deeper

00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:26,860
HPC or research and we try to understand

00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:28,209
what markets people are after and why

00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:32,830
they would actually even want to pick up

00:15:28,209 --> 00:15:35,440
an accelerator hard question to ask or

00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:37,630
answer but what impact would this have

00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:40,330
on your market share for instance is

00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:42,550
somebody going after a market that's you

00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:44,950
know tiny tiny and they'd get access to

00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:46,240
the whole thing or is it a huge market

00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:48,790
that they're just gonna wind up opening

00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,870
up with new accelerators and maybe

00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:51,100
there's gonna be a whole bunch of

00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:52,209
players that want to get in so we're

00:15:51,100 --> 00:16:02,490
gonna try and understand where some of

00:15:52,209 --> 00:16:02,490
those coming from Jeff yep absolutely

00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,850
[Music]

00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:24,390
yeah yeah and that's one like I think I

00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:26,790
had it earlier as being a little bit

00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:28,650
challenging and I've learned

00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:29,580
historically and I doubt you'll find

00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:31,470
this amusing I've learned this by

00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:34,290
working with lawyers there's always a

00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:35,820
way to get to success it may not be the

00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:38,850
straightforward one and we'll have to

00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:40,230
figure out what that method is but it is

00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:41,580
going to be a sensitive topic there a

00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:44,160
lot of sensitive topics throughout some

00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:45,690
of this people doing an accelerator not

00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,400
on an FPGA might be competing with

00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:49,740
somebody doing we're on it with the GPU

00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:51,480
you know what do we want to share

00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:53,280
information between ISPs there do they

00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:56,790
want to talk about what markets are

00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:58,020
after etc so absolutely right there is

00:16:56,790 --> 00:17:01,020
some potential sensitive information

00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:03,780
we're putting it up here to kind of know

00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:05,069
what scope we would like to have that

00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:09,420
doesn't mean we're gonna get all of

00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:10,860
these scopes right you'll notice my

00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:13,680
bullet numbers renumber because I'm

00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:14,939
using the online PowerPoint and I

00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:18,089
couldn't figure out how to fix that but

00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:19,800
the numbers don't matter what markets

00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:21,959
can you not address today that you could

00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:23,490
if you had accelerated open power

00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:25,290
what are your perceived technical

00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:26,699
inhibitors so some of these questions

00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:29,970
are gonna be more focused some are gonna

00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:31,560
be more essay questions because

00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:33,360
sometimes we don't know what question we

00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:35,430
should ask but the ISP knows what

00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,080
statement they want to tell us right so

00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:38,430
we're gonna be kind of prepared for that

00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:40,340
and the essay questions might be a way

00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:42,810
to get there

00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:44,700
what are your perceived business

00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:46,680
inhibiters you know it could be anything

00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:49,050
could be from cost easy availability

00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:51,840
could be open source libraries could be

00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:54,030
all kinds of stuff which accelerators

00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,380
have as an individual is be considered

00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:57,150
so he told you which ones are in scope

00:17:55,380 --> 00:18:01,770
but kind of curious which is bees are

00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:03,540
planetís which accelerators what

00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:05,310
software package do you know enable

00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:07,260
those accelerators so there's some open

00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:10,340
capi stuff going on some software side

00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:13,200
there but is there much for FPGAs today

00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:16,110
some people say no some people say not

00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,700
at all some people say nothing okay

00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:19,470
those are all the same aren't they I

00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:22,110
guess there isn't a lot today for open

00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:25,050
FPGAs so you know we want to find out

00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:26,040
what the end user thinks is the case for

00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:27,210
some of these as well they may have

00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,290
found a treasure trove from the

00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:29,610
university that was working

00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:33,780
something and maybe that's what we need

00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:35,280
to be working with a little bit of again

00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:37,260
more on market segments there's a lot of

00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,400
ways we talked about it and where this

00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,630
will probably come down to one or two

00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,100
questions when we're all finished but

00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:43,290
we're trying to think about this and

00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:44,670
kind of a holistic you know what are we

00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:47,160
trying to solve and what things do we

00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:51,420
really need so that's kind of the core

00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:52,590
of the the contents the goal is to get

00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:54,630
some input from the hardware

00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:56,340
acceleration manufacturers so some of

00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:58,740
the people that are typically here today

00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:59,610
you know the play this and in fact what

00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:02,130
I've seen with the open powder

00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:05,220
foundation is there's a heavy hardware

00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:08,760
centric basis to the group today right

00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:10,950
and that that's great for getting

00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:12,950
Hardware documentation that's not so

00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:15,330
great for the software people sometimes

00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:17,100
but we still need that input we need to

00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:20,850
know what they're building how they're

00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:22,320
doing it what the gaps are but we also

00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:25,230
need to put from the ISPs we talked

00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,700
about both those that are using them and

00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:28,020
those are thinking about using them

00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,580
they're going to be two wildly different

00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:31,050
sets those that have practical

00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:33,420
information versus those that have

00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:34,680
perceptions and sometimes the

00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:36,120
perceptions are the rule when you're

00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,020
dealing or the perceptions or the

00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,580
reality when you're dealing with

00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:40,380
something like this if they think it's

00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:42,180
impossible they'll treat it as

00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:46,800
impossible and we have to change the

00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:48,480
perception input from performance teams

00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:50,190
using accelerators so this all goes to

00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:53,070
the why would I use an accelerator and

00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:55,260
I've already seen a bunch of like even

00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:56,970
this morning some charts about power

00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:58,620
benefits from Hardware changes from

00:19:56,970 --> 00:20:00,030
using some of the accelerators I've seen

00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:02,040
a lot of stuff with open copy and the

00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:04,950
numbers how much additional bandwidth

00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:07,500
you can get some of that needs to be

00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:09,180
wrapped up I don't want to say in a

00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:11,430
marketing form I'm not a marketing guy

00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:13,710
and I never will be apologies to you

00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:15,900
those of you who are I'm a techie I want

00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:17,640
to know why would I do this what's it

00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:20,670
going to make faster right am I gonna

00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:22,920
get a 20% boost over Intel am I gonna

00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:25,440
get a 50% boost am I going to get a 10x

00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:27,840
boost and that's where Chris Sullivan

00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,250
isn't here is he today and I don't see

00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,230
him yeah

00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:33,900
Chris Chris does a really good job of

00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:36,510
this with GPUs and training of cognitive

00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:39,060
and he's got numbers that show 10x

00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:40,440
performance on power and say wow this is

00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:41,230
great but we want to be able to have

00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,880
information

00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:44,140
like that when we're talking to ISPs and

00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:47,919
say here's why you might want to be

00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:49,660
using this accelerator a lot of the work

00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:52,720
today of a softer side is being done by

00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:54,010
researchers obviously we need to pick

00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,360
their brains and figure out what they're

00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:56,320
learning cuz they're gonna have some

00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,980
really good input they're both

00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:02,919
experiencial and theoretical and then

00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:07,230
obviously generate some priorities based

00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:11,309
on all of that so if we're successful

00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:13,299
the next chart is a blue sky was not no

00:21:11,309 --> 00:21:18,400
I'm gonna give you an example in a

00:21:13,299 --> 00:21:20,890
minute part of my role today inside of

00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,390
IBM is the Linux power ecosystem it

00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:25,570
didn't have the word accelerators in it

00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:27,429
until Jeff came along but a lot of what

00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:29,530
we do is enabling ISPs to operate on

00:21:27,429 --> 00:21:32,049
power we do a lot of porting of open

00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:34,240
source applications we look at this

00:21:32,049 --> 00:21:36,370
through the lens of cognitive or through

00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,169
cloud or through whatever else is going

00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:39,970
on we've got a bunch of open source

00:21:38,169 --> 00:21:43,690
database work that we've been involved

00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:46,330
in and how many of you were power

00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:50,290
developers users back before a little

00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:52,179
endian anybody in here how many of you

00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:56,679
can remember trying to find information

00:21:52,179 --> 00:21:59,110
back then about power a lot of blank

00:21:56,679 --> 00:22:02,590
looks Oh Jeff remembers because he added

00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:04,120
all of his fingertips right we did a

00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:08,049
bunch of work when I first took over

00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:11,020
this role and we found something like 30

00:22:08,049 --> 00:22:14,290
sites probably 28 of which were hosted

00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:18,130
at IBM somewhere too that weren't that

00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:19,330
said oh you've come to the power portal

00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:21,880
this is where you will learn everything

00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:23,500
you need to know about power and each

00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:26,049
one of them had about four links and

00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:28,030
maybe one blurb based on whichever group

00:22:26,049 --> 00:22:30,580
they were put out by finding information

00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:32,700
was a nightmare finding any of those on

00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:36,340
Google or your favorite search engine

00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:38,020
you had to go to page 8 on Google how

00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:40,299
many people ever go to page 8 on Google

00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:43,120
yeah I mean either if it's not on page

00:22:40,299 --> 00:22:45,820
one or maybe page - if I'm desperate it

00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:48,160
doesn't exist right so we spent a lot of

00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:50,290
time trying to bring and coalesce all

00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:52,150
this information to a single spot we

00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:53,510
tried to figure out what developers

00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:55,760
needed to know

00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:59,480
and get that information front and

00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:00,679
center we think based on the work we did

00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,660
there we succeed and we're actually

00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:05,360
doing a design thinking session with a

00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:06,890
bunch of our kind of key input people to

00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:09,169
figure out where to go with that next I

00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:10,880
think from an IBM side some of this

00:23:09,169 --> 00:23:12,890
acceleration will actually go into there

00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:15,350
but I don't think that's the answer for

00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:17,090
the vision of working group success here

00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:19,179
I think that's a supplemental piece of

00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:21,380
information but we'll we'll work on that

00:23:19,179 --> 00:23:22,940
one thing I can say is it should have

00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:25,160
all the collective documentation that's

00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:26,929
necessary for software developers it

00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:29,990
should have kind of an ecosystem jump

00:23:26,929 --> 00:23:32,150
off point so it might point to

00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:33,679
University Research work to say here's

00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:35,780
the stuff that backs up the fact that

00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:38,210
this FPGA can give you a 10x improvement

00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:39,290
in this algorithm right that's kind of

00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:43,400
stuff people might want to be able to

00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:45,320
find easily examples blogs lengths other

00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,940
documentation that's you know always

00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:49,400
useful if your developer having a code

00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:50,750
snippet is sometimes worth gold it's

00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,880
better than that reading a 300-page

00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:55,250
document on how to program something

00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:57,049
right that that one little snippet can

00:23:55,250 --> 00:24:00,350
tell you everything you might need if

00:23:57,049 --> 00:24:01,610
you can find the right snippet and

00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:07,690
basically just a one-stop-shop for

00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:14,020
developers so I wanted to queue up here

00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:16,549
see if I can do this too this is just

00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:20,059
kind of a walkthrough of a portal that

00:24:16,549 --> 00:24:23,809
we've done internally and I don't know I

00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:27,020
it's okay the music shut off because

00:24:23,809 --> 00:24:32,090
it's makes me want to go drinking or

00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:36,200
something this is if you're a power

00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:37,880
developer this is the portal today that

00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,340
we have out there and shows you some of

00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:42,080
the things that are available that you

00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:43,370
might want to find if you're if you're

00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:46,760
trying to do any kind of development on

00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:49,010
power so there's a top-level menu that

00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:50,360
gives you things like you know

00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:53,090
technologies are grouped together

00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:56,240
resources are grouped together there's a

00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:57,740
package search capability I see there

00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,160
potentially being some kind of an

00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:02,059
accelerator code snippet repository

00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:03,419
based on the output of this working

00:25:02,059 --> 00:25:07,349
group

00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:09,119
things like that have any of you seen

00:25:07,349 --> 00:25:11,129
this package search tool or the portal

00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:13,019
at all anybody seen the portal just kind

00:25:11,129 --> 00:25:17,459
of out of curiosity so a couple of you

00:25:13,019 --> 00:25:20,899
not very many this comes up pretty often

00:25:17,459 --> 00:25:23,219
now if you're doing Google searches on

00:25:20,899 --> 00:25:25,559
things related to power developers and

00:25:23,219 --> 00:25:27,329
and that sort of thing and we spent

00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:28,950
almost four years working on search

00:25:27,329 --> 00:25:30,869
engine optimization to be able to get

00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:32,459
that so it's less than you get for free

00:25:30,869 --> 00:25:34,429
the ability that advertisers get

00:25:32,459 --> 00:25:36,929
information out and share it is

00:25:34,429 --> 00:25:39,559
difficult anymore there's so much

00:25:36,929 --> 00:25:42,119
competing noise out there that getting

00:25:39,559 --> 00:25:43,979
getting any visibility for the people

00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:47,759
that need it to your project or your

00:25:43,979 --> 00:25:52,709
your work is tough this is actually one

00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:54,779
of our most visited oh there's a name

00:25:52,709 --> 00:25:59,129
for them developer portals basically on

00:25:54,779 --> 00:26:00,719
on our developer sites now which is a

00:25:59,129 --> 00:26:02,639
huge step up from where it used to be

00:26:00,719 --> 00:26:04,649
you can see some stuff that is

00:26:02,639 --> 00:26:05,879
technology centric so around cognitive

00:26:04,649 --> 00:26:09,179
or around cap we've already got some

00:26:05,879 --> 00:26:11,519
Cappy Cappy snap stuff out there you can

00:26:09,179 --> 00:26:13,440
see some open stack stack stuff and I'm

00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:14,579
showing this not to just saw you on the

00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,799
portal although if you want to use the

00:26:14,579 --> 00:26:18,749
portal go for it it's it's great but

00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:20,429
this is more like I'd like to see

00:26:18,749 --> 00:26:22,320
something like this focused on the

00:26:20,429 --> 00:26:24,929
accelerators maybe centered at the open

00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:27,479
power foundation so that members or even

00:26:24,929 --> 00:26:29,789
non-members can actually find access to

00:26:27,479 --> 00:26:33,209
the stuff that they need someone let

00:26:29,789 --> 00:26:35,059
that run for another minute something

00:26:33,209 --> 00:26:38,609
like that

00:26:35,059 --> 00:26:41,329
you can follow along or sip your coffee

00:26:38,609 --> 00:26:41,329
whichever

00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:51,010
I really like the other IBM resources

00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:53,200
that are up there there's a lot of stuff

00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:56,320
that you just wouldn't think to go look

00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:58,120
for out there if you're looking for kind

00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:01,510
of a jumping-off point for all kinds of

00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:03,130
resources so well that's playing this I

00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:04,510
think almost finished I'll say that's

00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:08,770
probably the end and ask if there are

00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:10,660
any questions looks like most of you are

00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:12,780
still awake that's that's a record for

00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:12,780
me

00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:26,640
[Music]

00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:28,410
so so yeah that's in my blood that's

00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:31,290
that whole open source connection

00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:32,790
absolutely and in fact there are a

00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:35,640
number of places where I think that's

00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:36,960
going to be key in my current role one

00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:39,180
little tidbit maybe you've all heard

00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,040
this already but pretty much every

00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:43,490
application it's out there commercial

00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:45,900
application that's out there is built

00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:48,990
approximately 80% of the application is

00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:51,480
based on open source right whenever we

00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:53,790
do we whenever we get a request for an

00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:55,890
ISV or an application the first question

00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:58,050
we've started asking them is which open

00:27:55,890 --> 00:28:01,290
source do you depend on and the answer

00:27:58,050 --> 00:28:02,760
is we is never we don't the answer is

00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:05,340
always that's gonna take a while to get

00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:06,450
to you because it's so much right and

00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:08,970
they have to figure out how it's all

00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:11,790
integrated so absolutely

00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:13,470
is there any start in the marketplace on

00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:16,830
that today not very much

00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:18,840
right I think that's a place where some

00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:20,130
of the people I think the open capi

00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:21,360
community for what I'm see I've seen

00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:22,620
might be a little bit ahead of the rest

00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,360
there I think there's more tools and

00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:28,890
software available I don't think I've

00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:30,630
seen much for FPGAs gpus is pretty much

00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:33,060
Nvidia which is pretty much their own

00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:36,030
ecosystem so I don't see a lot of open

00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:38,670
source work there some of the others

00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:40,260
like SSDs and nvme you know accelerated

00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:41,400
networking technologies I don't think

00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:46,680
there's a lot out there so there's a lot

00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:49,200
of gaps right it's my point are we gonna

00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:52,140
be able to boil the ocean probably not

00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,640
but I think the key is to first get that

00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:55,050
set of priorities from the is be using

00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:56,910
about what needs to be looked at and I'm

00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:59,700
sure open-source will be on there the

00:28:56,910 --> 00:29:01,800
goal will be to figure out which of open

00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:04,020
source is the highest priority right

00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:08,780
that's that's how we will typically it

00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:08,780
was it's a good question other questions

00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:19,259
[Music]

00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:03,929
yeah a lot of this stuff almost

00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:06,490
everything anymore is about communities

00:30:03,929 --> 00:30:07,899
right and enabling those communities to

00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:10,299
provide a lot of that information that

00:30:07,899 --> 00:30:12,220
they themselves can share and that's

00:30:10,299 --> 00:30:14,110
that's been hard in the open tower space

00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:15,340
you know you've worked on some of this

00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:18,159
I've worked on some of this we were

00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:20,320
talking earlier about Google who

00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:23,009
supports everything is having trouble

00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:25,389
supporting power on chromium right it's

00:30:23,009 --> 00:30:26,679
it should be obvious but it's like

00:30:25,389 --> 00:30:28,509
building up that community those

00:30:26,679 --> 00:30:32,309
individuals to understand that this

00:30:28,509 --> 00:30:34,779
might be valuable to them over time I

00:30:32,309 --> 00:30:37,299
think that's going to be a how do we

00:30:34,779 --> 00:30:39,039
become successful question once we

00:30:37,299 --> 00:30:41,379
figure out what we need to do and I

00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:44,350
you're absolutely right it's a hard

00:30:41,379 --> 00:30:46,629
problem you know it's I mentioned

00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:48,369
boiling the ocean earlier where we're

00:30:46,629 --> 00:30:50,049
doing that with open source software you

00:30:48,369 --> 00:30:52,690
know we talked about that with I think

00:30:50,049 --> 00:30:55,990
I'm dual session as well the 300 or 600

00:30:52,690 --> 00:31:00,389
docker containers out of how many got a

00:30:55,990 --> 00:31:00,389
lot of ways to go so other questions

00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:04,149
I've been flashed the five-minute side

00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:07,110
which means we still have three minutes

00:31:04,149 --> 00:31:07,110
if you got questions

00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:28,590
coach students and I think there is a

00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:31,050
place or you get to the point where code

00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:33,570
snippets you don't think of something

00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:49,890
common get up off don't worry persimmons

00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:52,880
of code somewhere more people certainly

00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:52,880
a new way to write code

00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:05,769
[Music]

00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:41,230
okay so Jeff I have a great question

00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:46,390
I've just taken some time to think about

00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:47,380
it I think we have a solution one thing

00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:49,510
that my team has been putting together

00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:54,429
for quite a while on github.com there's

00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:56,350
a PPC 64 le directory I own it but my

00:32:54,429 --> 00:32:57,880
team owns it you know we can all take

00:32:56,350 --> 00:33:00,910
and contribute stuff there it's actually

00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:04,870
got today one of the things out there is

00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:06,820
build scripts for 500 projects or so and

00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:08,500
they're the ones if you're smart enough

00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:10,750
you'd go out to that open source project

00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:12,130
anybody could probably figure it out

00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:13,660
there's a few that might have some

00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:17,380
dependencies satisfied in the scripts

00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:18,790
but it turns it into a push return on

00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:20,500
the end of that bash script or whatever

00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:22,900
it is and it will pull all the stuff

00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:24,549
together and build that project we've

00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:27,220
also got a few other things at that

00:33:24,549 --> 00:33:28,840
location it would be very easy today to

00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:32,980
start putting code snippets there and

00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:36,549
continue to advertise that as as the

00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:38,950
place for now and if it becomes wildly

00:33:36,549 --> 00:33:42,610
successful and overgrows github will

00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:44,049
figure out it in place but there are a

00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:45,370
lot of simple solutions for a lot of

00:33:44,049 --> 00:33:47,559
these complex problems and the goal is

00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:48,850
to have a clear vision of how to do them

00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:52,299
and I think that's the kind of answer

00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:53,740
I'm I'm a big fan of like I'm going to

00:33:52,299 --> 00:33:56,260
steal all of Anton's and put them there

00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:58,150
and I've been told at this point that we

00:33:56,260 --> 00:34:00,030
are done thank you all very much it's

00:33:58,150 --> 00:34:04,950
been an exciting session

00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:04,950
