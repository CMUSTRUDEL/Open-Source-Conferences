Title: OpenPOWER Summit NA 2019: OpenPOWER Lab@Unicamp and Minicloud Updates and Call for Input
Publication date: 2019-08-20
Playlist: OpenPOWER Summit NA 2019
Description: 
	Presented by Klaus Heinrich Kiwi, IBM

UNICAMP (State University of Campinas) is an important OpenPower academic member providing community services such as Minicloud (http://openpower.ic.unicamp.br/minicloud/) that is one of the most widely used "free" developer clouds in the OpenPower ecosystem, providing virtual images hosting to dozens of Open-Source projects, academic students and faculty, as well as local IBM partners working on porting their solutions to POWER. This session will bring an update about our OpenPOWER Lab@Unicamp activities, including some statistics of usage such as geography, distro flavor, technology themes, etc. This session will also update the community on the current work to use the minicloud as a CI validation for multiple projects and will collect feedback and input on what other projects might be good targets to bring into minicloud, including a possible partnership with other foundation members.

okay good morning thanks for thanks for

00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:10,950
joining me for this session today my

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,980
name is Klaus Klaus kiwi I am an IBM er

00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:17,039
who has a long-standing relationship

00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:19,830
with with UNICAMP as I will explain

00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:22,529
later UNICAMP has been an open bar

00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:24,560
foundation member since a couple of

00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:27,480
years back

00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:32,009
it's also my alma mater which is

00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:36,270
convenient but our story goals goes back

00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:38,879
even even further and more and is even

00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:43,290
more tied to to our group in Brazil so

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:46,559
let me just start by saying that I mean

00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:51,539
what how can I change my slides here

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:55,739
okay so the the Linux Technology Center

00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:58,800
team in Brazil really started as a small

00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:01,739
group inside IBM Jeff see over there was

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:07,530
one of the responsibles for this this

00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:11,580
endeavor we started back in 2003 so it's

00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:14,970
a long time ago already with a small lab

00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:18,869
and a few students doing Linux

00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:21,119
development on on Power Systems but that

00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:22,890
evolved quickly that the Linux

00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,710
Technology Center in Brazil was

00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:29,579
established a year or year and half

00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:31,829
later and and we had a team I mean

00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:35,070
growing from from that initial

00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:38,040
investment that was inside UNICAMP and

00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:39,570
our relationship with UNICAMP continued

00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:45,570
to evolve as well and continue to

00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:47,700
progress throughout the years in I mean

00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:49,979
we we went through a couple of different

00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:52,619
phases in our in our relationship with

00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:57,409
UNICAMP they were always very interested

00:01:52,619 --> 00:02:00,479
in exploring the power architecture

00:01:57,409 --> 00:02:05,030
exploring how it could be useful for

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,030
their research for their teaching

00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:11,690
missions but they are also always very

00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:15,180
interested in also developing the talent

00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:19,220
necessary to work on system architecture

00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:22,290
system design low level low level system

00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:29,430
system programming work so it was always

00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:36,060
a fruitful relationship so just for us

00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:38,700
to set up the the the team here so what

00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:42,000
is unicamp and what is Campinas which is

00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,450
where we I came from and we are talking

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,480
about

00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:49,680
so unicamp is a state university in

00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:52,799
brazil a Campinas is the city where it

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:55,379
is located an institute of computing is

00:02:52,799 --> 00:02:59,970
the actual entity inside university that

00:02:55,379 --> 00:03:02,670
we partner with in order to make this

00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:05,190
this this partnership across in inside

00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:09,799
of inside power and further down open

00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:15,269
power possible this is this is Brazil

00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:18,630
you will see that in in in both I

00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:20,579
highlighted the state of San Paulo so in

00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:24,269
the state of San Paulo we are located in

00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:27,780
Campinas with about the metro area has

00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:29,030
about you and half million people and we

00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:33,030
are very close

00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:35,099
60 60 miles away from Sao Paulo which

00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:38,040
has 20 meter people 20 million people

00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:42,060
metro area so just for you guys to know

00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:45,440
where we are we are in Campinas UNICAMP

00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:47,849
it's it's one of the major

00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:55,829
state-sponsored universities in Brazil

00:03:47,849 --> 00:03:58,790
we we UNICAMP has about 36,000 students

00:03:55,829 --> 00:04:02,069
about half of them are graduate students

00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:04,980
they have I mean nineteen hundred

00:04:02,069 --> 00:04:07,680
faculty more than eight thousand in

00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:11,160
staff they are actually the number one

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:13,169
University in pattern feelings and they

00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:15,060
they are the number one university in

00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:16,509
Brazil for a number of publications for

00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:18,370
professor

00:04:16,509 --> 00:04:21,489
the annual budget is around a billion

00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:23,500
dollars per year and they are ranked as

00:04:21,489 --> 00:04:26,560
the number three top university in Latin

00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:30,819
America being the number one in computer

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:33,129
science so this is unicamp the region

00:04:30,819 --> 00:04:34,990
where unicamp is Campinas which I showed

00:04:33,129 --> 00:04:37,960
you this is considered to be the

00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:42,069
Brazilian Silicon Valley there are a lot

00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:44,699
of companies around the ecosystem a lot

00:04:42,069 --> 00:04:47,259
of those companies are actually from

00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:49,870
people coming out of unicamp directly a

00:04:47,259 --> 00:04:51,879
lot of startups started with with the

00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:59,699
unicamp graduate or undergraduate

00:04:51,879 --> 00:05:02,560
students and inside unicamp we are in

00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:04,569
the Brazilian the Brazilian term is Park

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,419
is scientifically technological but it's

00:05:04,569 --> 00:05:11,879
a it's a it's a tech park that they are

00:05:07,419 --> 00:05:16,150
they created a while ago to promote

00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:20,529
university and and and private

00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:26,430
initiative partnerships and we are with

00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:29,469
with a room that that we have a rack of

00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:34,479
power servers that you can see are here

00:05:29,469 --> 00:05:37,270
today to the lower right and we are in a

00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:39,880
building that also provides us with with

00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:41,289
conference rooms and auditoriums so

00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:43,389
there's there's some infrastructure we

00:05:41,289 --> 00:05:46,750
can use also as part of of this

00:05:43,389 --> 00:05:49,300
partnership the team itself are composed

00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:51,069
by myself in Rafael sani who will I mean

00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:53,770
who is participating in the in the

00:05:51,069 --> 00:05:57,940
conference as well and will be giving a

00:05:53,770 --> 00:06:01,060
talk about Travis CI and other good

00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:02,949
stuff later we have currently three

00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:06,009
students we actually have openings for

00:06:02,949 --> 00:06:09,430
another two we are in the process of

00:06:06,009 --> 00:06:13,990
selecting scholarship students and we

00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:16,539
have two professors Sandro and Lucas who

00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:22,900
are guiding us through through this

00:06:16,539 --> 00:06:26,110
effort one of our one of our most

00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:27,610
important initiatives in the open power

00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:29,110
in our list amor

00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:31,120
all of them later but one of them are

00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:35,590
more important initiatives in the open

00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:38,590
power contributions actually started

00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:43,050
before unicamp even became a member of

00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:47,379
the open power foundation we in 2014 in

00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:51,430
the de lab at UNICAMP started creating a

00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:55,150
cloud community cloud service based on a

00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:57,310
product that was called power KVM and we

00:06:55,150 --> 00:07:03,340
where we had about I mean at the time in

00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:05,529
2014 11 worldwide users in 2015 we

00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:08,740
initiated some tests with open stacks we

00:07:05,529 --> 00:07:12,580
jumped to about 300 worldwide users so

00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:15,909
it was already becoming a something we

00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:19,139
would be carrying a lot more about in

00:07:15,909 --> 00:07:22,539
2016 we did the transition to OpenStack

00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:25,750
we've drawn power KVM and we jumped to

00:07:22,539 --> 00:07:29,340
about 400 400 users in worldwide and

00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:32,620
today we are using open OpenStack rocky

00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:34,960
with selection of power 8 and power 9

00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:45,310
servers and we have a more more than 300

00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:48,129
600 worldwide users that that's coming

00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:53,379
directly from Ubuntu yeah our basis

00:07:48,129 --> 00:07:56,979
Ubuntu we started off in 2016 with 1404

00:07:53,379 --> 00:08:00,669
I believe we went through 1604 and I

00:07:56,979 --> 00:08:05,349
believe we are making experiments to go

00:08:00,669 --> 00:08:07,479
to 1804 but we're still in 1604 ok we

00:08:05,349 --> 00:08:09,669
have a selection a selection of OS is

00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:11,409
available through this the service I

00:08:09,669 --> 00:08:16,029
will go a little more in detail about

00:08:11,409 --> 00:08:19,180
that in in later slides but this is I

00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:21,939
would say the primary products from from

00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:26,800
the collaboration we have with with with

00:08:21,939 --> 00:08:28,650
UNICAMP as I mentioned UNICAMP in 2015

00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,389
became the first Latin American

00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:35,450
University to join the open power

00:08:31,389 --> 00:08:38,100
foundation as a academic member

00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:41,880
there there were some some news around

00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:44,220
the time the link won't be readable but

00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:48,900
in the offline slides you can you can

00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:52,040
consult that made us part of the fire

00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:56,970
fairly large network of academic and

00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:59,850
research network part of the open power

00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:01,710
ecosystem that we're providing some some

00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:05,400
form of service to the community either

00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:09,300
access to actual heart or access to

00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:12,210
virtual images development centers

00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:15,420
customer customer centers etc so that

00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:18,390
that put us on the map and as you see we

00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:20,670
we were not sure if this is too accurate

00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:24,180
but we were the only one in this sulfur

00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:27,350
in hemisphere to to do this this kind of

00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:32,430
service to the open power community okay

00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:36,270
so going back to this summary of open

00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:39,600
power missions that we carry in in the

00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:44,040
lab we have some dedicated harder

00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:46,920
projects we have some systems reserved

00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:49,440
for Debian so that they can have their

00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:53,040
their build D and and their Porter box

00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:56,610
systems we actually do have an Alpine

00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:58,440
Alpine OS Alpine distro built system

00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:01,140
also sealing and using that

00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:03,840
infrastructure is also a dedicated power

00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:06,330
eight system I believe we do have a

00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:09,030
power seven system dedicated to FreeBSD

00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:13,700
I believe we will have a talk about

00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:16,380
FreeBSD later in the in the event

00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:19,230
perhaps they will talk and you know a

00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:21,960
little more about that but we've we've

00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:24,180
been I mean assisting them as we can

00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:26,850
with the infrastructure part for the

00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:30,840
FreeBSD community to port their

00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:34,680
operating system to to power and we also

00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:37,870
have a few number of dedicated GPU

00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:40,570
projects that are that are going

00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:44,170
along the way as well those are

00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:47,440
generally time-boxed two or three months

00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:52,420
and those are generally very specific to

00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:55,000
either a professor in the university or

00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:58,600
a partner coming from the ecosystem and

00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:01,690
and we reserved a GPU enabled system for

00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:03,430
them so that they can I mean do what

00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:08,710
they want to do and there's a there's a

00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:10,270
number of those that already happened in

00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:13,780
addition to those we do have what we

00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:16,180
call the hosted projects right now I'll

00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:19,600
in the next slide or in a slide further

00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:21,910
ahead I will show what are the the

00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:26,020
current hosted projects that we are

00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:29,230
doing but I will all quickly mention

00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:31,300
that we had a little project we called

00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,920
power graph I'll show a little more on

00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:34,960
that later

00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:36,670
it's currently on hold because we are

00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:41,290
looking for the student that could

00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:44,860
continue that effort we we also had the

00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:47,920
tensorflow CI GG Lipsy Butte but which

00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:50,590
is also the CI way the gilepsy does and

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,870
the gdb build but as well those those

00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:55,990
last three ones we call them graduated

00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:58,840
because they started off in the in the

00:11:55,990 --> 00:12:01,510
unicamp lab as as students putting them

00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:04,090
together and setting up the CI for those

00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:08,350
projects but syncs them the community

00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:11,100
itself adopted that task and students

00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:13,840
are no longer needing to maintain that

00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:15,490
themselves so the community in actually

00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:18,100
great news right that this is happening

00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:21,190
because the community accepted that

00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:23,740
contribution and it's maintaining that

00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:26,920
service themselves and they're doing

00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:28,510
this through the last mission that we

00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,740
that I'd like to highlight which is the

00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:34,060
meaning the UNICAMP

00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:38,470
mini cloud it is a public cloud I did a

00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:40,870
math did a quick count on on August 12

00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:43,530
around August 12 at that particular

00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:50,320
moment in time in that snapshot we had

00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:51,490
147 images running 40 40 24 of them in

00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,800
the tiny

00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:57,730
shirt size right I mean in the tiny size

00:12:53,800 --> 00:13:01,180
with one V CPU 38 with small 32 with

00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:06,040
medium 34 large in nineteen with the max

00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:10,950
configuration that we reallocate it's 8

00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:16,180
V CPUs 10 gigabytes of RAM that actually

00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:18,550
for every one that requests us an image

00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:22,570
for for the mini cloud instance we will

00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:25,660
routinely allocate 8 v CPUs in 10

00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:30,010
gigabytes of RAM and a 80 gigabytes of

00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:32,230
disk total and using those t-shirt sizes

00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:34,649
that we are seeing here on the right the

00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:37,480
users can create their their their own

00:13:34,649 --> 00:13:38,350
configurations they can create three or

00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:43,149
four different

00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:45,940
I mean systems of small or tiny size

00:13:43,149 --> 00:13:49,029
they can create a private network for

00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:51,700
them to communicate or they can use all

00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:54,399
their resources and create one big

00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:56,589
system that that will use up all the

00:13:54,399 --> 00:14:01,690
resource pool that we have allocated for

00:13:56,589 --> 00:14:04,450
them ok so this was the snapshot this is

00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:07,810
actually running on this rack we have 2

00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:13,360
power 9 systems 5 power 8 systems total

00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:15,940
of 567 cores 760 gigabytes of RAM about

00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:19,630
10 terabytes of disk we are running

00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:22,480
Ubuntu 1604 + OpenStack rocky the

00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:26,770
OpenStack that we are running is the

00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:28,750
Ubuntu flavored one but we are doing a

00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:31,209
good job in keeping it updated and

00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:33,490
keeping it running and we actually

00:14:31,209 --> 00:14:37,510
learned a lot of lessons in upgrading

00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:39,899
from Ubuntu 1404 into 1604 and bringing

00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:42,670
up in stack together and we actually

00:14:39,899 --> 00:14:45,670
documented the process blogged about the

00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:48,700
process which I will show later in the

00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:52,089
English slide as well we have a total of

00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:54,579
19 image different images available in

00:14:52,089 --> 00:14:57,399
our in our library in our image library

00:14:54,579 --> 00:14:59,680
as as discussed in a previous slides

00:14:57,399 --> 00:15:03,650
including sent away as debian fedora

00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:06,920
openSUSE and the bunch of variants ok

00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:09,080
we do have only 14 public IP addresses

00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:12,170
this is what the university was able to

00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:15,140
allocate for us but most users are very

00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:19,040
satisfied or reasonably satisfied using

00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:21,920
network address translation so we will

00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:24,230
give them an SSH port for them to

00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:27,050
connect to they will I mean they will

00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:30,800
get a terminal they will also have the

00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:33,260
web access OpenStack does a good job in

00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,810
providing access to consoles these days

00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:39,070
to terminal so they they can also do

00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:44,300
this using using Adi web based

00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:46,640
management console and for those that

00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:49,070
actually need someone connecting from

00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:52,670
outside there's a special request we can

00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:56,060
we can we can do and we can allocate one

00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:58,010
of the 14 public IP addresses for them

00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:59,870
and and there were cases where this was

00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:03,350
necessary for example for the dedicated

00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:06,010
harder hosting projects the Debian the

00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:10,430
Alpine the FreeBSD folks they wanna

00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:12,370
connect directly to to that system in

00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:14,240
order to include it in as part of their

00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:16,460
infrastructure of worldwide

00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,380
infrastructure right and we have a bare

00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:20,740
metal infrastructure as I mentioned one

00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:24,470
power 7 1 power weight systems for the

00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:30,320
Alpine and FreeBSD communities we have

00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:34,430
one Minsky box that we are dedicating to

00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:38,720
to GPU projects that are taking rounds

00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:41,990
on top of them right going back to I

00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:44,180
mean I mentioned the CI in packaging

00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:48,350
work as part of the hosted projects so

00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:50,420
this list here is the list of currently

00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:55,910
hosted projects that the students are

00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:59,480
maintaining we have a Basel CI container

00:16:55,910 --> 00:17:02,660
D docker seee glide Griffin aki ali mini

00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:05,750
cube mini amino MC rustic and terraform

00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:08,930
two of them are still being set up but

00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:13,130
most of them are continuously building

00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:14,329
the upstream releases but also building

00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:17,600
the proper

00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:21,730
tact releases from the community we make

00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:24,620
those binaries available in the in the

00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:28,760
mini cloud computers themselves the URL

00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:30,409
is to your right again there's an

00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:33,490
offline version for the deck if you want

00:17:30,409 --> 00:17:36,769
to go inspect what the DD files are

00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:39,080
there are some SS off I took this

00:17:36,769 --> 00:17:41,299
picture like I said in all around August

00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:43,970
12 or so there were some bills failed

00:17:41,299 --> 00:17:46,220
this is actually a good thing because it

00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:49,100
means that we are catching them we are

00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:51,860
giving the communities the chance to to

00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:53,779
to be fixing them the students are

00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:55,190
constantly in communication with those

00:17:53,779 --> 00:17:58,730
communities so they are letting them

00:17:55,190 --> 00:18:00,950
know and the hope is that someday the

00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:03,260
communities will see enough value in

00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:05,929
this type of work that they will adopt

00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:08,299
it for themselves as well in and we will

00:18:05,929 --> 00:18:10,760
have a graduation ceremony as we had in

00:18:08,299 --> 00:18:15,409
the in the in the other projects as well

00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:17,090
right this is the documentation that I

00:18:15,409 --> 00:18:20,870
was talking about apologies for the

00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:23,419
small print I was trying to fit it all

00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:24,980
in in one slide but it it will become a

00:18:23,419 --> 00:18:30,139
good reference slides if you want to

00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:32,419
look at it later offline we we had a few

00:18:30,139 --> 00:18:36,710
more recent publications where we are

00:18:32,419 --> 00:18:40,130
talking about scikit-learn in Jupiter

00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:43,159
frame and Jupiter note notebooks using

00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:46,490
that on power we think this is relatable

00:18:43,159 --> 00:18:48,260
today I mean to the community track that

00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:52,250
that is happening today happened just

00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:54,340
now a few other interesting blog posts

00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:55,990
and documentation is about setting up

00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:59,240
OpenStack itself

00:18:55,990 --> 00:19:05,240
setting up various OpenStack services on

00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:08,960
power setting up CUDA OpenCL to CUDA

00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:12,850
which was an experiment we did a few a

00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:16,010
few months ago and a lot of other

00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:20,210
documentation that I mean are available

00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:23,420
out there in our being used

00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:27,150
they are being used by this community

00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:31,290
this does this map here so this is kind

00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:34,560
of map and unfortunately we don't have

00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:38,070
data that goes as far as 2003 when we

00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:41,010
first started or 2014 when we first

00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:45,360
started the mini cloud project itself so

00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:48,030
data is only recent as as December 2017

00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:51,560
when we started using Google Analytics

00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:54,030
to collect data from the websites usage

00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:57,300
you'll see that most users are from

00:19:54,030 --> 00:20:00,840
Brazil second one is I can reach for you

00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:03,960
its United States and then United

00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:09,090
Kingdom India Germany France Canada

00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:14,460
Argentina Russia Russia and Spain in

00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:16,710
this in this from from that in this time

00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:19,260
frame we had about two thousand two

00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:22,770
hundred and forty-one unique users in

00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:24,330
the website and again those are those

00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:26,550
who are reading articles reading

00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:30,450
documentation and the blog or who are

00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:32,910
requesting an instance on the mini cloud

00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:38,160
service we actually are still unable to

00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:41,340
count when the access is granted to D to

00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:43,410
the user how much he is coming back we

00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:47,130
have some statistics on the OpenStack

00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:49,550
for CPU usage and and and and bandwidth

00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:51,810
network bandwidth disk bandwidth usage

00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:54,270
but we couldn't actually figure out a

00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:56,400
good statistic for us to measure how

00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:57,840
much you users are using we know that

00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,330
they are using because the servers are

00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:03,180
constantly busy in making a lot of noise

00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:04,650
in the room so we when we when we hear

00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:06,240
the noise it's always satisfying

00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:09,150
sometimes we're just working on the

00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:12,120
office tyranny we hear a power system

00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:15,510
ramping up like going about you to take

00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:17,040
flight right so it's always good to hear

00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:19,650
that noise because you know we know that

00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:22,350
somebody's is compiling something

00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:25,380
someone is testing something and and

00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:27,870
also the statistics that we have are

00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:29,700
showing that there is a fair amount of

00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:33,140
use from from the mini cloud so this is

00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:36,110
actually just website accesses blog post

00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:39,830
and requests for access and speaking

00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:42,710
about access this is the word cloud for

00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:44,420
for the mini cloud requests so every

00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:48,799
time someone requests mini cloud

00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:51,559
instance they they give us a description

00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:57,290
of what they're there they're requesting

00:21:51,559 --> 00:22:00,679
that instance for I made a cloud word

00:21:57,290 --> 00:22:04,850
cloud from that you can see learn is one

00:22:00,679 --> 00:22:09,640
of the biggest hitters that the most

00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:14,150
occurring words developed test research

00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:17,590
OpenStack access cloud performance right

00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:21,559
you'll see the bigger the word the more

00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:23,660
hits the more frequent its use was in

00:22:21,559 --> 00:22:25,460
the in the open in the in the requests

00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:30,380
that we got from from the community

00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:33,290
right some testimonies of people that

00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:37,250
are that where we're using mini cloud in

00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:40,640
what for so we have people from the

00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:45,320
legit community telling us that they're

00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:48,200
trying to enable legit for PPC 64 le we

00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:51,470
have people testing for compile errors

00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:55,580
and build packages development of open

00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:59,320
open source rocks DB for for PowerPC 64

00:22:55,580 --> 00:23:02,330
le access to study Linux software

00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:05,120
development on the power architecture I

00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:08,390
had some twits that I collected as well

00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:11,210
from from the open power with with the

00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:15,309
open a mini cloud and open power hash

00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:22,280
tags we had a we had wrote Avio Pinsky

00:23:15,309 --> 00:23:24,470
which was porting software maestro write

00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:29,360
on power he was using one of our

00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:32,470
instances to do that we had Ganesh who

00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:34,240
was just summing this around and then

00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:37,000
was receiving an award during the

00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:40,030
keynotes here we actually used instances

00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,910
of the mini cloud to enable workshops we

00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:45,790
were doing in Brazil a couple of months

00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:49,720
ago and a good thing is that I mean when

00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:51,940
we were doing those workshop students we

00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:54,940
gave the incentives to students to go

00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:57,370
ask for a instance in mini cloud so that

00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:59,200
they can continue their work continue

00:23:57,370 --> 00:24:01,390
their exercises that were presented

00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:03,550
during the workshop and we actually had

00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:06,940
a quite good number of students who

00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:09,750
requested the these instances and

00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:13,390
continue to use those instances four

00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:19,810
months later after their they were done

00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:25,360
with the with the workshop right and we

00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:27,970
have that's this person here from the

00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:31,570
left I think it's actually mano the mano

00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:35,320
community was thanking us from providing

00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:40,480
access to the two to a power system

00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:42,490
system medium image and and that was was

00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,590
one of the ways they could port their

00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:48,010
software and test it and make sure it's

00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:51,430
it continues to be maintained as I

00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:53,320
mentioned we do have a project that is

00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:56,110
currently on hold waiting for us to

00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:59,920
staff a little better the team this is

00:24:56,110 --> 00:25:03,340
the it's unable to read on the top line

00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:05,410
but it's called the power graph students

00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:08,470
were able to use the IP and my

00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:11,320
interfaces to those systems to start

00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:14,050
collecting data about power usage power

00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:15,520
draw from the system's themselves and

00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:18,880
they were able to graph that real-time

00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:21,010
on a web application this is an open

00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:23,950
source project it's hosted on github

00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:27,250
everyone can can go there to see it's a

00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:31,420
it's a nice example of using open

00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:34,060
standards open interfaces for work for

00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:37,420
for visualization things that provide

00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:40,660
good value the the visualization part is

00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:43,510
actually very intuitive and and we had

00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:45,880
people asking us to do the same for for

00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:49,660
x86 service to which we said no

00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:51,010
go do it to yourself but it but it's I

00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:53,140
mean that the code is there we are

00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:58,179
accepting contributions if we if we want

00:25:53,140 --> 00:26:00,340
to do it for for x86 servers but it was

00:25:58,179 --> 00:26:03,370
a very useful tool for actually

00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:05,530
measuring in and this is something that

00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:09,630
was worried the whirring the university

00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:12,700
actually measuring the power draw for

00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:15,309
for the these systems we had hosted

00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:20,440
there in several parts of the day or

00:26:15,309 --> 00:26:23,919
several parts of the year right to

00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:27,250
request access to to the mini cloud you

00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:32,380
simply use that URL open power dot IC

00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:34,330
unicamp dot b are actually that that is

00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:36,429
the main portal you will see links to

00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:38,830
the mini cloud and to our blogs and to

00:26:36,429 --> 00:26:42,610
our videos to our events your ceilings

00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:45,700
in there too to everything everything

00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:48,460
that we are doing in this initiative but

00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:52,299
once you are in the mini cloud team you

00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:55,390
request access through the actual forum

00:26:52,299 --> 00:26:58,659
we you briefly describe the purpose and

00:26:55,390 --> 00:27:04,030
we routinely will grant you access in

00:26:58,659 --> 00:27:07,299
two or three days as I mentioned you you

00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:09,820
will have up to 8 V CPUs and 10

00:27:07,299 --> 00:27:13,270
gigabytes of RAM and you can create your

00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:17,140
combination of systems within that pool

00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:19,860
if you require more please justify it

00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:22,480
and we can we can provide probably

00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:29,530
figure out a way we can provide more as

00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:31,140
well now this is this is the time I I

00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:34,659
wanted to hear a little bit about

00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:40,270
feedback from from from you guys

00:27:34,659 --> 00:27:42,400
I created a forum I don't think it's the

00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:45,820
the QR code I don't think it will be

00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:47,650
clickable it will be available things I

00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:52,330
mean it's cutting off the upper portion

00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:56,140
but it's a very simple URL bit dot do -

00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:58,090
unicamp 2019 if you guys want to help us

00:27:56,140 --> 00:28:00,520
out figure out where

00:27:58,090 --> 00:28:03,910
we want to go how we want to go about it

00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:06,700
for for the next few projects that we

00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:09,370
engage on your input will be very much

00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:11,410
appreciated the first question is what

00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:12,790
would you consider to be the strongest

00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:16,090
contributions to the open power

00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:18,010
community I won't read the the options

00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:19,420
here I just wanted to hear if if there

00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:21,820
is anyone here

00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:23,830
passion passionate enough about any of

00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:26,560
those alternatives that want to want to

00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:29,110
raise their hands and and tell what

00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:30,520
would be the strongest contributions our

00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:33,190
strongest contributions to the

00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:37,560
communities so far

00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:40,180
free and easy access mission-critical

00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:45,630
OSS communities like we do with Debian

00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:47,860
in alpine bare-metal system access

00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:49,330
continuous integration creating in

00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:50,860
hosting the continuing integrations

00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:55,180
projects that the ones we call the

00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:57,190
hosted projects documentation or

00:28:55,180 --> 00:29:00,100
something else that that anyone would

00:28:57,190 --> 00:29:02,080
like to specify anyone any any takers

00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:03,940
Jeff here

00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:06,840
you're always passionate about any about

00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:06,840
anything so

00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:12,619
[Music]

00:29:17,809 --> 00:29:24,929
continuous integration taxes the

00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:29,190
community get there on power and get

00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:30,839
them to adopt and embrace I think is the

00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:32,729
strongest part of this story it's one

00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:35,249
thing to provide the enemies but then it

00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:38,459
sort of level of value on top of it I

00:29:35,249 --> 00:29:40,049
think it becomes the peace in the

00:29:38,459 --> 00:29:42,170
ecosystems of the people to become

00:29:40,049 --> 00:29:47,109
self-sufficient at some time

00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:47,109
[Music]

00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,719
[Music]

00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:26,599
[Music]

00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:37,009
[Music]

00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:47,109
[Music]

00:30:50,360 --> 00:31:04,850
[Music]

00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:04,850
and the good

00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:09,959
[Music]

00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:24,520
what yeah but that's interesting because

00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:26,770
one of the best things about doing this

00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:29,320
work is that it's a good entry point for

00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:31,300
students but doesn't nothing I don't

00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:33,790
know nothing about power sometimes

00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:36,580
nothing about open source communities

00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:39,430
and development but it's a useful

00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:44,710
service for anyone in community they

00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:47,410
usually routinely will not I mean a send

00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:49,210
anyone away for for offering those

00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:51,910
services so it's a good entry point for

00:31:49,210 --> 00:32:19,840
integrating and and in for second year

00:31:51,910 --> 00:32:23,110
students to start in this world yeah I

00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:27,040
believe that we are not publishing arm

00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:30,370
images outside but the docker hub is

00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:34,390
doing a very good job at keeping the the

00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:36,160
images in there themselves so if it's a

00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:38,470
container you're looking at I mean that

00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:41,620
they usually provide a very good a good

00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:43,870
service in in in docker hub for

00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:45,670
ourselves our images are mildly

00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:48,490
customized for our own networking

00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:50,890
environment but other than that there

00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:53,050
are pretty much pristine images coming

00:32:50,890 --> 00:33:19,870
coming directly from what boom - fedora

00:32:53,050 --> 00:33:22,930
openSUSE etc that's that's actually a

00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:25,120
good input thank you right that that

00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:28,960
might be I mean another way we could

00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:31,630
host projects but instead of CI it's

00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:33,910
also probably a good entry point for a

00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:36,820
little more experienced students to

00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:39,670
start creating docker images or any

00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:41,770
other type of images with a set of tools

00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:45,760
included that could be useful for the

00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:47,880
community yeah I do have a two more

00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:50,380
questions so bear with me

00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:52,150
what would be the best choice of next

00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:56,080
projects to us perhaps this was also

00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:57,520
already partially answered in the in the

00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:01,350
previous question but I added a couple

00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:03,580
more options here just if anyone is

00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:06,760
sufficiently passionate about them I

00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:11,520
added start building and testing low

00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:11,520
level components like OSS few more

00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:20,329
any tasks

00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:20,329
[Music]

00:34:47,739 --> 00:34:50,839
[Music]

00:34:54,920 --> 00:35:00,290
[Music]

00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:15,829
[Music]

00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:24,110
accent

00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:27,080
we actually had around a couple of

00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:29,660
months ago where we asked the students

00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:33,050
you do CEO optimization for our blog

00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:35,300
postings I don't know where that ended I

00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:36,860
need you to follow that up but but it

00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:40,790
was one of our objectives to be

00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:44,180
searchable to be well indexed and well

00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:48,620
ranked in Google searches so that people

00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:51,620
looking for keywords like open power and

00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:52,940
OpenStack would what leaders would lead

00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:54,800
them to to us since we have

00:35:52,940 --> 00:36:00,340
documentation on how to make those two

00:35:54,800 --> 00:36:04,940
things work together the last question

00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:06,500
actually what will be the most important

00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:09,770
characteristic for the mini cloud

00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:11,990
service if it's the total volume of

00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:15,980
virtualized service the total volume of

00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:20,200
folks a computing resources available if

00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:23,480
it's access to NV links GPUs or kpf DPAs

00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:26,030
FPGAs or access to cloud computing

00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:27,980
environments in api's we we were

00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:30,790
considering expanding our OpenStack

00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:34,430
offerings you'll start including more

00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:37,490
OpenStack more AP is that people could

00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:39,710
really start using to build power ready

00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:41,780
cloud computing Zoar called native

00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:46,640
applications right so that that was one

00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:51,110
of the de possibilities or BMC IPL low

00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:52,610
level access again I believe this was

00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:54,830
already partially answered in the

00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:57,230
previous slides but if anyone anyone

00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:59,380
wants to add any any thoughts on top of

00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:59,380
it

00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:07,820
[Music]

00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:51,890
are we yep

00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:01,690
[Music]

00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:12,070
[Music]

00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:23,710
yeah yeah you're completely right but

00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:26,440
the moment we add D peels and then the

00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:29,140
link they will ask for InfiniBand

00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:31,120
adaptors they will ask for object

00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:34,710
storage they were asked I mean their

00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:38,100
works for larger and faster storage and

00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:40,720
larger and faster networking and so they

00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:43,840
we recognize that there are people out

00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:47,110
there wanting to run real HPC and AI

00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:49,150
applications in a mini cluster that came

00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:52,930
that they can use but I mean giving

00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:54,760
access to a mini HPC or AI cluster the

00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:57,280
same way we are giving access to you in

00:38:54,760 --> 00:39:00,520
system images the way we are doing in

00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:03,220
mini cloud it's perhaps an exercise that

00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:07,480
little beyond our possibilities at this

00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:09,580
point but we are open to any community

00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:13,030
members wanting to donate hardware or

00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:16,200
land hardware so so that we can enable

00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:16,200
this type of thing so

00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:24,340
[Music]

00:39:25,010 --> 00:39:28,310
service jobs

00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:45,140
yeah we actually investigated this

00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:47,900
possibility we need to go back to it we

00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:52,520
there wasn't completely clear what type

00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:54,740
of scheduler what type of what type of

00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:57,020
yeah scheduler we would use there

00:39:54,740 --> 00:40:01,040
there's a possibility now that we use

00:39:57,020 --> 00:40:03,440
open shift for for having our GPU

00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:05,900
enabled worker node and and and then

00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:09,800
containers in open shift running on top

00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:13,850
of open shift we wanted to stay as a

00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:16,340
company as a Cossack as possible but

00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:18,170
open ship is sufficiently open source so

00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:21,920
so I think that could be a good

00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:23,720
alternative there there are alternate is

00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:26,090
the University Professors they are big

00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:28,160
on on a particular type of scheduler

00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:30,860
that they are using internally for their

00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:33,230
own projects I can't remember its name

00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:38,570
right now but it's an open community

00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:41,900
scheduler slurm exactly yeah yeah that's

00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:43,790
it that's it thank you Jeff but we we

00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:46,040
are still trying to find like I said we

00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:48,920
we got a batch of first and second-year

00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:51,170
students we need we need them to become

00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:53,240
older and more experienced before we can

00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:57,280
start throwing some of those more

00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:57,280
interesting challenge towards them

00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:06,280
they they are there there's um we are

00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:09,320
using cinder but I believe they are all

00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:11,270
in old storage there there's no external

00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:12,560
we we do have an external one but we are

00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:15,830
using it for backup

00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:22,760
not for live production data at this

00:41:15,830 --> 00:41:25,280
point Seth well I need to I need to

00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:30,170
consult with Rafael he's the technical I

00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:32,540
mean the technical minds must mastermind

00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:34,490
behind it so and I know that he will

00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:38,090
routinely I mean move move up to the

00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:40,430
next thing we we we use this group of

00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:43,250
students in unicamp and we treat them

00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:45,560
pretty much as a start-up so we the one

00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:47,600
of the primary things we make everyone

00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:50,660
absolutely understand about is that they

00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:51,830
are responsible for the service they are

00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:53,990
responsible for the customer

00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:57,170
satisfaction right and they need to

00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:59,450
continue evolving it as we go we we

00:41:57,170 --> 00:42:01,580
don't allow I mean long down times for

00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:03,170
them to upgrade the the hardware we had

00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:05,660
one exception at the beginning of this

00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:08,210
year because we completely broken up in

00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:11,270
OpenStack in a way that we decided to

00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:14,570
start it over and do it all again but

00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:17,030
they are able to continue deploying new

00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:20,720
services and new functionalities just

00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:24,470
the way a minor cloud computing provider

00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:29,330
would do in a rolling deployment type of

00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:32,120
model so well and if you you guys have

00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:35,660
any other feedback I mean please use the

00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:38,510
forum please contact me on on my email

00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:42,200
please contact me on Twitter or LinkedIn

00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:44,540
I will be around also in the event for

00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:47,180
for anything anything any any other

00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:49,610
conversations you guys might have and

00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:52,030
with that I think thank you for for your

00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:52,030
