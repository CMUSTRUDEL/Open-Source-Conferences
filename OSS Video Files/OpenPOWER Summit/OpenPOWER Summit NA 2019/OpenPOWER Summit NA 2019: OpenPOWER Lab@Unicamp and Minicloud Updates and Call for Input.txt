Description: 
	Presented by Klaus Heinrich Kiwi, IBM

UNICAMP (State University of Campinas) is an important OpenPower academic member providing community services such as Minicloud (http://openpower.ic.unicamp.br/minicloud/) that is one of the most widely used "free" developer clouds in the OpenPower ecosystem, providing virtual images hosting to dozens of Open-Source projects, academic students and faculty, as well as local IBM partners working on porting their solutions to POWER. This session will bring an update about our OpenPOWER Lab@Unicamp activities, including some statistics of usage such as geography, distro flavor, technology themes, etc. This session will also update the community on the current work to use the minicloud as a CI validation for multiple projects and will collect feedback and input on what other projects might be good targets to bring into minicloud, including a possible partnership with other foundation members.
