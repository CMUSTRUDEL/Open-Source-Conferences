	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,509
so good afternoon everybody so I Marvin

00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:09,660
Barney from India and that's adit sv

00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:11,429
he's also from India so we're in

00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:14,009
interning at object automation software

00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:17,190
solutions for the past four months and

00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:18,750
I'm studying beta Chi T in vs up the

00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:21,210
recomment Institute of Science and

00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:23,760
Technology Chennai and he's studying at

00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:27,289
MIT University Delhi he's a mechanical

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:32,009
engineer and i'm a i-i-i-i engineer so

00:00:27,289 --> 00:00:33,570
so basically our representation is about

00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:37,920
the power e aÃ­ Wishon and other

00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:41,040
solutions on AI box so so what is

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:44,040
exactly you know the problem of today's

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:48,180
generation you know like our college

00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:50,489
generation so students from India's like

00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:52,590
not exactly from India but students from

00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:55,289
different parts of the world have one

00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:57,930
major problem with them so that is you

00:00:55,289 --> 00:01:00,800
know getting a computer that is powerful

00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:04,500
enough not per that's powerful enough to

00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:06,720
walk on their experiments and get the

00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,299
expected outputs and results in a

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:12,030
sufficient time so not everybody can buy

00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:14,520
a supercomputer or not every college can

00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:16,950
buy a supercomputer so it involves a lot

00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:20,390
of cost a lot of energy and lots of

00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:25,170
space right so we're very thankful

00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:27,720
thankful to IBM to provide us with IBM

00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:31,380
power line processor so we were able to

00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:34,860
put forth put together a system which

00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:39,570
could be able to I know like simulate

00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:41,790
the powers of a supercomputer so we here

00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:42,990
at object automation software solutions

00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:46,350
are trying to combine these two

00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:48,869
momentous assets with various other

00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:51,360
solutions into a low-cost development

00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:53,790
system so this would be of great help to

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,310
students in like you know suburban

00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:58,140
districts and you know rural areas you

00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:00,060
know come up with their ideas and their

00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:02,850
experiments for the betterment of the

00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:06,420
world so this system is a power-packed

00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:10,960
AI box accelerated with NVIDIA GPUs so

00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:14,470
we've used NVIDIA GTX 2070 so

00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:16,390
that was also provided to us and instant

00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:19,000
development of interface and of the bill

00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:21,580
upon solutions so that enterprises or

00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,470
organizations can supply their solutions

00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:28,270
generating a fully efficient trained

00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:31,450
model okay so this will be demonstrated

00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:36,220
to you in shortly so the system that we

00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:38,290
develop a toy was powered by IBM power 9

00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:41,890
processor which were which was four core

00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:46,180
and it was also powered by NVIDIA

00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:47,980
GeForce r-tx 2070 GPU so Nvidia was kind

00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:50,740
enough to provide us with the libraries

00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:54,460
that would help us to integrate with the

00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:56,140
wraptor motherboard which Blackbird it's

00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:58,180
the version called Blackbird it's like

00:02:56,140 --> 00:03:01,210
you know like the basic version which

00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:06,430
would support for Co 4 core power 9 CPU

00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:09,490
so and we used a 16 GB ddr4 ECC server

00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:12,490
RAM and two slots of it so it would

00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:16,030
become 32 GB so the total drink costs us

00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:19,180
around like three thousand dollars a

00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:22,840
little below three thousand dollars so

00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:25,440
this system was able to you know

00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:28,810
generate models and train models

00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:30,970
efficiently that of supercomputers so

00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:36,610
like not like close to a supercomputer

00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:38,890
so now my friend audit will explain you

00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:43,440
the MN is the experiment for a step by

00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:46,090
step project on how to you know like

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,830
identify handwriting so most of the

00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:50,560
problems that we have nowadays you know

00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:52,930
like so in some countries students are

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,780
allowed to take notes in laptops and

00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:57,970
their phones but most of the countries

00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:59,440
it's handwritten so like with the fast

00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:02,410
moving world and everything

00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:05,650
so like handwritten notes are not

00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:08,530
possible for each and everybody so we

00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:12,010
are going to develop a model which could

00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:16,000
understand a human handwritten sentence

00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:19,060
or a word or any language by inputting

00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,340
different datasets into it and combining

00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:24,550
it through the IBM power

00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:29,290
processor and come with an outcome where

00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:32,440
the CPU can tell you how confident it is

00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:34,720
on which word or which number or which

00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:38,580
you know like any language whichever it

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:43,600
is so like we are going to explain using

00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:49,990
the power 9 processor experiment tool so

00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:51,100
audit will continue good afternoon

00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:52,810
everyone

00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:55,150
Matt I'm doing my mechanical engineering

00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:57,160
BTech back in India and I'm at a

00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:59,410
university so I'm going to do a small

00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:02,050
small demonstration on the MSD

00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:05,290
experiment using the power a I wishing

00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:08,470
tool so power AI vision tool is

00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:10,570
basically a image processing tool it

00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:12,130
processes images and videos it points

00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:14,260
out objects it detects objects and

00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:16,240
categorizes images on its own based on

00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:19,090
how it tree in the model over here so

00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,460
the four basic steps involved in in

00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:23,320
power AI vision tool would be creating

00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:25,330
the database dataset first and then we

00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:28,030
prepare the data and we train the model

00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:31,140
and deploy the model for our use in web

00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:33,400
applications and mobile applications so

00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:35,350
the first step would be creating a

00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:37,120
dataset as you can see there's a small

00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:38,770
box in the top left corner saying that

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,560
create new data city you can drag all

00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:43,090
your database data images and you know

00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:46,750
drop it over there so that the data set

00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:48,640
automatically gets created this second

00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:50,169
step would be preparing the data set so

00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:53,229
as I told you I'm going to take the MN

00:05:50,169 --> 00:05:55,450
IHT as an example for this so it's a pre

00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:57,610
pre pre made data set you can see all

00:05:55,450 --> 00:06:00,760
the images of number 5 written in

00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:02,350
different styles by different people so

00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:05,289
the first step for preparing the data

00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:07,479
set would be select the image which you

00:06:05,289 --> 00:06:09,100
have been added to create the data set

00:06:07,479 --> 00:06:10,660
and then this nominal option for layer

00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:12,430
labeling the objects will say like that

00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:14,139
and then you go to this page where

00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:16,270
you'll find the in the top for

00:06:14,139 --> 00:06:18,190
categorizing so you select five category

00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:19,930
as this is a five select five over there

00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:21,389
so the image automatic is categorized

00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:23,950
into five categories

00:06:21,389 --> 00:06:26,320
similarly select every image of that

00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:27,400
five category and then you prepare the

00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,260
data set in a similar way by

00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,700
categorizing each number into their own

00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:32,710
category this five or six or seven

00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:34,789
whatever the number number might be and

00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:36,169
the next step would be training the mode

00:06:34,789 --> 00:06:38,210
there's a small button the top-left

00:06:36,169 --> 00:06:40,490
corner saying trade model simply click

00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:45,020
on click on the button and it takes you

00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:46,729
to the next page here you find two two

00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:48,229
options the first one is image

00:06:46,729 --> 00:06:50,629
classification and the other one is

00:06:48,229 --> 00:06:52,669
object detection here the MSD model is

00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:54,439
going to use image classification as we

00:06:52,669 --> 00:06:56,990
basically classify the image which we

00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:59,900
get into which number it is so we said

00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:01,629
image classification option and then in

00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:03,889
the bottom will find Advanced Options

00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:06,289
there you can select your iterations

00:07:03,889 --> 00:07:08,029
your intervals your learning rate etc

00:07:06,289 --> 00:07:09,469
based on your needs and then simply

00:07:08,029 --> 00:07:13,129
click on the Train button in the bottom

00:07:09,469 --> 00:07:15,319
so here the tool automatically trains

00:07:13,129 --> 00:07:17,779
the model learns the images and prepares

00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:19,759
prepares the model so next step would be

00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:21,409
going to the models a model section in

00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,419
the top you click on the model section

00:07:21,409 --> 00:07:25,430
you can find our trained the training

00:07:23,419 --> 00:07:27,860
time for this this Emma HD mode has

00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:30,229
approximately 60,000 images and it takes

00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:30,710
around 15 to 20 minutes to attain the

00:07:30,229 --> 00:07:32,120
model

00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:33,740
so once the model has been trained

00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,830
you'll find the trained model in the

00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:38,569
models list you simply select the model

00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:39,919
you'll be taken to this page and then

00:07:38,569 --> 00:07:42,560
the next step would be deploying the

00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:44,150
model so once you deploy the model you

00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,550
will find it in the deployed models list

00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:48,139
in the top section over there so upper

00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:49,400
the models been deployed the deployment

00:07:48,139 --> 00:07:51,830
of the model take around 2 to 3 minutes

00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:55,430
in the in this tool so click on the MHD

00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:59,779
model option over there and then you can

00:07:55,430 --> 00:08:00,860
test your even test your model yeah so

00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:03,770
there's an option for dropping files

00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:05,479
over you simply drop any image any other

00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:07,370
image like you write number 5 on your

00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:09,400
paper and then give it give it a give it

00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:12,080
as an input to test the image and the

00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:14,349
tool automatically detects for example

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:17,210
I've taken an image of 0 from Google and

00:08:14,349 --> 00:08:19,310
I've put it in the box and then it

00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:21,860
automatically says it's the category is

00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:23,870
zero with confidence 0.96 there is 96%

00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:26,360
confidence so that's how this Tool Works

00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:29,810
and you'll also find an API link over

00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:31,460
there which this link can be used to it

00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:33,289
in your web applications and mobile

00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:35,240
applications to link with this model

00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:37,849
this can be used in your phones and

00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:40,550
other applications so basically this how

00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:43,149
the Tool Works thank you now Warren

00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:43,149
we'll be continuing

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:52,020
so the time taken for this experiment

00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:54,660
that was told by audit was by a four

00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:57,570
core power line processor so the time

00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:59,610
would be reduced by half it would be if

00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:02,280
it would be you know like used with

00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:04,080
Raptor Talos motherboard that was

00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,890
explained yesterday I don't think

00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,770
they're here now

00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:08,460
but talus motherboard was put together

00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:11,670
yesterday

00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:17,360
so we also asked them to you know like

00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:17,360
they helped us here to experience the

00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:25,560
CPU there so we tested and her time was

00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:29,760
reduced to like 65% it was efficient

00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:31,380
than this this time taken so the next

00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,890
thing would be so what are the

00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:36,420
applications of power a itools so we all

00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:40,860
know that breast cancer has been

00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:44,280
becoming a very important issue in lieu

00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:46,470
of women safety so because many women

00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:48,720
and mothers all across the world have

00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:51,210
been you know put through a lot of

00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:54,180
stress through their young age and

00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:56,550
they're also like 95% of the women are

00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:58,470
also working as on par with men so

00:09:56,550 --> 00:10:01,890
compared to their stress levels and

00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:03,450
their healthy habits they do not have

00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:05,940
time to take care of themselves so

00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:08,820
breast cancer is becoming an issue day

00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:12,570
by day so but most of them do not you

00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:15,810
know like ya know like they have this

00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:18,270
cancer or something so CT scans would

00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:21,240
not prove effective in some cases

00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:24,120
because breast cancer can wage from you

00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:27,230
know like state zero to stage four it is

00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:29,640
very very difficult to you know like

00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:30,720
understand like what is the complexity

00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:33,660
of the situation

00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:36,840
so our povery a vision tool can use

00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:39,300
image rendering to scan the tissues

00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:41,810
through a CT scan and then tell you

00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:44,790
where the lumps are present so like

00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:47,000
where the cancerous cells and tissues

00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:50,310
are reproducing at a very faster rate

00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:54,690
you know and what would be the

00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:57,330
effective countermeasure or a prevention

00:10:54,690 --> 00:11:00,240
or cure method for that because select a

00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:03,420
stage zero stage for like stage zero

00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,640
would they imply you know heating and

00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:08,640
such thing but stage four would involve

00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:10,770
chemotherapy so the intensity will be

00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:14,070
given out the results will be given out

00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:17,400
by the system and the other application

00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:19,800
is diabetes level detection from retinal

00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:21,839
scans this also uses image rendering so

00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:24,170
one might ask how would the image

00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:29,460
rendering help in finding the diabetic

00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:32,010
level of a individual so like if you see

00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:35,460
any diabetic person so oh like diabetes

00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:38,520
causes the retinal tissues of us to

00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:42,930
dilate so dilate means like basically

00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:45,420
like a person with more diabetes than a

00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:48,210
non diabetic person would have dilated

00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:51,390
pupils unless and otherwise he gets his

00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:56,010
eyes he or she gets her eyes checked

00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:57,810
regularly and dilates the pupil so our

00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:59,880
cavalry eye vision would be able to

00:11:57,810 --> 00:12:02,730
capture an image select you have to feed

00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:05,040
in an image of your eye a high-res image

00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:08,970
of your eye and the power I wish and

00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:12,930
tool would be able to categorize it on

00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:15,000
how dilated the pupil is and how tensed

00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:17,460
like you know like what are the tension

00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:21,480
present on the vessels blood vessels so

00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:23,100
you can see there so that like you can

00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:25,980
see some sort of a yellow filter right

00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:27,720
so a diabetic persons like highly

00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:30,710
diabetic persons would be subjected to

00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:34,380
this such conditions so this could be

00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:37,440
characterized or you know like found

00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:40,020
easily without power-i tool and another

00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,180
measure would be industrial safety

00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:44,190
measures so this would be using image

00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:47,220
rendering using the power line processor

00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:49,440
so most of the workers who are working

00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:51,870
in mining and construction businesses

00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,910
are subject to unsafe and unclean

00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:56,980
environments so like on the outs

00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:59,140
they all seem seem so rosy and

00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:00,610
everything but on the inside most of

00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:03,510
them do not get provided with the

00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:07,570
necessary safety equipments like helmets

00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:10,090
radiation tag and gloves and boots and

00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:13,540
everything so our email video rendering

00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:16,930
/ processing power through power 9

00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:19,000
processor would be able to detect the

00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:21,820
body posture and you know like you have

00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,220
to previously given the data sets of the

00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:26,350
helmet and whatever the industry is

00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:28,360
according to the industry you have to

00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:30,820
previously determined what are the

00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:33,790
safety equipments that people need to

00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:38,950
know where for their own safety so

00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:40,960
through live image rendering our power a

00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:44,680
efficient tool would be able to tell

00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:47,380
which worker is not wearing which part

00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:50,230
of the safety equipment so this would be

00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:53,110
helpful for both the company and the

00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:56,200
worker for the worker in terms of his

00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:58,120
face or her health issues and for the

00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:01,870
company by saving them a lot of money

00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:06,400
from insurance camps right so the last

00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:07,540
and the least is automatic attendance

00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:10,570
marking system through facial

00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:14,260
recognition so this might not seem that

00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:17,310
much of a like application but still

00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:20,350
this is a very important part because

00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:22,660
when you go to college okay so like

00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:25,630
stars mark attendance period voice are

00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:27,940
always right so some college there are

00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:29,650
biometrics but not our do or not all

00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:32,800
colleges have biometric attendance

00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:35,530
system but all colleges do have CCTV

00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,820
closed-circuit television cameras for

00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:40,300
security purposes

00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:43,830
so our povery i wishin could enable the

00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:47,800
CCTV cameras in each and every classroom

00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:50,740
to identify each and every student but

00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:53,590
this would involve like a half an hour

00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:55,090
of predetermined because so like each

00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:59,710
and every person has to be scanned

00:14:55,090 --> 00:15:01,720
through the body so their face would be

00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:03,670
captured extracted and it would be

00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:05,020
stored in a database where each and

00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:06,920
every one would have different

00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:09,620
structures because

00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:11,389
unless and until they're twins unless

00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:13,610
and until they're twins we could just

00:15:11,389 --> 00:15:16,250
mark attendance for everybody and in

00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:17,269
every case if they're Prince then lucky

00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:21,860
them

00:15:17,269 --> 00:15:24,050
so the last and the least is ongoing

00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:25,850
work and future plans so we've been

00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:27,920
working on this project for like four

00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:30,050
months now and our future plans would be

00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:33,410
testing the AI box with other cars like

00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:36,110
zhiling salvia you 200 and nvidia gtx

00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:38,750
980ti so we were not able to find

00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:41,420
libraries for gtx 980ti

00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:44,839
but we were able to find ceilings for

00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:46,760
zhiling salvia you 200 and the other

00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:49,279
would be taking any solutions to the

00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:53,120
edge on the next level ultra 96 board

00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:55,040
and which would know like smooth or not

00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:59,240
the process that we are having right now

00:15:55,040 --> 00:16:02,260
by 45 percent efficiency totally like in

00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:04,820
a total time and we are also working to

00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:07,070
working on collaborating with industries

00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:09,589
on exploring how AI can be useful in

00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:12,410
different sectors so a could be useful

00:16:09,589 --> 00:16:15,019
from farming to medical to industry to

00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:19,279
education surrogate has a very vast use

00:16:15,019 --> 00:16:21,560
and the last building and implementing a

00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:24,890
and edge computing curriculum for

00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:29,660
schools and universities because and the

00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:33,199
fast developing world AI is going to be

00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:35,149
the future so to schools and colleges

00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:37,610
should be notified of what are the

00:16:35,149 --> 00:16:39,860
changes that are being made and students

00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:43,640
should be able to given be given the

00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:47,449
chance for being a part of it so we are

00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:52,149
happy to have this opportunity and thank

00:16:47,449 --> 00:16:52,149
you so much any questions can be asked

00:16:55,269 --> 00:17:00,380
many questions if not I've got one you

00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:07,910
got one okay you can go first

00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:10,400
nice it so my question is basically on

00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:13,040
power AI patient and I understand it as

00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:16,130
a software that can runs on power

00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:18,410
yes open power servers so basically my

00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:21,110
question is do I need to to code any

00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:22,760
kind of algorithm in order to yes of

00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:25,760
course you need to code for everything

00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:28,370
so like each and every software disk you

00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:31,910
know like requires different kinds of

00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:33,770
coding levels so like our attendance

00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:36,500
calculation system and the safety

00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:38,830
measure calculation system are like both

00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:41,360
nearly the same but it would require

00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:43,880
more calibration in case of the

00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,650
industrial safety equipment system so

00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:49,100
like you have to code differently so

00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:51,110
like you have to have the person with

00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:53,150
the skill set to develop our AI vision

00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:58,299
okay so for example I can use the the

00:17:53,150 --> 00:18:01,669
Yolo framework so can I use the yellow

00:17:58,299 --> 00:18:04,040
pencil flow yeah you could use

00:18:01,669 --> 00:18:07,159
tensorflow but you cannot use tensorflow

00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:08,929
in like all aspects so like you could

00:18:07,159 --> 00:18:11,450
use tensor flow in experiments which

00:18:08,929 --> 00:18:13,250
require and which can be used with

00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:15,020
tensor flow button all or not all

00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:17,000
experiments can be used with tens of a I

00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:19,520
guess okay and in the platform I can

00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,929
change the parameters for my model

00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,030
oh yeah of course you can change your

00:18:20,929 --> 00:18:24,740
parameters so like if you come up with

00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:27,140
an experiment an experiment can be

00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:30,980
turned into select people have you know

00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:33,020
like experience and in cases where they

00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:36,049
were aiming for a product but that

00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:38,510
product was not attained totally but

00:18:36,049 --> 00:18:40,730
they obtained with a totally different

00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:41,809
expected output which turned out to be a

00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:44,809
huge success

00:18:41,809 --> 00:18:47,120
like the UMD with like Universal Media

00:18:44,809 --> 00:18:48,799
disc with the PlayStation Portable like

00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:52,070
have you seen the small series discs

00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:54,919
right so PlayStation Portable CDs are

00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:57,679
like like half the size of a normal CD

00:18:54,919 --> 00:18:59,900
but it turned out to be a failure but

00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:02,990
still it is a very very good use of

00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:04,250
compact discs so yeah you could change

00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:05,690
the model parameters

00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:10,910
end up with a hoe totally different

00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:14,540
product yes sure you got a crime an ass

00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:16,580
mine on the way over as you were working

00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:18,440
with power AI vision was there anything

00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:20,600
that you encountered that could be

00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:22,250
improved that could be made better you

00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:24,170
know what sort of problems did you

00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:26,570
encounter and what sort of feedback

00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:30,560
would you have to the product owners

00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:33,410
okay so the product owners hats off the

00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:34,820
product is amazing and I don't think we

00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:36,920
have any problem with the power 9

00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:39,950
processor except for the price maybe

00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:42,020
which could be lower down a bit so the

00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:46,850
only problem that we faced while we were

00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:49,430
developing the output was we had a lot

00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:52,250
of errors in the coding and you know

00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:53,960
like it would be possible for us to you

00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:57,380
know like you have to learn and only you

00:19:53,960 --> 00:20:00,230
have to rectify it right so correcting

00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:03,470
like the user interface for the all the

00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:05,060
tools were also a bit of a challenge for

00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:06,890
us because we like you liked a

00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:10,310
self-taught and you know like YouTube

00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:14,270
videos are our only way of learning so

00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:19,210
it's a very helpful tool so the

00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:21,470
confidence level you know like power AI

00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:23,420
the confidence level was the only

00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:26,510
problem for us because so like we would

00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:29,810
give an input of a 5 so which would look

00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:32,360
like a 2 but it was a 5 but the computer

00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:35,990
was so confident that it was a zero like

00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:37,900
447 percentage so that was our only

00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:41,510
problem so like we don't have any

00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:43,390
problem with the owners like the making

00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:47,170
of the product with the onus thank you

00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:47,170
