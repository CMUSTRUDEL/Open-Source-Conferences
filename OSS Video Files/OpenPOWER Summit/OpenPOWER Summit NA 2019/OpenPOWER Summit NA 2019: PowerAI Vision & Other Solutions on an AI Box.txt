We, here at Object Automation Software Solutions Pvt Ltd are trying to combine these two momentous assets with various other solutions into a low-cost development system. This system is a power-packed AI box accelerated with NVIDIA GPUs and connected with XILINX Alveo U200 board for easy and instant deployment or inference of the build upon solutions so that enterprises or organizations can rapidly deploy their solutions generating a fully optimized and efficient performance.

This will enable students, faculties and industries to experience the ease of developing solutions leveraging Artificial Intelligence capabilities with tools like PowerAI Vision and many others on a low cost development system powered by IBM and supported by NVIDIA and XILINX, also, opening up plenty of opportunities for developers to build solutions on top of this system.
