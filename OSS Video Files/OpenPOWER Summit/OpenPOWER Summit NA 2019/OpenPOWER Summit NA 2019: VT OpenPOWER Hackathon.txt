Description: 
	Presented by Robert Settlage, Virginia Tech

In Spring of 2019, Virginia Tech hosted an OpenPOWER Hackathon with the aim of showing users how the PowerAI ecosystem can accelerate AI/DL frameworks with little to no modifications.  Many of the students that signed up for the Hackathon were new to Linux and HPC.  As a limited duration Hackathon with a goal of using the PowerAI toolset, it was important to get new users into the Power system quickly.  Here we will discuss the Open OnDemand platform that allows for creating custom GUIs and portals of entry into HPC systems.  We will show how this system allowed users to focus more on the Hackathon topic and give summaries of the winning projects and acceleration results achieved.
