Title: OpenPOWER Summit NA 2019: Enabling SQL to FPGA Using HLS for Filtering Stream Data Transformations
Publication date: 2019-08-20
Playlist: OpenPOWER Summit NA 2019
Description: 
	Presented by Erwin de Haan, Delft University of Technology

This talk discusses automating the transpiling of SQL to High-Level Synthesis C++ to generate hardware for filtering and data stream transformations using CAPI on POWER systems. This work uses the Fletcher framework to automate the handling of data movement between memory and the FPGA. The use of HLS technologies can greatly reduce the development time of FPGAs compared to manual FPGA development workflows. 

Deploying FPGAs in fast changing data processing pipelines, can be very complicated or limit the use of the FPGA hardware. This work investigates if HLS is good enough for these kinds of applications to meaningfully reduce total development time while still maintaining performance. Additionally, the use of the Fletcher framework further reduces required developer time.
