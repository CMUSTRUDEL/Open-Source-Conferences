00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:06,420
Timothy Pearson from my Raptor computing

00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:09,559
systems here to talk about open power

00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:12,830
motor control computing and the future

00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:16,859
so wide to start off with a with a brief

00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:19,050
recap of why we chose open power now to

00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:20,279
three years ago one of the primary

00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,350
reasons we're doing this was the fact

00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:24,630
that we could actually offer secure

00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:29,010
computing products we have full source

00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:31,500
code for all firmware we have no

00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:34,500
reliance and external vendor signing

00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,300
keys so this means that you have full

00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,370
control of your data at all times and

00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,960
these open power machines that's that's

00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:41,540
something that most of the players in

00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,430
the industry do not offer at this time

00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:46,500
and as far as we can tell do not have

00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:48,899
plans to so if you want full control of

00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:52,620
a system the open power is the best way

00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:54,120
to do that that implies that the vendor

00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:57,420
has no way to override your control at

00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:59,910
any point if this these systems are

00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:02,219
actually compatible with the wraptor

00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:04,769
flex fara security technology that's

00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:06,240
expected to become available in 2020 and

00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:10,049
that technology will go ahead and

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:12,990
probably revolutionize the the actual

00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:18,000
harbor resilience against both remote

00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:19,920
and local unauthorized access these CPUs

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,979
are very high performance these are

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,530
easily the the most high-performance

00:01:21,979 --> 00:01:28,380
odor control CPUs on the market today

00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:32,100
the ready availability of documentation

00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:33,540
of source code means that you can debug

00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:37,590
your custom hardware and software

00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:39,299
solutions rapidly very precisely all of

00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:41,340
these systems ship with the full source

00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:44,040
code we provide schematics for our

00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:46,290
systems to further enable additional

00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:49,829
hardware module development system

00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:51,500
development obviously as has been

00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:54,509
touched on by a few presentations before

00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:58,770
one of power nines key strengths right

00:01:54,509 --> 00:02:00,960
now is its IO bandwidth I the power 9

00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:03,210
was the first CPU with generation 4 that

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,030
enabled us to be the first om in the

00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:09,060
world the ship power to ship PCIe Gen 4

00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:10,590
systems and the way that IBM was

00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:14,500
designed the module has allowed that to

00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:16,950
be a resourcing actually fully you

00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:19,720
there's no choke point inside the system

00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:23,380
where you're not able to really saturate

00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:27,400
those gen4 links in addition iBM has

00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:29,380
shown a great focus on security you've

00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,910
ever heard about rogue DMA attacks and

00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:32,620
things like that these systems were

00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:33,730
designed in such a way they had it's

00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:36,220
going to be very difficult to execute

00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:38,020
those and that's again another area

00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:42,400
where I have shown that leadership and

00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:45,310
dealing with the PCI systems but all

00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,630
that being said PCIe latency is still

00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:48,989
going to be a problem especially idea

00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:52,120
with accelerators we haven't seen a

00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:54,190
coherent bus for probably over a decade

00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,709
at this point that is open for everyone

00:02:54,190 --> 00:03:00,580
to use so can we do better than 10 PC a

00:02:56,709 --> 00:03:03,730
Gen 4 yes we can it's been touched down

00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:04,930
earlier we do have open Cappy this is

00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:07,989
actually been something has been in the

00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:10,239
works for a long time and is it

00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:11,830
available today on other servers but

00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,690
these are very high end machines it's

00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:17,860
very difficult to get your hands on the

00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:19,510
development hardware and what's

00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:20,950
interesting about open canopy is most of

00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:23,769
these other competing solutions is that

00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:25,870
when it's coupled with the power CPU you

00:03:23,769 --> 00:03:30,670
can again retain those full owner

00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:33,489
control and open advantages so like to

00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:35,440
announce our new Condor platform this is

00:03:33,489 --> 00:03:38,950
a single socket legrange module system

00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:41,440
it has four standard PC agent slots it

00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:43,900
has eight ddr4 memory slots and the key

00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,359
feature here is that open capping memory

00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:48,400
slot this is a standard ATX form factor

00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:51,730
machine we're expecting to have general

00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,470
availability quarter one 20 20 and is

00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:54,730
the case with all of our products this

00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:57,100
machine is fully owned and controlled

00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:58,989
fully blood-free chips of schematics

00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:01,090
this is ideal if you actually want to go

00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:03,640
ahead and develop and accelerate a

00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:06,609
solution if you want to experiment with

00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:08,680
the idea of coherent memory attach of

00:04:06,609 --> 00:04:12,670
literally extending that processor to

00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:14,500
support your custom workload in summary

00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:16,150
owner control computing is already at a

00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:19,419
point where it is practical for daily

00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:20,950
use we have best apps obviously the

00:04:19,419 --> 00:04:24,159
great partners in the open power

00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:26,470
ecosystem in addition to us is servers

00:04:24,159 --> 00:04:27,490
replacement parts are becoming readily

00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:29,199
available

00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:32,259
just as the air with the x86 machines

00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:34,090
that dominate the industry right now we

00:04:32,259 --> 00:04:37,300
have mainstream open OS application

00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:40,120
support at this time that means that if

00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:42,130
you if you use the standard Linux distro

00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:44,470
any of the major distros you're gonna

00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:45,970
see that this power port if you use for

00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:50,080
instance FreeBSD you can see as a power

00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:52,150
port there too and to be quite honest

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,960
the futures futures looking looking

00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:55,389
great

00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,849
there's it's about to get a whole lot

00:04:55,389 --> 00:05:00,550
better there's a major announcement it's

00:04:57,849 --> 00:05:01,810
going to occur it tomorrow and I can't

00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:03,820
say any more about it right now

00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:05,440
but if you're interested in these topics

00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:07,479
in terms to high-performance honor

00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,690
control computing if you're interested

00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:13,389
in developing hardware and software

00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:16,539
around power then you definitely want to

00:05:13,389 --> 00:05:18,190
not miss that announcement tomorrow I'd

00:05:16,539 --> 00:05:21,340
like to invite you all to come and visit

00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:22,960
our booth s2 we have a couple of

00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:26,110
demonstration machines running right now

00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:29,530
we actually have Unreal Tournament four

00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:32,289
which is one of Epic Games next

00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:35,470
up-and-coming flagship game titles

00:05:32,289 --> 00:05:37,870
running on power you can see firsthand

00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:42,250
how easy it is to switch from your

00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:44,430
current hardware to power and but also

00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:47,520
I'd to invite you to take a look at our

00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:50,650
enterprise desktop line this is

00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:53,349
something that was announced partially

00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:56,590
in in Europe last year and we have

00:05:53,349 --> 00:05:58,479
Hardware here now demonstrating that you

00:05:56,590 --> 00:06:01,120
can use that hardware with with Red Hat

00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:04,250
Enterprise Linux especially well seven

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:10,189
and eight so thank you

00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:10,189
