00:00:08,179 --> 00:00:14,219
the open power developer conquers

00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:15,660
something that I'm very excited about it

00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:18,500
is the first time we've gotten a group

00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:20,970
of developers together to focus in on

00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:22,769
how do you innovate on the power

00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:25,109
platform and what we're doing is

00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:26,730
bringing those developers together to

00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:29,010
get an opportunity to look at how they

00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,539
can use the power platform and do new

00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:32,669
things with it you know about a year and

00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:34,110
a half ago we said you know we really we

00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:36,719
really got to get to the application

00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:38,430
developers at the end of the day you

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,670
know we can build that hardware for

00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:43,170
people to have access to but it's what's

00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:46,020
going to change the market what's going

00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:49,410
to change buying decisions what's going

00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:52,680
to bring value to an end user or client

00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:54,510
is the applications but there's a reason

00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:57,120
that I want developers actually come to

00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:59,010
this developer Congress says right here

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:03,289
over the next two and a half days we

00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:03,289
have the IBM power 9 platform preview

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,330
for developers to start playing with

00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:12,090
it's an early version of the platform

00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:14,040
but it's a great opportunity to see how

00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:16,470
your code can work on the next

00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,270
generation platform and so if you look

00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:20,280
at the tracks that we've got set up you

00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:23,460
know they're developing having access to

00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,439
power technology that's a Nimbus Power

00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:28,470
technology that's an IBM super vessel

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,329
and in other places even locally on site

00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:31,680
here we've got power technology where

00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:34,079
they can do all this development that

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,869
they've done maybe in the past on x86

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:39,720
they can do it on power people being

00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:43,409
able to share their code and collaborate

00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,770
on it iterate on it do qa/qc make it

00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:46,229
better

00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,700
pulling bugs out of it faster than if

00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:49,920
somebody was doing that alone or a

00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:52,530
company was doing that alone that's why

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,210
it's important to developers and my view

00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:56,369
is why it's important to the marketplace

00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:59,250
in total is it's a new framework for

00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:00,630
driving innovation and it's a pretty

00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,310
nice place that we're at here you know

00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:05,280
we've got the Palace Hotel in downtown

00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:07,020
San Francisco you know a lot of very

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,399
good amenities in addition to a great

00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,789
hotel we've got you know nice

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,120
entertainment and evening

00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:16,239
special events so we want to start off

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,980
with a flagship you know it's really you

00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,150
know sweeten the pot up with everyone so

00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:22,000
they would really tell us what they

00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:24,189
think actually I'm here mostly for the

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,049
open PMT stuff and just curious

00:02:24,189 --> 00:02:28,239
interested in seeing where that's going

00:02:26,049 --> 00:02:30,670
you know what what directions is going

00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,349
what technologies is using I support

00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:34,750
both machine learning and HPC

00:02:32,349 --> 00:02:36,220
applications so I'm interested in one of

00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:38,650
the machine learning stuff the deep dive

00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:40,420
stuff I've got a lot of interest in the

00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:43,239
hardware in the open Cathy and Catherine

00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:44,349
staff I'll be following them and frankly

00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:45,879
the hardest thing is going to be

00:02:44,349 --> 00:02:47,590
deciding which one to go to because

00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:50,260
there's a lot of times there's two or

00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:51,609
three that overlap and interest I think

00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:53,920
the first dates going great

00:02:51,609 --> 00:02:56,159
we've had a lot of participation in the

00:02:53,920 --> 00:03:00,430
workshop around AI and machine learning

00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:02,260
spark data analytics and open BMC I

00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,819
think it's a great set up for the next

00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:06,430
two and a half days and I would

00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:08,260
encourage anybody to come on down we're

00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:10,480
letting people walk in and register so

00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:12,940
it's a great opportunity the agendas

00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,370
online on the open power foundation

00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:17,459
website and I think we're off to a great

00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:17,459
start

00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:23,550
you

00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:23,550
