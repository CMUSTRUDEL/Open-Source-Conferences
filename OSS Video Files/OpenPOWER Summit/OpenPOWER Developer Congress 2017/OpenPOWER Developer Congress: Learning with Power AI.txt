Howie eye is a collection of deep

00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:15,030
learning frameworks so we saw in the

00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:16,320
community a need for an easy access to

00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:18,570
these frameworks and we collect them all

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,789
together make it easy way to deploy easy

00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:23,130
way to consume them until it will

00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:26,160
develop our focus so power a I've just

00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:29,490
by itself is a it's basically all of the

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,470
major frameworks and toolkits for

00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:33,450
machine learning kind of you know maybe

00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:36,059
put together into a single package the

00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:37,920
open powers about openness right we open

00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:40,430
the hardware we've opened firmware we've

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,739
got the open BMC teams you know

00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:45,629
demonstrating that so Howie I is all

00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:48,570
open source we've just made it easier to

00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:50,010
consume our demonstration was kind of

00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:52,230
partnered with Nimbus for the

00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:54,960
infrastructure Nimbus has power AI

00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:56,629
docker containers on the cloud so all

00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,489
the students were able to connect on

00:00:56,629 --> 00:01:01,710
online under the cloud with up with

00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:03,619
Aparri I instance you know within a

00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:05,850
couple clicks and then we walked through

00:01:03,619 --> 00:01:09,030
Jupiter notebook that showed some

00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:11,250
financial prediction and analysis based

00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,750
on a couple different factors what we

00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:15,360
really hope that you know everybody gets

00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:17,430
out of everything that we do together is

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,350
that you know really focus on your

00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:21,420
science instead of on the DevOps of how

00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:23,130
to set everything up because you know

00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,360
between the work that IBM is done in

00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:26,820
power AI and the work that nimac has

00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,670
done on integrating power AI it's really

00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:31,170
very much turnkey so the expectation for

00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:32,430
for data science and for machine

00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:34,290
learning you know scientists should

00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:36,119
should be that they can just go right in

00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:38,159
and do their science and that's what we

00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:39,960
really hope that people see that these

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,140
types of tools are now available in the

00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:45,720
cloud but the whole concept of using the

00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:48,210
training sets and going to the flow

00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:50,820
building you know cleaning the model to

00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:52,860
look nice patterns in the end all go

00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:54,570
back to the feature set but it's text or

00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:56,850
image there can barn from a text

00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:59,280
perspective because we have a lot of

00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:00,790
costs being generated and we can work

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,760
that the holes to the text

00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:06,910
and we want to use that text in from the

00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:09,790
text identify whether this call was good

00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:12,250
bad how to convert what a sentiment to

00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:14,320
the calls and we use that for figuring

00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:16,120
out the quality of the call and being

00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,620
able to really play with it at home

00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,750
whether you're in the office you're at

00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:21,400
home there's definitely some unique

00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:23,170
capacities that you have to be able to

00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,020
really just develop this in your off

00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:27,670
time we want to make sure everybody

00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:29,650
knows the ease of access when it knows

00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:31,630
that the mimics platform is easy way of

00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:34,450
getting it but but also just like you

00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:36,490
know increase their knowledge in the

00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:38,320
industry of these of these tools and

00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:40,990
what we're working hard to do is to is

00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:43,060
to make power AI the standard for kind

00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:45,130
of the baseline for machine learning

00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:46,900
application so if you were building a

00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:48,400
machine learning application and you

00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,810
wouldn't have to go and figure out how

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,030
to put all the bits together you would

00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:54,280
simply start with a power AI container

00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:55,990
hopefully on mem bik's and then you

00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,730
would focus strictly on the code you're

00:02:55,990 --> 00:03:00,150
working regardless of which framework

00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:04,069
because supports them all

00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:06,129
