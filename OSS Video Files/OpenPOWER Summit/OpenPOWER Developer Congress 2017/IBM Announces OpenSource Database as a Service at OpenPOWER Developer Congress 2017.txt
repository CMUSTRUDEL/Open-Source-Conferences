00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:07,859
my name is Chuck Bryan I'm the

00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:10,620
open-source data solutions manager for

00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:11,910
the Power Systems team and I'm here this

00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,469
week accident we're here for the open

00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,599
power developer Congress so a very

00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:17,279
exciting event and we've used this as

00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,960
the venue to announce our new open

00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:21,330
platform for database-as-a-service

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,320
on power systems and there's been a lot

00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:23,850
of announcements there's going to be

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,529
other videos that you'll be able to see

00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:26,880
but what we found is that there's a

00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:28,349
number of questions that have come up

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,570
and what we like to do is address around

00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:32,219
three to four of those key questions

00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:35,660
that we've heard from across our

00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:35,660
community both internally and externally

00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:42,180
so one of the questions that we're

00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,260
getting is you know when people think

00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,820
about the cloud they think about

00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:47,160
database as a service it's primarily

00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,360
deployed on x86 servers in fact that is

00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,760
the default environment

00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:53,940
so why own power with significance of

00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,739
power again what we found is in working

00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,329
with the early clients and the telco

00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:59,070
industry communications industry

00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:01,050
healthcare industries and others they're

00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,670
looking to build out private cloud

00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:04,439
database that's a service offering so

00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:06,240
what they want to be able to offer to

00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:08,010
their internal developers and internal

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,020
line of businesses that same experience

00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:12,930
for developing a rich set of innovative

00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:15,869
applications on no SQL open source

00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:17,670
databases like Postgres SQL and

00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:19,619
others but as they've done that in the

00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:21,479
x86 environment what they found is that

00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:23,729
they're experienced in the x86 server

00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:25,350
sprawl so they've got literally hundreds

00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:27,630
of thousands of servers throughout their

00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:30,930
data centers providing support for

00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:33,360
databases but it's actually beginning to

00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:34,950
get out of control if you will so what

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,540
we're able to do with Power Systems and

00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,329
with our power servers and we'll be able

00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:41,820
to deliver up to 2x or greater price

00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:43,860
performance which translates to greater

00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:46,079
server density our clients are able to

00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:47,729
run up to two times the number of

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,770
database instances on each one of their

00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:51,630
servers those are rolling out database

00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:54,840
as a service what they're getting is

00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:58,430
great a greater density inside their IP

00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,430
environments and in x86

00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:06,250
so the other thing that we hear is you

00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,870
know really you know why does the

00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:10,030
platform matter because they just need

00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:12,400
you know basic levels of performance

00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:15,130
what we're finding is quite as clients

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,600
build these rich set of applications on

00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:19,330
top of an open source database like

00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:21,280
MongoDB for example there's high levels

00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:22,990
of concurrency in the application so

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,850
they need to be able to support a large

00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:28,600
number of users as well so a large

00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:30,700
number of i/o transactions very large

00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:32,890
memory bandwidth capabilities and with

00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:40,720
power we deliver superior capabilities

00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:42,160
to x86 in that regard so one of the key

00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,830
things that we're delivering with our

00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,900
new open platform for 4Â° as a service on

00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:48,970
power systems is this database as a

00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,620
service toolkit what that means is we're

00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:53,230
bringing together all the different

00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:54,940
components that are required to put

00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:57,280
together a private cloud database as a

00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:58,750
service infrastructure for a client to

00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,480
that facilitate that makes it very

00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:02,920
simple and easy for them to deploy a

00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:06,130
full-fledged database as a service

00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:09,190
platform for their organizations so we

00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:10,360
brought together the OpenStack elements

00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:13,060
that are required to build a cloud

00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:14,769
infrastructure we put together the

00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:16,390
database as a service set of services

00:03:14,769 --> 00:03:18,519
that are required by each of the open

00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:20,560
source databases like MongoDB Postgres

00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:22,840
and others and the beauty of doing that

00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,400
is if we can now provide a foundation

00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:26,680
where as they bring in additional and

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,720
multiple open-source databases they can

00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:31,739
do it with the same infrastructure and

00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,739
supports behind it

00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,810
so one of the key things about our

00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,860
offering our open platform for

00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:40,599
database-as-a-service

00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:42,340
is we're putting this together to

00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:45,010
support the open source databases that

00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:47,680
are out there like MongoDB Postgres SQL

00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:50,080
and others and so in the initial release

00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,120
that comes out we'll support five

00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:59,950
distinct community versions of the open

00:03:52,120 --> 00:04:02,860
source databases so MongoDB Postgres

00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:05,319
Maria Beebe MySQL and reddit so the

00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:07,239
community releases of those there are

00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:09,730
companies that provide commercial or

00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:11,410
enterprise class support around many of

00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:13,600
those packages as well so for example

00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:14,500
MongoDB provides the MongoDB enterprise

00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,320
EDB

00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:19,450
write provides a DB Postgres they

00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:21,340
provide enterprise support they provide

00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:23,770
additional packages and capabilities

00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:26,139
around the open source databases just as

00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:27,639
Red Hat does for Linux so then we'll

00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:30,310
also be supporting the enterprise

00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:32,500
versions of DB Postgres and others

00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:34,000
throughout the remainder of 2017 so

00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,650
another question that I found as I've

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,090
done the press interviews and I've

00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:39,220
talked to you know with clients and

00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:40,990
others around the announcements if

00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:42,789
database as a service was really born

00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:44,380
out of the public cloud environment so

00:04:42,789 --> 00:04:46,930
with Amazon and Google and Microsoft

00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:49,180
Azure we're providing the first

00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:50,740
enterprise class private cloud database

00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:53,169
as a service offering for customers

00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:55,450
we'll put inside their data centers and

00:04:53,169 --> 00:04:56,800
so that's what makes this unique is the

00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:59,979
private cloud database as a service

00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,500
platform that the IT organizations can

00:04:59,979 --> 00:05:04,090
use as a turnkey solution to build their

00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:06,700
own open-source database as a service

00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:08,020
infrastructure for the end user and the

00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,729
lines of business that are developing

00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:12,430
rich new applications so now we're

00:05:09,729 --> 00:05:14,380
making it very consumable for these

00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:16,630
lines of businesses for the enterprise

00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:19,180
client and why is that important it's

00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:21,039
because 80% of the data that that

00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:22,600
organizations have and that they use are

00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,010
really inside their own data centers

00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,020
they're not putting that out in the

00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:28,030
public cloud environment so one of the

00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:30,460
key characteristics and capabilities

00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:32,320
that we provide is for them to be able

00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:34,240
to treat that sensitive data whether

00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,340
it's script government or regulatory or

00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,139
compliance reasons and keep it on

00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:40,350
premise and not how to expose it public

00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:40,350
cloud

00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,229
we see with what we've been able to do

00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:49,850
with our new open database as a service

00:05:47,229 --> 00:05:51,949
platform on power systems it's really

00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:54,110
the first as a service offering for

00:05:51,949 --> 00:05:55,820
power systems and most people want to

00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:58,190
consume in more of a cloud model that's

00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:59,509
that's been very clear to us and in a

00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:01,100
cloud model that they can do within

00:05:59,509 --> 00:06:02,930
their their own data centers in the

00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:04,850
private cloud environment so I can

00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:07,370
envision where we could take rich new

00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:10,250
offerings like our power AI capabilities

00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:11,509
it requires you know data store and data

00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:14,090
models underneath and we have its

00:06:11,509 --> 00:06:15,830
clients today who are using MongoDB for

00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:18,800
example underneath their power AI

00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:21,039
applications and others so I would look

00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,330
for many of our new innovative

00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:25,460
applications and capabilities that be

00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:28,060
delivered in this as a service and cloud

00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:28,060
environment

00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:36,350
