00:00:04,439 --> 00:00:12,450
this week at developer Congress in San

00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:15,490
Francisco we're gonna learn a lot I

00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:17,349
think the crew has done everything

00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:21,669
possible to put on the best possible

00:00:17,349 --> 00:00:25,839
show provide the right tracks the right

00:00:21,669 --> 00:00:28,689
level focus given technology access the

00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:31,149
ecosystem jumped in to help us put this

00:00:28,689 --> 00:00:33,790
together I think in this developer

00:00:31,149 --> 00:00:35,500
Congress what's really unique is the

00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:38,980
fact that we have early versions of

00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:41,679
power 9 for people to hack build code

00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:45,719
try out and I know you had a big hand in

00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:48,699
getting that done and that's meaningful

00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:51,070
exposure right that's the average

00:00:48,699 --> 00:00:52,870
developer doesn't have access to a power

00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:54,730
9 system right now so those are the

00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:56,019
things you know and a lead-in to your

00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:58,210
questions that's what we need to

00:00:56,019 --> 00:01:00,909
continue to recreate we need to create

00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:03,070
opportunities for the developers to see

00:01:00,909 --> 00:01:04,659
the cutting-edge technology that's

00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:06,850
coming out of the ecosystem we're

00:01:04,659 --> 00:01:10,180
building and how they may be able to

00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:11,410
consume it so from my perspective and

00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:13,750
then I'll throw the question right back

00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:17,980
at you but from my perspective I'd like

00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:20,650
to see smaller more frequent developer

00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:22,540
congress's or called hackathons and I'd

00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:24,880
love some of the working groups to be

00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:27,730
their own catalyst which is hey we need

00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:30,100
to do one on genomics it's going to

00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:32,890
happen at Jon hobby it's going to be 30

00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:34,630
people and by the way I want a power 9

00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:37,150
because we're going to spend a day on it

00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:39,610
and and you're gonna have to get one out

00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:43,330
there Brian but that's what I think what

00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:46,450
do you think yeah I think I I think that

00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:49,180
having a event like we're having it's

00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:52,870
great I mean as the first event really

00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:54,310
to get a lot of these foundation leaders

00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:56,680
to understand see what the developers

00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:58,750
are doing getting their feedback

00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:03,210
you know what's working what's not

00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:06,820
working and then and then take this to

00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:09,069
much more reachable avenues I think we

00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:11,890
do need to have more and more hands on

00:02:09,069 --> 00:02:13,540
developers and you just can't say you've

00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:16,510
got this one place this one time of year

00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:19,390
I hope you can come and please

00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:23,049
please come or you know I think having

00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:26,560
meetups going to garages in multiple

00:02:23,049 --> 00:02:28,239
Mecca centers of applications and we're

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,500
startups or at because they don't you

00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,480
know startups don't have budgets to

00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:33,730
travel I think we need to go make this

00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:35,440
technology available to them put it in

00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:37,660
places where it's easy for them to get

00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,970
to and get more hands-on there's no

00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:42,790
reason why we can't do smaller versions

00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:45,099
of these things twice a month once a

00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:47,140
month you know at least once a quarter

00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:50,140
if anything in the right locations

00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:51,849
yeah that's why the feedback part is so

00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:53,799
important to me I mean when I first got

00:02:51,849 --> 00:02:56,980
involved with open power what was

00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:59,440
intriguing to me was the tight meshing

00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:03,519
of the software piece and the platform

00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:06,519
and the chipset you know that's rare and

00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:09,220
what I think is really unique is the

00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:10,989
opportunity to say hey I'm writing a

00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:13,390
piece of code not only what is available

00:03:10,989 --> 00:03:15,700
to me today but what may be coming and

00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:16,720
to actually get in the room with some of

00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:19,390
the people that are building the

00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,310
platform writing the firmware as well as

00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:24,220
the application on top of it as well as

00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:26,459
working on the operating system and kind

00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:29,799
of brainstorm on what would be a better

00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:31,660
total stack and how would you solve the

00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:33,609
analytics problems or the genomic

00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:37,090
problem or the supply chain problem

00:03:33,609 --> 00:03:41,049
faster universities have to be important

00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:43,599
because because you know data scientists

00:03:41,049 --> 00:03:46,690
are driving a lot of the next generation

00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:48,549
you know workloads there they're open

00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:53,109
source developers they're not they're

00:03:48,549 --> 00:03:54,340
not dependent on software they can get

00:03:53,109 --> 00:03:55,599
in the black box world today because

00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:57,459
that does not solve the problems they're

00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:59,680
actually finding problems finding

00:03:57,459 --> 00:04:01,540
solution or problems and then once they

00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,700
leave University they're gonna start

00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:06,519
their own companies or they're gonna

00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:09,760
they're gonna go into other companies I

00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:12,579
think getting them on the power platform

00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,500
early and often to show how they can

00:04:12,579 --> 00:04:15,549
solve their problems that in ways that

00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,979
he can't solve both any other

00:04:15,549 --> 00:04:19,720
architecture is important we're already

00:04:17,979 --> 00:04:20,049
reaching out to universities and I think

00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,459
there

00:04:20,049 --> 00:04:23,470
incredibly important part of the

00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:25,599
ecosystem what I think is even more

00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:28,090
important is as we think about smaller

00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:31,750
and regional developer conference

00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:32,979
congresses or conferences I would expect

00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:38,280
and I would hope many of them would be

00:04:32,979 --> 00:04:41,110
on university campuses you know they are

00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:42,669
little ecosystems of startups or

00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:45,099
soon-to-be startups or next-generation

00:04:42,669 --> 00:04:48,520
startups and a lot of the creative

00:04:45,099 --> 00:04:50,379
thinking that's going on at the platform

00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:52,780
level at the chipset level at the firm

00:04:50,379 --> 00:04:55,659
well at the OS at the application level

00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:59,169
is happening at universities I'd love

00:04:55,659 --> 00:05:02,110
for us to be as I look out over the next

00:04:59,169 --> 00:05:03,699
12 months you know think of an event a

00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:06,039
quarter and it wouldn't be surprising

00:05:03,699 --> 00:05:07,900
that one could be in you know Beijing

00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:10,240
and one could be at Carnegie Mellon and

00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:12,879
one could be it Cambridge and another

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,039
one could be in Berlin and those may or

00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:17,169
may not be at university settings but

00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:19,360
they'll all be tightly coupled to the

00:05:17,169 --> 00:05:21,729
local university community as well as

00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,620
the startup community as well as the

00:05:21,729 --> 00:05:26,289
established enterprise community I mean

00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:29,199
that's where we'll be breaking

00:05:26,289 --> 00:05:30,819
boundaries and getting people to swim

00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,190
outside their swim lanes and whenever

00:05:30,819 --> 00:05:35,979
that happens I'm confident we'll see a

00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:38,199
lot of creativity in I think the

00:05:35,979 --> 00:05:40,659
foundation that we've put in place with

00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:45,990
open power hopefully allows for that

00:05:40,659 --> 00:05:45,990
sort of innovation in collaboration

00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:53,410
