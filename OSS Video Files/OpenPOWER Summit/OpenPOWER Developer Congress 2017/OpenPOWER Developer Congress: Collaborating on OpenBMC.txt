00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:13,889
so open BMC is a service processor that

00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,929
runs on a on our servers and it the

00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:17,880
software stack for it a lot of those

00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:20,279
standards have been fairly stagnant for

00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:23,850
the past 20 years or so and this is kind

00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:25,949
of a new way for multiple companies and

00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:28,140
a lot of individuals to come in and say

00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:30,060
we actually want to see it implemented a

00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,279
different way so I thought workshop that

00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:34,140
we're having here we discovered that

00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:37,530
there's a lot of companies that actually

00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:39,540
want to to collaborate out with this

00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,860
open BMC project until we said like you

00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,260
know what let's get them together and

00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:45,420
let's actually start working on it you

00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:47,460
go in and you actually try the code out

00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:51,180
and you have an opportunity so I just

00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:53,280
sit there with you and say yeah run this

00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:54,390
command on that command it's useful just

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,460
to see a lot of different reference

00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,410
designs and sort of collaborate amongst

00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,750
the similar problems that different

00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:03,300
companies have had with management

00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,979
controller implementations we realized

00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,600
that the industry's catching up with

00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:09,780
this that we see here many vendors

00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:14,369
coming to join this conference and we as

00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:16,380
a BMC the component itself provider we

00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:18,270
want to be part of it one company is got

00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:19,799
to do the same sort of work that the

00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:21,840
other company is doing another company

00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:24,689
well there is like a common denominator

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,040
right there's a group of tasks that they

00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:27,659
all have to do they all have to maintain

00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,700
it and they all have to make sure that

00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:32,130
it's secure at all times and stuff well

00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,560
you can just kind of simplify that and

00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:36,390
if we find a common model which is where

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,970
the open BMC really comes into play here

00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:41,700
they're simple are simple well

00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:44,189
architected design and then the value

00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,960
adds and some other you hear from

00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:48,899
companies is what you put on top of it

00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:52,020
we have investigations going on on a

00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:54,329
couple of different areas that they will

00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:55,890
definitely be taken back to these so my

00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:57,960
goal is when you leave the conferences

00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:59,159
you you get to have the same environment

00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,409
that you did through it the whole

00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:02,579
education session I really want them to

00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:04,680
come later than understanding that

00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:07,259
there's alternatives to field way of

00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,640
doing things that open DMC is something

00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:10,210
that's out there and that there is an

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,100
engaging community of

00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:16,060
at the end of the day the open BMC

00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:24,589
really is about collaboration

00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:24,589
