00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:10,740
all right so John we spent the last

00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:14,730
three years in open power cultivating

00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:20,010
the hardware ecosystem servers you know

00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:22,740
GPUs FPGAs and this this event that

00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:25,050
we're having here this weekend help in

00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:27,240
San Francisco this open power developer

00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:29,699
Congress it was really aimed at the

00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:32,820
developers I think that's the next

00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:34,980
evolution I mean I have some ideas being

00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,600
you know hardware minded person with my

00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:39,000
roles responsibilities but how do you

00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,250
think that's going to help us in the

00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,649
open power foundation the ecosystem you

00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:45,870
know going forward yeah I think it's you

00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:47,910
know it's a critical step when we

00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:51,000
started this journey it was first an

00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:53,070
accumulation of companies mostly focused

00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,109
on the hardware part of it and opening

00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:58,440
that up was a big step in terms of

00:00:55,109 --> 00:01:00,719
creating open innovation and then we

00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:03,780
recognized that the operating system

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,610
level you know with Ubuntu Red Hat SUSE

00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,650
we needed to make sure that any piece of

00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:13,020
code could run on that operating system

00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:16,470
regardless of where it's at on power x86

00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:18,570
or on our but the ultimate solutions are

00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:20,910
built on applications that sit on top of

00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:22,500
those operating systems and that's the

00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:23,970
area that we're starting to cultivate

00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,340
and I think this is the year of the

00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:28,980
developer for us and it's an important

00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:32,240
one as you know yeah I know we spent a

00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:35,010
lot of time with the foundation members

00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:37,520
creating you know we set the hardware

00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:39,480
level based

00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,850
differentiation you know on the power

00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:44,760
platform for open power you know we've

00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:48,780
got accelerator interfaces that connect

00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:50,270
directly to GPUs in NVIDIA GPUs in fact

00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:53,690
the power processor is the only

00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:55,830
processor that that has n being linked

00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:58,350
accelerate you know the accelerator bus

00:01:55,830 --> 00:02:01,410
which is you know significantly you know

00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:04,710
wider and faster than PCI today we've

00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:07,800
got capi open capi how do you think the

00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:08,700
developers will grab onto that and take

00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:11,220
advantage of that

00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:12,870
well that's always the interesting thing

00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:15,280
and this is why I think doing a

00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:17,830
developer Congress is so important

00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,990
speaking on on the behalf of developers

00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:22,240
in terms of their overall creativity is

00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:25,750
always dangerous I think why you've seen

00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:27,790
the advent of hackathons and developer

00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:29,200
congresses is that you put the

00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:31,810
technology in front of them and they

00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:35,200
create the opportunity to capitalize on

00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:36,700
the differentiation what they do expect

00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,860
though is that they're building on a

00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:41,410
foundation of familiarity which is why

00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:43,480
it's so important to have to me already

00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:44,980
across the operating systems I think

00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:47,200
what the developers are gonna do is

00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:48,880
figure out in their own way for their

00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,160
use cases in their application what's

00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:53,620
important it's gonna be i/o it's gonna

00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:56,950
be compute processing speed some

00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:58,030
combination thereof and that's why you

00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:59,440
know one of the things we've talked

00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:01,450
about which I think is so important is

00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,239
the developer Congress that we have in

00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:07,150
May is one of many that are going to

00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:09,970
come smaller meet up smaller developer

00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:11,530
Congress conferences the opportunity to

00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:14,080
put the technology in the developers

00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:16,920
hands and then we'll see companies like

00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:21,040
Connecticut a kadaj of it so you know

00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:23,140
you being vice president bun to and

00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,480
seeing the software community you know

00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:28,840
and your daily life and me in the eye

00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:31,209
and IBM seeing power technology go from

00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:35,019
proprietary technology to you know open

00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:39,010
technology what do you think it's going

00:03:35,019 --> 00:03:41,560
to take to to get the ecosystem who

00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:43,000
participate in open standards open

00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:46,030
communities open source software

00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,040
development to realize that power is

00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:49,329
something that they have a tool for you

00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,700
know for a little bit their development

00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:52,900
how do we how do we get that message out

00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,880
and how do we attract those types of

00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:57,489
people yeah I think there's a couple

00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:59,620
things and it's first of all I should

00:03:57,489 --> 00:04:02,829
say I think we're already on that path

00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:05,110
right it's not that we're at Ground Zero

00:04:02,829 --> 00:04:07,239
we've actually started some of that work

00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:08,890
and it's been progressing I think a

00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:12,010
couple things that are really important

00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:14,070
one is being persistent with the

00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:16,870
developers putting it in front of them

00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:18,040
allowing them to get access to early

00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:21,670
versions of power

00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:24,370
9 as they are doing these couple days in

00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:26,530
the developer Congress and getting

00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:28,450
familiar with the technology but also

00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:31,150
being consistent in making sure they

00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:32,650
understand that the open power platform

00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:34,270
is going to be a platform they can count

00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:36,580
on that will have very specific

00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:39,130
advantages that they can count on and

00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:40,780
that's where I think open copy and vlink

00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:44,020
all these things that have been in

00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:45,820
motion are becoming familiar now the

00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:47,860
other part is you need to create

00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:50,050
opportunities for the developers to talk

00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:51,430
amongst themselves to work with the

00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:53,740
people that are involved with firmware

00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:55,270
people that are involved with building

00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:57,070
the platform and understand the

00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:59,530
advantages of their code can take

00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:02,320
advantage of what's now available to

00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:04,060
them and then the last thing is really

00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:07,120
incumbent on us as part of the open

00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:08,860
power foundation is to really facilitate

00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,480
the dialogue out to the developer

00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:12,970
community and that's why I thought it

00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:15,520
was so important that this year we

00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:18,130
included building better relationships

00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,840
with developers in general or general it

00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:22,660
was a top priority for the open power

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:25,570
foundation the foundation has built up

00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:27,850
its working groups over the last several

00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:30,910
years started off from a hardware

00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:33,520
perspective specifications for

00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:37,060
connectivity and the power architecture

00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:39,010
and those continue to build recently we

00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:41,440
started things like the personal

00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:43,570
medicine workgroup the machine learning

00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:48,250
deep learning workgroup that was just

00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:50,280
kicked off at the beginning of 2017 more

00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:53,200
work done in those areas more

00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:55,270
solution-oriented work groups or you

00:05:53,200 --> 00:06:00,090
know what's your perspective of you know

00:05:55,270 --> 00:06:02,470
creating a structured focused

00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:04,420
participation capability that you know

00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:07,480
our developers could latch on to and

00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:11,440
work together yeah I'm a big advocate of

00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:13,900
that I think ultimately we solve actual

00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:18,070
problems out in the marketplace out in

00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:21,190
society you cancer genomic problems

00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:23,950
how do you do data analytics for supply

00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:26,800
chain these are business problems that

00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:29,980
either impact humans or impact

00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,420
businesses and you write applications to

00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:33,010
solve problems not big

00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:36,250
you know free time on your Saturday

00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:38,260
afternoon the applications sit on top of

00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:40,600
operating system and platforms that make

00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:43,000
them perform better you know I think we

00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:46,030
are moving very rapidly away from a

00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,800
world where all problems are nails and

00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:50,260
the only platform you have is a hammer

00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:53,080
right and you're kind of narrowly

00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:56,050
focused on a short list of options

00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:58,630
I think AI machine machine learning data

00:06:56,050 --> 00:07:02,920
analytics are all things that benefit

00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:05,440
from the marketplace being much more

00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:07,390
thoughtful what's the business problem

00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,920
what's the best application to help me

00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:12,070
understand and solve that business

00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:14,350
problem and where is that application

00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:17,080
most performant and what I expect is

00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:19,210
working groups like the AI group that we

00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:22,750
have in the open power foundation are

00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:25,870
coming to being because they're like ah

00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:27,330
I can maybe solve my problem better by

00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:29,320
being on this particular platform

00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:31,120
doesn't mean that I can't operate on

00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:34,000
other platforms but there's advantages

00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:37,030
and I hope that what we'll continue to

00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,040
sponsor and encourage is more working

00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:41,980
groups that are solution oriented and

00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:43,690
when their solution oriented they solve

00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:46,660
actual problems and then there's real

00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:48,670
value and you and I love the technology

00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:50,440
but the technology is irrelevant if it

00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:52,950
doesn't solve a problem that helps

00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:55,150
somebody in a real way you know that

00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:57,310
impacts their daily life and that's what

00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:59,800
I think those working groups do you

00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:02,130
never think of you know least IBM's

00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,340
involvement things like chain or

00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:08,140
tensorflow

00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:10,150
Minds AI you know the relationships that

00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:15,760
we have with Google and Vidya and in bun

00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:18,610
2 and Mellanox and you know things that

00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:20,620
you see here in VIX is hosting you know

00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:22,420
their cloud based on power platformers

00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:24,160
hosting a lot of a lot of what these

00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:26,470
developers are programming not today

00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,630
it's not even IBM's cloud this is this

00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:30,220
is nimac sits you know five years ago I

00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:32,950
never would have probably wrote that

00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:36,340
script and and today I think it's it's

00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:38,740
definitely relevant and important or not

00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:40,720
only for IBM but for the ecosystem who

00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:43,879
meets differentiation and choice

00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,879
