00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:09,049
so you know Brian I think we're on the

00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:11,480
right track and working hard to embrace

00:00:09,049 --> 00:00:13,760
developers but you know you're very

00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:15,289
close to the platform and what we're

00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:17,539
doing with open power how would you

00:00:15,289 --> 00:00:21,170
differentiate open power as a platform

00:00:17,539 --> 00:00:22,940
to the developer community taking a

00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:25,610
number of steps over the years and we're

00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:27,260
a proprietary architecture looking at

00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:29,360
what our market segments were and and

00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:32,539
you know how we differentiate it

00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:35,659
ourselves and that typically has been

00:00:32,539 --> 00:00:37,370
you know it's been CPU performance core

00:00:35,659 --> 00:00:39,769
performance it's been memory bandwidth

00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:41,749
it's been i/o and that's still at the

00:00:39,769 --> 00:00:43,699
core we start looking at open power and

00:00:41,749 --> 00:00:45,289
we start talking to the to the open

00:00:43,699 --> 00:00:46,699
power community listening to what

00:00:45,289 --> 00:00:50,390
problems they're trying to solve it's

00:00:46,699 --> 00:00:53,329
the differentiation that they want to

00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:55,069
have which what they do not get from you

00:00:53,329 --> 00:00:57,409
know a proprietary architecture or a

00:00:55,069 --> 00:01:01,069
closed architecture and so we've we've

00:00:57,409 --> 00:01:04,489
taken a bit about our technology that

00:01:01,069 --> 00:01:07,370
we've built upon we've listened to what

00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:09,260
the ecosystem would want I have an

00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:11,150
architecture that could scale to a

00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:14,690
system that could then scale to those

00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:17,390
applications and and we've partnered and

00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:19,640
in the foundation with our foundation

00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:21,710
members and sometimes we partner in a

00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,150
one on one relationship and sometimes we

00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:25,130
partner on a broader relationship but

00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:26,450
even the one-on-one relationships the

00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:27,950
whole goal is to make it available to

00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:30,380
the ecosystem because sometimes you got

00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:31,880
to work together in order to get it

00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:33,020
right and then to make it available you

00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,660
know and the link is one of those

00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:37,700
examples

00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:39,170
capi and open Cappy is the opposite and

00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,750
where we started that you know kind of

00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:43,550
an open going at the same place but I

00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:45,890
think providing you know the

00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:48,290
differentiation is definitely now

00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:51,470
shifted from the CPU to the platform

00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:54,860
level and that's where the ecosystem

00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:56,750
who's trying to differentiate is also

00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:59,540
aiming there their attention as well

00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:03,740
though it's in fact it's it's it's such

00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:07,490
a scalable flexible high-performing

00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:09,379
platform that I think is being provided

00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:11,810
to the open power foundation based on

00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:13,670
their input based on their work you know

00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:16,430
putting their their elbows in and

00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:17,150
getting those designs done so I think

00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:19,819
that's

00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:22,220
you know that's our future as Ibn I've

00:02:19,819 --> 00:02:24,739
noticed a big change in your

00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:26,569
participation in open power in terms of

00:02:24,739 --> 00:02:29,150
how you collect information from

00:02:26,569 --> 00:02:31,970
developer communities what's IBM

00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:34,849
declared that that open power was a

00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:38,359
strategy for the future for the power

00:02:34,849 --> 00:02:40,609
architecture you noticed subtle changes

00:02:38,359 --> 00:02:43,359
that were important changes I think our

00:02:40,609 --> 00:02:46,010
involvement in the open source community

00:02:43,359 --> 00:02:48,680
beyond Linux right we've been in Linux

00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:50,239
for four decade right was until we

00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:52,579
started open power where we went to the

00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,440
mainstream little-endian Linux that was

00:02:52,579 --> 00:02:56,299
the mainstay of most of all the

00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:59,090
application developers which made it

00:02:56,299 --> 00:03:01,489
easier for for applications to port from

00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:03,230
x86 architecture you know to the power

00:03:01,489 --> 00:03:09,379
architecture that was a pivotal change

00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:12,859
you openstack open nfe iBM has continued

00:03:09,379 --> 00:03:14,989
to grow there their relationships their

00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:17,689
involvement and in a lot of the open

00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:20,720
standards committees even taking you

00:03:17,689 --> 00:03:23,239
know board seats positions and you know

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,430
heavy involvement investment because

00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:28,690
that's that's vital leave with our ISVs

00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:32,060
you know we've expanded our ISV

00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:34,040
ecosystem and looking at you know look

00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:36,829
IBM's looking at startups to go and and

00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:39,639
put on their main line at power servers

00:03:36,829 --> 00:03:42,949
undergo so it's a big mindset change

00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:46,659
that that is starting to I think come to

00:03:42,949 --> 00:03:51,609
fruition for for us and and I think it's

00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:55,010
adding the open power ecosystem to that

00:03:51,609 --> 00:03:57,590
making it relevant for us and hopefully

00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:59,030
provide some relevance to them weaving

00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:02,209
together different groups and different

00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:05,449
companies different developers and

00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:08,090
different platforms creates a whole new

00:04:05,449 --> 00:04:10,459
range of solutions that are important in

00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:13,940
the world that's moving very quick and

00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:17,180
on top of that is solving many of these

00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:19,820
problems with software and you know I

00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:22,699
think ultimately if we help in some

00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:25,580
small way make that software or perform

00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:26,960
better and solve problems quicker you

00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:28,800
know we've contributed something

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:37,740
meaningful

00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:37,740
