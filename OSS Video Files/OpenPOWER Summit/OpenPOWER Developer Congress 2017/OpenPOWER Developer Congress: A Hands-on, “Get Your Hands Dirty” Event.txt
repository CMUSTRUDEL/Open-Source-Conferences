welcome to the first ever open power

00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:06,529
developer's Congress let's do some fun

00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:14,549
[Music]

00:00:12,049 --> 00:00:18,119
thank you for being here for the first

00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:19,560
ever open power Developers Conference it

00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:22,140
is the first time we've gotten a group

00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:24,900
of developers together to focus in on

00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:27,359
how do you innovate on the power

00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,769
platform so I'm interested in one of the

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,279
machine learning stuff the deep dive

00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:30,929
stuff

00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,460
frankly the hardest thing is going to be

00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:34,170
deciding which one to go to because

00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,750
there's a lot of times there's two or

00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:39,030
three that overlap that interest I'm

00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,140
here mostly for the open PMT stuff I'm

00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:43,160
just curious

00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:45,539
interested in seeing where that's going

00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:48,450
so at the workshop that we're having

00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:50,520
here we discovered that there's a lot of

00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:52,530
companies that actually want to

00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,789
collaborate out with this open DMC

00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:55,260
project and so we said like you know

00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:57,899
what let's get them together and let's

00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:00,390
actually start working on so something

00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:02,670
that had been heard a lot about that I

00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:05,040
had never just even play with so would

00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:06,450
be just to see we have investigations

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,850
going on on a couple different areas

00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:13,080
that they will definitely be taken back

00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:14,939
to these AI vision is is a product that

00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,590
enables and wants to take advantage of

00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:19,439
machine vision but doesn't necessarily

00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:22,140
want to get under the covers of creating

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:24,390
the model we had a data set of thirds

00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:26,430
actually which were uploaded we created

00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:27,750
a model we trained the model just by

00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:30,270
clicking buttons you know no coding

00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:31,829
required specifically and then after

00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:34,799
that one could then go onto the internet

00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:36,030
find an image of a bird and then give it

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,140
to the trained model and then the

00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:38,790
trained model would tell you what breed

00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,159
it was what I liked about that

00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:43,470
particular platform is how you could

00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:45,600
really build a functional worked well

00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:47,130
for you for machine learning finding

00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,560
somebody with deep learning machine Mel

00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:51,990
here they acknowledge it's expensive but

00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:54,270
I can leverage that upfront good

00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:55,619
training to find an efficient model and

00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:57,120
then separately roll that out in

00:01:55,619 --> 00:02:00,790
victorious

00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:03,100
Harry I is a collection of deep learning

00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:05,260
frameworks we saw in the community a

00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:06,430
need for an easy access to these

00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:08,679
frameworks and we collect them all

00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:11,080
together make an easy way to deploy easy

00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:13,660
way to zoom them uncritical it will the

00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:15,730
developer focus our demonstration was

00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:17,350
kind of partnered with Nimbus for the

00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:19,540
infrastructure though all the students

00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:22,120
were able to connect on online under the

00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:24,040
cloud with a Perry I instance you know

00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:26,380
within a couple clicks we have a lot of

00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:29,110
calls being generated and we can work

00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:32,140
that closer to text and we want to use

00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:35,760
that text in from the text I think if I

00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:38,050
wear this call look good bad beautiful

00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,540
giving other quality with a call and

00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:41,980
being able to really play with it at

00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:44,170
home whether you're in the office you're

00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:45,700
at home there's definitely some unique

00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:47,620
capacities that you have to be able to

00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,940
really just develop this in your off

00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:56,839
time

00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:56,839
[Music]

00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:02,599
Oh

00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:02,599
