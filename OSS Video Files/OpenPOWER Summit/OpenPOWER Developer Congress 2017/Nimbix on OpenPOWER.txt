[Music]

00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:09,219
so Nimbus is a it's a high-performance

00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:14,380
computing and data science and machine

00:00:09,219 --> 00:00:16,599
learning public cloud and we offer these

00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:18,550
workflows on demand for both software as

00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:24,880
a service for end-users and platform as

00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:27,070
a service for developers so Nimbus

00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,140
actually joined open power because we

00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:32,169
were the first public cloud to deploy

00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:34,629
the IBM Minsky system in toward the end

00:00:32,169 --> 00:00:37,629
of 2016 and we felt it was important to

00:00:34,629 --> 00:00:39,909
join the foundation so that we could you

00:00:37,629 --> 00:00:41,979
know continue to help the community you

00:00:39,909 --> 00:00:46,470
know from the from the perspective of a

00:00:41,979 --> 00:00:46,470
cloud provider and software company

00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:54,129
power is very important for for Nimbus

00:00:51,699 --> 00:00:55,960
and you know also for power itself

00:00:54,129 --> 00:00:59,470
because what it does is it it really

00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:01,180
simplifies the way that developers and

00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:04,119
end-users can actually consume the

00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:06,250
latest and greatest and very diverse set

00:01:04,119 --> 00:01:07,360
of machine learning frameworks so for us

00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:09,580
it was very important because we're

00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,640
already a cloud that focuses on turnkey

00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:14,350
workflows instead of infrastructure or

00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,770
hosting it was important for us to have

00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:20,470
these turnkey capabilities to make you

00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:22,630
know consuming these frameworks as easy

00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:24,100
as just you know clicking a few a few

00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:26,650
buttons in a web browser versus having

00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:29,640
to you know compile things from from

00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:29,640
scratch and so forth

00:01:32,499 --> 00:01:37,969
so for example if you were to be using

00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:40,579
if you want to use tensorflow without

00:01:37,969 --> 00:01:42,679
power AI you would have to go off and

00:01:40,579 --> 00:01:45,020
and you know download the temperature

00:01:42,679 --> 00:01:47,689
flow source code compile it hope that

00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:48,979
you got all the dependencies set up and

00:01:47,689 --> 00:01:50,329
then you know and then you could start

00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:52,130
using it maybe you wanted to add a

00:01:50,329 --> 00:01:54,170
jupiter notebooks to make it easier to

00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:57,649
consume etc this this could take several

00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:59,119
hours or several days if you're not you

00:01:57,649 --> 00:02:01,159
know somebody who has experience doing

00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,079
this with power AI what you would simply

00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:05,060
do is go to the Nimbus cloud click on

00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:08,000
the power bi notebook that you wanted to

00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:10,099
use for example tensorflow chain or no

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,160
cafe and others and then you would

00:02:10,099 --> 00:02:14,660
simply get a link to a web page where

00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,670
which would actually have your jupiter

00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:18,860
notebook already secured for your

00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:20,390
session without having to do any setup

00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:22,489
so you literally would just would just

00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:24,739
select your application click it and

00:02:22,489 --> 00:02:26,599
then within within seconds you could

00:02:24,739 --> 00:02:28,160
actually start you know writing or your

00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:34,310
notebook and tensorflow code right in

00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:36,620
your web browser the Nimbus cloud is

00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:42,200
different in two ways one we are a

00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:44,299
high-performance cloud so we we don't

00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:46,579
use hypervisor so we don't virtualized

00:02:44,299 --> 00:02:48,260
at all we run directly on bare metal we

00:02:46,579 --> 00:02:51,290
use containers to actually deploy

00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:52,340
applications so you get the agility of

00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:54,169
virtual machines but without the

00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:57,049
performance overhead and or the

00:02:54,169 --> 00:02:58,880
hypervisor taxes its known so sessions

00:02:57,049 --> 00:03:01,370
start up in seconds or less depending on

00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:03,410
what you're running so on the

00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:04,430
infrastructure side it's very fast it's

00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:06,019
bare metal we have things like

00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:07,959
InfiniBand to connect servers together

00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:11,419
and so forth it's very much like a real

00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:12,829
supercomputer with a cloud operating

00:03:11,419 --> 00:03:14,870
system that we call Jarvis that we

00:03:12,829 --> 00:03:16,609
developed that actually controls and

00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:18,410
orchestrate all these workflows in a

00:03:16,609 --> 00:03:20,450
very easy to consume way and on the

00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:22,579
other end of the spectrum are our

00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:24,769
service our plots of services software

00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:26,180
service and platform as a service so

00:03:24,769 --> 00:03:27,650
instead of dealing with machines you're

00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:29,359
dealing with applications and workflows

00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:30,680
and if you're a developer instead of

00:03:29,359 --> 00:03:32,680
dealing with setting up development

00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,849
environments you all you're doing is

00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,079
interfacing with a platform that already

00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:37,519
understands your containerized

00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:39,530
applications and makes them easy to

00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:42,789
deploy so not only are we the fastest

00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:42,789
cloud we're also the easiest cloud

00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:50,980
to get started with the Nimbus cloud you

00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:53,440
just visit wwm because net you click

00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:55,600
sign up for an account and then within a

00:03:53,440 --> 00:04:04,630
few minutes your your off using anammox

00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:07,390
cloud Nimbus is supported by by email by

00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:10,090
default using our you know just just to

00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:11,140
help desk we also have a developer forum

00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:13,960
where we have a community of developers

00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:14,800
who can assist you in a very community

00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,540
way but people that are very

00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,920
knowledgeable with with how to develop

00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:20,140
application form mimics and we also

00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:21,880
actually sell enterprise support with

00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:23,800
different tiers of service if you're

00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:26,160
looking for you know different support

00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,160
options

00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:34,330
for open power Nimbus going forward

00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,770
we're very excited about power 9 were

00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:38,710
you know very much looking forward to

00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:41,770
continuing to converge the roadmap with

00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:43,750
IBM on one hand you know to bring more

00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:44,979
capabilities to our to the stack on the

00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,479
other hand to continue to make it eat

00:04:44,979 --> 00:04:48,190
from the Nimbus side to continue to make

00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:50,020
it easier to consume these capabilities

00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:52,479
and we're also looking at things like

00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:54,070
open copy working very closely with IBM

00:04:52,479 --> 00:05:00,910
on that to to bring these technologies

00:04:54,070 --> 00:05:02,770
to the cloud as well the open power echo

00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:04,720
system is is valuable in the sense that

00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:06,070
it has you know hardware companies

00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,100
software companies and obviously like

00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:11,979
Nimbus cloud companies and everybody's

00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:14,470
goal is to you know to further not just

00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:16,600
the the the platform itself but but

00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:18,460
there's a very advanced and unique use

00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,990
cases that you can achieve on the power

00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:29,290
clock

00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:29,290
