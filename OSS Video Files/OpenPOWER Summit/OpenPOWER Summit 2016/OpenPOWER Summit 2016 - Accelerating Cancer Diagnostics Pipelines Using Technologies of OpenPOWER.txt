so good afternoon everybody thank you

00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:09,330
all for being here my name is a Larson

00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:11,580
I'm from blue be a company specialized

00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:13,139
in high-performance genomics and my

00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,660
presentation today I'm going to discuss

00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:17,940
a working group that we have started

00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:20,580
with in the open power foundation to

00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,380
bring together a lot of different

00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:25,140
players in the field of personalized

00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:27,420
medicine and to enable them with

00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:30,300
solutions within the open up our

00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:32,969
foundation to accelerate the problems

00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,770
that they have and also enable their

00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:36,450
work in practice you have seen a number

00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:40,620
of presentations today from different

00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:42,660
members of empower that shown actually

00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:46,200
improvement in performance in various

00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:47,640
genomics pipelines for example and we

00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,340
would like to bring all those activities

00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:53,430
together and enable them from a

00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:55,440
technology point of view to make them

00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:57,829
faster and easier and cheaper i will

00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,989
discuss as well as part of this effort

00:00:57,829 --> 00:01:04,460
our work in accelerating a specific

00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:10,890
pipeline that is specifically used in

00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:12,720
cancer diagnostics so they usually when

00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:15,330
i would like to understand a specific

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:19,110
topic and go to Wikipedia and i try to

00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:22,290
google what kind of term I would like to

00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:24,409
know about so wikipedia says the field

00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:28,500
of personalized medicine is actually a

00:01:24,409 --> 00:01:32,369
customization of healthcare that

00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:35,369
eventually would help individuals to be

00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:39,630
treated based on their specific patient

00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:41,009
state for different specific attributes

00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:42,840
that are being used for the personalized

00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:46,490
medicine application domain that is

00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:51,060
predictive preventive personalized and

00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:52,710
participatory there are a number of

00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:56,399
different source of information that can

00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:58,829
be used to identify the state of a

00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,409
patient within the personalized medicine

00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:03,030
medicine application domain so we can

00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:06,329
use information that is based on the

00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:09,060
molecular description of an individual

00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:12,480
or an organism or talking about DNA data

00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,710
for example talking about RNA data DNA

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,540
sequencing is

00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:18,060
relate to this issue we can talk about

00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:20,540
the functional parameters of an

00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:25,400
individual for example blood measurement

00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:28,350
for example specific blood samples

00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:30,420
imaging information we can talk about

00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:33,320
behavioral aspects which is what we talk

00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:36,540
about in general when we talk about

00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:38,220
measurement devices like watches that

00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:40,650
measure the activity of a person and

00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:43,470
otherwise and bringing all these

00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:47,280
together actually creates a huge problem

00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:50,640
computational problem that eventually

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,170
produces significant effort on the

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,990
computational infrastructure to be able

00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:56,880
to address and the soul in addition to a

00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:59,880
huge data problem that is by

00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:02,550
accumulating all this information what

00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,050
prevent institutions organizations and

00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:06,540
even hospitals that would eventually

00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:08,760
like to use this information to use them

00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:11,940
in their traditional Diagnostics

00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:15,350
processes here I show a just a one

00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:19,650
sample of the growth of the genomic data

00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:22,020
information the past 20 years and the

00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:23,640
exponential size of this information as

00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:26,180
it grows and not taking into

00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:28,020
consideration and of the functional or

00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:31,230
behavioral data that we are also

00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:35,580
starting to use in order to personalized

00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:39,030
medicine Diagnostics the address this

00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:41,250
application domain we started talking

00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:44,280
with within the open power foundation

00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:46,620
about initiating and efforts to address

00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:49,020
the challenges within the personalized

00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:54,510
medicine application domain and based on

00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:56,610
this we started a workgroup to be able

00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:58,050
to bring together as I said technologies

00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:59,670
from different technology providers

00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:01,830
within the open power foundation and

00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:04,160
also different members that would like

00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:07,260
to use these technologies so that we can

00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:11,910
create solutions specifically designed

00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:14,610
for those who need them it is the first

00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:17,190
open power application domain specific

00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:20,310
work group that is not technology so

00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:21,690
instead of having technology horizontal

00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:23,810
work groups are having the first

00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:26,490
application so vertical work group and

00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:27,630
we would like to have both sides of an

00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:31,380
equation taking care of

00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:34,380
so i would like to design systems that

00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:36,300
are specifically created for those

00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:38,310
applications for the personalized

00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:41,400
medicine application domain and on the

00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:43,080
other hand would like to optimize the

00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,180
applications themselves the software

00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:47,520
itself so that can work efficiently on

00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:50,760
the existing infrastructure that is

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:53,550
provided by open power the number of we

00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:56,040
just started we started about 4-5 months

00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:58,410
ago we already have a large number of

00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:01,350
participants 60 members 10 organizations

00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:04,890
and these are basically from different

00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:08,790
backgrounds both technology and research

00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:10,920
and medical we have just a couple of

00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:12,060
months ago we had a workshop while you

00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,710
brought together all those different

00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:16,100
these different partners and we

00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:19,140
discussed together how we can go further

00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:21,330
in order to show the possible benefits

00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:23,250
of this kind of of the challenges that

00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:26,460
this kind of application domains would

00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:29,760
face we would like to talk a little bit

00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:33,120
of a bit genomics field because it is

00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:34,830
one of the most identifiable a challenge

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,390
that we see at the moment in the

00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:39,690
personalized medicine application domain

00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:42,030
and it is also a showcase for what kind

00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:44,580
of improvements we can show in the NF

00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:49,040
for that field now there are three

00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:52,140
different aspects within genomics that

00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:54,780
actually cause a big challenge in the

00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:57,300
field the first one is the fifth is the

00:05:54,780 --> 00:06:01,230
face of generating the information here

00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:06,270
I show they a an exact figure a graph

00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:09,060
that shows the growing size of it the

00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:10,920
speed of generating the reduction in

00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:14,810
price of generating information genetic

00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:18,570
information and the reduction in size in

00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:20,220
pricing our hard disk storage capability

00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:22,890
of capacity and you see that DNA

00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:24,840
sequencing is generating information at

00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:28,230
a higher rate exponentially higher rate

00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:32,340
as compared to the our capacity to store

00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:36,720
that information it's only a matter of

00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:38,850
time before this means that we are not

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,710
able to store information and many

00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:41,520
institutions at the moment decide

00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:42,960
actually to delete

00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,669
information that you already sequence

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,050
after they analyze them because they

00:06:44,669 --> 00:06:48,030
don't have the capacity to store them

00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:49,680
but this will result eventually in a

00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:51,509
problem a global problem where you do

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,159
not have really the capacity store the

00:06:51,509 --> 00:06:55,139
information that we generate at a global

00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:57,569
level and this is a problem that has

00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:59,159
been projected already people actually

00:06:57,569 --> 00:07:01,229
predict a couple of different searches

00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:03,690
have predicted that the field of

00:07:01,229 --> 00:07:06,379
genomics will be the biggest generator

00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:08,759
of big data within the coming five years

00:07:06,379 --> 00:07:11,180
something that we should keep in mind to

00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:15,240
be able to address in the coming years

00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:17,280
the second phase of analysis within the

00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:19,979
genomics application the genomics field

00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:24,150
is the analysis of the information

00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:30,509
itself I show another graph that shows

00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:32,819
the actual need for analyzing

00:07:30,509 --> 00:07:36,210
information within the application

00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:38,849
within the genomics field and the growth

00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:40,889
of our capacity to analyze it with from

00:07:38,849 --> 00:07:42,599
a computing point of view and again you

00:07:40,889 --> 00:07:45,360
see that there is of course an

00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:47,729
exponential increase in the available

00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:51,389
capacity of computation and a higher

00:07:47,729 --> 00:07:54,810
exponential increase in the amount of

00:07:51,389 --> 00:07:58,229
analysis that is needed for the genomics

00:07:54,810 --> 00:08:00,210
field and the final part is the

00:07:58,229 --> 00:08:03,090
interpretation part which is after

00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:05,009
you've done generated the data after

00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:08,270
you've analyzed the data you need to do

00:08:05,009 --> 00:08:11,880
work to run a number of interpretation

00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:13,830
faces on your information and we see

00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:15,810
that with the increasing amount of

00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:17,880
genomes that we are analyzing that we

00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:20,159
are storing with the increasing amount

00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:22,169
of information you can do a little from

00:08:20,159 --> 00:08:24,840
multiple references multiple genome

00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:26,039
analysis and also need for visualization

00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,919
of this information that we're

00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:33,779
generating will actually create a shift

00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:35,940
in becoming five years from five percent

00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:37,919
compared to ninety-five percent of the

00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:41,250
price of analysis within the genomics

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:43,169
field from genotyping which is

00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:48,209
identifying the mutations or the

00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:50,880
variations of the genomes to ninety-five

00:08:48,209 --> 00:08:53,610
percent of the cost being dedicated to

00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,420
actually interpreting the data that we

00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:58,180
are getting

00:08:55,420 --> 00:09:00,250
so the challenges are staggering and all

00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:02,440
different institutions are facing them

00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:04,389
and we would like to bring together all

00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:06,579
those different players in the field to

00:09:04,389 --> 00:09:08,200
address them head-on to give you an

00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:10,720
example of what we can do in such a

00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:13,320
field we have analyzed a specific

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:16,000
pipeline in the past couple of months

00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:18,820
try to identify what are the bottlenecks

00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,870
in that pipeline and try to provide

00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:24,579
solutions to enable speeding up they

00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:26,769
analysis that pipeline and show some

00:09:24,579 --> 00:09:28,990
performance increase the apartment that

00:09:26,769 --> 00:09:32,740
you have chosen is the gatk pipeline and

00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:34,240
this is our first focus for a group we

00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:35,500
this is a pipeline very well-known

00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,680
pipeline developed by the Broad

00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:40,839
Institute it has been a great success

00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:42,639
for a number of different institutions

00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:45,940
and hospitals around the world it is

00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:49,060
being used for cancer diagnostics all

00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:52,870
over the world and all those

00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:55,240
institutions our desire to have

00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:57,310
reduction in the price of using that

00:09:55,240 --> 00:10:00,160
pipeline on the clusters to be able to

00:09:57,310 --> 00:10:04,000
treat more patients and to treat those

00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:06,190
patients at a lower price point the

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,750
computational complexity is huge we're

00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:09,880
talking about every single patient

00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:12,130
cancer patient for example coming in

00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:14,170
with a about of a terabyte of data for

00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:17,050
every single experiment for every single

00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:19,510
biopsy and we're talking about days to

00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:21,970
weeks of an Ellis time on a typical

00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:25,120
cluster where that say an average

00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:27,550
institution has access to it's a lot of

00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,680
waste of time for the institution other

00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:32,110
ways of money for society and a lot of

00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:35,079
ways of energy if we are able to do this

00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:38,110
analysis the same analysis faster and

00:10:35,079 --> 00:10:42,930
cheaper so the pipeline is divided to

00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:46,329
actually five steps mapping sorting

00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:48,910
realignment recalibration and variant

00:10:46,329 --> 00:10:52,209
calling each one of these stages we have

00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:54,610
address we have evaluated and we

00:10:52,209 --> 00:10:56,649
provided solutions for each of them and

00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:58,660
I will show you in each of these stages

00:10:56,649 --> 00:11:03,930
and number solutions that we have

00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:07,630
provided so in the mapping phase we have

00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:08,570
used the algorithm that is now de facto

00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:11,420
standards

00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:13,580
BW mm and this is a mapping algorithm

00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:15,350
that is basically tries to find out

00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:18,320
where the different pieces of the genome

00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:21,950
are located on a reference genome we

00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:23,900
have used a number of acceleration

00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:28,540
approaches for this for the support for

00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:31,760
this algorithm and we were able to reach

00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:37,070
acceleration of up to two times using

00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:41,120
those hardware accelerators and this has

00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:43,310
been actually is available as IP and we

00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:46,130
are describing this as part of our a

00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:47,660
document that will be released to the

00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:51,470
public select everybody that is

00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:54,440
interested will be able to access it now

00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:57,080
the sorting part when we looked at the

00:11:54,440 --> 00:12:00,170
sorting and part of the other analysis

00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:01,970
well identified that actually much of

00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:05,600
the NL's that's being not the time that

00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:09,110
is being taken by this step is due to

00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:13,090
memory access disk access in efficient

00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:15,560
utilization of bio and we try to access

00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:17,720
to Mize the performance of that code

00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:20,600
just by improving because itself and

00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:23,420
were able to achieve significant speed

00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:26,740
ups from 50 to 100 times and proven

00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:29,720
speedups just for this phase on its own

00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:31,580
almost eliminating it from the

00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:35,090
computation time for the whole pipeline

00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:37,840
most of the work was not computational

00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:41,930
most of the work is was just overhead

00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:44,930
the next two stages we try to address

00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:47,360
them you know in a generic way not

00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:50,300
specifically identifying details of

00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:53,390
those stages the in the realignment and

00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:55,930
the base recalibration and we identify

00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:58,370
that these two stages have actually

00:12:55,930 --> 00:13:01,850
utilized a lot of compressed information

00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:04,790
so they zip data stored in the disk read

00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:07,010
it again unzip it do some analysis 0th

00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:09,110
back again put it back to disk take it

00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:10,670
back out unzip it do someone else and

00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:12,980
zippered bag and put it back to disk and

00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:14,720
it continues that way we're seeing a lot

00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:16,520
of times just sipping and sipping on a

00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,100
processor that can do some other stuff

00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:22,239
so we simply implemented an accelerated

00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:25,819
version of a zip over gzip

00:13:22,239 --> 00:13:28,839
function and try to improve the

00:13:25,819 --> 00:13:31,579
performance by just using such a generic

00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:33,319
accelerator and we actually were able to

00:13:31,579 --> 00:13:37,129
reduce the execution time by up to

00:13:33,319 --> 00:13:39,230
thirty five percent and finally the

00:13:37,129 --> 00:13:42,049
variant calling stage which is actually

00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:46,279
a stage that is able to identify the

00:13:42,049 --> 00:13:48,980
mutations in the reeds that the genome

00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:50,749
of the patient has and we use the number

00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:53,209
of acceleration techniques we address

00:13:50,749 --> 00:13:55,059
this problem in depth use the number of

00:13:53,209 --> 00:13:58,429
exhibition techniques with different

00:13:55,059 --> 00:14:02,239
hardware accelerators and we're able to

00:13:58,429 --> 00:14:04,939
reduce it anywhere between fifty percent

00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:07,399
to two times acceleration depending on

00:14:04,939 --> 00:14:10,420
the data set and depending on the system

00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:12,559
that we used so bringing all these

00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:14,660
acceleration techniques and improvement

00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:16,459
and optimizations together you can

00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:18,939
actually improve the performance of your

00:14:16,459 --> 00:14:21,860
pipeline of up to two to three times

00:14:18,939 --> 00:14:23,959
based on the original baseline that

00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:26,360
everybody almost everybody around the

00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:30,889
world is using which is a significant

00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:32,899
improvement to the baseline just to

00:14:30,889 --> 00:14:36,619
conclude bring everything together and i

00:14:32,899 --> 00:14:38,990
would i would like to let everybody know

00:14:36,619 --> 00:14:41,720
that we have formed a personalized

00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:43,029
medicine workgroup i would like to

00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:45,589
inform everybody that we are addressing

00:14:43,029 --> 00:14:48,049
pressing needs in the field that

00:14:45,589 --> 00:14:51,470
actually would help individuals and

00:14:48,049 --> 00:14:52,999
institutions solve their computational

00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:55,220
challenges within the personalized

00:14:52,999 --> 00:14:58,009
medicine application domain that we have

00:14:55,220 --> 00:15:00,290
shown with a specific pipeline that you

00:14:58,009 --> 00:15:02,089
are able to achieve significant

00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:04,879
improvements in performance by just

00:15:02,089 --> 00:15:07,339
looking at your pipeline and identifying

00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:09,110
the bottlenecks and resolving them from

00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:11,990
a technological point of view not

00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:14,509
necessarily from a biological point of

00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:16,160
view and I'm finally we are

00:15:14,509 --> 00:15:17,959
investigating a number of different

00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,929
future activities in the work work group

00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:23,720
to accelerate other pipelines that are

00:15:20,929 --> 00:15:26,410
clinically needed by the users thank you
