hello I'm sandy Woodward and I'm the

00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:12,420
open power compliance work okay thank

00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:14,280
you hello I'm sandy Woodward and I'm the

00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:17,010
open power foundation compliance

00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:19,130
workgroup chair I have over 20 years

00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:22,020
experience with the Power Architecture

00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:25,980
i'm a senior technical staff member at

00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:29,279
IBM and in an IBM Academy of Technology

00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:33,210
member today I'm going to discuss open

00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:36,270
power compliance let's look at the

00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:38,430
agenda for today first I will give an

00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:40,110
introduction to open power compliance

00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:42,870
with the review of the open Power

00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:44,910
Architecture compliance definition which

00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:47,850
I described in more detail at last

00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:50,489
year's open power but next I will

00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:54,180
describe open power cap accelerator

00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:56,640
compliance the compliance work group has

00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:59,250
generated an open power compliance

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,949
accelerator compliance test harness and

00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:04,739
test suite specification that I will be

00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:08,159
going through be going through public

00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:11,040
reviews soon today I would describe that

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:13,229
the concepts from that document to

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:18,420
address open power cappy accelerator

00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:20,610
compliance lastly I providing an outlook

00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:26,960
of the compliance work group activities

00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:30,960
for 2016 let's start with the open power

00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:33,570
compliance introduction the compliance

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,759
work group has generated an open Power

00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:39,290
Architecture compliance definition

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:42,329
specification it documented open power

00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:45,740
specifications that contain it is

00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:49,020
required to be open power compliant

00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:52,490
these open power specifications are work

00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:56,009
products of other open power work groups

00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:59,399
each specification defined certain open

00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:02,880
Power Architecture features interfaces

00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:05,520
and facilities and it in its conformance

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,069
to the specification section just

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:11,810
defines which are required in which are

00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:14,010
optional for compliance though our

00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:16,500
architecture compliance Stephanie

00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:18,840
specification documents an overview of

00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:21,239
the compliance test harness and test

00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:24,930
suite specifications that are being

00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:27,360
developed in the compliance workgroup it

00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:29,790
documents procedures on how to measure

00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:33,900
in document compliance and where

00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:36,569
discipline submit compliance report the

00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:39,239
open Power Architecture compliance

00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:46,440
definition workgroups back is on the

00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:48,950
open power foundation public website now

00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:53,849
I will describe open power cappy

00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:55,920
accelerator compliance to begin the

00:02:53,849 --> 00:02:58,650
discussion on open power cappy

00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:02,370
accelerator compliance let's look at the

00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:06,870
various pieces in opa copy accelerators

00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:09,299
peluche in the diagram at the top is the

00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:13,290
application that is interfacing to the

00:03:09,299 --> 00:03:16,560
open-source Cappy kernel driver for

00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:19,379
supervisor calls it interfaces to the

00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:24,239
capi accelerator library live see excel

00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:27,120
for user mode buttons its interface to

00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:30,889
the coke attached processor proxy a

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,889
hardware the product

00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:37,489
which operates with the power service

00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:40,940
layer to enable accelerator function

00:03:37,489 --> 00:03:44,989
unit to operate on system memory in a

00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:46,790
fast coherent manner the hardware

00:03:44,989 --> 00:03:48,920
interface pointed to with the arrow

00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:51,349
between the capi kernel driver cap

00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:54,680
accelerator library and the coherent

00:03:51,349 --> 00:03:56,750
attached processor proxy is defined in

00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:59,420
the coherent accelerator interface

00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:01,519
architecture spec which is also

00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:05,569
available on the open power foundation

00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:07,760
public website the hardware interface

00:04:05,569 --> 00:04:10,129
pointed to with an arrow between the

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:13,099
power service layer and the accelerator

00:04:10,129 --> 00:04:15,440
function unit is defined in the PSL to a

00:04:13,099 --> 00:04:18,139
a few interface spec which is also

00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:21,530
available on the open power foundation

00:04:18,139 --> 00:04:23,419
public website now let's look at

00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:26,690
compliance for each of these Hardware

00:04:23,419 --> 00:04:31,340
interfaces starting with the PSL to a fu

00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:34,490
test harness and test suite the test

00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:37,400
harness used to execute the PSL to a fu

00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:40,250
test suite should emulate the psl

00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:44,150
Hardware behavior as it reacts to and

00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:47,240
drives the PSL a of you interface it

00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:50,000
should verify the cooker that the PSL a

00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:52,820
fu interface specification is not

00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,300
violated in testing the required and

00:04:52,820 --> 00:05:00,349
optional facilities of the PSL a fu

00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:03,979
interface the PSL simulation engine is

00:05:00,349 --> 00:05:08,530
one example it is available on github

00:05:03,979 --> 00:05:12,229
and I have the link to the website here

00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:14,450
the specific tests are determined by

00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:18,310
what the application and the a of you

00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:20,479
are programmed to do the general

00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:23,630
recommendations for verification with

00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:26,210
the PSL le is that it provides some

00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:28,760
randomness on the interface and

00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:31,580
therefore long-running test cases will

00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:35,539
provide the most coverage also you

00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:39,099
ensure that the PS LSD forms file is set

00:05:35,539 --> 00:05:39,099
correctly for your tests

00:05:40,599 --> 00:05:47,660
the PSL a fu test suite test should

00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:52,159
verify that the a fu adheres to the PSL

00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:54,470
a fu interface it should exercise each

00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:59,629
of the a fu interfaces and ensure

00:05:54,470 --> 00:06:02,300
correct operation for the fu mmio

00:05:59,629 --> 00:06:04,849
interface it should ensure that the fu

00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:09,020
descriptor space is decoded correctly

00:06:04,849 --> 00:06:11,840
and valid values are returned for the fu

00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:14,180
buffer interface it should test the air

00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:19,520
view supported read buffer latency of

00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:22,729
either one or three for the PSL response

00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:25,990
interface it should ensure the PSA a few

00:06:22,729 --> 00:06:29,090
complete says successfully with done and

00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:33,830
is able to handle address and data

00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:36,259
errors for the fu control interface you

00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:38,270
should ensure that the fu decodes reset

00:06:36,259 --> 00:06:41,990
and start commands and operates

00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:44,810
correctly the test suite test should

00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:51,080
also exercise the implemented optional

00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:55,729
facilities for successful execution of

00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:58,039
the PSL a few tests the PSL simulation

00:06:55,729 --> 00:06:59,990
engine or any other test harness should

00:06:58,039 --> 00:07:03,710
have a return code zero to indicate

00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:06,680
successful completion with no errors it

00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:09,349
should have a nonzero return code if to

00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:12,139
indicate failures it should have error

00:07:09,349 --> 00:07:15,050
messages to indicate what failed if

00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:17,300
there is a nonzero return code you

00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:24,650
should debug and fix the design and then

00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:29,479
run the test again now let's talk about

00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:32,120
the cai a hardware interface the test

00:07:29,479 --> 00:07:35,229
harness to execute the cai a test suite

00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:37,969
should provide an environment to test

00:07:35,229 --> 00:07:41,740
existence and operation of required and

00:07:37,969 --> 00:07:45,430
implemented optional cai a facilities an

00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:49,219
open power ready system can be used an

00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:51,889
open powder ready system contains the

00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:54,270
open power is a profile processor

00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:57,210
chipset which is the power

00:07:54,270 --> 00:08:00,060
a processor power 8 with NVIDIA in the

00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:02,940
link processor or CP one processor and

00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:07,160
it has at least one cent our memory

00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:10,290
buffer with memory it has a modest River

00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:13,110
derivative of the open power abstraction

00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:16,550
layer firmware and has at least one boot

00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:20,070
device you can see the open power ready

00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:23,220
2016 definition and criteria workgroup

00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:27,470
notes for complete definition on the

00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:27,470
open power of foundation public website

00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:36,540
for the cai a test suite you should

00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,730
develop a functional application that

00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:41,790
tests the existence of required and

00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:45,990
optional cai a facilities and should

00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:48,930
verify correct behavior the open source

00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:51,060
curdle cappy kernel driver can be used

00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:53,910
to get access to privileged cai a

00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:56,760
facilities and the capi accelerator

00:08:53,910 --> 00:09:00,170
library live see excel or equipment can

00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:10,590
be used to get access to user mode cai a

00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:14,640
facilities for successful execution cai

00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:16,350
a tests each test in the test suite of

00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,600
tests should have a return codes there

00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:21,570
to indicate successful completion with

00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:24,240
no errors and should have nonzero return

00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:26,400
code to indicate failures the test

00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,220
harness should summarize the results and

00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:31,470
if there is a non-root zero return code

00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:35,250
it should show error messages indicating

00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:37,560
what failed if there is a nonzero return

00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:40,710
code you should debug the failure and

00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:46,800
fix the design then run the test again

00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:49,140
to be open power cap accelerator

00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:52,820
compliant you need to have successful

00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:58,370
execution of the PSL a of use test and

00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:58,370
successful execution of the cai a tests

00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:05,070
now I will give an outlook of the

00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:10,140
compliance work group activities for

00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:11,970
2016 the compliance work group is

00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:14,130
planning to develop open power

00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:16,230
compliance test harness and test suite

00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:18,779
specifications for other areas of

00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:21,150
compliance such as the open power

00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:24,150
instruction set architecture profile

00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:27,870
compliance and the open power io design

00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:30,060
architecture version 2 compliance these

00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:32,880
will be for compliance of the open power

00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:36,140
instruction set architecture profile

00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:38,460
specification and the iod a version 2

00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:40,970
specification that are available on the

00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:44,330
open power foundation website today

00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:46,529
there will also be more compliance

00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:53,220
specifications as other workgroups

00:10:46,529 --> 00:10:55,380
complete workgroup specifications if you

00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:57,779
are an open power foundation member i

00:10:55,380 --> 00:11:00,839
invite you to join and participate in

00:10:57,779 --> 00:11:03,470
