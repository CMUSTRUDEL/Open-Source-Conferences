good morning Bruce while from IBM I'm

00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:17,910
going to talk about a year and the

00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:19,439
growth of cathy is that all right what

00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,300
I'm going to go through here is is a

00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,689
quick look back at where we were a year

00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:26,400
ago at open power and then talk about

00:00:23,689 --> 00:00:29,820
what we've seen in the growth of the

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,859
accelerators some of the some of the

00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:34,320
charts won't be is exciting because it

00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:37,320
we are working off of a PDF but you'll

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,690
certainly get all the ideas here so a

00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,190
year ago we had two accelerators that

00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:43,800
were being shown here on the floor we

00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:47,070
had algo logics l3 order book which was

00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:50,670
and still is the fastest financial order

00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:54,570
book from a latency standpoint and we

00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:58,230
had the IBM data engine for no SQL and I

00:00:54,570 --> 00:01:01,770
was given a message to go forth and get

00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:04,559
more accelerators at that point we also

00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:06,420
had one developer kick card from nalo

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:09,119
tech and there of course in the booth

00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:11,400
right over there now you fast forward to

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:15,409
a year later we've got dozens of

00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:19,200
accelerators now over 20 of them we just

00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:24,119
we just put up on our website if you go

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:26,490
to IBM dot biz / power cappy you will

00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:28,290
see the listing of many of the

00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:30,420
accelerators that I'm going to just show

00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:32,520
their names here we now have three

00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:35,009
developer kits one from nelle attack

00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:38,600
alpha data and cynthia mall which those

00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:38,600
cards and those companies are here today

00:01:38,689 --> 00:01:45,390
now as we started to get more and more

00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:47,610
of these accelerators we found that they

00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:49,530
were grouped into three categories the

00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:52,320
first one we call transparent

00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:54,990
accelerators where and that's this green

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,299
box here where the accelerator and the

00:01:54,990 --> 00:02:00,750
library come together and they give you

00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:04,649
an ability that you may have already had

00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:06,360
such as compression or eraser code these

00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:07,890
are things that you can do today but you

00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,110
can do it much faster with an

00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:12,210
accelerator and all you have to do is

00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:14,280
real ink

00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:16,590
to point to the accelerator rather than

00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:20,010
where it was done in software so that's

00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:22,800
the first class of transparent the next

00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:24,480
class is a whole set of accelerators and

00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,630
this is where we have a majority of our

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:30,090
accelerators whole set where it gives

00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:32,310
the application writer the solution

00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:35,460
provider a capability that they never

00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:37,620
had before and therefore you have to

00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:41,580
write new code with your accelerator in

00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:44,040
order to take advantage of the FPGA and

00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:47,010
Cathy so that's the app integration

00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:49,620
required set of accelerators and finally

00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:52,650
the third set is full solutions this is

00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:55,950
where you receive the hardware the

00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:58,320
powering platform you get the FPGA the

00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:59,910
card the bit file that comes with it all

00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:01,380
the middle where all the application

00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:03,870
code and it comes with a bow around it

00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:07,200
support and everything else into your

00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:09,660
office to to provide a solution so those

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,580
are the three categories that that we've

00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:14,220
seen all of these new accelerators fall

00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:16,050
into so let's take a look at what these

00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:18,360
new accelerators are in these three

00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:20,910
categories we have a set of transparent

00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:23,700
accelerators eraser code just announced

00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:27,270
in China for the Hadoop market which

00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:29,780
will be fully compatible with Hadoop 300

00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:34,100
coming out we have an IBM will have a

00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:38,220
gzip compression cappy accelerator

00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:41,100
available in July and we have a few

00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:45,240
others that you can get and go look at

00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:47,760
on our IBM website integration required

00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:50,460
of course the IBM data engine for no SQL

00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:53,910
is an integration required accelerator

00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:56,850
because Redis had to write to our new

00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:59,520
block API are our arc API library in

00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:02,970
order to start to use the capi flash and

00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:07,170
now we have MongoDB and others starting

00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:11,180
to use it and here's a list of many many

00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:14,540
others including a whole set of a visual

00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:16,710
object recognition facial recognition a

00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:19,470
motion detection which I'll show

00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:22,410
available from silicon escapes who's

00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:23,900
over at the alpha data booth right there

00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:26,449
Kevin's waving to us there

00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:32,539
and they have some very compelling cool

00:04:26,449 --> 00:04:34,280
cappy demos of video analytics then we

00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:36,979
have our full solutions things like

00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:39,560
genomics processing for medico and etta

00:04:36,979 --> 00:04:42,110
ko's you can you can buy genomic

00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:45,620
processing systems on the power a

00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:48,080
platform from them today DRC and their

00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:50,419
graph analytics you can see DRC and talk

00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:53,449
to them at the xilinx booth right around

00:04:50,419 --> 00:04:56,860
the corner and and they have some fuzzy

00:04:53,449 --> 00:05:01,010
text searching and petascale analytics

00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:03,380
we have another half dozen in the queue

00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:05,240
that are ready to come forward in the

00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:06,680
next few months that you so keep

00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:10,639
checking back at that site for new

00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:16,610
listings questions on these we're good

00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:18,320
so far so without the products also need

00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:20,720
the ecosystem around them and as I

00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,789
mentioned we have alpha daily ascent Ian

00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,660
and nallett a call have developer kit

00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:28,660
cards but we also have a bunch of

00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:31,160
frameworks and examples and tools for

00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:34,190
people to use to help you develop a

00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:36,349
cappy accelerator we have a DMA mover

00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:37,970
which will be open source we have all

00:05:36,349 --> 00:05:42,169
the approvals now to have an open source

00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:45,979
and will be out in github shortly but

00:05:42,169 --> 00:05:50,180
and all of the all of these can be found

00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:54,169
again on that IBM dot biz / power cappy

00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:59,330
website the capi framework is an open

00:05:54,169 --> 00:06:04,789
framework created by a set of people out

00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:06,919
of Europe we had the 8 a cafe to copy

00:06:04,789 --> 00:06:11,630
translation that came out of our Beijing

00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:12,919
lab thank you and a psl simulation

00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:15,560
engine of course has been there an hour

00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:19,159
mem copy example code these are all out

00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:20,690
there to help drive the ecosystem and be

00:06:19,159 --> 00:06:28,449
a set of tools that you can use right

00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:28,449
out of the gate so where is Kathy going

00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:34,219
this is the old way of doing data

00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:36,229
analytics where you have a whole lot of

00:06:34,219 --> 00:06:38,539
data your pull it into memory you do

00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:41,719
your analytics on it in memory but if

00:06:38,539 --> 00:06:45,469
you want to bring in an acceleration at

00:06:41,719 --> 00:06:47,569
that point in the without cappy of

00:06:45,469 --> 00:06:49,280
course you have to bring in a device

00:06:47,569 --> 00:06:51,800
driver and you add all kinds of latency

00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:55,490
and overhead and there's no sharing of

00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:58,580
memory so this would be FPGA

00:06:55,490 --> 00:07:00,620
acceleration without Cappy Cappy makes

00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:03,650
all this easier by extending the memory

00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:07,819
over here making the calls back and

00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:11,270
forth much simpler but this is where

00:07:07,819 --> 00:07:13,699
it's going and this is where Cappy and

00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:15,979
analytics is all going to take off now

00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:18,080
you can see this with data analytics

00:07:15,979 --> 00:07:21,590
where the data gets processed on the fly

00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:23,539
as it moves into the system doing either

00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:26,569
pre-processing a whole bunch of heavy

00:07:23,539 --> 00:07:28,460
lifting along the way but it's not just

00:07:26,569 --> 00:07:30,590
for analytics video encoding and

00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:33,740
decoding compression eraser code all of

00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:36,080
these other transforms are going to

00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:39,080
start to happen as we call data in

00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:41,659
motion or bump on a wire and and you're

00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:44,569
going to start seeing these FPGAs do all

00:07:41,659 --> 00:07:48,039
this work ingresa ng doing needle in a

00:07:44,569 --> 00:07:50,930
haystack kind of checking rather than

00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:53,240
putting all of that work on to the

00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:55,639
processor or having to go in and out of

00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:57,319
the system back and forth so this is the

00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:59,360
direction that we're clearly seeing and

00:07:57,319 --> 00:08:03,439
come next year I'm sure we're going to

00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:07,180
have a ton of items to show here at the

00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:13,400
open power booth that follow this model

00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:16,629
questions again on that ok so just a

00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:19,189
pair of of examples the first one is

00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:22,250
dynamic time warping which is a pattern

00:08:19,189 --> 00:08:27,080
historical pattern matching this came

00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:29,509
out of tsinghua university professor foo

00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:35,630
I believe is that right professor foo is

00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:37,699
the dynamic time warp where you have a

00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:39,409
stream of data coming in and you give it

00:08:37,699 --> 00:08:41,509
a pattern to match

00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:43,399
and using using Cappy in the

00:08:41,509 --> 00:08:45,740
acceleration engine it's picking out all

00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:48,470
the patterns that might be like this so

00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:51,199
if you're looking at data coming off of

00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:53,269
a bunch of power generators and you know

00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:54,769
there's a failing signature you can

00:08:53,269 --> 00:08:56,959
start to look for that signature before

00:08:54,769 --> 00:08:59,360
the failure starts to happen that's one

00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:01,730
of many uses of these this kind of

00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,529
pattern matching and and of course the

00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:06,290
performance on this goes way through the

00:09:03,529 --> 00:09:10,100
roof because you're doing this through

00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:11,899
the accelerator and then finally again

00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:15,970
no animation here but this is always a

00:09:11,899 --> 00:09:19,459
fun one to show our friend Matt here

00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:22,569
there is a when this when the animation

00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:26,569
is going he cycles through happy sad

00:09:22,569 --> 00:09:29,480
disgusted and angry and the text here

00:09:26,569 --> 00:09:30,829
changes with his face so what do you do

00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:33,470
with something like that retail

00:09:30,829 --> 00:09:36,379
analytics so if you can watch somebody's

00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:39,470
face as they pick up a product and look

00:09:36,379 --> 00:09:42,620
at it you can get immediate feedback as

00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:44,990
to the packaging or what what what it is

00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:47,990
around that product that they like and

00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:50,660
again over its silicon escapes with the

00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:53,149
Alpha data they have live or they have

00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:55,160
demos of all this going on but beyond

00:09:53,149 --> 00:09:58,009
that they're picking up the gender the

00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:59,959
age and in this case because it's been

00:09:58,009 --> 00:10:03,199
trained it says that this is matt yang

00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:05,600
or this is matt and it's not the other

00:10:03,199 --> 00:10:06,579
people here that it's been trained on so

00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,990
there's some facial recognition

00:10:06,579 --> 00:10:12,050
capability in here and this just shows

00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:15,380
all of the kinds of cappy IP that they

00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:17,149
put on the FPGA facial detection gender

00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:21,100
classification age classification

00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:24,889
etcetera all working today and and

00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:26,870
running on the power 8 system so those

00:10:24,889 --> 00:10:29,959
are just two examples of kathy and and

00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:37,389
how far that we have come with it so

00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:37,389
