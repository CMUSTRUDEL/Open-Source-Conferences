hi everyone my name is Ching Lee I come

00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:09,780
from idea China system life I'm

00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:14,730
currently working on system software to

00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:17,910
fund infrastructure so today i will talk

00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:20,730
to you about a healthcare dynamic pic

00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:23,960
data solution now open power so i will

00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:28,470
not talk and talk about some

00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:31,289
technologies but a solution to solve

00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:39,809
some real customer pinpoints so i hope

00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:42,809
this view okay so i have very simple

00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:45,270
agenda so first let's take a look at the

00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:48,920
challenges in the data driven health

00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:52,890
care organization then I i will show you

00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:56,789
IBM product that can be a good candidate

00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:59,910
as the foundation in that's customized

00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:02,370
solution for healthcare customers at

00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:04,110
last i will show you the pic today at

00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:08,909
the stories operation the maintenance

00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:15,540
solution field on top of PCM and open

00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:19,200
open power so from from last year we

00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:23,520
started to engage with some china local

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:28,229
healthcare customers and are we we

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:31,880
realized that in healthcare industry it

00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:36,299
has become more and more data children

00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:38,880
because of the following factors so I've

00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:42,659
not goes through the factors here but i

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:45,750
think this factors not only applies to

00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:50,520
our china market but also applies to

00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:53,130
other big countries so the below flow

00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:56,280
shows that shows the analytics continuum

00:01:53,130 --> 00:02:00,509
for healthcare industry so you can see

00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:03,149
from the flow data from the beginning so

00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:05,909
the raw data generation from the

00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:08,729
transaction reporting to the last step

00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:13,680
the advanced analytics for healthcare

00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:19,650
data all these steps are disappearing so

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:22,620
so actually the healthcare companies has

00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:26,909
helped the same motivation to build up

00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:29,879
our common unify the platform too too

00:02:26,909 --> 00:02:34,049
too many to tommy's they are new

00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:38,819
business model so so the customer we

00:02:34,049 --> 00:02:41,519
engage the healthcare customer their new

00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:44,040
business model is to gather the

00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:47,720
healthcare data from their partners

00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:50,609
usually the partners are Hospital

00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:56,370
hospitals so the hospital's can get the

00:02:50,609 --> 00:02:59,280
raw data from the road at hand and puts

00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:04,290
the data to the headquarter data center

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:07,139
and the healthcare company can analyze

00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:13,620
this data and provides the dinner

00:03:07,139 --> 00:03:16,459
service to their end users so this so to

00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:20,430
build up such a unified picketers

00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:22,769
platform for healthcare customer so

00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:27,049
let's take a look at the challenges

00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:29,760
first so this chart shows the overall

00:03:27,049 --> 00:03:33,299
solution for this kind of healthcare

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:35,310
healthcare customers so you can see from

00:03:33,299 --> 00:03:39,540
this chart that's the total solution is

00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:42,209
filled up on top of multiple clusters so

00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:45,150
the left side is actually the haircutter

00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:48,269
picketing ha cluster and the right style

00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:52,859
is the remote site clusters so the

00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:54,959
problem is they are just like I just

00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:57,900
mentioned there are lots of hospitals

00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:01,019
located in different regions in China i

00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:03,689
think is similar for other countries so

00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:07,889
the number of the remote ciety very big

00:04:03,689 --> 00:04:09,449
so for the customer so for the customers

00:04:07,889 --> 00:04:13,939
they have the first the Challenger is

00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:17,880
two how to efficiently or manage the

00:04:13,939 --> 00:04:22,079
multi clusters in this or in a unified

00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:25,740
platform so currently actually the

00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:30,870
remote size are managed there are

00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:33,449
or cluster individually so there is also

00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:37,319
some other challenges such as the

00:04:33,449 --> 00:04:39,720
security and use abilities and the

00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:45,560
second second challenge for the customer

00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:48,240
is that is the complexity or complexity

00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:51,930
because as we all know that the big data

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:58,500
stack is very complicated is composed by

00:04:51,930 --> 00:05:02,310
many open source components and the

00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:05,789
customer would like to ensure the open

00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:09,509
the Paquita stack are same across

00:05:05,789 --> 00:05:11,550
different cluster different sites so

00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:15,210
that's a big challenge for custom also

00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:18,240
that they need to ensure the upgrades

00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:21,810
across different sites can be management

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:26,090
in the same platform so it's very hard

00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:29,039
in this current customer solutions so

00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:31,380
the third challenge is the security and

00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:33,810
usability I just mentioned that because

00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:36,780
currently the remote I'll customer is

00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:39,389
managed they are cluster individually

00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:42,659
you even they are managed they are

00:05:39,389 --> 00:05:47,210
clustered manually so it is introduced

00:05:42,659 --> 00:05:51,509
lots of security and usability problems

00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:53,960
so to solve this challenges we figured

00:05:51,509 --> 00:05:56,669
out that we have like existing products

00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:59,520
that can be a good candidate to be the

00:05:56,669 --> 00:06:04,020
foundation of the new solution for

00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:06,780
healthcare customers because so the name

00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:11,099
of the product its platform cluster

00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:13,349
manager piece on is because it's it's a

00:06:11,099 --> 00:06:16,620
good system management tool on top of

00:06:13,349 --> 00:06:19,319
open power and the health care customer

00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:22,949
is very interested in IBM open power

00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:25,830
platform because of the benefits it can

00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:29,310
get from open power but I will not

00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:31,139
mention that a lot here because a lot it

00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:35,339
has been mentioning in other sessions

00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:38,030
these days so second second the PCM has

00:06:35,339 --> 00:06:41,620
a good pattern paste the cluster manager

00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:46,070
and capability that can be used to

00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:49,370
standard standardize the customers big

00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:53,440
data stack and other software components

00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:59,150
so that he can manage the multi sighs

00:06:53,440 --> 00:07:03,590
you know very easy way or let me have a

00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:06,290
ver pick introduction to PCN so if you

00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:09,380
are from HPC domain you must be very

00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:13,190
familiar with that this too so it's

00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:16,070
actually the most powerful lifecycle

00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:18,800
management for skewered cluster

00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:21,350
environments but now it's known it's not

00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:26,140
only applies to hpc domain but also

00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:29,350
applies to other areas for example hpc a

00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:34,490
cloud computing big data Hobart skill

00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:39,590
and etc so piston has lots of key

00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:42,860
capabilities so for example the cluster

00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:45,110
template designer and the multi-tenancy

00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:48,890
capability these are very key

00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:52,760
capabilities for for this health care

00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:57,980
solution also PCM has the alerting and

00:07:52,760 --> 00:08:00,560
reporting function and automated

00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:04,550
infrastructure management and it has

00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:08,300
also some all the possible enhance the

00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:10,150
classroom management capabilities so the

00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:13,610
customer can cast will also benefit from

00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:17,900
this capabilities so this chart just

00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:20,920
shows the how is pc i'm managing node

00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:23,540
perspective personalities so all these

00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:28,550
operations can be done on the GUI and

00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:31,420
it's all open powers 35 and this is the

00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:37,100
hardware management and monitoring

00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:40,730
snapshots from pc on so it's his pro is

00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:43,700
provides the monitoring and all the

00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:46,050
possible management capabilities include

00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:49,190
power cycling firmware update and

00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:52,640
etc I will not go throughout all days

00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:56,339
also it can can monitor the network

00:08:52,640 --> 00:09:01,850
switch and chassis and the IBM spectrum

00:08:56,339 --> 00:09:04,649
skill storage it can all be monitor so

00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:10,079
pattern-based classroom management is

00:09:04,649 --> 00:09:12,390
the key feature of PCM that's why it can

00:09:10,079 --> 00:09:16,860
be the foundation of this health care

00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:19,589
solution so this the the pattern based

00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:23,880
the cluster designer the customer can

00:09:19,589 --> 00:09:28,470
very easily to design their cluster in

00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:31,860
the drop and drag and drop manner on the

00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:35,070
cuy also with the design it class or

00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:37,290
templates because the cluster can be

00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:38,880
deployed at management in a one-click

00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:43,140
pieces it's very easy for the customer

00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:47,339
also this this designer can be easily

00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:50,730
integrated with other popular tools for

00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:52,829
example and Barry in this case is amber

00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:57,870
is used that you manage the picked it

00:09:52,829 --> 00:10:01,649
has stack so last does take a look at

00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:06,029
how we built this solution by using open

00:10:01,649 --> 00:10:09,570
power and PCM so just lucky i mentioned

00:10:06,029 --> 00:10:14,010
to use pattern to standard standardize

00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:17,910
the big data stack so with PCM cluster

00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:20,279
designer the customer can easily model

00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:23,250
their multi-system pic data stack into

00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:26,279
cluster template so and automates there

00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:30,000
a company configuration well and very

00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:32,899
restful api so you can you can see from

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,310
this box all the components can be

00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:38,760
modeled in the cluster templates

00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:41,310
including the big data stack manage the

00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:44,310
bar embry and a operating system and

00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:47,490
other components here so with the

00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:51,269
upgrade capability provided by PCM the

00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:54,529
customer can easily operate from the Old

00:10:51,269 --> 00:10:55,819
Warden to the new warden and easily

00:10:54,529 --> 00:11:03,439
the new component in the cluster

00:10:55,819 --> 00:11:06,620
template so also because the the

00:11:03,439 --> 00:11:11,809
customer solution is based on multi size

00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:17,949
is it can be easily p.m. can be can be

00:11:11,809 --> 00:11:17,949
acting at the Ox Twitter to deploy the

00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:24,740
apply the software stack to different

00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:29,420
locations it also leverages caster is

00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:33,439
node function to automation automation

00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:37,029
works on the remote island so at last

00:11:33,439 --> 00:11:40,550
base d this solution the customer can

00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:45,920
easily accelerate the air clustered

00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:48,620
delivery on multiple sites and reduce

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:51,800
their their cost and finally help the

00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:54,949
customer to confidently in a witch on

00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:57,499
the health care is instead itself

00:11:54,949 --> 00:12:00,980
instead of span spending a lot of time

00:11:57,499 --> 00:12:05,839
on the classroom and infrastructure

00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:09,949
management work so so that's my topic

00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:13,819
today and by the way during I'm writing

00:12:09,949 --> 00:12:17,720
this slice the PM has been rebranding

00:12:13,819 --> 00:12:19,579
the to spectrum cluster foundation a new

00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:21,649
name you've used you if you see a

00:12:19,579 --> 00:12:25,370
spectrum cluster foundation that's the

00:12:21,649 --> 00:12:28,309
new name of PCM this new name also is

00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:31,819
highly telling that PCM is not only a

00:12:28,309 --> 00:12:35,059
product but also a foundation in others

00:12:31,819 --> 00:12:39,170
q out solutions for example cloud
