I'm Andy Andy Lin I'm the vice

00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:07,020
president's strategy at mark three

00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:08,639
systems I'll be kind of talking about

00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:10,740
that's from a couple different angle I

00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:14,400
think from a lot of the other talks in

00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:17,130
this particular session so we're

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,390
actually a long time IBM premier

00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:22,949
business partner we've been around since

00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:24,869
the mid-90s a solution provider you know

00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:28,050
offering infrastructure but also like

00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:32,070
software services and clouds so you know

00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:36,090
our involvement with open powers is

00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:39,750
really around the barrel I system the

00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:41,219
you know we one of the main things like

00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,840
our clients which our clients are

00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:45,090
enterprise clients and service providers

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,820
pretty much have data centers across

00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:48,930
North America primarily you know they've

00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,670
been pushing us not only to help them

00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:51,539
with kind of their core IT strategies

00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,100
which are around a lot of the

00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:54,840
applications that people need to kind of

00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,670
maintain optimize and improve these days

00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,320
but also around you know building

00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,449
strategies around digital cloud stacks

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,309
which all you guys are you know very

00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:04,260
familiar with primarily for us it's like

00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:06,750
on-premise and hybrid strategies how do

00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:08,280
you get the same type of development and

00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,450
agility that you would get you know in

00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,979
the public cloud but do it in your own

00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:13,740
data center for whatever reason need a

00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:15,390
lot it's based on economies of scale a

00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:18,540
lot of it's based on you know security

00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:20,270
or specific reasons around why people

00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:23,369
want to kind of build that stack out so

00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:25,650
you know we've had the ability to offer

00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:27,630
you know kind of what I would call you

00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:29,310
know core power up to this point but

00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:30,869
then also you know a lot of folks are

00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:33,119
looking at other alternative strategies

00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:35,280
as well to still leverage a lot of a lot

00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:39,090
of the benefits of power but do it kind

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,680
of in a newer way and barrel eyes really

00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:43,549
one that we see like a lot of interest

00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,810
in a lot of demand and really filling a

00:01:43,549 --> 00:01:47,729
requirement that a lot of people

00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:50,180
so for those of you who aren't familiar

00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:53,369
with it I think most of you are but

00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:57,360
barrel I is built on the Open Compute

00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:59,460
Project recipe project spec the floor

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,070
factor itself is built around really

00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:04,649
about hyperscale and and being able to

00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:06,420
scale to most of the time an environment

00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:08,519
that has thousands or tens of thousands

00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:10,259
of systems even though you know we're

00:02:08,519 --> 00:02:12,590
seeing more and more interest even you

00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:17,550
know what kind of at a number as well

00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:20,310
and you know if you look at what

00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:22,019
Rackspace came out with it and I think

00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:26,130
this was actually approved and by the

00:02:22,019 --> 00:02:28,920
ocp project I think of be wary months

00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:31,410
ago officially so it's the specs are

00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:35,849
officially out there that actually build

00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:38,580
on top of but you know we've actually

00:02:35,849 --> 00:02:39,870
had a system in our in our lab for a

00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,910
couple months now and we're working

00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:45,420
toward actually commercializing on a

00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:47,160
wide scale I think in Rackspace's my

00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:48,209
bm's press release today they talked

00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,850
about you know they're going to have

00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:54,900
public cloud offerings later on this

00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:57,299
year and our our concept is basically to

00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:59,489
allow people also to build an on-premise

00:02:57,299 --> 00:03:00,959
or you know however types track what

00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:03,359
that would leverage the same type of

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,579
system when there are data centers and

00:03:03,359 --> 00:03:07,200
and kind of going in concept in concert

00:03:05,579 --> 00:03:10,109
with what we normally offer to our

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,930
clients today is having our guys kind of

00:03:10,109 --> 00:03:14,819
trained up as far as being able to offer

00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:16,410
guidance the ability to integrated with

00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:19,769
existing strategies being able to

00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:22,590
delineate between the two sides we call

00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:24,269
like a bimodal IT strategy and helping

00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:26,690
them you know properly execute maintain

00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:29,130
kind of over the over the long term a

00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:31,019
couple of the areas that I think we

00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:33,660
found you know interesting you know just

00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:35,069
more perspective is there's a lot of

00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:37,530
stuff around here about you know the

00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:39,049
open BMC and that's been something you

00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:42,930
know that from our perspective we found

00:03:39,049 --> 00:03:44,850
pretty exciting it's it is a it is a

00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:46,829
change from other power architectures

00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:49,620
and in the past but just kind of the

00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:53,190
ability to you know incremental E and

00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:54,180
quickly advance the capabilities of the

00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:56,280
platform

00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:58,530
we've seen you know Co drops occurring

00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,900
pretty frequently so much like you

00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:03,269
iterate today on you know the the

00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:04,590
traditional cloud software stack you

00:04:03,269 --> 00:04:06,750
also have the ability to do that as well

00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:08,310
obviously from the harbour perspective

00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:10,590
which is a little bit of a change but

00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:12,989
it's been you know incredibly exciting

00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:14,579
to kind of witness and we're really

00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:15,719
really pumped about you know word that

00:04:14,579 --> 00:04:18,840
can kind of take this particular

00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:21,419
platform in the future just one last

00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:24,270
point about you know our perspectives is

00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:26,520
a lot of the things around Cathy and

00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:28,860
accelerators and potentially becoming

00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:31,349
more and more accessible for anyone to

00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:32,460
kind of code to it and access it in the

00:04:31,349 --> 00:04:33,960
near future that's the thing that we

00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:35,940
really hope that the community continues

00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,380
to kind of reinforce and and kind of

00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:39,539
bring to the forefront because that I

00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:40,770
think that's going to be a true true

00:04:39,539 --> 00:04:42,650
game changer obviously there are a lot

00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:46,349
of huge you know price performance

00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:47,940
benefits of adopting open power from

00:04:46,349 --> 00:04:50,280
what we've seen and I even a lot of the

00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:52,560
tests that we've run we view that as

00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:55,590
kind of like be the thing that will

00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,930
really really kind of push this platform

00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:59,520
and open our general and in the future

00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:02,280
so would definitely encourage everyone

00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,889
to so can you continue to push that

00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:06,539
forward so if you have any questions I

00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:08,190
know this is kind of a short talk I'll

00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:11,479
be around a little bit afterwards but

00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:11,479
