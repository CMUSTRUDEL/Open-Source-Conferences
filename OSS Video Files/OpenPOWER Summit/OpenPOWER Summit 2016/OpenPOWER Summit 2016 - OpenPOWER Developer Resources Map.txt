so yeah so I'm going to talk to you guys

00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:07,470
about ways that we are sort of enabling

00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:09,870
developers to get involved with in the

00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:12,719
open power ecosystem and some pretty

00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:15,660
cool and fun ways opportunities to win a

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:18,180
lot of great prizes so please pay

00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:20,100
attention so I want to start off this is

00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:22,699
the open power developer resources map

00:00:20,100 --> 00:01:03,480
this is something that is now live at

00:00:22,699 --> 00:01:06,420
developers dot the developer resources

00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08,549
map this is now live at developers open

00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,380
power foundation org this is something

00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:12,479
that we put together for our global

00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:14,700
developer audience for them to quickly

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:18,030
and easily find ways that they can

00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:20,970
access open power virtual machines and

00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:22,439
open power resources in person so you

00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:24,450
can see across the top here it does have

00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:26,759
it has a set of filterable categories

00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:28,500
you basically just put in you know are

00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:30,180
you looking for something open are you

00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,460
looking for something that's by request

00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:34,320
where you kind of have to describe your

00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:36,119
project and you know it's kind of based

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,150
on merit or something a little bit more

00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:40,530
premium like stack velocity or OVH where

00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:42,329
you do have to pay money but you're

00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:44,100
getting some really top notch virtual

00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:47,159
machine resources with lots of cores for

00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:48,810
scaling and then you can filter by you

00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:52,890
know what type of instance you're

00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:56,189
looking for power kvm bare metal etc any

00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:57,659
accelerators GPUs or otherwise and then

00:01:56,189 --> 00:01:59,700
a particular OS that you're looking to

00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:01,380
work in and it will quickly narrow down

00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,180
the sights to give you the exact one

00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:05,460
that will match the work you're trying

00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:06,810
to do so this is a living breathing site

00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:09,239
it's something that we are continually

00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:11,670
updating right now we do have 19

00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:13,540
available sites on there and looking to

00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:15,640
have over 40 by the end of the year

00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:20,290
so definitely bookmark that page and

00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:21,489
keep coming back so now this is

00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:22,959
something a little bit more exciting and

00:02:21,489 --> 00:02:24,819
something that ties into those virtual

00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,709
machines that you might be using through

00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:28,689
our map and this is the open power

00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:30,430
developer challenge you might have seen

00:02:28,689 --> 00:02:33,159
this announced by Brad McCready earlier

00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:35,319
Rob high and he's his keynote earlier

00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:36,790
now i'm bringing it to you again but

00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:38,620
this is something this is a the first

00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:41,109
time we're doing this and it's a way for

00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:43,389
developers to compete for up to i think

00:02:41,109 --> 00:02:45,939
about 17 thousand dollars worth of

00:02:43,389 --> 00:02:47,980
prizes ranging from a trip an

00:02:45,939 --> 00:02:51,489
all-expenses-paid trip to supercomputing

00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:54,010
2016 in salt lake city to iPads to eye

00:02:51,489 --> 00:02:56,019
watches so something you want to get

00:02:54,010 --> 00:03:05,470
involved in two ways for you to

00:02:56,019 --> 00:03:07,030
commiserate something all new for open

00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:09,159
powers so you can port something new

00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:11,169
create something new for open power and

00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:12,730
then go faster with accelerators you

00:03:11,169 --> 00:03:14,230
know show us how you can use GPUs or

00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:17,310
other tools to really make your

00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:20,560
application sing on the highest platform

00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:21,790
the second one is the spark rally and

00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,819
this is where we're encouraging you to

00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:27,430
use spark and GPU accelerators in tandem

00:03:24,819 --> 00:03:30,069
to accelerate the image net database to

00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:32,139
train a deep neural network to recognize

00:03:30,069 --> 00:03:33,579
images with greater accuracy and then

00:03:32,139 --> 00:03:36,519
demonstrate you know how you want to use

00:03:33,579 --> 00:03:39,549
spark in order to scale that so this is

00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:43,060
now open as of yesterday so you can go

00:03:39,549 --> 00:03:45,190
to open power dev post com to register

00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:47,739
it's free to participate so you know

00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:49,150
definitely do it in addition to the

00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:52,479
prizes we're going to be having you know

00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:55,690
in person meetups you know you can stay

00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:57,310
tuned get instructional videos hacker

00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:59,590
hours with some of our developers

00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:01,000
through slack so it's a really great way

00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:03,489
for you to get involved and to really

00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,620
get you know really close to some of the

00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:08,349
experts that we have to help build an

00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:10,209
application for open power the

00:04:08,349 --> 00:04:14,229
submission period officially opens on

00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:16,389
may first and then closes on august

00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:18,759
second so we're giving you roughly 90

00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:20,799
days to complete your application but

00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:22,419
like i said it's open for registrations

00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:24,310
now so you can even have a little bit

00:04:22,419 --> 00:04:25,719
longer than 90 if you kind of want to

00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:26,800
get started and forming your teams and

00:04:25,719 --> 00:04:29,039
thinking about what your projects going

00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,039
to be

00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:35,380
but then finally we have the open power

00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:37,150
HPC application ecosystem initiative I

00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:38,980
know it's quite a mouthful but this is

00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:41,260
something that we are working with the

00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:43,690
University of Michigan and bounty source

00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:46,300
and the goal here is to get open source

00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:47,830
code ported over to the open power

00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,870
platform so this is something that's

00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:51,760
been administered by the University of

00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:53,380
Michigan and we're adding other academic

00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:55,360
partners and essentially they are going

00:04:53,380 --> 00:05:00,160
to our bounty source page which is

00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:02,140
bounty source com / teams / IBM hpc and

00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,200
they're putting up open source codes

00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:06,460
that we want ported to power for those

00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,500
of you who are familiar with bounty

00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:11,110
source essentially there's payouts for

00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:14,050
every code that you port it's open to

00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:15,880
anybody ever you know it's roughly a

00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:18,610
hundred dollars per successful code port

00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:20,530
for some of those its greater depending

00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:22,270
on the difficulty for some of those its

00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:24,510
lesser depending on the difficulty so

00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:28,660
there's really something for everyone to

00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:30,100
try and to try and port it over you know

00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:31,540
it's a really great way for if you're

00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:34,270
just a you know someone who likes to

00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:35,860
code as a hobby to earn some extra cash

00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:38,200
and also kind of be involved with the

00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:41,290
open power foundation so this is

00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:43,870
actually this actually got up so this is

00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:46,450
a geared towards university students

00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:48,220
however it is open to anybody but we

00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:50,140
know that university students are always

00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:52,660
looking for beer money so this is a

00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:55,000
quick and easy way for them to use it

00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:59,350
while you know enhancing their coding

00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:03,190
skills so yeah I really about wraps it

00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:05,170
up for me so just to recap everything so

00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:07,180
we have the open power developer

00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:08,860
resources map which is where you can

00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:10,750
just see you know all the different

00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:13,420
tools that are available to you and how

00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:14,590
to find the best resources to meet the

00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:17,760
needs of the project that you're working

00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:20,770
on the open power developer challenge

00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:22,870
registration is open now and the

00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:25,450
submission period begins May first and

00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:27,640
closes August second competing for up

00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:30,820
roughly seventeen thousand dollars worth

00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:32,980
of prizes as well as a dinner with Brad

00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:35,110
McCready and everybody I know everybody

00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:37,840
wants to have dinner with Brad and then

00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:40,479
finally the open power hpc application

00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,139
ecosystem initiative go to bounty source

00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:43,539
there's already

00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:46,949
some codes up there ready to be ported

00:06:43,539 --> 00:06:46,949
