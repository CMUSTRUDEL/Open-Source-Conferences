good afternoon my name is Dirk platter

00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:07,710
I'm from the unit supercomputing center

00:00:05,089 --> 00:00:10,679
instead of say talking about the

00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:14,580
research which we are doing at annually

00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:16,470
in relation of applications and computer

00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:19,170
architectures I want to rather talk

00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:20,939
today about some of the activities with

00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:23,430
an open power where we try to organize

00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:26,400
the different academic members with an

00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:28,710
open power and actually I mean you heard

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,349
earlier today I mean that open power now

00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:33,960
reached a membership of 200 members and

00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:36,329
quite a lot of them so about 50 of them

00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:39,210
are academic members so open power has

00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:42,510
been quite successful in this very young

00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:44,910
time of existence of attracting academic

00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:47,160
members and I think they're good reasons

00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:49,320
for data of course it's attractive in

00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,879
the sense of what I cited technologies

00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,180
which are developed with an OPA power

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,199
and where research can benefit on but

00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,600
it's also attractive from the

00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:00,180
perspective of this being becoming an

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,940
ecosystem which allows to interact not

00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:05,250
only with our site leading academic

00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:07,590
institutions but also with leading

00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:10,290
technology providers both in the

00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:14,159
industrial area s as well as also quite

00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:16,380
interesting as a maze now when our goals

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,110
within the academic discussion group

00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:21,299
which is say the current platform of the

00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:24,180
academic partners with an open power

00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:26,970
well first of all we started to work a

00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,140
lot on trying to provide training and to

00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:31,799
give the opportunity to exchange

00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:33,689
experience which say academic people are

00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:36,240
obtaining by using the open power

00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:39,450
technologies and also by their own

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:41,640
research to provide a platform for the

00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:43,920
academic members to network among

00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:46,799
themselves and in particular we had a

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,720
bit of a focus so far on hpc so to

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,729
engage the htpc community will give you

00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,229
an example later on and certainly a

00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:54,659
future I would hope that we exempted

00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:58,619
also to more what you would call say

00:01:54,659 --> 00:02:00,479
data focused science and the first point

00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:02,310
I don't think we really reach that but

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,740
is to at some point also enable

00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:07,220
co.design activities I mean Scott from

00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:10,979
mellanox already stressed this aspect

00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:12,900
earlier in this talk now what we are

00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:13,560
doing in the context of training we are

00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,780
currently

00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:19,140
running regular webinars about once per

00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:20,550
month where we invite people from

00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:23,730
different parts of the open power

00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:26,160
foundation to give presentations and to

00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:27,840
allow whoever is interested to listen to

00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,090
these presentations and to ask questions

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,370
and we try to balance your really

00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:35,370
academic speakers and commercial members

00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:37,769
to provide training on new technologies

00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:40,590
but also to be able I mean to provide

00:02:37,769 --> 00:02:44,060
that academic members can give their

00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:46,980
experience on open power technologies

00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:49,170
all the all these webinars they are

00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:51,030
recorded and the slides are collected

00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:53,459
and they are available for the members

00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:55,950
of OPA power so in this way we also try

00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:58,190
to provide benefit for academic members

00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:00,930
to really become member of OPA power I

00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:03,720
just give you say an overview hear about

00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:05,790
the quite broad range of topics which we

00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:08,880
have addressed so far in this different

00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:12,209
webinars ranging from say very technical

00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:14,430
very nice until also more practical I

00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:16,980
mean how can people use for instance

00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:20,130
doing performance analysis using the

00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:22,200
different processing technologies we

00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:25,140
also go into extent that towards say

00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:27,420
experience on porting applications a lot

00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:28,769
of focus and also interest worse related

00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:34,500
with new technologies like for instance

00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:36,780
caffeine oops okay in terms of

00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:40,739
networking we have been organizing in

00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:43,470
the recent past several workshops there

00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:45,959
was the first one just before the

00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:48,930
supercomputing conference in austin with

00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:51,660
more than 30 participants had closed the

00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:54,780
after had been and second workshop more

00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:56,389
at a national level in india again we

00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:59,670
had attracted several dozens

00:03:56,389 --> 00:04:03,120
participants from quite a broad range of

00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:06,350
institutions within india and we are

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:09,959
going to continue that during this year

00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:13,680
now another opportunity in order to

00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:16,859
engage the vital community in hpc is by

00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,989
organizing workshops we currently have

00:04:16,859 --> 00:04:21,409
an open call for papers for a workshop

00:04:18,989 --> 00:04:23,039
bit have been accepted for the

00:04:21,409 --> 00:04:25,900
international supercomputing conference

00:04:23,039 --> 00:04:29,770
which is taking place in Frankfurt

00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:32,680
in late June so if somebody has more or

00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:34,930
less an almost very paper the deadline

00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:37,449
for submitting a paper is by end of next

00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:41,229
week and we expecting something around

00:04:37,449 --> 00:04:44,590
220 papers of which we hope to be able

00:04:41,229 --> 00:04:46,570
then to accept around ten papers again

00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:50,259
in a very broad range of topics from

00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:53,199
ranging from experience on porting

00:04:50,259 --> 00:04:55,990
applications of the questions of co

00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:57,850
design of hpc software stacks all the

00:04:55,990 --> 00:05:03,850
way till benchmarking a validation

00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:06,370
studies of open power architectures now

00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:08,260
let me just give you say very selective

00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:12,310
and quick overview or four different

00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:15,039
activities from a DG members I mean it

00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:17,740
is quite broad range I mean across the

00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:20,080
whole world a star and Singapore I mean

00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:22,510
they have been doing starting to do work

00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:25,389
on application porting an optimization

00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:28,210
see that in India or specifically they

00:05:25,389 --> 00:05:29,919
had start to work on a graph series or

00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:32,470
something which is a bit more complex to

00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:35,729
address with these non regular

00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:38,979
applications and Julie we had to

00:05:35,729 --> 00:05:41,320
inaugurate it on power acceleration

00:05:38,979 --> 00:05:43,990
design center in October last year and

00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:46,210
within the center we focused together

00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:49,690
with our partners IBM envidia on

00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:53,260
enabling applications on open power

00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:55,419
platforms so we are open for working not

00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:58,199
only with application owners within our

00:05:55,419 --> 00:06:01,060
own Center but with application owners

00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:03,370
outside of the center and our interest

00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:05,440
is to learn more about how well can

00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:08,199
scientific applications exploit these

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:10,900
kind of architectures the Hydra Center

00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:14,070
you will learn more about it later in a

00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:16,360
talk about match effort and they also

00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:18,580
initiated the power acceleration design

00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:20,409
center and at the moment are also doing

00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:23,409
starting to work on application

00:06:20,409 --> 00:06:25,720
enablement there are several sites in

00:06:23,409 --> 00:06:29,010
India which our site working the context

00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:31,900
of open power I jacket two examples of

00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:34,630
Mumbai and the Indian Institute of

00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:37,029
Technology in inver key the first one

00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:39,249
working on an app initio chemistry code

00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:42,519
mochas ported that on

00:06:39,249 --> 00:06:44,709
our and in working on database

00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:47,499
technologies you heard earlier from

00:06:44,709 --> 00:06:50,469
Fernanda from operate all the exciting

00:06:47,499 --> 00:06:53,409
work which they are doing French

00:06:50,469 --> 00:06:56,709
University rouse is again also focusing

00:06:53,409 --> 00:07:00,729
on porting graph application particular

00:06:56,709 --> 00:07:02,979
here this graph 500 benchmark and not

00:07:00,729 --> 00:07:04,509
only say to the power architecture but

00:07:02,979 --> 00:07:07,209
which is even more challenging I mean to

00:07:04,509 --> 00:07:11,199
also to use the GPUs and finally yet

00:07:07,209 --> 00:07:12,819
another partner from India the sastra

00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,159
university they are working on

00:07:12,819 --> 00:07:20,049
bioinformatics applications and power

00:07:15,159 --> 00:07:22,629
and open power systems oops so let me

00:07:20,049 --> 00:07:25,360
conclude we have a growing number of

00:07:22,629 --> 00:07:27,819
academic organizations that became

00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,589
number of open power and we try to

00:07:27,819 --> 00:07:31,839
organize them with an academia

00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:34,989
discussion group to give them a platform

00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:37,839
for training network and engagement and

00:07:34,989 --> 00:07:40,629
I hope that at some point we will reach

00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:43,209
say intensity of interaction which will

00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:45,309
allow us to really also contribute to a

00:07:43,209 --> 00:07:47,379
crowd design process with the different

00:07:45,309 --> 00:07:51,159
technology providers which are available

00:07:47,379 --> 00:07:53,319
within the open power foundation and all

00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:55,239
those who have not yet become member of

00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:56,799
the academic discussion group I would

00:07:55,239 --> 00:07:59,860
very much like to invite you to become

00:07:56,799 --> 00:08:01,809
member for those who are saying at this

00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:03,189
conference there will be tomorrow

00:08:01,809 --> 00:08:05,589
morning at eight-thirty will be in

00:08:03,189 --> 00:08:07,389
breakfast meeting so if you are

00:08:05,589 --> 00:08:10,259
interested to join please contact me

00:08:07,389 --> 00:08:10,259
