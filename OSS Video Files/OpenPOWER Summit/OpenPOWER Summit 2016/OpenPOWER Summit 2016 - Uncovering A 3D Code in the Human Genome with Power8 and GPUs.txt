hi my name is sue Hofstra I'm with the

00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,599
Center for genome architecture Baylor

00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:11,130
College of Medicine Rice University and

00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,139
I'll be telling you a little bit today

00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:15,059
about how we're using power 8 at Rice

00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:17,670
University to accelerate our workflows

00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:23,939
and learn kind of really basic biology

00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:26,490
about how the genome is organized so the

00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:27,990
basic problem we're interested in is the

00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:30,179
problem that if you take out the DNA out

00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:32,070
of a cell and stretch it it measures

00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:34,559
roughly two meters long but it fits

00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:37,020
inside the nucleus of a cell that's only

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,430
microns wide so this is kind of many

00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:43,710
orders of six orders of magnitude of

00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:45,690
packing but yet the cell manages to do

00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,579
this without tangling the the genome and

00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:49,620
access precise a pieces of it at any

00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:51,300
given time so how this problem solved in

00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:55,020
vivo is of most importance to

00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:57,539
understanding how the body functions but

00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:59,370
yet despite this the importance of this

00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:01,920
problem well we know a lot about how

00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:03,660
whole chromosomes fold and the kind of

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,309
double helix structure of DNA that how

00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:08,520
this is packed at the middle scales are

00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:11,369
still remains mysterious so how do we go

00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,720
about approaching such a problem so one

00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:15,060
approach is to use something called a

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,490
technology called contact mapping and

00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:23,189
it's useful to use a Facebook analogy

00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:26,759
for this the clickers okay there we go

00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:28,740
so let's say I was on Facebook and

00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:31,829
because i'm still waiting for to get

00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:33,210
access to my new power a cluster i have

00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:36,420
some time to kill and so i decided to

00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:38,180
look through homers facebook photos and

00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:42,150
so maybe I see some of whom are alone

00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:43,920
maybe some with homer and Marge Homer

00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:46,049
and the kids maybe some other people

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,360
make an appearance and so now I've

00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:50,399
wasted a ton of time so I need to

00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:53,340
justify doing this so I decide I'm going

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,899
to do some simple analysis and so if i

00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:57,899
count the number of times any pair of

00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:59,490
people up here in the same photo i can

00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:02,040
put that into a matrix and immediately

00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:03,540
you can see some structure up here so if

00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,280
you look you can see that there's a

00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,170
square in the middle that that's

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,629
enriched over the the the rest of the

00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:11,340
map that kind of tells you the structure

00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:12,840
of Homer's family and then homer and

00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,540
Marge appear together and more photos

00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,860
than the

00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:18,430
Homer with the kids so you can see that

00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:20,620
enrichment as well so basically if I had

00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:24,069
a facebook for genomes maybe I could

00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:28,209
pull some structure out of that and

00:02:24,069 --> 00:02:33,489
thankfully such a technology exists it's

00:02:28,209 --> 00:02:37,680
called hi-c and the basic idea is we

00:02:33,489 --> 00:02:39,879
take the genome we freeze it we

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,939
basically glue it together we cut into

00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:44,560
millions of pieces and we mark the the

00:02:42,939 --> 00:02:45,819
ends of the free ends of the fragment so

00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,049
that we can pull down and then we

00:02:45,819 --> 00:02:48,790
connect them so that we can pull down

00:02:47,049 --> 00:02:50,379
these chimeric molecules that represent

00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:52,599
two pieces of DNA that were close

00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:54,159
together in space and so if you just

00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:55,689
look at one of these snapshots doesn't

00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:57,129
really tell you very much but if you

00:02:55,689 --> 00:02:59,439
look at millions or billions of these

00:02:57,129 --> 00:03:04,150
you can start to put together a map of

00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:07,209
the 3d genome and so when we when we do

00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:09,669
this now instead of each pair being a

00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:12,220
pair of people in the photos it's a pair

00:03:09,669 --> 00:03:14,650
of positions in the genome and so you

00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:16,840
can fill a matrix just like we did with

00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:21,549
homers photos if i zoom in on a

00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:24,459
particular chromosome now anytime I see

00:03:21,549 --> 00:03:26,260
something that's more read that that

00:03:24,459 --> 00:03:27,909
indicates that those two pieces of the

00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:29,829
DNA work we're closer together in space

00:03:27,909 --> 00:03:32,709
than than other pieces of DNA so if i

00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:34,540
look at the interactions of say position

00:03:32,709 --> 00:03:35,949
a with itself you'll see that it's very

00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:37,180
red which makes sense because things

00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:40,479
that are close together and one dear

00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:41,709
close to getting the 3d if you look at

00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:47,129
something a little bit farther away and

00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:49,209
be it's less red a and see even less red

00:03:47,129 --> 00:03:50,859
but that takes us to the first cup

00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:52,870
computational challenge which is that

00:03:50,859 --> 00:03:55,479
i'm taking these these chimeric

00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:57,129
molecules of DNA and but that doesn't

00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:58,180
actually when i when i read off these

00:03:57,129 --> 00:04:00,370
molecules i don't actually get the

00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:01,780
position of the genome i get just PA

00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:04,659
when i put it on a sequencer i just get

00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:05,620
text that I then have to align back to

00:04:04,659 --> 00:04:07,599
the genome and figure out their

00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:09,459
positions and this is a this is not a

00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,799
trivial computational problem if you're

00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:14,019
doing it just once it might be fine but

00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:17,919
we have to do it millions or billions of

00:04:14,019 --> 00:04:20,139
times so to kind of set the stage a

00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:23,800
little bit i'll tell you a little bit

00:04:20,139 --> 00:04:28,110
about our hardware setup at rice and so

00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:30,940
we have eight power 8 systems

00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:34,750
for a total of roughly 1,500 virtual

00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:37,389
cores two of our nodes are high memory

00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:38,830
nodes for with a terabyte of RAM for

00:04:37,389 --> 00:04:42,310
high memory applications and then two of

00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:43,509
them have k40 Tesla's actually this is a

00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:48,039
little bad a date they just got up we're

00:04:43,509 --> 00:04:49,270
gonna to kad Tesla's and so I'll tell

00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:51,699
you a little bit later about some of the

00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:54,879
applications that we're using gpus for

00:04:51,699 --> 00:05:00,310
to do some analysis on very basic

00:04:54,879 --> 00:05:03,219
biology we also have a forge a ba disks

00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:06,430
for total of 660 terabytes of disk space

00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:09,490
scalable to 1.4 petabytes as well as a

00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:12,759
20 terabyte flash array for IO intensive

00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:18,069
applications and we have a 56 gig

00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:23,349
InfiniBand connection between the the

00:05:18,069 --> 00:05:26,620
disks and the power rate systems we're

00:05:23,349 --> 00:05:29,590
running slurm over move on to and red

00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:31,509
hat enterprise linux alright so we have

00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:33,009
this this awesome power rate system and

00:05:31,509 --> 00:05:35,229
just to give you a scale this problem

00:05:33,009 --> 00:05:37,389
we've generated our high resolution maps

00:05:35,229 --> 00:05:38,860
of the 3d genome have 13 billion reads

00:05:37,389 --> 00:05:40,840
and we're generating billions of reads

00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:43,360
every every month so to give a sense of

00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:45,969
scale that's nearly 200 times as much

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,770
data as the entire human genome project

00:05:45,969 --> 00:05:49,419
generated and we generated in half the

00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:52,539
time and we're continually generating it

00:05:49,419 --> 00:05:56,379
every month and so power rate has

00:05:52,539 --> 00:05:58,180
enables to do roughly 700 alignments per

00:05:56,379 --> 00:05:59,529
second per core over the hundred ninety

00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:01,599
two cores of the power a clusters is

00:05:59,529 --> 00:06:03,810
fifty percent faster than our previous

00:06:01,599 --> 00:06:06,819
clusters so now we can do these kind of

00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:10,029
alignments in in hours where before it

00:06:06,819 --> 00:06:12,909
would take us much longer so using that

00:06:10,029 --> 00:06:14,949
we can actually build maps of the the 3d

00:06:12,909 --> 00:06:17,379
genome and so our most recent

00:06:14,949 --> 00:06:19,659
highlighted in yellow we can basically

00:06:17,379 --> 00:06:21,219
look at how the genome interacts with

00:06:19,659 --> 00:06:22,690
itself on kilobase resolution which is

00:06:21,219 --> 00:06:25,000
basically a thousand base pairs of DNA

00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:26,650
so imagine cutting the genome into three

00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,710
million pieces and figuring out how each

00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:30,909
of those pieces interact with each other

00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:34,270
great so we've built this map what does

00:06:30,909 --> 00:06:36,490
it actually tell us so one of the

00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:39,279
fundamental problems in in biology is

00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:40,960
the this we have our own spooky action

00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:42,340
at a distance problem which is that

00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:46,360
there are switches these regulatory

00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:48,580
elements enhancers that control genes

00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,900
that turn on genes and kind of control

00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:52,150
the functional say the cell but they're

00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:55,660
separated by a distance and actually the

00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:57,819
physical proximity leads to the

00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:59,770
mechanistic action so mapping these

00:06:57,819 --> 00:07:02,410
loops is pretty fundamental to

00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:04,630
understanding how the genome works as a

00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:07,169
as a mechanism but we don't actually

00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:10,090
have that we haven't actually done that

00:07:07,169 --> 00:07:12,039
so with our new maps we can actually

00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:14,250
translate this problem of looking for

00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:18,910
chromatin loops into looking for

00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:21,400
enrichments in a in a contact map so now

00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:23,229
if you take a loop position and then

00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,520
move in any distance in either other way

00:07:23,229 --> 00:07:27,599
you'll kind of decrease the enrichment

00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:29,710
so we're looking for these focal piece

00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,690
we run into another computational

00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:33,310
problem now which is that the map we're

00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:35,050
looking at is a twenty gigapixel image

00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:37,840
so this is like trying to find features

00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:41,949
that are size of a city block on the

00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:43,180
entire Google Earth image but we have

00:07:41,949 --> 00:07:46,419
the advantage that it's embarrassingly

00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:49,630
parallel so we can implement this on

00:07:46,419 --> 00:07:51,520
GPUs and speed up this entire problem of

00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:52,750
looking at every pixel and comparing it

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,550
to its local background to find

00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:56,680
enrichments and so we can we put it on

00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:57,940
GPUs we get a 200-fold speed up and we

00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:01,539
can take this problem that would have

00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:04,599
taken us weeks and make it in finishing

00:08:01,539 --> 00:08:06,009
hours so we can we map these loops

00:08:04,599 --> 00:08:07,780
across the entire genome they're

00:08:06,009 --> 00:08:10,690
reproducible and it costs are up

00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:14,289
different hi-c experiments there you can

00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:18,280
look at them under a microscope and see

00:08:14,289 --> 00:08:20,199
them as well the the loops actually is

00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:22,659
pinch off parts of the genome and set up

00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:24,219
the the intervals of DNA interact with

00:08:22,659 --> 00:08:25,360
each other more often than you would

00:08:24,219 --> 00:08:26,229
expect by chance so they're actually

00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,810
setting up these regulatory

00:08:26,229 --> 00:08:34,360
neighborhoods in the genome just like

00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:36,250
the one big happy family and like I said

00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:38,260
in the beginning our main goal here was

00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:40,750
to figure out this regulatory network

00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:42,700
inside the inside the cell so if we

00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:45,130
compare these maps across different

00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:48,310
cells these annotations of loops we can

00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:49,959
actually see when loops appear in

00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:51,610
different cell types they turn gene

00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:53,650
expression on so using power rate and

00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:54,760
and using that to map the loops we can

00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:59,010
actually start to decipher

00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:59,010
gene regulatory network of the cell

00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:05,890
click here is there we go so what's

00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:07,360
actually forming these loops so when you

00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:08,470
look at the the anchors of these loops

00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,870
you see that there's a particular

00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:13,000
protein called ctcf and it recognizes a

00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:15,310
particular sequence of DNA that has an

00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,750
orientation and so we see that actually

00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:18,790
at either end of the loop that the

00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:22,030
orientations are flipped so that they

00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:23,620
point towards each other I'm kind of

00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:25,290
like this so we have loops and then at

00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:27,730
the base of loops you have these these

00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:32,050
ctcf sites that point towards the inside

00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:34,090
of the loop so this kind of hints at the

00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:36,550
mechanism by which these loops form so

00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:37,930
you might imagine that two pieces of DNA

00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:40,720
we're just kind of wiggling around in

00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:41,650
space until they come into contact but

00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,220
this model actually has a lot of

00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:47,260
problems so one is doesn't explain why

00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:49,150
you see this kind of orientation rule

00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:50,880
because if they were convergent or

00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:53,530
divergent Lee oriented that you wouldn't

00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:56,710
the the loop would have no way of

00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:58,660
knowing that it doesn't explain why

00:09:56,710 --> 00:10:02,020
loops tend not to overlap in our in our

00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:03,850
annotation of loops and it doesn't

00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:05,500
explain why we don't see why we only see

00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:07,510
loops between the same molecule of DNA

00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:10,600
we don't see loops between different

00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:12,640
chromosomes so we actually came up with

00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:15,220
this other model of DNA where basically

00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:17,890
a complex binds to two very nearby

00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:20,260
pieces of DNA and starts to slide and

00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:22,240
extrude a loop which satisfies all the

00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:24,070
properties and so now we can actually

00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,350
model this so because that brings me to

00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:29,370
the next kind of how power 8 is actually

00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:31,660
helping us advance the science here so

00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:34,270
we can use molecular dynamic simulations

00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:37,420
and if you could actually play the movie

00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:38,860
here and we can use molecular dynamic

00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:41,410
simulations to actually model this

00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:42,430
process of extrusion but these these

00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:44,470
simulations are extremely

00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:45,880
computationally intensive and each kind

00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:48,700
of simulated contact map requires

00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:51,730
hundreds of simulations so when we put

00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:54,160
this on Jeep GPUs we can get a tenfold

00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:56,170
speed up and model different regions of

00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,030
the genome much more quickly and here

00:10:56,170 --> 00:11:00,450
you can see that this complex that

00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:03,700
slides along the DNA actually sets up

00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:05,140
the the red and blue segments of DNA

00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:07,390
where they were tangled in the beginning

00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:10,120
after this process of extrusion end up

00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:12,910
kind of being segregated into insulated

00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:17,260
domains and so this actually enables us

00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:18,730
to do really this actually enables us to

00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:20,530
kind of skip the experiments altogether

00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:22,960
and so rather than having to use this

00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:24,340
experiment expensive DNA sequencing to

00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:26,410
figure out what the 3d structure the

00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:28,750
genome looks like we can just use now

00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:31,120
molecular dynamics simulations and

00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:34,030
recreate these maps without having to

00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:36,190
even sequence any DNA so the top is in

00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:38,170
silico simulation and the bottom is what

00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:40,030
you would get if you did this whole DNA

00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:41,410
sequencing experiment to figure out the

00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:44,620
structure look like and you can see they

00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:46,780
look almost identical and so this allows

00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:49,600
us to now even do fancier things which

00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:52,090
is we can predict the changes so there

00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,670
are a lot of diseases in which you might

00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:56,260
expect the genome to be Miss folded and

00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:58,030
so one goal might be to to kind of

00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:59,650
correct the Miss folding and so to go in

00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:01,480
targeted way and change the folding of

00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:03,810
the genome and so now we have this tool

00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:05,680
to actually go in and see by using

00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:07,000
simulations on the power right cluster

00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,590
we can actually see what we're going to

00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,630
what those changes are going to result

00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:12,580
in before we actually do it and so now

00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:14,380
here this is just a before we make any

00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:16,480
changes the left of the simulation and

00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:19,300
the right is the result of the

00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:21,820
experiment if we delete one of the

00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:24,250
anchors of the loop you'll see that our

00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:25,630
simulation predicts that that loop and

00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,440
that domain will disappear and that's

00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:28,330
the same thing we see with the

00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:30,040
experiment we can do this with other

00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:31,740
kind of deletions of loop anchors with a

00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,520
whole number of them and every time

00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:36,280
exactly what's predicted by our

00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:37,870
simulations ends up what what happens

00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:41,530
when you actually go in and you delete

00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:46,390
it so basically now we're able to use

00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:48,370
this hpc approaches to enable us to do

00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:50,380
basically really precise genome surgery

00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:52,240
and start to think about going in and

00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:58,240
refolding the genome and to kind of

00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:59,860
correct disorders so yeah so power rate

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,240
has been helping us kind of accelerate

00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:03,220
work flows from the very beginning so

00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:05,020
this process of reading 3d genomes and

00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:06,370
figuring out what the different

00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:08,500
structure principles are and figure out

00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:10,750
where all the loops are and then going

00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:13,630
through and actually writing 3d genome

00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:14,830
so by using GPU accelerated simulations

00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:16,990
we can model the process of the

00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:19,810
formation and go in and actually change

00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:21,430
the structure of the genome so I like to

00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:22,899
thank my advisor heirs leave

00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:25,000
aiden is the director of the Center for

00:13:22,899 --> 00:13:27,270
genome architecture and also my co first

00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,550
authors Miriam Hundley and adri Sanborn

00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:32,140
and I should mention that so so far

00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:35,020
we've been sharing time on the rice

00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:37,089
power8 cluster and we've been so happy

00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:38,380
with it that we're planning on or we're

00:13:37,089 --> 00:13:40,770
thinking about getting one of our own as

00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,770
