okay good evening afternoon my name is

00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:08,719
Jeff decor Poe and I am responsible for

00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:11,070
strategic initiatives at stack velocity

00:00:08,719 --> 00:00:14,730
we are very excited to be here at our

00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:16,260
first open Power Summit and we have some

00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:18,119
exciting things going on we'd like to

00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,220
talk to you and or share with you today

00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:23,519
but before I do that I like to give you

00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:29,420
a little bit of background regarding who

00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:29,420
stack velocity is little clicker issue

00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:38,160
szostak velocity is a whoops one too far

00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:40,129
we go szostak velocity is a business

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:44,040
unit within jabil circuit jabil circuit

00:00:40,129 --> 00:00:46,559
is a global contract manufacturer we're

00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,780
about 18 to 20 billion dollar company

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:51,660
and a big part of our businesses

00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:53,399
building products if for many of the

00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:55,980
brand names that you're familiar with in

00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:59,309
the IT marketplace today we do

00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:01,410
everything from design to building PCBs

00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:03,290
to building boxes to doing full you know

00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:05,460
rap level or multi rack level

00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:08,760
configurations on behalf of our

00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:10,890
customers we also you know deliver it

00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:13,500
provides logistics and fulfillment for

00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:15,450
some of our customers as well and so

00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,250
stack velocity is a new business unit

00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,500
really focused on systems integration

00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:21,869
taking many of those core capabilities

00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,939
that we have for our current core

00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:27,869
customers in providing that as a

00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:29,570
customized service offering for a set of

00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:32,340
customers that are looking to deploy

00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:34,470
hyperscale scale-out infrastructure or

00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:37,049
leverage that same infrastructure along

00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:40,400
with their customers to deliver let's

00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:44,250
say next generation platforms based on

00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:48,540
you know based on hyper scale type

00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:51,240
principles so so many of the

00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:53,130
capabilities that we leverage as jabil

00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,990
or as part of jabil include

00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:57,110
manufacturing so we have a global

00:01:54,990 --> 00:02:00,090
footprint we have over 100 you know and

00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:02,009
manufacturing sites around the globe we

00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:03,600
have world-class capabilities in terms

00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:05,540
of manufacturing terms of quality

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,970
systems and supply chain procurement

00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:10,770
we're obviously we're able to finance

00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:11,940
large transactions and deployments just

00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:12,710
through the balance sheet we have as a

00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:16,460
as a

00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:18,830
large corporation and and but beyond

00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:20,240
that we really built around a couple of

00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:22,370
different areas to kind of provide a

00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:25,580
complete set of services for the space

00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:27,560
one of those is around we call front-end

00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:31,190
engineering so that is really working

00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:34,970
with customers to help define hardware

00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:38,110
infrastructure Platts right help help

00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:41,470
customers look at look at evaluate

00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:43,610
different technologies different design

00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:45,410
choices that they might be considering

00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:48,170
looking at how those design choices

00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:50,750
might impact the cost versus performance

00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:53,020
versus power consumption and we spend a

00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:55,390
lot of our focus and energy around open

00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:57,740
initiatives open hardware open software

00:02:55,390 --> 00:03:00,040
because those tend to be the most

00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:03,890
relevant to the kinds of customers that

00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:07,490
that that we're looking at or that we

00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:09,140
value our services on the back end of

00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:10,910
that we also have extended some

00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:12,500
capabilities around services so we

00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:15,530
provide a menu a range of different

00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:18,020
types of services to help customers

00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:23,240
whether that is with deployment in terms

00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:25,100
of taking racks from their dock into

00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,450
their data center and in installing

00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:28,130
those and turning those on and running

00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:30,320
through some acceptance testing before

00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:32,810
commissioning them in their environments

00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:36,650
or whether that's assistance from break

00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:38,150
fix perspective so that maybe you know

00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:40,510
supporting them will say with remote

00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:42,800
technical support for their own staff or

00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:43,850
potentially sending staff on-site into

00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:47,690
data centers where they don't have

00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:48,770
people or just for providing some sort

00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:51,440
of a spares management logistics

00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:53,890
management around managing spare spare

00:03:51,440 --> 00:04:00,500
pool let's say in their data center to

00:03:53,890 --> 00:04:01,340
facilitate that you know that process so

00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:04,310
one of the things that really

00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:06,020
differentiates I think us versus maybe

00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:07,940
others in this space is our ability to

00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:09,470
kind of bring together a full suite of

00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:11,900
capabilities from an end-to-end

00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:14,180
engagement perspective and so we have

00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:15,740
capabilities that are we can flexibly

00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:18,859
bring into any particular engagement

00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:21,350
model whether that's in a design sense

00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:23,600
so where we're leveraging our design

00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:25,540
organizations and teams that we have to

00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,280
let's say take a platform that we've

00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:30,770
brought to into the space but then

00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:32,270
customize that maybe tweak the feature

00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:34,130
set or the functionality to meet a

00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:36,290
specific set of custom requirements or

00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:38,960
whether that might be engaging with a

00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:40,970
customer on the grounds up a development

00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,230
based on very specific need that is an

00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:45,020
exists that does not exist in the

00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:46,430
marketplace of course we leverage a

00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:48,020
broad range of capabilities around

00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:49,970
manufacturing we have world-class

00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:52,730
capabilities in terms of you know

00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:55,160
assembly processes manufacturing process

00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:57,110
quality processes we have a large

00:04:55,160 --> 00:05:01,669
capability around procurement in terms

00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:03,770
of being able to leverage kind of our

00:05:01,669 --> 00:05:06,550
ability to buy material source material

00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:09,200
and optimize the entire supply chain

00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:10,400
when as customers are considering how

00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,870
they get how they actually land

00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,790
infrastructure into their facilities

00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:15,500
particularly for customers who have

00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:17,330
multiple geographies or have they may be

00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:20,450
data centers or customers and multiple

00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:21,889
areas of the world I already talked a

00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:23,120
little about solutions architecture

00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:25,370
design but that's another area of

00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,680
capability then we also once once we

00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:28,610
have a rack definition and we have an

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,650
idea of what that infrastructure

00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:33,229
supposed to look like we can then roll

00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:35,930
that into a manufacturing process to

00:05:33,229 --> 00:05:38,390
help really streamline the ability to

00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:40,460
build that infrastructure configure it

00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:42,380
in a very specific way based on what the

00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:44,270
customer may be looking for whether

00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:46,700
that's a box level configuration whether

00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:49,789
that's a wrap level configuration we can

00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:51,440
do that in a way that it arrives exactly

00:05:49,789 --> 00:05:53,450
the way that the customer needs that

00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,250
hard work to look like to facilitate

00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:56,660
let's say automation of revisionary

00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:59,539
systems that they might be using in

00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:00,979
their operations lastly I talked a

00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:03,139
little about services but that's

00:06:00,979 --> 00:06:04,460
obviously there's a range a menu of

00:06:03,139 --> 00:06:05,780
different choices that we can bring to

00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:11,990
bear again depending on what the

00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:14,060
customers needs requirements might be so

00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:17,270
we've real excited to be participating

00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:19,100
in open power we think this is a you

00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:21,650
know this this initiative kind of Lance

00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:22,970
you know directly aligned to kind of

00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:27,200
where the market is going with the

00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:30,260
evolution of the of how customers are

00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:34,610
consuming IT infrastructure we joined

00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:36,020
open power back in fall 2014 and we

00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:38,450
really are focusing around a couple

00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:39,500
different areas one of those is making

00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:42,350
contributions around

00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:44,990
systems integration and solution design

00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:47,240
kind as I mentioned earlier so helping

00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:49,160
to really take some of the building

00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,830
blocks and the technologies and bring

00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:53,240
those together to understand to solve

00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:56,060
particular applications the particular

00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:58,880
problems customers are trying to to work

00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:00,650
through second is around new platforms

00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,760
and so we are going to talk about that a

00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:06,350
little bit but bringing you know new new

00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:08,840
configurations new platforms based on

00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:12,050
kind of the continued evolution of the

00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:13,940
Power Architecture technology and then

00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:15,980
lastly to really facilitate

00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:20,030
collaboration really and through that

00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:24,860
process support new innovation to better

00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:26,380
meet customer needs market needs okay so

00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:28,850
let me talk a little about platforms

00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:30,710
this is probably a platform that you may

00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:33,140
be familiar with is called barrel I I

00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:35,290
think Erin talked about this again this

00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:37,640
morning and the keynote but it is a

00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:40,250
project that's been driven by Rackspace

00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:42,740
we are bringing it into the marketplace

00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:45,140
to meet you know through partnerships to

00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:49,250
be able to meet specific application or

00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:52,180
or our workload requirements the

00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:55,630
platform is a 2 socket platform it

00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:58,610
supports 32 dims and it has a storage

00:07:55,630 --> 00:08:02,390
solution that basically built in as a

00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:04,910
drawer so it supports the 15 small

00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:08,000
form-factor drives in a drawer that

00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:10,400
basically pulls up inside it is

00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,050
specifically designed for Open Compute

00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,270
right so if you're not familiar with

00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:16,190
open open compute it's a it's a

00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:18,140
different as an alternative standard to

00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:21,260
traditional rack architectures it's

00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:25,330
built around a 21 inch standard and it

00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:27,890
utilizes a 12 volt power distribution

00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:30,500
within the rack so each of these systems

00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:33,110
basically plug into a bus bar and are

00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:34,370
supplied by toll bolts so that's a

00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:35,780
consideration if you can sit if you're

00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:38,060
looking for you know if you're looking

00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:39,440
or concerning a platform like this as to

00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:41,270
whether or not that you can accommodate

00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,380
that or your tea or utilizing that maybe

00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:45,370
in your data center perimeter you can

00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:47,000
accommodate that in your in your

00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:49,690
wherever you're deploying your

00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,690
infrastructure

00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:53,690
the new program the new platform that we

00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,180
unveiled this week which are very

00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:59,120
excited about is a new system it's

00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:00,970
leverages the Firestone architecture

00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:05,050
which you may be familiar with from IBM

00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:07,459
but is also a to saket platform it is

00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:11,720
specifically designed around storage

00:09:07,459 --> 00:09:13,730
rich applications and so it extends kind

00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:16,490
of the amount of storage capacity that

00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:18,410
can be supported in this platform to 24

00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:20,930
small form-factor disks these are all

00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:23,589
front accessible the platform is

00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:28,730
designed specifically for 19-inch

00:09:23,589 --> 00:09:31,550
traditional rack infrastructure it again

00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:36,020
supports 32 you know large large memory

00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:40,310
for footprint up to 32 dims and a range

00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:42,860
of i/o options including 2 x 16 cappy

00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:45,380
enabled slots and then it has another

00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:48,740
four by eight slots a couple of those

00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:54,829
are embedded and then additional by two

00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:57,140
slot some of the advantages that the

00:09:54,829 --> 00:09:58,520
platform brings obviously leverages many

00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:00,290
of the capabilities from power8

00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:02,589
architecture in terms of processor

00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:07,579
performance in terms of kind of the

00:10:02,589 --> 00:10:08,720
enhanced memory i/o design its

00:10:07,579 --> 00:10:12,529
importance of course a large memory

00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:17,560
footprint the it also of course features

00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:17,560
the capi architecture for a low latency

00:10:17,829 --> 00:10:24,140
for low-latency i/o models for adapters

00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:26,839
have support that interface again it

00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:29,839
supports more storage in this particular

00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:33,740
platform of 24 small form factor drives

00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:35,779
and it being in a 2u chassis can support

00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:40,940
a very high density configuration within

00:10:35,779 --> 00:10:43,070
Iraq so this next slide just goes into a

00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:44,690
little bit more detail in terms of some

00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:47,480
of the options that are supported in the

00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:49,220
platform we're happy to kind of discuss

00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,050
those if you have questions please stop

00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:53,720
by our kiosk we actually have a live

00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:54,709
system there which and we can kind of

00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,380
talk you through some of these

00:10:54,709 --> 00:11:02,240
particular considerations or questions

00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:03,200
that you might have so I'd like to close

00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,230
really

00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,640
with a discussion invitation really to

00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:09,140
collaborate right so I think we're real

00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:13,090
excited about being part of the open

00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:16,070
Powerpuff community we would love to

00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:18,830
engage with you on discussing you know

00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:21,140
new technologies new problems spaces to

00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:22,550
that that need to be you know that could

00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:24,920
be addressed or opportunities to address

00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:27,050
those I think you'll find that we can

00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:29,300
bring a lot to the table as a partner

00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:31,280
whether that's through our design you

00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:33,200
know capabilities an organization or

00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:35,030
whether that's through an extensive

00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,460
network of technology partners that we

00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:39,800
work with or whether that's just food

00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:44,030
experience that we have building IT

00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:45,740
systems for the marketplace we look

00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:49,660
forward to talking with you and working

00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:49,660
