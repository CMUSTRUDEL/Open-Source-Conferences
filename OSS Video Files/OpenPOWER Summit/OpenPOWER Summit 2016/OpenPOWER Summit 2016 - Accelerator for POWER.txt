yeah I'm reverie i'm eric from some team

00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:08,519
for first thing I want to sense and

00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:12,179
media and the open of urban park

00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:15,089
foundation so now let's get back well

00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:19,289
for 17 there are three member sarahx

00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:22,740
moon target seeing this summit first we

00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:26,820
want to meet the other members of the

00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:29,670
OPF face-to-face and the second we want

00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:32,899
to show our achievements in this

00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:35,460
community and the second another third

00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:37,800
we are looking for more collaborations

00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:42,420
including design houses every winders

00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:44,879
and the system integrators okay and as

00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:48,960
we all know that power is really a

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:52,739
powerful processor but the hunger for

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:57,300
more computing resources never ends so

00:00:52,739 --> 00:01:02,399
as an option we develop the accelerator

00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:04,769
for power it's based on the a it based

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:10,740
on the apt to knowledge from lettings

00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:15,479
okay and it is a short brief of hooey

00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:19,950
same team something is founded in 2003

00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:22,830
and in the past failures we provide the

00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:25,619
data acquisition and analysis product

00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:28,829
for our customers so most of our

00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:32,130
customers are requiring accelerating

00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:38,520
solutions they always ask for us for a

00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:43,189
turnkey solution okay and and this is

00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:47,549
our sometimes NASA accelerator yeah and

00:01:43,189 --> 00:01:51,270
it's based on the KP technology from IBM

00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:54,030
and the actual skill technology from

00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:57,810
lettings and I'm sorry there's something

00:01:54,030 --> 00:02:04,890
wrong with sinead from the ppt to to the

00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:08,190
PDF okay now in the next I will show

00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:12,210
some NASA except accelerator features

00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:17,070
and the first is high performance and

00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:19,230
low power and as we all know that fpga

00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:21,810
is born to be a programmable hardware

00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:29,190
and it can be turned down to the gate

00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:31,470
level so so the power consumption of the

00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:35,190
electricity consumption of the AP j is

00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:37,530
very low you can see that in this slide

00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:41,400
we have completed three acceleration

00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:45,180
functions our NASA car and all of them

00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:47,750
has a minimum 10 times speedup and the

00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:55,040
electricity is owning one third

00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:58,830
comparing to that of the CPU and so

00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:02,190
additional external external power is

00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:04,710
not needed and no additional air cooling

00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:08,370
is needed so you can just block the card

00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:12,870
into the pieces lot of a server and it

00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:16,560
can works we have installed it in many

00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:19,800
servers in fact we ever installed full

00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:24,270
not occurring into a single server for

00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:27,230
accelerating progress and I have to see

00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:31,500
that the most interesting thing about

00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:34,200
the NASA is that NASA dedicated security

00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:37,290
chips for the third party every

00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:39,810
protection as you can see that a unique

00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:43,860
Eddie can be written to n store in the

00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:47,340
security team the ID cannot repeat read

00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:49,590
back so each time with the accelerating

00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:54,180
function is loaded or a car by the

00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:57,600
software it can use a a DD related

00:03:54,180 --> 00:04:00,780
license for validation if the validation

00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:03,710
pass the work the car cam works if the

00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:07,640
validation fails it can refuse to work

00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:11,370
so the value of the intellectual

00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:17,790
property is guaranteed against illegal

00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:23,010
copying and we have to see that for an

00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:25,780
extra for accelerated car tu su tu tu a

00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:29,020
success there are still several

00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:31,960
things should be done well including

00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:35,980
business development experienced and

00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:38,590
adequate technical support collaboration

00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:41,919
with abby winters high quality control

00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:44,830
and effective delivery in the past

00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:47,980
failures sentenced it acquisition and

00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:49,780
analysis product has been deployed in

00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:52,840
all the problems and the most big cities

00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:57,010
in China and also in some countries in

00:04:52,840 --> 00:05:00,310
Asia and Africa most customers have

00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:03,580
potential needs for accelerating

00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:07,300
solutions and in order for rapid

00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:12,180
response to customer support engineering

00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:15,580
team are 180 person are kept in

00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:19,450
including the people for developing and

00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:23,169
the pre-sales and apple sales that is

00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:26,860
seventy percent of the total employee so

00:05:23,169 --> 00:05:29,830
and every year we can see at 17 deliver

00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:33,669
more than 10,000 network equipments to

00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:36,820
customers or 12 years experience in

00:05:33,669 --> 00:05:40,479
hardware design and our new burst and

00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:42,669
resilience supply chain is a good

00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:47,860
guarantee for a good delivery of high

00:05:42,669 --> 00:05:49,990
quality products to our customers and in

00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:53,169
following site in the following time i

00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:57,880
will use some i will show some success

00:05:53,169 --> 00:06:02,440
stories to use nasa for accelerating

00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:05,260
poppers this is enriched code in racial

00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:08,800
code is a can of theater pick up master

00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:12,280
during restore algorithm in fact it's

00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:15,669
pleaded original data into several plugs

00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:20,140
and a generated you blocks by

00:06:15,669 --> 00:06:22,900
calculating the original and the newly

00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:27,550
generated blocks together construct a

00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:30,220
protected data group if some blocks in

00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:32,710
the remaining if some blocks were

00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:36,010
missing the remaining the remaining

00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:39,610
blocks can be calculated and further

00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:42,810
with for data recovered without loss

00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:47,860
you can see that in our implementation

00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:50,530
we will use only 140 personal storage

00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:55,110
capacity contrasting to the traditional

00:06:50,530 --> 00:07:00,270
HDFS which need one which will need a

00:06:55,110 --> 00:07:03,939
300-person storage that means one-half

00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:07,840
reduction in the storage medium that

00:07:03,939 --> 00:07:15,819
also means the cast will also reduce the

00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:20,159
two one half but it will pay a huge

00:07:15,819 --> 00:07:25,930
burden on the cpu and we can see that by

00:07:20,159 --> 00:07:31,060
accelerating with NASA card the the

00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:35,669
power CPU help having implemented the

00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:38,740
original code in real time services and

00:07:35,669 --> 00:07:42,849
here is another application immediately

00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:44,949
sizing image resizing is what we use in

00:07:42,849 --> 00:07:48,190
mining Internet services including

00:07:44,949 --> 00:07:51,580
online shopping web surfing and a social

00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:54,580
media for example that you made it

00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:58,680
receives the tool terminals of different

00:07:54,580 --> 00:08:04,180
screen cells or the image quality is

00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:07,270
adjusted to the subscribers level and we

00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:09,879
are collaborate with class attack in

00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:15,099
home accompanying Hong Kong to provide

00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:21,490
the immediate reciting implementation

00:08:15,099 --> 00:08:24,729
and we can see that the electricity

00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:30,129
consumption is on its current is carried

00:08:24,729 --> 00:08:33,269
down so the the expense for the cooling

00:08:30,129 --> 00:08:38,649
and for the electricity consuming is

00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:42,459
reduced to ok as a conclusion I have to

00:08:38,649 --> 00:08:45,070
see that as strong and open ecosystem is

00:08:42,459 --> 00:08:48,910
essential for open parcel success

00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:52,300
especially in China o our customers just

00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:54,390
one or tinky solution same thing is

00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:58,740
willing together with our partners to

00:08:54,390 --> 00:09:02,740
discuss with our customer about the

00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:06,040
performance bottleneck and 17 also

00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:09,130
welcomes collaboration with more design

00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:12,190
houses and ivy Winters our bus is number

00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:15,420
10 13 will be happy to meet you there

00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:15,420
