ok this is on great all right well I'm

00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:09,420
gonna get started here I'm Brian Larsen

00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:11,219
from brocade communications and we are a

00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:14,940
networking company if you are not

00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:17,550
familiar with brocade our history shows

00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,529
that we have been a storage networking

00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:23,070
company and I'd like to reintroduce

00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:25,680
ourselves as a networking company in a

00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:27,359
lot of different ways we since 2008 we

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,220
have made multiple acquisitions and put

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,890
ourselves right smack into the middle of

00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:33,899
IP ethernet switching at a very high

00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:36,180
speed does that mean that we've left our

00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:39,809
storage networking heritage absolutely

00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:41,640
not we have been a partner with IBM in

00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:43,620
storage area networking and fibre

00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,390
channel technologies along with many of

00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:48,360
the other large storage vendors almost

00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:51,510
every one of them and we continue to

00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:53,100
evolve that into IP storage solutions we

00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,530
are evolving our fibre channel

00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,449
capabilities we heard earlier from one

00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,800
of the guest speakers about nvme which

00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:01,109
is something that we're going to be

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,820
porting into the fabric he did announce

00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:04,619
that and that is something that we're

00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:07,070
definitely in the middle of and helping

00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:09,090
in that space however again

00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:12,110
reintroducing ourselves as a networking

00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:14,280
company and with that evolution is

00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:17,040
something that we need to take a look at

00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:19,409
in a virtualized world and I'm going to

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,960
try to step you through what that means

00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:25,799
to brocade and how it gets applied into

00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:28,020
and throughout the solutions that get

00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:30,630
applied to every one of the compute

00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:35,729
platforms out there but open power and

00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:37,290
its migration to compete in slightly

00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:40,590
different markets or compete directly

00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:43,710
into an Intel market lends itself well

00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:45,270
to a new market or new use cases so let

00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:48,780
me just kind of step through where we're

00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:53,189
at brocade is landing on a vision of the

00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:57,659
new IP we know that the the the networks

00:01:53,189 --> 00:02:00,509
of old have basically just run out of

00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:03,060
gas and with the number of end-user

00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:05,340
devices and as you know you've seen all

00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:08,039
of the stats just billions and billions

00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:11,489
of these different handheld devices our

00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:13,680
phones or tablets or pcs Internet of

00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:13,950
Things all of that is expanding itself

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,500
so

00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:19,200
fastly that the service providers cannot

00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,819
seem to keep up with the the amount of

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,190
data rate that needs to happen the

00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:25,590
flexibility that it needs to portray and

00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:28,440
the services that it needs to deploy and

00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:31,860
with that is a new evolution in what

00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:34,290
we're calling the new IP this new IP

00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:37,590
approach is different than your

00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:40,170
traditional IP switch vendors you know

00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:44,760
the top ones in the world and this is a

00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:46,200
this is a very revolutionary in the fact

00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,750
that if we take a look at network

00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:51,140
services people like to buy it have

00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:54,480
bought for the last 30 40 years

00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:56,400
purpose-built switches now our friends

00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,650
at mellanox they're very good at it fit

00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,890
a band that is not something that we do

00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:03,420
well in addition to that there are some

00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:06,090
of the other vendors out there like

00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:08,099
cisco and juniper who have such a large

00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:11,640
install base that they cannot disrupt

00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:13,349
that hardware evolution and continued

00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:16,049
revenue growth I mean they just need to

00:03:13,349 --> 00:03:18,959
have that their brocade has entered into

00:03:16,049 --> 00:03:20,700
this new IP realm with not a large

00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,889
install base not a lot of market share

00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:25,889
and the and the affordability for us to

00:03:22,889 --> 00:03:28,019
be disruptive in this technology and in

00:03:25,889 --> 00:03:30,780
looking at this new IP this is just kind

00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:33,660
of the our approach to it we're looking

00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:37,410
at how we do this in a very open manner

00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:39,810
that clients can take do something today

00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:41,310
if they don't like us tomorrow they can

00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:43,769
take us out and put a different vendor

00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:46,530
in with no disruption to service this is

00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:48,239
what open power is all about so this is

00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:51,269
an approach that we feel very very

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:53,130
tightly knitted with open power and IBM

00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:56,220
in general because they've been a very

00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:58,290
major partner of ours the innovation

00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:00,930
centric innovation centric again is a

00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:02,430
software enabled opportunity now open

00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:05,430
power we've been hearing a lot of

00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:07,260
speakers talk about the internals cappy

00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:09,420
all of the different real high speed

00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:13,680
stuff high compute things that they can

00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:16,560
do that is phenomenal and I tell you I

00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,720
am very impressed by all of this the

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,209
talk of what this power platform can do

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,550
however the software enabled

00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:26,669
capabilities of the of the compute the

00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:27,720
network and the storage has to take into

00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:30,240
consideration

00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:32,640
the solutions on end to end we're taking

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:37,320
a very innovative innovative approach in

00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:39,630
software enabling the network ecosystem

00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:41,340
driven ecosystem driven if we don't have

00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:42,960
people to play with and the way we can

00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:45,180
put these things together it simply

00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,440
won't work oh let's go back to open

00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:49,980
power what's one of their major

00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:53,250
objectives ecosystem friendly and with

00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:55,230
that evolution we need to have storage

00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:56,640
vendors network vendors compute vendors

00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:58,980
we need to have all of them put this

00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:01,620
together software vendors to put it

00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:04,260
together so that we can create this open

00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:06,840
environment that's very reactive very

00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:10,110
flexible very scalable and can react to

00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:12,600
what a service provider or an enterprise

00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:14,850
user once use it for very quickly to

00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:18,120
beat the market demands as it is and as

00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:20,910
this last bullet says your own pace when

00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:23,250
you want it this is all about the

00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:25,710
flexibility built into software enabled

00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:28,800
anything right well if we can give all

00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:31,050
these elements to a client in a way that

00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,320
they can approach this that makes

00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:36,510
perfect sense today and into the future

00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:38,370
then we have a way to evolve very

00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:40,800
quickly this is going to take some time

00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:43,290
it's not going to be an overnight event

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:46,020
that happens here but this is a kind of

00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:48,150
an overview of what we see and this is

00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:49,590
our stack if you will when it comes to

00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:51,570
brocade and how we're approaching the

00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:53,970
markets and with very specific

00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:56,640
understanding that you will not get rid

00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:58,680
of hardware infrastructure it will be

00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:00,780
there and it will always be there and if

00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:03,150
we look at the bottom here the network

00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:05,160
the compute the storage is at a physical

00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:07,320
layer there's no question about it

00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,880
however the innovation that you can

00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:12,780
build into the network for automation

00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:14,340
complete automation is probably not

00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:16,290
going to happen overnight but I can tell

00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,700
you what you there are so many different

00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:19,800
ways that we've already implemented

00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:21,600
automation in the network it's reduced

00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,610
operational expenses by up to forty

00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,290
percent this is a virtualized

00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:27,840
environment that lends itself very well

00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:31,200
to compute high speed compute and very

00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:33,690
high speed storage connectivity now if

00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,669
you just keep going up the stack in this

00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:38,310
virtualization world and you're

00:06:35,669 --> 00:06:40,150
abstracting them physical this is where

00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:44,770
we're investing is significant

00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:47,590
of Rd acquisitions we have been

00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:50,230
purchasing virtualized network companies

00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:51,880
for the last five years and we are

00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:54,430
building out these things for the mobile

00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:55,870
networks service provider networks we're

00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:58,180
building them out for enterprise class

00:06:55,870 --> 00:07:01,090
solution sets and we're creating those

00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:05,860
within the ecosystem of an open source

00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:07,720
environment so in the in this chart here

00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:09,880
it does show these different layers and

00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:12,130
our b-wing that is where we're playing

00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:15,580
and off to the side and each one of

00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:18,130
these layers is the the assets and

00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:22,000
what's in our portfolio that we sell in

00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:25,300
these different layers we are and again

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,700
looking at the open community if you

00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:29,860
look at the network controller layer

00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:32,050
server controller and storage controller

00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:33,550
layer you know when we talk about we're

00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:35,320
not storage vendor we're not a server

00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:37,150
vendor we are a network vendor and we're

00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:39,610
very much participant in open daylight

00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:41,620
which is another consortium building on

00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:43,240
the open source community for a

00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:45,310
controlled environment within the

00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,350
network and so you start to add these

00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:49,480
two together and the ecosystem partners

00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:51,850
that we need because we are not going to

00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:54,070
provide this end and we need the the

00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:56,920
folks to fill in the gaps if we don't

00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:58,810
then the system breaks but we have some

00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:00,490
very strong partnerships both in the

00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:02,290
physical layer the compute layer the

00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:04,810
storage layer and then all the way up

00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:07,000
through other software vendors that are

00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:08,710
working in the network space so we're

00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,320
working together in that ecosystem to

00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:13,210
put it together now it's all of this

00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:16,000
available today and is it all of it

00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:18,100
available on an open power platform the

00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,310
answer is no however if you're looking

00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:23,530
at very specific infrastructure like

00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:27,610
storage infrastructure fibre channel if

00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:29,590
you're looking for a 25 gig Ethernet if

00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:31,900
you're looking for 10 gig 40 gig 100 gig

00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:34,270
that's all there it's all standard we

00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:36,340
have all that but what we see is an

00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:40,420
evolution towards something that makes

00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:43,000
it more deployable faster to deploy more

00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:45,220
flexible and that's where you do become

00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,100
you come right down to software and how

00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:50,290
it interacts and sits on a compute the

00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:53,380
compute node becomes the virtual router

00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:53,920
or a network component and in this

00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:55,209
instance

00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,940
just going to take you through what this

00:08:55,209 --> 00:08:59,320
virtual router or vnf you've probably

00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:01,540
heard or maybe have heard of

00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:03,850
software-defined networking and virtual

00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:06,670
network functions this is a virtual

00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:09,910
network function it's a router take

00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:13,660
anyone Cisco juniper broke aids doesn't

00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:16,449
matter routing functions and purpose

00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:19,269
built units do certain things firewall

00:09:16,449 --> 00:09:21,899
network address translation they just do

00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:24,430
layer 3 routing off you do firewalls

00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:27,100
barracuda you know you name it they have

00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:29,560
functions in their purpose built however

00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:33,279
then they've done serve the purpose very

00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:34,600
very well but as scale happens in the

00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:37,420
enterprise and with service providers

00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:39,579
how do you keep just adding more purpose

00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:41,079
build things and how do you do it very

00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:43,209
efficiently and without sending out one

00:09:41,079 --> 00:09:45,570
of your text out to the middle of North

00:09:43,209 --> 00:09:48,790
Dakota and put one of these things in

00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:49,600
what if you can put that software that

00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:51,730
we've been talking about this

00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,889
virtualized image of a router and put it

00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:56,110
on an open Power Platform can't do it

00:09:53,889 --> 00:09:59,050
today but what if or you can put it on

00:09:56,110 --> 00:10:00,910
an intel server out there remotely from

00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:02,230
anywhere in the world and deploy it and

00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:03,820
you're up and going and you get that

00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:06,940
purpose-built capability on a

00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:08,560
virtualized machine at performance this

00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:10,180
is where the world is going and this is

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,190
what service providers are asking for

00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:13,930
especially it I'm going to use the

00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:15,550
context of cloud because it's very

00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:17,170
prevalent today in the cloud

00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:21,370
environments and how it's being deployed

00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:23,709
this routing function gives today the

00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:26,170
ability to gain access from your

00:10:23,709 --> 00:10:28,810
enterprise out to a service provider a

00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:30,910
cloud service provider oh and then they

00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:33,579
can have access to any other cloud

00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:35,829
service provider you have choice it can

00:10:33,579 --> 00:10:37,959
be deployed anywhere you want it it is

00:10:35,829 --> 00:10:40,360
industry standards based there is no

00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:42,010
difference between the two interoperates

00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:45,310
outside the realms of another

00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:46,870
virtualized instance and it but it helps

00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:48,940
you get to where you need to go very

00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:50,800
quickly it gives you all the functions

00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:53,139
as you're used to and that you need in

00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:56,319
those purpose purpose-built functions

00:10:53,139 --> 00:10:59,230
like routing IPSec virtual VPN tunneling

00:10:56,319 --> 00:11:02,339
firewall all of those things are in this

00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:04,140
and only and it are built around a

00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:08,050
whoops

00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:10,990
sorry about that and built around a

00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:12,580
software-defined instance this gives you

00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:13,870
just kind of a high-level view so if

00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:15,750
you're in an enterprise if you have

00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:18,610
built out your own private cloud

00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:20,680
fantastic however if you're scaling and

00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:22,540
you need to get into a private cloud you

00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:25,510
can go or a public cloud you can go to

00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:27,490
any cloud provider that you want or any

00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:29,710
of them and add them together into

00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:31,570
providing what you need for services you

00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:33,730
don't have to pick one you can pick any

00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:37,089
one and these virtualized routing

00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:39,670
instances can reside in all of them so

00:11:37,089 --> 00:11:42,760
let me just give you an example brocade

00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:45,279
is the largest provider of a virtual

00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:48,790
router function in softlayer we have

00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:51,310
virtual router capabilities in AWS and

00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:53,620
you name it we're in rackspace we're in

00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:54,820
every one of those large cloud providers

00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:56,680
and it's because of the ease of

00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:59,260
deployment that this is put in there any

00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:02,890
in the ability its flexibility to give

00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:05,710
you more than one service so and if we

00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:07,360
align this with what softlayer does this

00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:09,190
is where and we know by the way that

00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,080
many of these cloud service providers

00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:14,260
and we heard earlier today Rackspace

00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:16,420
google and by the way softlayer are all

00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:18,490
going to be going and using their

00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:21,190
probably already using power platforms

00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:23,560
and open power platforms so the question

00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:26,020
becomes will these virtualize network

00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:28,150
functions need to be poured ported to

00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:31,330
the power platform it's a good question

00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:33,910
we think it does but we're still waiting

00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:36,400
for market demand softlayer though in

00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:38,470
this virtualized world that we live in

00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:40,959
and especially now in this network and

00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:43,630
routing function all these value adds of

00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:46,029
what they get from this using this kind

00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:50,110
of a virtual routed infrastructure helps

00:12:46,029 --> 00:12:51,520
them expand and quickly deploy what is

00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:53,680
needed for the enterprise's who are

00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:55,420
using their cloud services and they have

00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,950
this deployed on a worldwide basis and

00:12:55,420 --> 00:13:01,029
every one of their data centers of all

00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:02,980
25 to date what am I talking about I

00:13:01,029 --> 00:13:05,830
don't want to drill down into each

00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:09,490
platform but this virtual router again

00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:12,300
has three very specific major functions

00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:15,400
if you will and it's not melt it's not

00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:17,379
special purpose it is all in the same

00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:19,670
code that we sell

00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:21,170
I'm not trying to do a pitch your folks

00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:22,610
I apologize if it sounds that way but

00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:25,129
what I'm trying to do is just come to

00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:27,920
the point where this routing function

00:13:25,129 --> 00:13:30,649
can be done in software on compute

00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:33,889
platforms and it can be as performant as

00:13:30,649 --> 00:13:35,929
any purpose built box it's not going to

00:13:33,889 --> 00:13:39,110
be used everywhere however in certain

00:13:35,929 --> 00:13:41,239
circumstances very well applies itself

00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:43,790
cloud service providers and the

00:13:41,239 --> 00:13:46,730
enterprise where it's applicable and

00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:50,809
their private clouds very well very well

00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:55,639
suited for that so I'm going to end with

00:13:50,809 --> 00:13:57,170
this chart here and it just tries to

00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:59,629
pull together I've talked about the

00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:01,699
enterprise virtualized instances the

00:13:59,629 --> 00:14:04,610
network the network in and of itself

00:14:01,699 --> 00:14:07,790
needs to be there to take high-speed

00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:10,339
compute platforms that takes an output

00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:12,549
and they put it somewhere or they

00:14:10,339 --> 00:14:15,410
deliver an answer to someone that

00:14:12,549 --> 00:14:17,449
Network has to be there it's not just

00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:19,369
the Internet we can't just say it's just

00:14:17,449 --> 00:14:21,439
the Internet no it has to have

00:14:19,369 --> 00:14:26,029
connectivity to everywhere in the world

00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:29,089
in fact to the point where brocade on

00:14:26,029 --> 00:14:31,369
Monday purchased a a wireless networking

00:14:29,089 --> 00:14:33,709
company called ruckus for 1.2 billion

00:14:31,369 --> 00:14:35,929
dollars these are the investments that

00:14:33,709 --> 00:14:38,449
we've been making since the last five to

00:14:35,929 --> 00:14:41,089
six seven years to expand to the

00:14:38,449 --> 00:14:42,589
end-user endpoint to to you sitting

00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:43,999
there with your phone to you sitting

00:14:42,589 --> 00:14:46,910
there with or me sitting here with this

00:14:43,999 --> 00:14:49,459
clicker our internet of things that

00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:51,589
volume of data continues to grow and we

00:14:49,459 --> 00:14:52,879
need to get access to it we need to

00:14:51,589 --> 00:14:54,739
bring it through a service provider

00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:57,169
network and get it to these high-speed

00:14:54,739 --> 00:14:58,339
compute nodes where they do their data

00:14:57,169 --> 00:15:00,769
crunching they understand what's going

00:14:58,339 --> 00:15:03,619
to happen and predict things for the

00:15:00,769 --> 00:15:04,759
benefit of all of us so we're trying to

00:15:03,619 --> 00:15:06,139
combine what we can do with the

00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:08,239
enterprise our heritage and the

00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:10,309
enterprise looking what we can do with

00:15:08,239 --> 00:15:13,100
the cloud group and then how it

00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:15,410
intersect of interacts with telecom and

00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:18,829
how we can provide a more efficient

00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:21,049
flexible and capability to deploy very

00:15:18,829 --> 00:15:24,559
quickly and through a virtualized

00:15:21,049 --> 00:15:27,529
environment in platform so that was very

00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:29,550
quick just a hair over my 15 minutes but

00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:31,170
I know we're way behind so

00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:35,959
if there's any questions would be happy

00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:35,959
