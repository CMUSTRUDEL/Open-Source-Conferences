good afternoon evening almost to

00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:11,849
continue on the European theme I'm Mike

00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:19,859
Ashworth from the science and technology

00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:21,720
facilities Council in the UK stfc is one

00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:24,269
of the seven Research Council's in the

00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:27,210
UK think of an oakridge run or you

00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:30,960
you'll ish we run experimental

00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:34,440
facilities like synchrotrons and neutron

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:37,620
source and we're also very active in

00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:42,210
high-performance computing and we set up

00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:45,510
the hartree center to provide market led

00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:48,960
research and innovation to develop

00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:54,180
services for competitive advantage and e

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:56,699
economic impact so this is our vehicle

00:00:54,180 --> 00:01:01,530
for bringing high performance computing

00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:04,680
and other technologies to to bear for

00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:09,330
the benefit of industry the hartree

00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:13,290
center was created in 2012 as a result

00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:18,270
of funding that was announced in two

00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:21,390
thousand and and and and and e 11 I

00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:24,030
myself contributed to the Tilsley report

00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:27,689
which was a government report led by

00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:31,490
Dominic Tilsley which recommended

00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:36,990
substantial government investment in e

00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:39,689
infrastructure in the UK and so we we

00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:43,590
received some of this funding at that

00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:46,649
time to set up the hartree center for

00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:50,100
economic impact through simulation

00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:54,149
software and mod modeling with a strong

00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:56,939
focus on industrial engagement and part

00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:59,700
of the reason for that was the the

00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:04,649
really good story that have been put out

00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:08,190
by the organizations like the IDC on the

00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:11,450
benefits the return on investment the

00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:13,000
the economic impacts that you get from

00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:17,630
investments

00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:21,740
high-performance computing we had follow

00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:24,500
on investment in 2013 which allowed us

00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:26,990
to expand our activities into

00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:29,870
energy-efficient computing and data

00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:33,230
analytics and then a further tranche of

00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:35,330
funding last year which is a major

00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:39,860
investment in collaborative research

00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:44,570
with IBM around data centric computing

00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:47,720
and cognitive computing and we're in the

00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:51,230
process of establishing an IBM Research

00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:54,320
Center and IBM presence on the dars Bri

00:02:51,230 --> 00:03:01,430
sites this is the first IBM research

00:02:54,320 --> 00:03:03,950
presence in in the UK there are a whole

00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:06,800
number of case studies which you can

00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:10,400
look at on the web of interactions that

00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:13,220
we've had with with industry there's a

00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:16,310
long URL at the bottom but if you just

00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:21,620
Google hartree center case studies you

00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:24,500
should find find that that page our

00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:26,030
mission as I've elaborated is to bring

00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:30,020
the benefits of high-performance

00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:34,010
computing and big data data science to

00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:36,320
industry and commerce to use the skills

00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:40,640
that we have the equipment that we have

00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:45,050
our hardware software and skills and we

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:48,080
offer two companies a range of offerings

00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:50,239
if they have their own solution to a

00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:53,420
problem and simply want to run on our

00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:56,650
hardware that's fine we're not really in

00:03:53,420 --> 00:04:00,950
the business of selling cycles but we

00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:05,500
will go down that route we can also

00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:08,980
provide consultancy and professional

00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:12,320
service services we can use our own

00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:15,140
simulation software to tackle probe

00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:18,549
problems that are that are brought to us

00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:22,880
what we really like to do is to develop

00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:25,220
collaborative R&D opportunities and to

00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,540
solve the problems in partnership with

00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:29,570
our

00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:31,250
our industrial partners and fifthly at

00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:37,070
the bottom you see there that we also

00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:41,570
provide training and education for four

00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:44,150
people our skills are very wide wide

00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:46,280
ranging the heart three centuries just

00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:49,400
one part there's also the scientific

00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:52,730
computing department and between us we

00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:55,640
have around 160 staff with skills that

00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:58,610
you see there ranging from cfd through

00:04:55,640 --> 00:05:01,880
chemistry and environmental modeling

00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:05,780
energy efficient computing the basic

00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:09,470
kind of hpc skills that you would that

00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:14,420
you that you would expect we've recently

00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:20,780
taken delivery of a power 8 system with

00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:24,650
K 80 GPUs this is a 32 node system 16

00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:28,160
cause two sockets on a node and then

00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:33,380
there are a 2k 80 GPUs on each node so a

00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:36,110
total of six 64 GPUs InfiniBand

00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:39,770
connected and you can see you can read

00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:42,020
their the storage offerings this machine

00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:44,500
was delivered to our site on the last

00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:49,910
working day before the Christmas holiday

00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:53,780
and georgina from ocf our our friendly

00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:57,530
sales lady provided the ribbons and bows

00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:59,540
that you see on the system there those

00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:01,850
have now gone it's now installed in our

00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:04,460
data center and I've been running on the

00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:07,280
system throughout the last the last week

00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:10,360
or so so we are members of the open

00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:14,360
power consortium we're part of Dirk's

00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:20,110
the the academia discussion group that

00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:24,350
Dirk blighter mentioned and we're also a

00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:27,440
power acceleration and Design Center in

00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:31,310
partnership with IBM and you see here

00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:35,840
the press release around the PA DC that

00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:38,370
was that was announced last October and

00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:41,280
the quote from Peter Allen who

00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:43,320
is just departing now as director of the

00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,380
hartree center that we're going to help

00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:49,740
industry and academia take advantage of

00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:54,900
this hardware platform from IBM and

00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:58,050
NVIDIA and delivering in delivering

00:06:54,900 --> 00:07:01,440
solutions to real world' real world'

00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:04,680
probe problems this is not our first

00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:08,760
experience with power we used to be the

00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:14,280
the site of the national supercomputer

00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:17,039
in the UK way back in from 2002 to 2010

00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:21,600
and this was a power based system we

00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:24,030
started with power 4 and the high

00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:27,990
performance which and they went up to

00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:31,260
power 4 plus and eventually power power

00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:37,020
5 you can read about some of the history

00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:43,050
of computing at dari if you so so so

00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:47,389
wish we have scientific groups who who

00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:50,490
work in Simpson simulation and modeling

00:07:47,389 --> 00:07:53,160
across the full range of length and time

00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:56,370
scales and this set of thumbnails here

00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:59,940
is intended to represent that so from

00:07:56,370 --> 00:08:03,360
the top left we have some subatomic sim

00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:06,510
simulations optical in interactions with

00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:11,490
atoms there's a molecular dynamics

00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:15,000
simulation in there of radiation damage

00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:17,220
to a crystal there's CFD flow around an

00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:22,490
aircraft and moving to the very large

00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:25,400
scale of ocean and atmospheric modeling

00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:29,370
here's an early result from the power 8

00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:32,370
system this is actually from a small

00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:35,940
system we had on loan before our our

00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:38,849
main system arrived so this is from from

00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:41,459
an evaluation system this is a code

00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:45,089
called dl mezzo which is a mesoscale

00:08:41,459 --> 00:08:48,660
modeling code solving lattice Boltzmann

00:08:45,089 --> 00:08:51,560
equations and you can see there in blue

00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:56,870
the time to solution so

00:08:51,560 --> 00:09:00,760
lo is good this is on a 24 core single

00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:03,770
node so it scales well down to 24 cause

00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:06,710
then as you add more threads you start

00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:11,089
to use the sim symmetric multithreading

00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:12,890
the SMT option on the power 8 and you

00:09:11,089 --> 00:09:18,170
see that there's some benefit from that

00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:20,390
down to 96 96 threads the red curve is

00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:22,880
just the inverse of that that's the

00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:28,400
efficiency in millions of lattice

00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:31,220
updates per per second it so in summary

00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:35,089
we've invested in a significantly sized

00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:39,950
system using the IBM open power and

00:09:35,089 --> 00:09:41,740
NVIDIA GPU architecture Harvey center

00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:49,310
has been open for business for a while

00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:52,580
for as a center for enabling economic

00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:56,540
impact in industry and with the first PA

00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:59,330
DC in the UK we're porting an option

00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:02,750
optimizing a wide range of codes on the

00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:06,500
system for clients across industry and

00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:09,260
also academia as well as large-scale

00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:13,610
Sims simulation through our other

00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:15,860
programs data analytic applications and

00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:21,140
cognitive computing applications are

00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:23,210
also high prime priority so look for us

00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:26,600
that future open power events i'm

00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:30,530
submitting a paper into the workshop

00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:33,560
that Dirk announced that's happening at

00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:37,720
ISC in Frankfurt so I hope to see some

00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:37,720
