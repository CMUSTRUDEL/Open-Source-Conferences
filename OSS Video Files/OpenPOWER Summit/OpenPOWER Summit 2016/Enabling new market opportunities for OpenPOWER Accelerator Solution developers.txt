thank you everybody my name is Bob

00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:08,099
Sherwood I am the offering manager for

00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:11,849
accelerated programs accelerated

00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:15,179
solutions on power so my goal here today

00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:16,830
is to explain to you the ecosystem and a

00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:19,109
little bit of why you would want to

00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:25,410
develop accelerators on your

00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:27,300
applications on power systems so first

00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:32,250
just a quick what are we talking about

00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:34,590
here so these are accelerator cards up

00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:37,520
on the top here they're PCIe attached

00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:42,120
they have an fpga in the middle of them

00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:44,550
we have cards now for alpha data we have

00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:46,770
cards from nalo tech we also have cards

00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:49,050
from sentian who's here and we have

00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:52,170
other cards coming in from other vendors

00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:55,260
now that are being developed these cards

00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:56,820
hold the in the in the fpga they hold

00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:59,250
the accelerator code which actually

00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:01,620
performs the calculations that do the

00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:10,380
offloads from the processor and goes

00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:11,460
faster so on a normal power 8 server /

00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:15,660
socket you're going to have to

00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:20,530
accelerator cards on a in each socket

00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:23,860
so why do you care and why does Cappy go

00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:26,470
faster this is the 32nd overview of why

00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:29,950
it works and why it goes faster but on a

00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:33,250
typical IO model you end up with having

00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:36,340
to pin the memory run the accelerator do

00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:39,460
the calculation tell that it's complete

00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:41,590
put the data somewhere again and you're

00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:43,390
done but the whole thing takes 13

00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:46,870
microseconds to run through that whole

00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:49,360
thing and thousands of instructions when

00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:51,430
you come down here with cappy the memory

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,100
is coherent and you don't need to

00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:57,729
therefore use the device driver so in

00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:59,950
the end you end up with 500 instructions

00:01:57,729 --> 00:02:02,290
and you end up with point 3 micro

00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:04,900
seconds which is about 35 times faster

00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:06,790
than 13 microseconds you won't say that

00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:09,970
all over the place but you will say that

00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:12,580
in these instances and so you run faster

00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:14,980
so an accelerator is going to make your

00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:16,990
application run faster on power and if

00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:20,320
you enable cappy you're going to run an

00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:24,610
additional improvement so that's Cappy

00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:29,230
101 so I want to talk more about the eco

00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:30,910
system for building an accelerator

00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:33,250
applications what you end up with is

00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:37,150
really four stages you have building

00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:40,180
block providers these guys build Monte

00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:42,820
Carlo simulation encryption sort they

00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:44,920
build the algorithms then you have an

00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:46,480
independent software vendor he's going

00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:48,340
to take those building blocks he's going

00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,900
to put a wrapper around him with has an

00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:53,080
interface and it's geared towards a

00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:54,880
specific industry target so for Monte

00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,200
Carlo he built a wrapper around it he

00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:58,900
might put it in the financial services

00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:00,910
market as an example then you have

00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:02,590
business partners and they're going to

00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:05,380
create solutions out of that so they're

00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:06,970
going to take the ISB and they're going

00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:08,680
to take that application they're going

00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:10,570
to take the capi card that we showed you

00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,799
earlier they're going to take a power 8

00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:13,180
system they're going to put all that

00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:15,010
together they're going to integrate it

00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:17,110
and they're going to add services to

00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:19,060
that and then they're all that down to

00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:24,569
the end user so this is the whole

00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:27,849
solution building process if you will

00:03:24,569 --> 00:03:30,069
what does that look like kind of in a in

00:03:27,849 --> 00:03:33,129
a picture form here you have the

00:03:30,069 --> 00:03:35,680
accelerant and the FPGA with a building

00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:38,409
block in it when you add the application

00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,970
from the isv you bring that together and

00:03:38,409 --> 00:03:41,439
then if you put that in a rack with

00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:43,000
servers and you build the whole solution

00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:45,099
around it then you end up with a full

00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,260
solution this is kind of important

00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:52,269
because this happens in places during

00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:56,349
the during the build cycle so let's talk

00:03:52,269 --> 00:03:59,980
first well let me explain now so my goal

00:03:56,349 --> 00:04:01,870
and this whole thing is to explain to

00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:04,720
you how we can leverage open power and

00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:07,480
all the and all the members of open

00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:10,840
power and their expertise to develop

00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:12,639
solutions that are leading technology

00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,829
and bring value to our customers so

00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:17,530
that's my whole job with my whole team

00:04:14,829 --> 00:04:19,000
is to take all your applications try to

00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:21,789
get them accelerated try to provide

00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:26,460
value to our business and our and our

00:04:21,789 --> 00:04:28,840
customers so if we talk about the

00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:30,400
solution channel where the building

00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:32,320
block providers and the independent

00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,020
software vendors why do they want to

00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:39,340
develop on power what can I provide them

00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:40,870
in my ecosystem so the first thing is we

00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:43,870
have a lot of development resources

00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:47,320
available for you we have access to the

00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:49,780
technical specs for for the accelerators

00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:52,780
for Cappy we have Cappy development kits

00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:55,360
so you can go out to the to the card

00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:57,310
vendors as I said Sen Tian alpha data

00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,990
nallett ech you can get a Cappy

00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:01,530
developer kit you can build your

00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:03,909
application on there you can try it out

00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:05,770
we have what we call the pic and the

00:05:03,909 --> 00:05:07,930
super vessel development clouds these

00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:09,310
are free you can go schedule time on

00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:11,139
them they have accelerators in the

00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:13,000
clouds you can go out and you can try

00:05:11,139 --> 00:05:14,530
your application you can tune it you can

00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,490
improve it you can make sure it works

00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:20,560
free of charge we have access to the IBM

00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:22,690
poughkeepsie benchmarking facilities so

00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,880
once your applications running if you

00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:26,949
wanted to well collateral proof points

00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,659
benchmarks things like that that helps

00:05:26,949 --> 00:05:31,510
sell that solution that help demonstrate

00:05:28,659 --> 00:05:33,000
its value I have access to that I can

00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:36,420
provide that to you

00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,610
we also have the Montpelier the

00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:40,590
benchmarking center of competency and we

00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:42,150
have we have them in Poughkeepsie also

00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:44,610
we can feature and showcase your

00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:47,040
application there and we can also

00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:48,690
provide technical resources as you go to

00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:52,830
do the benchmarking and build your and

00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:55,560
build your application it's all free we

00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:57,600
have go to market resources so most of

00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,550
the companies that are developing some

00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,410
of these new applications or small

00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:03,180
companies they don't have marketing

00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:07,520
resources they don't have sales forces

00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:10,890
things like that so what can we provide

00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:13,250
we have a website now just went live we

00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:15,930
can advertise your application on there

00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:19,500
we have business partner channel sales

00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:21,780
teams things like that so you can go

00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:23,940
worldwide in other words if you have an

00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:25,530
application or a solution I can bring

00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:28,410
that to a business partner that business

00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:29,910
partner has worldwide sales force and

00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:31,560
resellers underneath him so all of a

00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:37,130
sudden your market presence is grown

00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:40,200
significantly I also have the ability to

00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:42,150
bring your solution into our demos our

00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:44,490
conferences things like this we're

00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:50,820
showing DRC over there this time when we

00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:53,250
were at open power are the super compute

00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:56,010
in November we have five demos going in

00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:59,850
a super compute of different different

00:06:56,010 --> 00:07:01,710
applications all right so the whole

00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:04,169
point on this is we have the development

00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:06,030
resources but we also increase your

00:07:04,169 --> 00:07:09,570
market share and that's what's really

00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:12,630
key are between the stuff that IBM will

00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:14,130
do and our business partners xilinx now

00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:16,169
litec others we can go to other

00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:21,780
customers and help increase your market

00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:23,820
share on the other side of it why do

00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:26,280
business partners want to offer our

00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:30,120
solutions and why do they want to go to

00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:31,800
the end customers this is a difficult

00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,169
chart and I'm just going to step through

00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:37,290
really quickly cuz when you go through

00:07:34,169 --> 00:07:38,580
the channel you end up with up here in

00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:41,520
the blue this is where the building

00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:43,550
blocks get get built sort encryption

00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,500
Monte Carlo

00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:47,450
they build a building block they put it

00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:49,760
on a course of card a copy card which is

00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:51,410
what I showed you on the first page then

00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:53,690
we have the solution integrator this is

00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:56,900
your business partner when he does this

00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:59,750
he takes that card he had the powerade

00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:02,480
server he adds solution integration

00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:04,460
services he adds the customer

00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:06,020
application he puts warranty services he

00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:08,120
adds all these kinds of services these

00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:10,310
are all high margins services that he

00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:12,050
can add to build this solution so now

00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:15,500
he's going to sell and build a solution

00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:16,880
instead of just a hardware and he gets

00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:19,910
more margin on it so that's his

00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:22,640
incentive Plus as we've talked about

00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:23,920
from the technology standpoint your

00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:26,210
solution is going to be more competitive

00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:29,180
doing your solution on power and

00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:31,130
invoking cappy makes your solution more

00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:34,220
competitive it's easier to sell

00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:36,050
competitive solutions then he goes down

00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:38,240
to a reseller that resellers going to

00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:39,970
have installation services he may

00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,740
customize that in that particular

00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:45,860
customers environment so he gets also

00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:48,590
margin for that that goes to the end if

00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:50,180
we can't do this if the if the reseller

00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:53,030
does not have the skills to do the

00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:55,280
customization I can bring in the IBM GBS

00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:58,450
team and they have skills to manage this

00:08:55,280 --> 00:09:00,590
process and manage and manage the

00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:06,740
engagement and they can do that

00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:08,480
customization so I'm going to if you

00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:10,490
talk about that all I'm saying here and

00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,080
kind of repeat it a little bit but the

00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:14,180
advantage to the business partners are

00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:17,510
they get to add high-margin services

00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:22,220
when they sell solutions in addition

00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:27,640
they bring to the table resources and

00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:31,270
marketing scope so they get all right

00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:34,300
a couple quick examples here we've got

00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:38,740
an isv who came to us and they have text

00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:42,340
and search solutions so on this one what

00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:44,470
we ended up doing is two things one is I

00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:47,230
got them introduced they happen to

00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:49,780
specialize in the intelligence community

00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:51,580
and I got them in touch with a client

00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:54,700
executive e.m who handles the

00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:57,340
intelligence community in Washington we

00:09:54,700 --> 00:10:00,070
pitched their solutions to the client

00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:01,990
exec and to the sales execs for the

00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:04,060
intelligence community and now they're

00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:05,980
running PLC's at one of the agencies in

00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:09,760
the intelligence community so we got

00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:11,530
them and into the market it works second

00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:15,120
one down here I've got another is V with

00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:19,380
an image analytic solution these guys

00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:22,750
are really doing bank fraud and I

00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:24,400
introduced them again they had an

00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:27,130
opportunity but I introduced them to the

00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:31,410
GBS and the client exec for IBM will

00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:36,250
handle that account and in that case the

00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:39,940
the GBS client exact she noticed that

00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:41,710
that solution was so universal she said

00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:45,100
either within that bank you're not even

00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:47,140
in the most profitable place where that

00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:49,120
solution could be applied would you mind

00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:51,340
if I presented it to that part of the

00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,920
organization because this guy only had

00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:55,600
one into the bank so she presented it

00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,280
she's going to present that to other

00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,590
organizations within the bank and she

00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:01,960
says that solution is also applicable in

00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:03,880
the insurance community which she also

00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:05,650
covers so she said would you mind if I

00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,560
presented it to the insurance community

00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:10,510
so now this guy who had one small

00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:12,610
solution in a one organization within a

00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:14,170
bank now has the rest of the bank and

00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:17,020
he's got the insurance community where

00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:18,760
his solutions being proposed that's huge

00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:21,430
for him he wouldn't have gotten those

00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:22,720
doors in without going through this or

00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:25,330
would have been a lot harder for him I

00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:30,340
won't say never but and the last thing

00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:31,870
is that we did the engagement management

00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:34,450
for this because his is a very high

00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:36,010
touch solution needs a lot of

00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:38,290
customization depending on what

00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:40,840
particular end user is going to use it

00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:41,889
and we coordinated all that forum so we

00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:44,199
provided him a method

00:11:41,889 --> 00:11:45,759
going to market that he didn't half and

00:11:44,199 --> 00:11:48,279
he couldn't have entertained this size

00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:54,069
engagement without invoking this

00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:56,559
ecosystem so no I'm just going to

00:11:54,069 --> 00:12:00,480
summarize here quickly we have a winning

00:11:56,559 --> 00:12:04,689
technology it's competitive it's winning

00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:06,609
so you can bring that in and the open

00:12:04,689 --> 00:12:10,029
power foundation members are going to

00:12:06,609 --> 00:12:12,339
build leading products with it we can

00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:14,230
provide routes to market for you and we

00:12:12,339 --> 00:12:16,689
can provide services for you and we can

00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:17,919
provide technical resources for you and

00:12:16,689 --> 00:12:19,419
that's going to increase your market

00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:20,829
segment that's going to generate more

00:12:19,419 --> 00:12:22,480
customers and it's going to help you

00:12:20,829 --> 00:12:24,519
bring more revenue and that's what this

00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,439
open power foundation can do for you and

00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:30,129
it's why you should do accelerators on

00:12:26,439 --> 00:12:34,839
power my last chart and then you can go

00:12:30,129 --> 00:12:37,149
drink is just a set of contacts here so

00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:39,519
you can and you can I think everybody

00:12:37,149 --> 00:12:42,279
gets copies of the charts but you can

00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,540
contact myself or Bruce or Brian any of

00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:45,730
the three of us and we'll get you into

00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:47,860
this process and get it started we do

00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:49,509
have a cap e development website we have

00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:50,829
the super vessel website where you can

00:12:49,509 --> 00:12:53,709
go if you're developing an application

00:12:50,829 --> 00:12:56,139
and you want to go reserve time on it

00:12:53,709 --> 00:12:57,850
and we just did I don't have it up here

00:12:56,139 --> 00:12:59,799
because we got it live after I did the

00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:01,600
charts but we do have a website now

00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:03,279
where we actually advertise all the capi

00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,169
solutions and all the accelerator

00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:11,759
solutions that are available right now

00:13:05,169 --> 00:13:11,759
on power at website thank you that's it

00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,140
