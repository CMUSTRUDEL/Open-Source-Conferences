okay so I try to be brief and maybe

00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:10,469
catch up sometime here so I'll talk

00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:12,000
about con to toe and if you have any

00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:13,410
more questions after this we have a

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,990
booth over there where we have the

00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:19,710
hardware running in a power system so

00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:22,949
come over and look at it and ask any

00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:24,990
questions so what we did is we built

00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:27,570
this con todo cart which is an FPGA

00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:30,990
memory card that plugs right into the

00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:34,430
memory slot of a Powerade server and the

00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:36,660
idea is that we can now put any

00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:39,390
different memory technologies meaning

00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:41,820
other than DRAM into a Powerade system

00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:44,100
and we successfully booted T Ram em RAM

00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:47,070
and envied imps

00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,530
the other benefit you have from that is

00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:52,140
that now that you have an FPGA in the

00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:56,280
middle between the processor and your

00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:58,500
memory you have really found highest

00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,750
bandwidth and lowest latency attached

00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:04,140
point for an FPGA in any computer system

00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:06,900
currently so I think earlier we had

00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:11,010
already done fine don't run use that for

00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:13,110
near memory acceleration so here's

00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:17,610
little introduction into the power eight

00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:19,530
memory subsystem so we use these custom

00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:23,130
themes that consists of a memory buffer

00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:25,409
ASIC that connects via via mei-ling's

00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:27,570
high-speed serial links to the to the

00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:29,549
processor and then has four memory

00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:32,850
controllers to connect with the memory

00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:35,400
on the dim so the big benefit that gives

00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:38,070
you is that this dual chip module power

00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:40,380
eight would have access to eight times

00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:43,799
four memory controllers meaning 32

00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:46,079
memory controllers onto this socket

00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:51,210
which gives you enormous capacity and

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:53,790
bandwidth using these custom dims so in

00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:56,520
this project we went ahead and said okay

00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:59,820
if we can replicate the functionality of

00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:01,950
the ASIC we're having in an FPGA and put

00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:05,329
that right on the memory bus then

00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:08,970
because the flexibility of the FPGA you

00:02:05,329 --> 00:02:10,420
can now well a you can populate the

00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:13,270
server with the

00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:15,430
customs and and the fpga-based card at

00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:18,790
the same time and you can build

00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:20,800
basically any memory controller you like

00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:23,500
not only targeting vram but anything

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,780
else and we try to keep the the

00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:27,610
architecture of the FPGA as flexible as

00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:31,959
possible so that that is actually easy

00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:36,069
to do so here's the card you see it has

00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:40,709
the the same connector to the total

00:02:36,069 --> 00:02:43,360
memory slots as as our custom DBMS and

00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:45,730
it's a little bit higher than then I see

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:49,000
Dempsey Liam's end roughly here so we

00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:51,459
add a little bit of height and also you

00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,310
know as you plug the dims you you come

00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:58,030
out a little bit further so it's wider

00:02:54,310 --> 00:03:02,280
and higher so just that shows you that

00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:05,739
this is basically just a prototype and

00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:07,420
play vehicle for us to to experiment

00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:11,019
with the different memories and give

00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:16,090
people access to them the FPGA we used

00:03:11,019 --> 00:03:18,549
is a static 5 a 9 which has should have

00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:21,850
enough capacity to to put additional

00:03:18,549 --> 00:03:26,290
logic they are and to experiment with

00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:28,450
your ideas here's that here's a little

00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:31,720
bit more detailed look into what that

00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:34,930
FPGA looks like so we come in from the

00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:39,040
processor 14 names at 8 gigabyte

00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:42,760
gigabits and go back up with 21 times 8

00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:47,500
Giga bits the terrifi multiplexers and

00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:50,140
demultiplexers 32 to 1 so we come out at

00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:54,069
a frequency of 250 megahertz that is

00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:56,470
manageable on an FPGA still gives you a

00:03:54,069 --> 00:03:59,220
pretty wide data path at a good

00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:02,769
frequency so it was not quite that easy

00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:05,769
then all the all the protocol logic to

00:04:02,769 --> 00:04:08,410
enable us to talk to the processor and

00:04:05,769 --> 00:04:11,530
transfer data and then basis is cut

00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:14,139
point where we use the Altera Avalon bus

00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:16,299
to basically separate everything we need

00:04:14,139 --> 00:04:19,180
to do to talk with the PA to anything

00:04:16,299 --> 00:04:23,080
you would want to do and play with

00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:25,660
and that is should hopefully be plug and

00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:28,060
play so what you see in this picture

00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:31,479
basically our logic and two memory

00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:35,650
controllers consumes roughly 40% of the

00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:41,919
a9 so you have good other 40% or so

00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:43,750
available for you to play so again we

00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:46,600
are we have a booth here at the open

00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:49,720
power so come over take a look and ask

00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:53,530
more questions if you like we did

00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:55,120
successfully booty ummm and envy dibs in

00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:59,169
a countertop locked into a Powerade

00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:02,470
server the the additional latency we

00:04:59,169 --> 00:05:07,330
incur compared to to our custom themes

00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:10,780
is 272 500 nanoseconds depending on use

00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:13,599
case and configuration I think you know

00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:15,699
it could give two more talks about only

00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:17,500
that so I think if you're interested in

00:05:15,699 --> 00:05:20,020
more details on those numbers also come

00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:22,750
over and talk anytime and there's

00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:26,380
already several projects inside and

00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:28,990
outside IBM going on using this card so

00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:32,830
if you if you are interested in doing

00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:35,680
the same and maybe shine in the and and

00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:38,349
when the dinner with Bert McCready you

00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:42,330
know come on by and we'll give you a

00:05:38,349 --> 00:05:44,949
head start and that's basically it

00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:46,599
this particles partially funded by the

00:05:44,949 --> 00:05:49,630
Department of Defense and the first for

00:05:46,599 --> 00:05:54,870
to contract and many many others

00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:54,870
