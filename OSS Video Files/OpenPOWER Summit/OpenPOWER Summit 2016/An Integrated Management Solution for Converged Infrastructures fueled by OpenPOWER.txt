good evening so I'm going to talk about

00:00:03,799 --> 00:00:08,370
converging for stretchers and a lot of

00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:12,450
you may not have heard these terms

00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:15,570
before so getting started on the first

00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:18,810
chart here I want to get this study

00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:21,840
initial description of how what where

00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:24,990
the market is going right and what's the

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:28,410
difference between these infrastructure

00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:30,720
systems so you have the traditional

00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:35,880
systems in the data center where you

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:38,190
have islands of compute networking and a

00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:42,180
storage and you will deploy solutions on

00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:44,850
top of that right the market is going a

00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:47,120
different direction also in order to

00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:51,649
make it these things easier to manage

00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:54,719
they get integrated into rack systems

00:00:51,649 --> 00:00:57,210
where you can find all the aspects of

00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,520
these solutions like storage and

00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:02,520
computer networking and the managed in a

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:06,240
sack and the the solutions themselves

00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:08,119
are deployed within these district

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:12,450
systems right so this is what we call

00:01:08,119 --> 00:01:15,900
converge systems and and then there is

00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:18,990
another term where the industry is going

00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:21,479
on a direction that is even more

00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:25,439
integrated nowadays so they call it a

00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:27,509
hyper converge and there are discussions

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:31,020
on the industry what there is likely

00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:33,110
means but there are at least ax and some

00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:36,350
aspects everybody is in agreement so

00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:39,630
when to hyper converge you'll have more

00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:42,869
software-defined solutions right so

00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:47,479
you'll have a commoditized hardware

00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:51,619
where you have all your resources pects

00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:56,670
represented there and you'll use

00:01:51,619 --> 00:02:00,860
technologies like oh vs for verbalizing

00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:04,049
the network aspects use distributed

00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:08,100
storage systems like safe and Swift

00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:12,990
right to verbalize your your data ask

00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:18,420
act of the systems as well one other

00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:20,400
thing I wanted to kind of just point out

00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:24,240
here is that the market is going in this

00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:27,510
direction today so the market as a whole

00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:30,090
it's like more than 400 billion dollars

00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:33,990
market if you look at the integrated

00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:35,580
systems as a whole but yeah you can see

00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:38,780
that the traditional systems are

00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:45,650
decreasing in terms of yearly

00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:48,210
deployments right so right now the

00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:51,900
converts system deployments they're

00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:55,650
growing at a compound annual growth rate

00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:57,990
of more than ten percent and if you look

00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:00,660
at hyper convert systems they're growing

00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:03,890
even more like they're growing up to

00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:06,390
sixty percent year to year right and

00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:09,780
there is a nineteen billion dollar

00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:14,460
market opportunity on these types of

00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:18,330
solutions usually they are delivered

00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:21,720
into two models there are what they call

00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:25,910
single sku systems and what that means

00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:28,950
is that the provider sells the whole

00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:31,620
package solution with the whole cells

00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:34,380
you were iraq we has a storage and

00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:38,970
computer networking and it has support

00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:41,820
and it has documentation and the manor

00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:43,860
and software embedded into it and then

00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:46,860
there's a heparin circuit teachers also

00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:50,910
heifers architecture is they provide you

00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:53,130
with a bill of materials and you build

00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:56,490
your own system right so they provide

00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:58,650
you a reference architecture for both

00:03:56,490 --> 00:04:02,940
the hardware and the software aspects of

00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:05,310
the solution and that includes on like a

00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:08,760
software that you can download or you

00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:11,220
can purchase it it depends and and most

00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:15,330
of these systems are going more towards

00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:17,750
the open direction today so that's why

00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:20,510
it plays a big role

00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:24,050
to open power but with open hardware

00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:26,780
open architecture of references like oh

00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:29,870
people supporting open power and it

00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:34,370
plays a big aspect of open-source

00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:38,840
software so for the management aspect so

00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:41,210
the key message here is that power and

00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:43,930
open our they have to play a big role in

00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:47,630
this market that that's the market where

00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:50,950
things are growing nowadays and if we

00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:54,410
don't position power and open power

00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:56,030
ecosystem hardware in these these

00:04:54,410 --> 00:05:02,960
markets we're going to be left behind

00:04:56,030 --> 00:05:06,680
red this is a discharge is just for

00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:10,490
information so last year in IBM we

00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:14,480
worked on the converged system we call

00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:17,600
it pure power so it is a one of those

00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:22,000
single sku solutions so we have a rack

00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:24,740
where you have three kinds of networks

00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,660
so we have a data network we have a

00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:28,370
management network and you have a fibre

00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:31,700
channel network and you have all the

00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:34,640
aspects sold and inside the same rack

00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:38,180
right so we have these seven thousand to

00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:42,020
support storage and you can verbalize

00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:45,050
the distortion to v7000 and you have the

00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:50,150
power 8 notes to fulfill your computer

00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:53,120
aspects and you have the the management

00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:56,540
nodes as well we use the x86 for

00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:59,240
dissolution to manage power so we were

00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:01,760
talking about managing to power you're

00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:07,210
not running into power right and this is

00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:12,410
one other aspect that it's really under

00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:15,770
addressed nowadays and then on the right

00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:17,030
side it's just a minervan stack so we

00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:20,449
have the physical instructor if

00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:22,520
researcher have the firmware and

00:06:20,449 --> 00:06:25,400
that's assigned to each of these devices

00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:27,949
and what we really are or team

00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:29,599
contributed really wasn't a higher layer

00:06:27,949 --> 00:06:34,639
where you have think the great at

00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:38,059
managing part so in and I'm going to get

00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:40,219
more into this but that was one of the

00:06:38,059 --> 00:06:42,289
aspects where we started to integrate

00:06:40,219 --> 00:06:44,830
open source software to provide

00:06:42,289 --> 00:06:48,379
management package functions like

00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:50,659
monitoring and provisioning and other

00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:53,120
kinds of men of informations right and

00:06:50,659 --> 00:06:56,919
we we saw that there was a kind of a

00:06:53,120 --> 00:07:00,830
lack of support for managing to power

00:06:56,919 --> 00:07:02,900
right now nowadays we we were a lot

00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:05,180
about or solutions and everything

00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:08,150
compiling and running on power but this

00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:12,439
aspect of managing to power it's a

00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:15,620
little bit under addressed right now so

00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:17,810
what's next after this pure power

00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:20,689
solution right so well we would like to

00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:23,330
move to a hyper conversion and then

00:07:20,689 --> 00:07:26,689
moving to the hyper convert solution we

00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:29,060
need to use commodity hardware we have

00:07:26,689 --> 00:07:31,960
to be lower cost that's one the reasons

00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:34,580
why we want to go open with open power

00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:42,229
ecosystem to be built on these racks

00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:43,789
right and we would like to use open

00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:47,949
software as well for the management

00:07:43,789 --> 00:07:50,930
aspect so if you look at key words like

00:07:47,949 --> 00:07:53,599
kvm for the virtualization layer instead

00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:56,870
of a power vm look like the power the

00:07:53,599 --> 00:08:01,370
legacy technology that we had an IBM

00:07:56,870 --> 00:08:06,129
right for vaporizing power so we want to

00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:09,349
move to kvm which is open and it's more

00:08:06,129 --> 00:08:12,189
used in the open community right now so

00:08:09,349 --> 00:08:14,749
we want to use oppa sack instead of

00:08:12,189 --> 00:08:16,939
virtualization project like pervy see

00:08:14,749 --> 00:08:19,999
for example we want to use the community

00:08:16,939 --> 00:08:22,939
support a door open OpenStack when I use

00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:25,310
containers right so we went a support

00:08:22,939 --> 00:08:26,990
darker and colbert nets and we want to

00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:29,710
support to storage technologies like

00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:34,819
self and the Swift and

00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:38,810
virtualize networking with a VXLAN and

00:08:34,819 --> 00:08:42,069
ovs as well so these are all the kind of

00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:46,160
hot buzzwords nowadays for these these

00:08:42,069 --> 00:08:50,209
kind of integrated solutions and the

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:53,750
other hot buzzword is how you deploy and

00:08:50,209 --> 00:08:58,940
how you operate these solutions right so

00:08:53,750 --> 00:09:01,730
the traditional traditional as a way

00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:04,220
that you would do this is you'll develop

00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:07,250
a new release your management software

00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:10,550
and then we install it and then you you

00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:16,279
operate it right so nowadays are they

00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:18,740
they have the solutions being deployed

00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:21,459
in what they call their vaults so it's

00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:24,019
like just a continuous integration

00:09:21,459 --> 00:09:26,600
delivery of the solutions so it means

00:09:24,019 --> 00:09:28,339
that you deliver your management

00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:32,029
applications and your infrastructure

00:09:28,339 --> 00:09:36,290
itself you monitor them and you have to

00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:38,630
feed the performance analysis and many

00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:41,209
other aspects of management you have to

00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:44,410
feed back to your tweaking your

00:09:41,209 --> 00:09:48,490
infrastructure and you'll you earn a

00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:52,160
continuously continuous cycle of

00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:56,600
enhancing tweaking and delivering it

00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:59,990
right so when we're putting this

00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:02,870
together and even before when we release

00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:06,529
the pure power solution one aspect that

00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:09,800
I mentioned before was that we did see a

00:10:06,529 --> 00:10:14,329
little support to manage to power right

00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:16,250
so if you there are many many layers of

00:10:14,329 --> 00:10:18,019
management that you can have in these

00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:19,850
solutions so you can manage this

00:10:18,019 --> 00:10:22,490
solution as a whole you can manage the

00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:25,880
services of the solution you can manage

00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:27,980
their operating systems on the hosts you

00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:30,199
can manage the virtualized guests you

00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:34,220
can manage the firmware and can manage

00:10:30,199 --> 00:10:38,319
the hardware capabilities associated to

00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:41,620
the hardware right like for example here

00:10:38,319 --> 00:10:44,640
that we're hearing a lot of

00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:48,130
those words about optimization using

00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:50,110
kathy and cuda so you need to understand

00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:53,260
out in a data center you have a mixed

00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:56,560
environment right so you need to know

00:10:53,260 --> 00:11:00,850
which nodes you have this capabilities

00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:03,970
and how to to really deploy to these

00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:06,430
notes correctly using a workflow and

00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:10,029
occurs orchestration applications today

00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:12,880
and if you look at these applications in

00:11:10,029 --> 00:11:15,790
the DevOps environment they don't they

00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:20,250
don't really have of the show support to

00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:25,029
know what what kind of hardware I have

00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:28,000
in especially on the power work right so

00:11:25,029 --> 00:11:30,720
they don't know how to do that so that's

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,200
one of the biggest issues right now and

00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,980
one thing we want to do with having

00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:39,010
conversations through the open bar

00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:41,410
foundation and try to have an a kind of

00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:45,760
in couple a workgroup and incubation

00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:50,050
workgroup try to promote more of this

00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:54,480
managed to aspect to support power in

00:11:50,050 --> 00:12:00,779
the existing solutions out there right

00:11:54,480 --> 00:12:05,650
so and and this is howie when i do this

00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:09,270
so the right side you see that cut out

00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:11,560
there DevOps and continuous integration

00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:15,790
architecture or how you deploy these

00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:19,930
solutions but we we can do that alone so

00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:23,770
we we need to pick a kind of from one of

00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:26,140
the capabilities and then you have to

00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:29,080
look at the market there are thousands

00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:32,050
of applications out there if you look at

00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:36,750
one aspect like health monitoring you're

00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:39,490
going to see just in the open source

00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:41,860
word for example you you want to see

00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:46,180
dozens of applications that do the same

00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:50,620
thing right so we can't instrument all

00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:53,350
of them at once to support open power or

00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:55,870
can we write so

00:12:53,350 --> 00:13:00,580
one of the maintenance of this

00:12:55,870 --> 00:13:02,980
discussion is to try to make to to have

00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:05,470
a single point of reference for for

00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:09,820
these two providers so they know how to

00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:12,910
manage the open power aspects so do

00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:16,510
libraries to make it easier for them to

00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:19,870
to understand when a given hardware

00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:24,190
support scooter or or or GPU

00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:27,370
acceleration or support so CC for power

00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:30,070
cap management like another speaker

00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:31,840
mentioned earlier today so that there

00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:34,450
are many of these aspects that we can

00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:37,360
provide us a library and make it easier

00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:41,200
for these two providers to build plugins

00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:45,100
to support power off the shelf right so

00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:49,300
if you if you live in a data center for

00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:51,940
example its are really very likely that

00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:56,170
you heard of tools like a nag use or

00:13:51,940 --> 00:14:01,890
sensor or I singer or zabbix so the

00:13:56,170 --> 00:14:04,570
intent of these this kind of incubation

00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:06,570
workgroup that we're proposing is to

00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:09,460
make it easier for these tools to

00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:15,100
support these off the shelf right

00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:18,510
support managed to power so that's one

00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:23,380
of the reasons why we're kind of a

00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:26,050
showing these did this work where we're

00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:29,430
starting to do some work in IBM but we

00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:34,360
want to be open and have an open source

00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:37,000
a kind of open source initiative where

00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:39,700
we would like to engage of other

00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,620
partners as well to help us to define

00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:44,620
what are the reference architectures

00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:47,710
that we want to see these solutions what

00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:50,680
are the more most popular tools that we

00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:52,480
want to instrument and help us define

00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:55,360
what are the libraries that these tools

00:14:52,480 --> 00:15:00,100
I need to use red

00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:04,690
and this is a big picture of what such

00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:06,730
such thing go look like so you'll see on

00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:10,000
the bottom the reference architecture

00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:13,839
based on open power you have compute

00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:17,290
nodes with large CPU capabilities and

00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:20,470
maybe GPU capabilities as well you have

00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:25,149
other power nodes where you have a large

00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:28,300
number of hard disks right so and I

00:15:25,149 --> 00:15:30,010
suppose it doesn't have to be only one

00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:34,060
entrance architecture could be multiple

00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:37,380
ones right then there is the the

00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:40,300
infrastructure as a service aspect and a

00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:43,480
lot of people today they use OpenStack

00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:45,940
and obey stock already supports power on

00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:48,070
a certain degree but what they stock

00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:51,370
alone will not provide everything that

00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:55,300
you need to to manage these solutions on

00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:57,820
a on a data center right so like I said

00:15:55,300 --> 00:16:01,209
there are thousands of our applications

00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:05,769
that run along side of a stacker to

00:16:01,209 --> 00:16:08,410
complement OpenStack so then that's

00:16:05,769 --> 00:16:13,140
where it enters this green layer that's

00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:15,449
where we're working on right now so

00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:18,940
whatever purpose is to have this

00:16:15,449 --> 00:16:22,000
extensibility framework where we would

00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:26,890
be have these libraries and their

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,870
capabilities defined dan would make them

00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:31,480
available to the tools and the upper

00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:34,449
layer and then I just put some examples

00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:37,000
of some tools there and tries to cover

00:16:34,449 --> 00:16:40,000
multiple aspects of DevOps right so

00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:43,720
their robes even from the beginning from

00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:47,350
source code and having a positive R is

00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:51,550
like you get and having automation

00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:55,089
fields with Jenkins for example then all

00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:58,600
the way to provisioning aspects you know

00:16:55,089 --> 00:17:00,760
there's a very popular tools today red

00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:04,179
have bought and simple for example and

00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:06,669
suppose a declarative provisioning to

00:17:04,179 --> 00:17:08,160
then you have your your procedural

00:17:06,669 --> 00:17:14,100
provisioning tools like

00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:17,190
chef and then there's the solutions from

00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:19,680
canonical as well miles in Jeju so what

00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:22,350
I'm trying to say is that there every

00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:26,460
way you could it every aspect you look

00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:28,620
at in there like provisioning or

00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:30,180
configuration or discovery or inventory

00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:34,980
you're going to find multiple

00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:38,760
applications and they do they do make

00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:42,150
sense they do influence how people

00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:45,300
choose to took purchase their come there

00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:48,300
their infrastructure today so you can

00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:51,030
see a lot of people that will look at

00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:56,760
when they're expanding their data center

00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:58,590
they're going to look in to see if they

00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:01,380
support already supported tools that

00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:03,780
they are familiar with right so that's

00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:11,190
one of the reasons why we want to

00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:13,410
provide these dis capabilities and make

00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:19,970
it easier for these tools just to manage

00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:25,770
the power okay so and this is the just a

00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:29,070
final chart so like I said before this

00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:31,200
is a initiative that is being discussed

00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:33,990
there is a work group in the open power

00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:37,470
foundation it's called salute the

00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:40,650
integrated solutions work group and this

00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:44,850
layer this incubation layer were support

00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:47,550
order tools not only open stock but our

00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:51,260
order to like the ones that I mentioned

00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:55,320
before so we're discussing how to better

00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:58,260
organize into how to better engage with

00:18:55,320 --> 00:19:01,560
partners in order to to help us do this

00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:03,840
echo system right so if you're

00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:06,810
interested if you are to provider or

00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:10,310
you're harder provider that you like to

00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:14,010
see this popular to support or harder

00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:17,310
we're looking for your help right so

00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:17,789
just contact there is work group in

00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:20,279
there

00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:23,850
open bar foundation or or just contact

00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:26,129
myself my amuse at the bottom there so

00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:29,820
we're trying to put this together in the

00:19:26,129 --> 00:19:33,149
next two to three months or so and try

00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:35,279
to reuse things as much as possible so

00:19:33,149 --> 00:19:37,409
there are assets already like like I

00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:39,690
mentioned before OpenStack that

00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:41,580
supported supports power there's this

00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:44,729
super vessel cloud that a lot of people

00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:47,909
here heard about they also support a lot

00:19:44,729 --> 00:19:52,080
of the same kind of functionality that

00:19:47,909 --> 00:19:56,809
we would like to streamline right and

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:59,669
there is a there are other open source

00:19:56,809 --> 00:20:03,179
open source projects out there if you

00:19:59,669 --> 00:20:04,739
look at provisioning aspect for example

00:20:03,179 --> 00:20:07,979
we're going to see a project called

00:20:04,739 --> 00:20:12,179
Ursula that uses ansible to deploy

00:20:07,979 --> 00:20:14,399
OpenStack generically and they are

00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:17,460
adding support of power right now right

00:20:14,399 --> 00:20:23,190
so we would like to reuse as much as

00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:25,590
possible and then kind of a add or add

00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:30,929
more value on the pieces that are

00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:34,729
missing out there right so that's what I

00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:34,729
