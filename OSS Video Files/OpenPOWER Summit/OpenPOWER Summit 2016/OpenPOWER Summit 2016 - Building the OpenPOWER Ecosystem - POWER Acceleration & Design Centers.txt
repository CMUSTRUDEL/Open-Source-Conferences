ok so I'm going to speak about what we

00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:10,290
call in IBM power acceleration and

00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:14,099
Design Center I want to explain what

00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:20,010
they are how we can engage and work with

00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:25,230
the center ok so high BAM and partners

00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:27,090
announced last year 3 / actuation center

00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:33,329
in Europe but with the worldwide

00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:35,700
coverage the center offer audra external

00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:38,940
access but also technical collaboration

00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:42,540
and the focus on the center's is

00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:45,360
application only many application and

00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:49,680
research no other we're not a lot of

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:54,510
other things so the first one is in

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:56,670
Emporium rid of this one and forget to

00:00:54,510 --> 00:01:00,690
mention all the center our incorporation

00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:03,449
with nvidia and mellanox okay that that

00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:06,390
are important and thumb thumb with some

00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:09,270
clients and partners so the first one is

00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:12,540
in montpelier we are focusing on

00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:14,549
technical collaboration application

00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,320
programming application tuning I'm going

00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:21,299
to give you some detail in the next

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:24,180
slide the second one is Germany and it's

00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:28,680
centers in collaboration with unique

00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:31,650
Center where are the frame air and also

00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:34,619
with nvidia and i will presenter for the

00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:38,130
activity of these centers and what is

00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:41,640
interesting also the last one is not an

00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:46,140
IBM centers is a center managed by yuki

00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:48,540
science and facility centers what the

00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:51,810
name is STFC or in the raspberry

00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:55,070
university and they provide also

00:01:51,810 --> 00:02:00,680
technical collaboration but also

00:01:55,070 --> 00:02:03,450
development of services engineering and

00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:05,610
not only in high-performance computing

00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:08,129
but also in big data analytic and deep

00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:10,979
learning so it's a little bit different

00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:13,110
compared to the center the mother ortho

00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:16,590
of engagement is little bit different

00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:19,560
all these Central's offered other where

00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:22,590
remote access one specific

00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:26,130
characteristic we provide is not we are

00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:29,250
not a cloud because we have to to

00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:32,280
identify partners but we provide very

00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:36,570
early access auto oil for example we are

00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:39,690
in studying Pascal GPU already we have

00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:42,540
beta version of all the compiler from

00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:45,270
time alpha but for the partners we have

00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:47,220
only the agreement from laboratory to

00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:48,540
give access to the beta version not hard

00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:53,160
Federation that you have a beta version

00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:55,709
for openmp open sec PGI all the stuff we

00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,360
can imagine on power we can provide you

00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:59,160
the accent that very important of the

00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,100
role of this power acceleration center

00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:04,890
and there is another one but it's not

00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:07,830
really a giant engagement it in

00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:12,480
poughkeepsie in u.s. provide a large

00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:16,170
system for benchmark so let's give you

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:19,680
some detail about non presenter so our

00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:23,010
focus is application and we have a five

00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,760
missions the first one is to engage in

00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:29,220
support long-term collaboration

00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:32,790
long-term meanings 12 years up to the

00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:34,650
pre example of systems and we have

00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:36,540
different customers the first one is a

00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:39,030
french research because we are in French

00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:41,310
where we are working on application to

00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:45,420
anticipate application modification

00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:48,000
internal program model or not only on on

00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:50,070
the application or from the design new

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,030
technology for the storage bus buffer or

00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:57,150
this technology and we are collaboration

00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:59,880
in some other client in oranges

00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:03,540
financial market of course because with

00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:07,290
some bank and we can provide some common

00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:09,000
communication for this corporation the

00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:12,360
second aspect that I mention is

00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,790
application enablement and it's not in

00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:16,260
this case long-term collaboration but

00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:20,489
you can work with you we can work with

00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:24,419
IV partners we can provide some a catan

00:04:20,489 --> 00:04:25,690
audition or education what you want many

00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:31,240
Iran

00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:34,720
power tuning and GPU tuning in this in

00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:36,970
this group and of course we are part of

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:40,030
IBM so you are in including the

00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:41,770
development process that why we can have

00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:43,240
access to the beta version is something

00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:46,660
like that so the garage solve this

00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:48,550
Center is not only to provide you the

00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:50,440
capability to test the product but also

00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:52,450
to get it back to the development

00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:57,070
because as you know we are in the

00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:59,590
process openmp open sec we're missing

00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:01,420
some picture depending on the different

00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:03,880
domain so we need the feedback from the

00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:06,100
client to add the development so you can

00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:08,200
have a direct access or the center can

00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:12,520
have a role like a go-between between

00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:14,140
the you and the labs and of all you are

00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:20,770
high bandwidth also we are running

00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:22,450
benchmark comparing x86 power and for

00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:24,940
the customers what is important to

00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:28,570
notice I have provided for all the

00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:32,050
center the contact name and the email

00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:34,570
address so you're feel free to send a

00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:40,270
mail for any type of question regarding

00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:43,740
powered ship eun ji staff ok but it's

00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:47,470
only power and GPU so it's a green box

00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:50,680
but as you know the power ecosystems is

00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:54,910
not only GPU and power it's a different

00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:57,490
other acceleration or technical topic

00:05:54,910 --> 00:06:00,700
and in the center we provide all so

00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:03,250
different we have different groups we

00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:06,040
have one groups dedicated to the capi

00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:08,950
and st g acceleration and two until you

00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:12,669
walk together to know what type of

00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:16,180
design can be the best including GPU but

00:06:12,669 --> 00:06:19,510
potentially GPU and Cappie nae GA for

00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:22,150
the specific program i will i will

00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:25,900
provide more detail about the center

00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:29,140
while one group working on linux then

00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:32,230
you for the amps dockers commercial

00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:34,630
application big data amo MongoDB mi

00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:38,050
adeeb a faulty stuff which is not in the

00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:41,379
eye performance and domain i would say

00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:43,990
and the last one which is very important

00:06:41,379 --> 00:06:47,319
also it's about workload optimization

00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:51,909
and system optimization we are working

00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:54,849
on bad scheduling between you up now GPU

00:06:51,909 --> 00:06:57,699
cpu accelerator meeting notes makita

00:06:54,849 --> 00:07:00,400
storage so is very critical top team I

00:06:57,699 --> 00:07:02,949
the workload so I want him working on

00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:06,639
mainly on software for workload

00:07:02,949 --> 00:07:09,159
optimization and also on the high oh

00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:12,550
especially on parade file system with

00:07:09,159 --> 00:07:14,830
GPFS or spectrum scale for IBM mutti

00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:18,699
tears you know now we have birth burford

00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:22,300
i mentioned and in the RAM flash SSD

00:07:18,699 --> 00:07:25,120
tape cloud so we need to optimize the

00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:27,219
workload and to be able to run anywhere

00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:32,979
any place any type of for God so that

00:07:27,219 --> 00:07:36,909
the group is in short of that for the

00:07:32,979 --> 00:07:42,310
capi for interesting on cappy we can

00:07:36,909 --> 00:07:45,789
contact also our team the mission is to

00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:47,889
promote existing kappa block I hope

00:07:45,789 --> 00:07:50,680
other I wouldn't make any any mistake

00:07:47,889 --> 00:07:53,500
about that but you can also engage this

00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:57,759
team to support a specific project about

00:07:53,500 --> 00:08:01,659
Cappy to for the benchmark or proof of

00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:07,270
concept or also to create an asset the

00:08:01,659 --> 00:08:09,310
primary focus is Isis and clients but we

00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:14,710
can work with some of the partner

00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:18,310
university or commercial client it's a

00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:20,650
Ropin coverage primary and middle west

00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:23,590
africa i don't want to say if you are

00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:25,360
from us is not possible but getting guys

00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:28,240
with a guy and I they will be able to

00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:30,610
provide the right contact and of course

00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:34,570
we have a strong partnership with zai

00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:37,839
link which is a normal and also with IBM

00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:42,039
lab these centers is stranded by high

00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:45,820
beam labs and you can have demonstration

00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:50,660
riffing lot of type of service or run

00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:53,520
this technology no now

00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:56,460
let's talk about babbling and center I

00:08:53,520 --> 00:09:00,390
would say is pretty similar to the

00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:01,740
montpellier centers but there are some

00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:04,590
single it'll be different I let me

00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:08,040
explain so still working on application

00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:10,980
power 8 and power 18gp you it's a

00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:13,200
command center with nvidia and with a

00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:17,310
strong collaboration with the german

00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:20,400
yoga centers they provide also

00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:23,640
consultancy about power there are

00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:28,080
expertise in in tuning and application

00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:30,540
porting and what they provide they can

00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:35,820
give you an access there are the systems

00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:38,730
not so big but pretty con second and if

00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:42,900
you have a project you can request time

00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:45,150
support on the system's a dimension is

00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:46,920
an up-to-date technology that very

00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:48,780
important we are not a cloud we have the

00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:52,790
class we are the center want to provide

00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:56,040
the latest technology and event pre GA

00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:58,170
technology so I don't think there are a

00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:00,030
lot of system in the center in the world

00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:03,300
we can give the capability to run on the

00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:08,630
Pascal systems at this time except this

00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:11,970
power acceleration center ok so just

00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:14,910
contact and you have potentially the

00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:17,910
capability to have a slot and run on on

00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:19,770
this environment some project you are

00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:24,660
working on for instance in different

00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:26,880
domain so maybe astrophysics what we are

00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:30,240
doing we are trying to port the

00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:35,280
application in this case using OpenMP on

00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:38,190
GPU we are working on genomic ortho and

00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:41,190
weather forecast open forum for free

00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:44,550
dynamics where the objective is ready to

00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:47,700
demonstrate that power run pretty well

00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:50,820
but not only the fact important to run

00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:54,020
to change application to enable GPU and

00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:56,100
that i mentioned we are focusing on

00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:58,260
programming model with directive

00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:00,630
openness this year even if we can use

00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:03,089
cuda we all really want to push open

00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:06,930
OpenMP open sec for this

00:11:03,089 --> 00:11:09,379
complex and large application form of

00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:13,290
the application in automotive and safety

00:11:09,379 --> 00:11:18,860
is my latest struck a slide it's about

00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:21,930
this large Center in newquay and they

00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:24,569
normally the first objective is to

00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:27,120
support the euchy customer the UK

00:11:24,569 --> 00:11:29,009
environment and not only in I

00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,019
performance computing but all different

00:11:29,009 --> 00:11:33,629
domain a specie of course but

00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:36,779
visualization Direction is teach you big

00:11:33,629 --> 00:11:40,980
data and cognitive and we have a joint

00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:43,230
center with IBM research about deep

00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:46,399
learning in cognitive so this center i

00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:50,129
would say compared to the other one are

00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:54,120
much more dedicated to big data in

00:11:50,129 --> 00:11:56,399
cognitive at the same other the center

00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:58,459
you can have expertise in technology but

00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:01,620
the main difference we can have also

00:11:58,459 --> 00:12:06,240
expertise in domain so you can not only

00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:08,160
set up some poor teen application tuning

00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,740
collaboration but you can also set up

00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,449
technical collaboration and engineering

00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:15,389
in different domains so they are in

00:12:12,449 --> 00:12:18,509
chemistry environment modeling materials

00:12:15,389 --> 00:12:22,740
they can able to develop a service you

00:12:18,509 --> 00:12:24,420
can ask on these all these systems they

00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:27,600
have a bigger systems compared to earth

00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:31,499
and as you can see there are 30 around

00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:35,040
30 notes with a lot a lot of memory one

00:12:31,499 --> 00:12:37,949
terabyte per per node and they have a

00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:40,379
pretty strong hi-fi systems so that I

00:12:37,949 --> 00:12:43,860
mentioned it's not only I performance

00:12:40,379 --> 00:12:46,980
computing it also big data and they

00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:49,259
provide four types of engagement the

00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:52,980
first one is a simple access with us say

00:12:49,259 --> 00:12:56,490
any support so you're free access and

00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:58,980
you run the 71 you have an access and

00:12:56,490 --> 00:13:03,860
you have a support support in the

00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:07,350
different domain especially providing by

00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:10,410
scientific computing garden the third

00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:12,679
one is collaboration project

00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:16,089
collaboration a dimension to domain

00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:19,240
application and engineering

00:13:16,089 --> 00:13:21,189
and the latest one is education training

00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:24,660
I que tanto you can organize all this

00:13:21,189 --> 00:13:28,360
type of thing for your own for you

00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:30,370
daresbury some time you have to play

00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:32,649
sometime don't have to play for normally

00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:34,720
for though the center is free because

00:13:32,649 --> 00:13:39,519
you are here to develop the business and

00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:41,410
to develop the ecosystems on power so

00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,089
you want to have more more application

00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:47,829
running on power and the best as

00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:51,939
possible that the girl the same you have

00:13:47,829 --> 00:13:56,050
all the contact in the presentation so

00:13:51,939 --> 00:13:58,660
if it is all for me today so to adjust a

00:13:56,050 --> 00:14:01,480
brief ID to how to engage you know it

00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:05,529
exists is for you if it's not for your

00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:09,970
only source of IBM business no more but

00:14:05,529 --> 00:14:12,579
it's prettier large pretty gosh

00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:14,499
capabilities and a dimension another

00:14:12,579 --> 00:14:17,309
place in the world will be able to give

00:14:14,499 --> 00:14:19,959
you an early access hardware or software

00:14:17,309 --> 00:14:24,420
except the barracks are each a center

00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:24,420
