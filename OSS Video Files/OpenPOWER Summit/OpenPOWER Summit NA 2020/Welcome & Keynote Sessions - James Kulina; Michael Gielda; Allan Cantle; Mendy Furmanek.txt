to let everybody know what you the great

00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,400
work you're doing

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,160
so first of thanks to our sponsors as

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,120
well uh ant micro

00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,719
ibm open cappy and yandro without your

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,960
support we wouldn't be able to

00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:46,559
put on these events and let everybody

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,559
know all the great work that's going on

00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,039
so my name is james clinton i'm actually

00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,199
the new executive director

00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,320
for the foundation i started only a few

00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,719
months ago

00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,800
so my background is in open source uh

00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,000
previously i was the co-founder of the

00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,479
open source

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,040
cloud startup called hyper sh we were

00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:09,040
focused on container security

00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,640
uh we actually were the creators of the

00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,040
kata container project

00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,320
which is in now within the openstack

00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,320
foundation

00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,360
we worked extensively with the cncf here

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,520
at linux foundation

00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,119
as well as google kubernetes team and

00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,600
the docker team

00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,360
previously i'm a former red hatter

00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,240
working in the product group

00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,880
focusing on devops and then before that

00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,159
i was at

00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:34,320
18 t where i helped them stand up their

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,720
first openstack telco cloud

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,680
very excited to be here today with you

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,759
as well as

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:43,520
very excited about all the possibilities

00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,520
of open power moving forward

00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,399
so first i want to give a shout out to

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,320
hugh blemings

00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,759
our former executive director he did an

00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,159
excellent job

00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,920
in establishing the foundation for

00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,840
future growth

00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,280
and one of the best things that happened

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:04,079
last year was

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:07,439
the open opening of the power isa

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:09,440
which is monumental

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,039
and i think will lead to really great

00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,680
things uh in the future

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,480
we also had uh open reference designs

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,280
released

00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,360
so the first one was the microwatt and

00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,400
this was really a proof of concept

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,000
um that really only took a couple weeks

00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,760
to build out and it was really just

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,920
focusing on

00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,920
how do you how do you consume the power

00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,680
isa and how easy it is to consume and

00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,519
actually get up and running a working

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,680
processor

00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,760
and if you want to learn more about that

00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:41,200
you can actually attend their talk today

00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,480
it's in the track one at 3 30. we also

00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,599
just a few months ago

00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:48,239
ibm contributed the a2i core which was

00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,519
originally an embedded core a high

00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,680
performance embedded core

00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,040
that made its way into a number of super

00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,239
computers including the

00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:59,440
blue gene q uh there's another technical

00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:02,560
uh deep dive into that core and

00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,080
they they have a talk today at 1 20.

00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,920
the other great thing that happened last

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,720
year in 2019 was

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,680
moving the open power foundation within

00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,440
the linux

00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:16,879
foundation so we had open governance

00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:20,000
and by joining the linux foundation

00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:21,440
we really get to have access now to the

00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,400
best and brightest within the open

00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,640
source communities

00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,480
um and we can learn about the best

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,200
practices of growing a foundation and

00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,840
growing

00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,560
numbers and uh showcasing all the great

00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,440
things that you

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:36,560
all are doing so very excited to be part

00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,560
of the linux foundation now

00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:40,000
so i want to talk a little bit about our

00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,920
vision

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,360
moving forward for the foundation so

00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,239
historically

00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,360
the foundation was set up to really just

00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,200
focus on the

00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,599
the isa and the specification around the

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,599
iso

00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,519
what i want to do and what i'm hearing

00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,400
from other members

00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:00,239
is we're really going to shift into

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,319
being a more proactive foundation

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,239
that energizes their member companies so

00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:06,879
they can devote engineering resources

00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,239
to driving a thriving ecosystem and it's

00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,439
going to be around co-development of

00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,840
common license

00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:14,480
free power ip cores tools software and

00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,799
systems and

00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,759
moving forward we're going to have a a

00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:20,880
lot more

00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:24,720
interaction between our members

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,720
so that new innovations can occur

00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,240
and part of the way that we're going to

00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,479
do this and to accelerate this

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,080
is we're going to retool and rework our

00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:36,479
working group structure

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,680
around use cases and industry segments

00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,400
and the focus here is

00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,600
is around making it easier for our

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,639
member companies and our potential

00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,199
member companies

00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,639
to understand where they sit within the

00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,120
uh the foundation

00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,800
uh and how they can actually potentially

00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,600
contribute and collaborate

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,840
um and so showing the value uh very

00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,680
upfront um

00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,759
about what's going on and and how they

00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,080
can actually take part

00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,360
we'll also continue to have working

00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,440
groups around technologies

00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,520
specific technologies these technologies

00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,240
tend to cut through uh

00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,680
many segments and so they will still

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,120
exist and they will still be moving

00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,039
forward

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,720
but these working groups will also be

00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,479
responsible for managing all aspects

00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:22,240
around compliance and verification

00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,240
and modification to the isa if if

00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,240
required

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:29,199
and again one of the great things about

00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,199
being now within the linux foundation

00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,560
is the ability to have potential

00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,960
partnerships and collaboration with

00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,880
other foundations

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,080
and so openpower is really aiming

00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,680
towards driving

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,960
collab these types of collaborations

00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,840
within the found within the linux

00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,680
foundation

00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:48,320
including with projects uh called linux

00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,680
the risk five foundation the chips

00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,840
alliance foundation

00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,720
uh the lf artificial intelligence

00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,639
foundation

00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,840
as well as the networking in edge and

00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,560
automotive group

00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,240
hyperledger and cncf and all the sub

00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,800
projects within cncf

00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,600
and because openpower is a platform

00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,560
itself

00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,720
we want to make sure that we're

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,080
supporting all the great open source

00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,680
software out there that the linux

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:13,199
foundation is

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:15,120
producing we're also going to be

00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,039
working directly with the opencapi

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,919
consortium as well as the

00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:22,000
ocp group we actually have an entire

00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:23,520
track almost too dedicated to open cappy

00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,600
today

00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,039
and so the goal here really is to create

00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,560
this short feedback loop

00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,240
uh for feature requirements that are

00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:34,720
work that will inform our

00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:37,759
working groups moving forward

00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:40,080
and so the goal is to generate this this

00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:42,800
open power reference ip this common

00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,479
components uh that can be used within a

00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,400
number of verticals

00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,240
but by splitting out our work groups

00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,479
based on segments and verticals

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,520
it makes it easy for our member

00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,199
companies to see

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,800
you know what are we working on that

00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,120
aligns with these different verticals

00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,280
and

00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,280
then how can we engage who else is

00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,199
within those working groups

00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,360
and what are they contributing and how

00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,440
can we collaborate together

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,800
so you can see what's there and what you

00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:10,080
can reuse

00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,080
so you don't have to reinvent the wheel

00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,160
moving forward the focus areas for the

00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,599
foundation will be

00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:21,280
first around access to power systems uh

00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:23,599
we want to make it as easy as possible

00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:26,960
for you to get access to

00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:30,560
uh test out either software hardware uh

00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,560
and and making sure that it runs

00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:35,120
well on the power architecture and so

00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:38,240
what we want to have is

00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:40,800
a centralized hub technology hub with

00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,720
a variety of different power systems and

00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,280
configurations

00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,479
and in different geographical regions uh

00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,639
so that you can

00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:50,479
easily gain access to the types of

00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,919
systems that you require

00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:53,599
so we'll have a centralized way of

00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,960
getting access and requesting access but

00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,440
we want to make sure that anybody who

00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,919
needs it

00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,440
can get to it the other thing that we're

00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:01,840
looking at is

00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,919
standing up training curriculum so we

00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,560
have a number of academic

00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:07,280
institutions as members and they've been

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,199
asking

00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:12,720
actually for developing a curriculum

00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,919
around the open power iso

00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:19,280
because now it's a fully nuts to bolts

00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:20,960
open source it's a great platform for

00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,879
our teaching

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,120
we also obviously want to have engaged

00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:28,560
in productive technical working groups

00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:30,160
so i think how we're going to be

00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,479
changing our working group structure

00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,320
will lead to significantly

00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,240
higher uh throughput of technical

00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,800
innovations

00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,279
we're going to continue on putting on

00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,240
events

00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:44,080
such as this uh the summits but also

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,600
we're going to be

00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,600
looking at smaller events and more

00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,480
frequent events that are focused

00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,160
potentially on

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,680
you know specific segments and specific

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,279
technologies uh

00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,000
and giving a voice to our different

00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:58,000
members to showcase what they're doing

00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,480
at those events as well and we're going

00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,120
to be standing up meetups and workshops

00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,080
mostly focusing on the developers and

00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,920
end users

00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:09,839
and use cases around that

00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,519
so that we can have a lot of

00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,959
cross-pollination with the developer

00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,279
community

00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,399
um we're also going to be reaching out

00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:18,160
to all of you

00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,760
and and asking what are you up to so we

00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,240
can develop case studies

00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:26,000
and potential proof concepts to

00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,000
demonstrate the value of open power

00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,640
and so how do you actually engage with

00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,240
the openpower community well there's a

00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,480
number of ways

00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,839
obviously being here submitting talks

00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,760
getting accepted and

00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:39,760
showcasing what you're up to is is one

00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,680
way but there's also other ways you can

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,959
become a member of the foundation

00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,800
uh you can join our work groups

00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,600
contribute and collaborate there you can

00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,640
come to

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,800
potential meetups um if you already have

00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:53,279
open power uh

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,120
software or or hardware you can get it

00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:57,760
certified and showcased

00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,399
on our website as openpowerready uh you

00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,560
can

00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,079
help us out in terms of marketing uh

00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,720
through our marketing committee

00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:06,320
and the best way to to engage with any

00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,399
of the leadership here is is just to

00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,800
send us a note so you can always reach

00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:13,120
me at ed openpowerfoundation.org

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,560
or you can reach our new tsc chair to

00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:18,000

so uh to kick off

00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,680
our keynotes today

00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,839
is going to be michael gilda uh the vice

00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,640
president of business development at ant

00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:32,399
micro

00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,399
so please welcome michael

00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,320
hello everyone i hope you can see me let

00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,440
me try to advance a slide here just to

00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,440
check if it's all working

00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,120
okay so today i'm going to tell you a

00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:55,279
little bit about

00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,639
the open source ecosystem powering

00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:59,040
innovation and fpga

00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,079
development and i couldn't help myself

00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:03,120
and of course

00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:05,680
i capitalized the uh

00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:08,639
power there because of course we're at

00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,639
the openpower event

00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:12,880
um so first

00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,639
why am i here why am i talking on behalf

00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,120
of my company here at this openpower

00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,160
event

00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:20,079
um i think it need the story about

00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,000
micron open source needs telling because

00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:23,200
uh we've been founded 11 years ago and

00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,959
throughout that time

00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,120
a lot of things have changed but the one

00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:29,279
thing that has stayed the same is

00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,360
the fact that open source is the key to

00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:33,680
our business model

00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,959
and the reason is that we provide open

00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,720
source services

00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:38,720
transformative services that help people

00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,959
adopt new workflows and design

00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,160
methodologies to build better next

00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:44,399
generation systems

00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,240
we also use those methodologies to

00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,680
implement next generation systems for

00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,720
our customers and we call those systems

00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,160
software driven

00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,760
because even though we do a lot of like

00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,720
hardware fpga stuff

00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,920
we believe that uh um taking a software

00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,920
approach to them

00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,839
uh just like you know james was talking

00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:02,240
about and his background

00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,760
is implying is is a good idea there's a

00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,320
lot of great lessons to be learned in

00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,959
how open source transformed software

00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,399
to be transformed and transported into

00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:12,399
the hardware space

00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,240
so what we help people build this

00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:16,480
anything ranging from

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,079
autonomous vehicles to satellites

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,120
through security

00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:24,160
uh all sorts of uh industrial equipment

00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,839
medical um laboratory equipment and so

00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,959
on

00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:30,720
uh and we do hardware software ai fpga

00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:32,399
and asic is what i'm going to talk about

00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,440
today and also tools that kind of

00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,560
empower all the other

00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,360
segments so uh we don't just build like

00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,839
the

00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,480
currency of the art things we also think

00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,920
about

00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,160
what's going to come after and how we

00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:47,680
can use open source to improve

00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,959
uh the next level of development

00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,199
if you're really curious about what we

00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,959
do like on a more practical level

00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:55,040
uh you can take a look at the technology

00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:56,399
showcase on our main page

00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,240
there you'll see a lot of projects that

00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,639
we're involved with and

00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,240
they'll range from boards to software

00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:05,440
operating systems

00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:07,120
uh different kinds of ips uh

00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,199
different kinds of proof of concepts and

00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,560
so on uh be sure to check that out

00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:12,240
each of those is a blog note that

00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,240
describes the thing and very often leads

00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,639
to you know a github repository that

00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,519
holds the stuff because we publish what

00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,880
we do

00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:23,360
quite extensively now

00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,800
to the ecosystem part uh there's a bunch

00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:28,399
of organizations that we take

00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:30,560
part in and these are little foundations

00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,160
zephyr projects chips alliance risk five

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,760
and of course open power

00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,519
uh i i like that james actually

00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,760
mentioned i think all of them

00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:40,079
uh in his presentation and we typically

00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,959
try to play the strategic and and kind

00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,600
of

00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:44,240
ecosystem role in those organization so

00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,800
we

00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,760
adopt technologies that they build early

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,240
we help of course

00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,600
build them and we try to see what are

00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,399
the synergies and how we can connect

00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,880
those

00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:56,320
ecosystems we believe that there's a lot

00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,560
of value to be had in this collaboration

00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,079
between hardware and software divide

00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,600
and between groups from various

00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:03,440
industries because sometimes they just

00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,639
don't see the low hanging fruit

00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:08,560
that's just a neighboring field um

00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,160
and we say that you know in open source

00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,720
is very merocratic so

00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,360
uh you know the best technology wins are

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,839
actually

00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,360
it's typically not just one it's it's

00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,040
multitude of technologies

00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,800
it's a connected network of technologies

00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,639
that wins and so

00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,240
we don't view those things like risk

00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:25,360
five and open power we don't really view

00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:29,040
them as

00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,040
conflicting in any way or or

00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,880
competing that we believe that there's

00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:35,279
space to build things

00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,480
and and collaborate and and we say that

00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:39,360
open source lifts

00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,480
all boats because if you really create

00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,199
open source ip

00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,959
if there's real open source collaterals

00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:48,240
coming out of an organization

00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:50,160
it just becomes very easy to build on

00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,800
top of other people's work and reuse

00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,120
repurpose

00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,240
stuff combine and rehash things and

00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,360
we've seen that already

00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,680
a lot of the work we've done for the

00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:00,480
risk 5 foundation is immediately useful

00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:01,839
you know in open power and vice versa

00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,920
there's a lot of

00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:06,959
technological transfer that can happen

00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:09,440
between all those orgs

00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:10,079
and why we joined open powers openware

00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,480
as such

00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:13,600
um so the story is we'd actually worked

00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,759
with the power i say

00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,759
uh some years ago in the automotive

00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,600
context we even had support for that

00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:21,120
in in the early version of what was to

00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,680
become renowned

00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,120
but over time as our focus switched more

00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,000
and more into open source also in

00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,079
hardware

00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
uh we you know we we kind of focused on

00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:33,920
risk five which was the first

00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:36,240
major i say to open source itself and

00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,199
actually open power is kind of coming to

00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,519
this stage and

00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:41,199
like making open source put it really

00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,959
front and central back on our radar

00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:44,800
and also our customers there's some

00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:46,320
great enthusiasm that openpower managed

00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,360
to build around the microwatts and the

00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,800
initial releases

00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,880
and of course this momentum continues

00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:54,079
now with some great and exciting

00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,959
things being announced today um so we

00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:58,160
feel it was

00:16:54,959 --> 00:17:00,240
really a good moment to join and

00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,199
also because cloud and data center are

00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,759
coming increasingly

00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:06,480
more into our focus we started out from

00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:08,720
edge devices but actually today we cover

00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,880
you know all sorts of like cloud-based

00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:13,679
systems continuous integration

00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,039
uh big deployments and so on so so cloud

00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,959
and data center have become

00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:18,799
pretty important for us and with

00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,880
microbot and similar things

00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:22,559
openpower has also been showing that

00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,160
it's not just about data center it's

00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:26,319
also about the other things so

00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,439
i think we've just gone closer together

00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:30,640
i really like this

00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:32,880
uh trend uh so we joined in may and

00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,720
we also added support for the power i

00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,520
say in reno i mean we added it back in a

00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,480
sense

00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,840
and microwave was our first target um i

00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,440
think the most important job that we'll

00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,280
have to do here is really connecting

00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,240
power to this open source ac and fpga

00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,679
ecosystem

00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,440
i mean this already has been happening

00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:48,400
of course but we can actually provide

00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,679
services and

00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,720
help for people to adopt all those great

00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,400
things that are being done

00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,760
and improve them also from the power

00:17:54,400 --> 00:18:00,160
point of view and

00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:03,600
around the topics that power cares about

00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:05,760
um there's uh some challenges

00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,919
that kind of the ecosystem is facing

00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:10,480
that i think open source is helping

00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:11,520
uh fix uh this slide is from the chips

00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,360
alliance presentation

00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,559
i'll actually we're having a summit two

00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,720
days from now

00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:18,240
where uh we'll be discussing you know

00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,000
all sorts of challenges like this

00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,840
and how to fix them and open power is

00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,200
part of that story but the story is

00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,039
broader than that

00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,640
the story is all about kind of how do

00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:27,120
you do open source digital analytic

00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,000
design

00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,720
of chips and fpgas and the challenges

00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,480
are that

00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,840
there are significant costs with latest

00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:37,280
gen technologies there's

00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:38,320
a lot of uh technology that's being kind

00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,080
of stalled and

00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,400
an innovation that's being stifled

00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:44,799
because organizations are pretty

00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,840
old and awkward and don't collaborate

00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:47,600
much

00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:50,080
in this space and also there's you know

00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,400
a need to build more purpose-built stuff

00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,080
but

00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,160
at the same time this need also

00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,400
generates the fear of fragmentation

00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:58,080
so open source becomes the solution to

00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,760
all three of those problems because in

00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,520
in the cost space you can just

00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,440
collaborate to share the costs

00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,280
and i'll show you a few examples later

00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:08,400
on in this presentation

00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,440
um for innovation i think it's

00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,120
especially important

00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,120
i mean open source has allowed us and

00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:15,760
other people to benefit from

00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:17,280
this in incredible energy where people

00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,200
just start collaborating you know on

00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,320
github without really having to ask for

00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,640
permissions

00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:24,400
and and without signing ndas without

00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,720
like royalties and license fees

00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:29,280
and we've really seen some incredible

00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,799
spontaneous activity that just happened

00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,400
uh i mean there's always a reason of

00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:33,840
course but there's some kind of

00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,679
common interest and so on but if you

00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,360
have proprietary stuff in place

00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:39,919
very seldom does this common interest

00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,760
actually trans uh transform into real

00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:43,120
technical work whereas in open source it

00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,880
just becomes very easy to

00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,240
to jump on a train and start working

00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,400
together and

00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,080
the the purpose-built stuff like if you

00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,720
have a methodology that based on open

00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,960
source

00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,000
even if the end result is kind of very

00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,000
specialized

00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,600
uh very often you can find common

00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
elements and open source allows you to

00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,320
do that

00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
much more effectively in contrast if you

00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,400
have proprietary tools

00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,320
very often you know each and every

00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,880
vendor each and every uh

00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,600
type of application has their own little

00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,400
quirky

00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,520
uh tool chain and flow that is very hard

00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,760
to reuse so

00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,880
we think that kind of the the need to

00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,840
build a lot of

00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:22,400
disparate things is solvable by having

00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:25,280
common tools in place

00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:27,120
so what i call uh this journey is a long

00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,679
but hopeful journey towards open source

00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,120
so

00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:30,880
of course it's going to take a while to

00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,679
make this all of this open source but on

00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,960
the other hand

00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:35,600
there's a lot of hope there's a lot of

00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,640
bright spots and and great examples of

00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,799
things we've already been able to

00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:41,600
accomplish so bear with me and i'll try

00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:43,520
to tell you about some of them

00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,280
i think the first stop and kind of

00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,600
really deserving a lot of attention is

00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,159
the

00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,200
sky water pdk it's the first open source

00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:52,480
manufacturable

00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,679
pdk out there it's a 130 nanometer

00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,000
process design kit

00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:57,600
and it can be used to make some

00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,919
practical stuff of course if you're used

00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,080
to

00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:01,360
taping out five nanometer chips then

00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,840
perhaps

00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,039
it's not so much fun for you yet but of

00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,080
course this is just the beginning this

00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:08,720
is just the first

00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:10,640
of a kind and it's a very important

00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,000
milestone because nobody had

00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,960
actually achieved that before it's a

00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,880
collaboration between google and

00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,280
skywater primarily but also a fabulous

00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,559
blue cheetah and micro a big number of

00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:21,679
academic partners

00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:23,840
and chips alliance um and you know

00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:25,520
it's it's kind of important in itself as

00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:28,000
an open source collateral but

00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,520
like was even cooler is that there's a

00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,080
free shuttle run

00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,200
paid for by google that's associated

00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,640
with this pdk

00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,960
where you can actually get your chip

00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,400
taped out in this process

00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,159
assuming that the chip is open source

00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,120
and you comply to some of the rules that

00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:43,760
are kind of

00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,720
sketched for you uh in the in this uh

00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,960
project

00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,480
but uh in reality you know the rules are

00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,720
pretty lacks it's supposed to be

00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:53,520
innovative it's supposed to be creative

00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,559
uh it's supposed to open up chip design

00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:57,520
to groups that

00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:58,640
might have not like necessarily done

00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,360
chips before

00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,760
uh or at least wouldn't have done a chip

00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,480
in this

00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:06,400
this context normally so really you

00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:09,120
should be excited about discover pdk

00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:11,200
and uh there is uh you know if you're

00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,799
not excited about 130 nanometer

00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,559
think that this is just the first step

00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,120
we're going to go to 90 and 45

00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:17,280
nanometers

00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:20,000
at some point and if if you've been

00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:22,320
looking at the a2i github repository

00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,520
you might see that 45 nanometers already

00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,760
in the a2i

00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,120
territory right so you can see that even

00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:30,000
though this generation

00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,400
isn't really ready to build things uh

00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,799
like

00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,000
you know open power is releasing uh at

00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:36,000
least on the high end

00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,440
uh at some point we're actually going to

00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
be able to do this and all of this is

00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,520
going to be

00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:44,480
open source to the metal as we say

00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:46,240
and uh as a nice kind of cherry on top

00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,520
there's a t-shirt giveaway for for

00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,600
people that kind of

00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,280
contribute to the project and and build

00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,080
things there's two types actually one of

00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,400
them is

00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:56,000
for contributors when you actually like

00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,640
improve scouter pdk

00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,720
and you can do this another is for fans

00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,840
i have the fan t-shirt with me today i

00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,520
can show you

00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,600
uh so that's what it looks like i hope

00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:07,760
it's visible that's the

00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,720
that's the back side uh so if you want

00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,080
to get one of those

00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,919
just kind of get involved with us and

00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,840
start working on the skywarp pdk

00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:15,520
uh or just become a fan and you know we

00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:18,720
might be able to to give a t-shirt

00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:20,480
at some future event uh the t-shirt was

00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,919
prepared by micro and google and

00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,880
if you want to contribute just look at

00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:26,000
our guidelines we need a lot of help

00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,840
and especially you should see the

00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,960
incredibly popular talk by tim ansel

00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,039
from google

00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:34,480
from the fosse dial up uh in june i

00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:36,240
believe there's a link here

00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,640
and that talk is a very long deep

00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,360
technical i dive into skyrocket pk so

00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,559
i'm not gonna

00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:44,960
talk about this anymore today

00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:45,760
uh complementing discover pdk in a sense

00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,720
is open road

00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:50,400
that's another eda focused program and

00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,200
that's actually part of the darpa idea

00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,679
program

00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,760
and this is part of chip's alliance

00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:58,559
there's a talk about this on thursday

00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:00,159
um and open road is concerned with

00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:02,880
building a fully open source and

00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:04,159
automated digital design flow and we

00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:07,600
want to have you know

00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:09,360
no human in the loop uh build flow

00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,640
we want to replace humans by machine

00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,600
learning we want to have very quick

00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,679
turnaround

00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,520
and enable like critical innovation

00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:18,400
without having to care about

00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,840
the this entire framework right the

00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,279
framework should be in place and people

00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,600
should be able to innovate on parts of

00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:25,120
it

00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:27,600
and the goal is full like rtl to gds uh

00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:29,679
designs uh it's really incredible and if

00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:31,600
you combine that with scouter pdk

00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:32,799
the name for that is open lane and you

00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,799
can actually build

00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:36,159
a stuff with this flow uh more

00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:37,360
information can be found on github of

00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:38,320
course but this is one of the more

00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:42,080
exciting projects

00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:43,840
of chips alliance now when it comes to

00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:46,240
tools of course they're very important

00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:48,640
but sometimes it's it's

00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,159
as trivial as kind of not having support

00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,159
for the language that you use

00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,919
system verilog has been this historical

00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:55,279
thing that wasn't really well supported

00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:58,640
in open source designs

00:24:55,279 --> 00:25:00,720
and tools so this is no

00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,159
no longer such a big problem google has

00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:05,520
released one parser

00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:07,360
called variable uh it's a full-fledged

00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:09,039
uh assistant real parser that's used at

00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,080
google in the open titan project and

00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:12,400
rescribe dv

00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,919
and some other projects too and we've

00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,240
done quite a lot of development work for

00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:15,440
it

00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,520
of course google is still kind of

00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,440
developing and maintaining it

00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,960
and uh we'd also integrated that with

00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,240
other tools like fusek which i'll

00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,760
describe in a second

00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,520
and you can do linting and formatting of

00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,039
systemverla code easily with that and we

00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,080
have a blog note that describes this

00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:29,279
process

00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,360
so you can go and take a look in our

00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:34,000
blog

00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:35,760
kind of more even more to the point uh

00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,440
for system verilog there's a framework

00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,600
called surelog and uhdm

00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,760
and sherlock is yet another like parser

00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:45,039
but also preprocessor and compiler

00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:46,799
for system verilog including not just

00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:48,320
uh you know not just for linting and

00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:51,440
formatting but actually for

00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:53,679
other purposes too we and we want to use

00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,559
sherlock and uhdm as this kind of

00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:58,159
interop

00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:59,440
layer and it want to enable

00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:01,440
connecting different fronts and

00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,799
back-ends together in a very modular

00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,640
fashion

00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:06,559
and this is developed in collaboration

00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,080
between google and micro

00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:09,679
and so we'll be able to use that for

00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,880
various open source tools we're already

00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:12,720
kind of using this but

00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,000
of course the plan is to make it even

00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,080
more of a standard

00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,679
and you can see a diagram here that's

00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:21,360
our target we want to

00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:23,360
um have a single parsing

00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:25,120
framework for things like yoasu's

00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:27,840
verilater occurs in other

00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:29,760
simulators and and the input languages

00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,039
might in the future be like today we're

00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,559
focusing on system verilog because

00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:34,080
that's not supported well

00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:37,760
but you can imagine plugging in

00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:39,120
different languages like vhdl

00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,960
another project that micros

00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,360
participating in and chips alliance is

00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,000
kind of

00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:45,520
pushing forward is uh implementing

00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,320
verilator

00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,760
support for uvm and other types of

00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,840
verilator improvements

00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,799
but but this is the single biggest

00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,400
effort

00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:56,080
uh if you don't know very later you

00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,919
should it's a very cool

00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,360
fast simulator that outperforms many

00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:01,200
proprietary alternatives

00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,960
it's really developing fast now with

00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,440
somewhere from wilson snyder the author

00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:07,760
i mean one of the original authors the

00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:10,080
fossil community and chips lines

00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:12,159
and we're spearheading that development

00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,600
adding this uvm capability it's it's a

00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:16,799
long way ahead of us but

00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:19,600
we're making good progress

00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:20,000
and in the system rock space uh we know

00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,000
we're not

00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,120
just kind of blindly hacking things

00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,760
together we actually have

00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:27,679
a system relock test suite in place that

00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:30,159
allows us to test a variety of

00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:32,080
open source tools against different

00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:33,520
kinds of system verily designs

00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,440
uh of course there's a bunch of risk

00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:38,000
five cores there's a bunch of other

00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,559
kinds of device designs uh there's a

00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,760
huge

00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:42,320
um test suite for the entire uh system

00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,520
verilog

00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:48,159
uh language spec uh so i encourage you

00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:50,960
to go and take a look at this test suite

00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:51,840
that's what it looks like in a bigger

00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,600
zoom

00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:57,279
uh you can see a bunch of tests on the

00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,279
left a bunch of tools on top

00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:02,399
okay uh so going on to more like ip

00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,880
oriented part

00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:06,399
uh i i wanted to highlight lidex which

00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:09,679
is a really cool

00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:11,120
ecosystem of ips mostly for fpgas but

00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:12,559
actually we're also thinking about it in

00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,000
the asic context and i'll tell you a

00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:16,159
little bit about that in a second

00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,159
as you can see there's a huge amount of

00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:21,360
ips there there's a lot of

00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:23,039
great things you can build of litex and

00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,720
actually microwave has been integrated

00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:26,799
with litex

00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,960
levering some of those ips there there's

00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:30,320
a lot of cpu options of course including

00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,600
microwatts

00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:34,080
but the the great thing about this

00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:36,640
framework is that it allows you to build

00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,520
all sorts of frameworks that uh are very

00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,880
modular

00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,799
and it's also the important thing to

00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,799
know this is very well supported

00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:45,039
in things like zephyr and linux and

00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:47,200
simulators like renault and verilater

00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:48,480
and also open source fpga tools like sim

00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,120
flow so that

00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,559
if you if you kind of use litex which we

00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,559
encourage and we kind of implement that

00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:57,760
for a lot of customers

00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:58,960
you'll get a very portable framework to

00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:02,000
do things in

00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,440
um so go ahead and check it out

00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,600
and one thing that needs particular

00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,399
mention here is an open source dram

00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:09,440
controller

00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:11,440
that we're developing it's actually the

00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,320
best in class you know open source ddr3

00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,919
and iv

00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:17,600
drum controller for fpgas and uh

00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:19,760
a lot of development is going into it

00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,880
right now both from and micro and its

00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:24,000
creator florence

00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:25,200
karmarek and uh currently we're also

00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,799
working on making this

00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,320
capable of you know being built in an

00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:30,880
asic

00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,679
again some way ahead of us to to get

00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,480
that but

00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:35,120
it's definitely a worthwhile endeavor

00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,840
and

00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:39,679
also excited our plans to use like dram

00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,159
as an experimentation platform for

00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:43,679
research

00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:45,039
into dram in general so

00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:46,480
yeah i encourage you to take a look at

00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:47,919
light dram it's a really great example

00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,360
of an open source ip that's

00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:51,279
you know really enable a lot of

00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:54,880
different

00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:57,039
ideas and use cases uh reno this and

00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,880
micros framework actually for simulation

00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:00,080
uh so we're going somewhere in between

00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,039
you know a hardware and software

00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:04,399
development

00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:07,360
and possibly fpgas i explained on second

00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:08,080
renode lets you rapidly create different

00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,559
kinds of

00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:12,159
software and you can debug and test

00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:13,440
things very easily

00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:15,360
an important thing to know is that you

00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,360
can simulate not just like a cpu but

00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:19,679
also sensors and ips and

00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,840
different kinds of protocols and

00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:23,600
networking

00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:25,279
mediums so you can really test real

00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,720
world systems

00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:28,720
and it's been used for things like

00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,679
porting operating systems doing ci

00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,799
machine learning testing and

00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:32,640
benchmarking i'm going to tell you a

00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:34,080
little bit about this in a second

00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,760
and also for example horror software

00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,000
code development and the next slide is

00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,480
about

00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,399
that so a lot of people have actually

00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,919
used renaud in a context that initially

00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:44,399
we didn't really kind of

00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:45,760
give pay a lot of attention to but

00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:47,120
increasingly is becoming a very

00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,559
important use case

00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,080
first of all we have the ability to

00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:51,279
co-simulate stuff with verilator and

00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,799
physical hardware which gives us the

00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:54,799
ability to kind of simulate

00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:55,919
some things fast because renald is an

00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:58,159
instruction set

00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:59,600
fast simulator and some things kind of

00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:01,200
in more detail because

00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:03,039
we might not have a simulation model for

00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,880
it and since we have a lot of

00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:06,559
configuration capabilities and we can

00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:08,000
extend using plugins

00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:09,840
uh it becomes very easy to like

00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,600
prototype things and and just

00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:13,519
quicker to build things in reno than

00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,559
otherwise we have some examples from our

00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:16,559
customers where

00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:18,159
they could build things much faster with

00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:19,600
reno than they could in hdl

00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:20,960
so they actually ended up prototyping

00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,679
renault and then when they found the

00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,679
right mix

00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:24,960
they would go back to hdl and and do the

00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:27,919
rest of the work

00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,919
um and we can do execution hooks and

00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:32,159
find game control of execution

00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:33,600
and we can do custom instructions as

00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:35,360
hooks and plug-ins so

00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,519
it's really extendable and of course it

00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:40,399
supports light x and open power so

00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:42,960
it's a good starting point for your

00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:44,880
development on on power

00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,000
and the thing that renode allows you to

00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,080
do is writing

00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,080
tests in a pythonic framework called

00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:51,600
robot actually you can do other types of

00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,120
test frameworks too but this is the one

00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:55,360
we we support pretty well

00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,799
we can generate very fancy reports uh of

00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:58,240
course this one is you know everything

00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:00,159
passed but

00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,519
the the one where things don't pass is

00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:03,919
more red

00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:06,240
um and then we can also build like whole

00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:07,840
dashboards of various kinds of binaries

00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,360
and demos that we test so this is a

00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,720
dashboard that we're working in

00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,880
the public dashboards of different

00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,720
firmwares that we're testing in reno'd

00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,240
and and we'll be publishing some

00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:20,480
collaterals like binaries

00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:21,760
that we know are working in reno's

00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,840
and if you want to really kind of try

00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,559
out reno quickly just go to collab to

00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,919
this link

00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:27,679
and you can actually run it in the cloud

00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:29,360
because it's very easy to install

00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:31,039
so you can probably if you take a look

00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,799
at the screenshot you'll see

00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:34,480
that's what you need to do to install it

00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:35,279
on a vanilla machine and then you can

00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,600
actually run

00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:38,880
a tensorflow lite pipeline with some

00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:41,279
machine learning

00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,559
stuff in the cloud completely in the

00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:43,519
cloud without hardware

00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:45,519
it's pretty exciting it's a

00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:46,240
collaboration of google and other

00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:48,720
parties

00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:50,080
uh and uh i must say this is really

00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,200
developing very nicely it's kind of

00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:54,720
showcasing how

00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:57,440
renowned enables great stuff

00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:59,200
moving on directly to fpgas now um i

00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:02,080
wanted to highlight symbiflow which is

00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:03,600
a fully open source fpga tool chain and

00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,880
it's really making rapid strides

00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:07,039
i think the one thing that needs to

00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,559
shout out is quick logic's participation

00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:11,360
these guys did the first vendor

00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:12,159
supported tool chain so they actually

00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,799
kind of paid us

00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:15,200
and to develop a tool sheet for them and

00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:18,720
uh

00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:20,799
this really kind of helps to

00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,320
get a leading position in the in the

00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:24,720
space and since quick logic actually

00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:26,399
sells efpga right you can you can buy

00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,840
the fpga fabric from them

00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:29,760
which will be supported in open source

00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:31,200
tools like you could be building your

00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:33,840
next generation chip

00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,880
with some fpga capabilities supported by

00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,559
open source tooling

00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,320
supported by the vendor which is like

00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:40,960
again a historical first

00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:41,600
uh you know really great guys we've done

00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,919
a lot of

00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,799
work with them also for reno'd and

00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:47,679
zephyr and

00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:48,159
and other uh things they've really gone

00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:50,399
all in

00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:51,919
on the open source mentality and we we

00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:52,799
kind of encourage other people to do so

00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:55,200
too

00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:56,240
and and and what simple does it makes

00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,000
fpga development much more

00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,600
software-centric and collaborative

00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,440
especially for research and prototyping

00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,799
like even if you're not really into fpga

00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,640
but you're doing asics

00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:06,240
this is really important for you because

00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:08,320
if you want to kind of

00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,919
rapidly prototype basic stuff you're

00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:12,960
going to use fpgas anyway and

00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:14,639
uh simbufo is kind of made for that we

00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,399
have already some good results for some

00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:18,399
niche applications

00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:19,520
which are not supported by the vendor

00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:21,760
tool chains

00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:24,079
and and we we plan to make fpgas more

00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:26,079
mundane like you know you have gcc for

00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:27,440
code we want to be the gcc for code

00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:29,359
where you don't think about compiling

00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,280
things you just compile them

00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:33,280
and we want to make fpgas part of future

00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:35,359
socs without hassle

00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,480
go to simple guitar io and take a look

00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:38,159
we have a pretty fancy

00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,679
website that's what it look like and

00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,720
that's also the support for different

00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:42,240
families right now

00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:44,240
the designs this lattice there's quick

00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:45,679
logic there's of course unofficial

00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:47,359
support for other things too there's

00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:49,200
in-progress support for a lot of

00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:51,679
the devices but these ones are kind of

00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:53,440
pretty well supported

00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:55,520
if you recognize some of these boards

00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,879
out there

00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:59,839
then there's a high chance you can

00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:03,040
actually use simulfo today

00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:03,359
okay and simple can also do vgl now you

00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,599
can

00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:06,400
use a plugin that kind of runs through

00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:08,720
ghdl

00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,640
that's that's how you do that and yeah

00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:12,320
you can get a design from vhdl too

00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,280
because our primary focus is very long

00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,880
normally but

00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,440
there's no reason why vhdl should not be

00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:19,440
possible

00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:21,359
moving on towards the end of this part

00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:23,040
uh there's also

00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:25,040
little tools that really help you out a

00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:26,400
few sock needle eyes are two tools made

00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:29,520
up by all of kingren

00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,000
that help you like to create and reuse

00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,000
fpga

00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,200
designs you can reuse cores you can

00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,720
create some kind of

00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,960
runtime configurations compile

00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,680
configurations you can port things very

00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,760
easily

00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:41,119
you can let people reuse your code and

00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,480
set up ci very easily

00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:45,040
and i'll show you in a second how use

00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:48,720
utilize to actually do that very well

00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:49,680
so these kind of little tools out there

00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,680
really help to

00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,800
pull the ecosystem together and increase

00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,560
reuse and

00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,920
fusek has been adopted very widely by

00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:58,079
the community

00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:00,240
and we helped achieve that as well we we

00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:02,640
kind of contribute to it regularly

00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,359
and the flow is kind of portrayed in

00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,960
this

00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:06,640
picture where you have a core library

00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,640
that fetches stuff from storage

00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,839
it might then github might be on gitlab

00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:13,280
might be some local

00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:15,040
repository you tell it to run a kind of

00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,640
a simulation for example and the manager

00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,000
just fetches the right course with the

00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:20,880
right order and write

00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,599
dependencies and then edelice just goes

00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,320
and

00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:25,680
transforms this into a specific project

00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:27,760
for a specific tool

00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:30,480
which might be a very later simulation

00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:33,920
or you know quartus

00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,920
synthesis and placing route

00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:38,000
we also have a tool for measuring

00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:41,359
performance of pgas it's a tool by

00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,640
micro to kind of show how your designs

00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:44,160
progress over time whether you're

00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,920
getting better or worse

00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:48,000
we have nice facilities to measure you

00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,480
know resources usage and runtime and so

00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,400
on

00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,520
it uses ether light so it's a nice

00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,000
illustration of how

00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:54,640
utilize is very useful part of simple

00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,320
suite

00:36:54,640 --> 00:37:01,280
and i also encourage you to try it out

00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,920
okay summarizing hopefully i've been

00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,920
able to

00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,839
show you that there's a lot of progress

00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,560
so i would say that the outlook is very

00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:07,680
sunny

00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,599
but then again you should bring a

00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:11,359
developer just in case you know uh in

00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:14,480
case it rains and you have to

00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:16,800
fix things up uh definitely we have

00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:18,320
uh incredible progress but there's a lot

00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,800
of legacy there's a lot of links we were

00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,200
fighting

00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:23,040
there's a lot of mentality problems also

00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,960
a lot of kind of things that are secret

00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,240
just because not not because there's a

00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,000
reason

00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:29,359
and so far we've been very successful

00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,240
we've actually managed to reach as far

00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:32,000
as the pdk

00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:35,200
so i'm joking that the sky water is the

00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,200
limit and

00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:39,119
i think that power could really play a

00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:41,280
vital role in this ecosystem because if

00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:43,440
if it aligns well with those efforts if

00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:45,359
it kind of learns how to benefit

00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:46,800
from all those rapid developments and

00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:48,800
this collaboration

00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,640
i think that power with its established

00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:53,680
brand it's established

00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:57,040
ecosystem and it's it's kind of

00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:59,839
uh good support in the server space

00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:01,119
is a really valuable player and that's

00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:02,800
what we want to enable that's

00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:04,720
what we want to provide services for

00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:07,920
that's kind of how we

00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:09,200
envision openpower kind of leveraging

00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:12,800
this

00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:14,880
ecosystem and the last thing i wanted to

00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:17,200
say is to invite you over to the chips

00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:20,000
lines workshop this is taking place

00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:20,400
on thursday and uh i'm going to have a

00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,839
talk

00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,760
about enabling fully open source and

00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:25,680
continuation during flows in asian fpga

00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,960
development

00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,400
which will present the progress of the

00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,680
tools working group it'll be a little

00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,160
bit more technical but

00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:33,200
of course a bit similar to this one and

00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,640
i encourage you to

00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,240
to join because there's a lot of awesome

00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,520
speakers including some open power

00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:40,480
foundation members like

00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:41,760
google east berkeley and there's also

00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,520
what i mentioned before

00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,800
talks about open road and symbiflow

00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,760
hopefully i got you interested in those

00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,079
projects who will come

00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:50,400
and and listen to those talks and learn

00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:52,400
more check out the schedule for more

00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,839
and yeah i invite you to the chip

00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:57,040
science workshop later but

00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:58,640
today of course i invite you to see the

00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:00,160
all the excited stuff exciting stuff

00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:01,040
that the openpower foundation has

00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,880
prepared

00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:04,160
for this event i'm really dying to see

00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:15,839
this

00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:15,839
thank you very much thanks for attention

00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:25,599
thank you michael uh and now for our

00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:28,320
next keynote speaker

00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:29,680
uh alan cantell he is the ceo of nala

00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,680
sway

00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:34,960
and the new technical director of the

00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,960
opencapi consortium

00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:40,400
hi everyone i'm going to talk to you

00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:41,839
today about opencapi

00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,560
i plan to give you a better

00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:47,760
understanding of the reason for needing

00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:49,599
a new memory fabric and then highlight

00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:52,720
opencap's strengths

00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:55,200
for a pure data-centric world so let's

00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:57,760
start with the basics

00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:58,640
we all recognize this cpu-centric uh

00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:01,680
architecture

00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:04,560
so much so it's a generational religion

00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:06,640
we have the memory bus which is latency

00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:09,520
critical in bandwidth critical

00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:11,280
the processor interconnect buses they

00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:12,960
are all proprietary

00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:15,440
that are latency critical environment

00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:17,119
critical then we have storage attach

00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,480
which is more latency tolerant and

00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:20,960
bandwidth tolerant

00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,520
and finally we have the network attached

00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,000
which is

00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:25,839
frequently latency relaxed and bandwidth

00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:29,040
critical

00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:30,960
so essentially we've got um

00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:32,720
as an analogy the internal combustion

00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:36,880
engine car is a very similar

00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:39,599
thing it's been around for decades and

00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:40,480
it's really uh it is great at what it

00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:42,480
does and and

00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:44,480
often you don't need to change it

00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,440
however we've seen this data centric

00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:48,480
shift

00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:50,560
uh going on over the last 15 years or so

00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:52,560
where we've got memory memory memory in

00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:55,200
a cpu-centric world

00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:56,240
what i mean by that is well essentially

00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:59,200
with the

00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:01,359
the interconnect bus is a coherent

00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:04,240
memory interconnect to start with

00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:06,640
we're seeing that storage is becoming

00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:09,520
persistent memory more so

00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:11,760
as we go forward and we're even seeing

00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:15,040
that we're remotely connecting memory

00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:16,720
over the network so a better way to

00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:19,040
represent this would be these different

00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:20,480
buses just connecting to memory memory

00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:23,599
memory

00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:27,280
in a in a way this blend of this

00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:28,960
data centric and cpu-centric world is a

00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:33,040
bit like a hybrid electric

00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:34,800
uh gas car such as the toyota prius

00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:36,240
and let's face it that the prius has

00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,160
been around for 20 years

00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:39,440
it made a lot of sense it's a good way

00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:42,640
to evolve

00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:44,880
from one world to to the next

00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:46,720
but we shouldn't forget that there are

00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,599
several compromises that we have to put

00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:50,319
up with

00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:50,960
we have complex logic translations going

00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:54,079
on between

00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:55,839
all these different buses and it's a

00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:58,240
really a wasteful use of the i o

00:41:55,839 --> 00:42:01,040
resources on on the processors

00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:02,720
and um and not only that if we look at

00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:05,119
the uh the cost of our

00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,760
seat of our data centric servers these

00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:08,079
days

00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:09,280
we find we're spending the vast majority

00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:10,560
of the money on the memory

00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:12,720
infrastructure

00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:14,400
and very little relatively speaking on

00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:16,319
this on on the processor

00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:19,119
so really we're getting to a situation

00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:21,599
where the tail is wagging the dog

00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:22,160
so ideally we'd like to converge these

00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:24,000
memories

00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:26,160
and put them all together into a tiered

00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,040
memory infrastructure on one new memory

00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:29,440
bus

00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:30,880
and we need to get the best of all the

00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,880
performance we need is the lowest

00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:34,720
possible latency still high bandwidth

00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:36,480
and really scalable

00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:38,880
and we shouldn't forget that the memory

00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:41,280
is not existent in a single point it is

00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:44,000
certainly a data plane continuum

00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:45,680
you know one nanosecond per to 134

00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,440
milliseconds for light to travel around

00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:50,079
the world so we need to take this

00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:53,359
into account in our system and us in our

00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:55,440
seat in our data centric world

00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:57,359
but what about the pci bus it's a

00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:58,000
peripheral component interconnect we're

00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:00,480
increasingly

00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,680
seeing peripherals being absorbed into

00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:04,800
the cpu

00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:06,560
and that becoming more of an soc device

00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:08,240
and really even the ethernet now is

00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:10,400
becoming directly coupled

00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:13,040
uh into the processor so we're looking

00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:16,480
at systems on a chip cpu rather than

00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:18,880
purely just a cpu and the pci

00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:19,680
is becoming a legacy bus which is all

00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:22,000
very well

00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:23,520
but one thing we shouldn't do is we we

00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,839
shouldn't compromise our new memory

00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:28,160
buses latency critical memory bus with

00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:31,839
unnecessary legacy support we really

00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:31,839
need to keep that clean

00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:39,119
so pulling that all together we get this

00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:42,720
data centric core building block

00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:43,040
a really clean slate when we really look

00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:46,240
at

00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:47,520
data centric purely and don't worry

00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:49,520
about legacy

00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:51,920
a bit like an electric car it looks

00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:54,400
really pure and open cappy

00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:56,319
is that new memory bus it offers this

00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:59,280
lowest possible latency high bandwidth

00:43:56,319 --> 00:43:59,280
and it's very scalable

00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:04,400
so but what about other processors

00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:07,359
accelerators

00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:08,000
um we've got peer processors i i tend to

00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:11,119
call them peer

00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,880
processors or soc variants

00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:15,040
and they come in the different flavors

00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:18,560
cpu and gpu

00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:20,240
and and fpga and ai really you can

00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:22,319
categorize them into two separate

00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:24,160
categories latency critical really

00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:26,000
volume and processors

00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:28,000
and you've got to get over that volume

00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,760
and bottleneck and hence the coherence

00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,079
critical part of this

00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:34,480
and then the ai and fpga are more

00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:35,680
latency relaxed streaming processors

00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:37,680
and they're often used for data

00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:39,760
reduction filtering functions and

00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:41,839
coherence is frequently unnecessary

00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:44,480
unless you've got a tightly coupled

00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:47,359
accelerators or cpu trying to accelerate

00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:47,359
a single thread

00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:52,000
so putting that all together we end up

00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:55,359
with

00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:57,520
a distributed um memory

00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:59,119
data plane and all the all the different

00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,760
processors attached to it so really

00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:02,560
we've got a

00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:05,200
heterogeneous distributed uh computing

00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:06,319
going on here and we can see this really

00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,920
at the rack scale

00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:09,359
or all the way up to the data center

00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,839
scale and it would look something like

00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:12,560
this

00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:14,400
but we can now see that this is truly

00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:17,440
data centric in our thinking

00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:19,280
of how to represent this and

00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:21,520
increasingly if we look at the the

00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:22,079
buzzwords around we've got the cloud the

00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:24,960
edge

00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:25,920
and the intelligent iot internet of

00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,839
things

00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:30,079
and i've just highlighted here that

00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:31,359
often with so much data coming from the

00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:34,560
iot

00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:36,800
like cctv cameras etc

00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:38,640
you often want to just filter out the

00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:40,880
information that you need and only offer

00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,520
that to your your data plane continuum

00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,520
like maybe

00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:44,800
extracting faces from video or number

00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:46,480
plates etc

00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,920
rather than sending all of the video

00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:50,319
into into your

00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:51,599
into your memory structures and that's

00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:53,839
often driven by

00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:55,760
the comms bandwidths available or the

00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:57,599
cost management that you've got

00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:59,119
so really we're talking about a generic

00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:00,640
system level domain specific

00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:02,960
architecture here

00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:06,160
and this is an area that i specialize in

00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:09,040
with my consulting company narsway

00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:10,720
so here this is really the the core

00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:14,160
building block we should think of

00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:17,200
as we go forward with computing

00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:19,760
so great concept but the reality

00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:23,520
well the reality is that open cappy is a

00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:25,599
production ready memory fabric today

00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:28,560
open cappy is the third generation it

00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:31,839
was just deployed in 2014

00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:32,640
um the openpower initiative focused on

00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:34,480
data centric

00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:35,680
open community innovation right from the

00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:38,480
very start

00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:40,319
so we've we've been looking at the pure

00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:41,040
data centric approach all the way back

00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:43,920
then

00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:45,200
this is not just a spec that's yet to be

00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:47,280
fundraised

00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:49,280
we're so that we've had a lot of work in

00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:52,079
progress a lot of learning a

00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:54,079
good few mistakes on the way and uh but

00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:56,800
but we're here today with a really

00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:58,640
effective bus and uh and it's showing

00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:00,640
lots of promise

00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:02,400
the open cap e5 is fundamentally an

00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:03,920
eight transit relay bus with a few

00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:06,079
sideband signals

00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:08,160
um 25 gigabits per second has been in

00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:10,240
production since 2018 and introduced

00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:12,319
with power 9.

00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:14,160
and it's a highly focused it's the only

00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:15,760
bus that's highly focused on the lowest

00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:18,000
possible latency in point-to-point

00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:21,359
interconnect

00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,559
um opencapi is also introduced this open

00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:24,960
memory interface

00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:26,800
omi differential dimms that were

00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:29,440
introduced in 2019

00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:29,920
and in my view this is a game changer a

00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:33,520
piece of

00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:36,000
of the open cappy infrastructure

00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:37,760
so putting that pictorially what's in

00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,520
production today the power nine and the

00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:41,119
zonex fpgas

00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:42,559
and we've got this open cappy

00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:45,599
interconnect and

00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:48,000
uh and and and the memory sharing

00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:50,160
going on here additionally there's been

00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:54,079
a lot of work going on in the fpgas

00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:55,839
called open acceleration framework ocxl

00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:58,079
which really brings the open cappy

00:47:55,839 --> 00:48:00,079
framework in the fpga to connect memory

00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:02,079
and external networks into it

00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:03,440
and also make it much more easy to

00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:05,760
program uh

00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:07,040
your your your fpga with your

00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:10,079
application in c

00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:11,359
or hdl and on the software side we've

00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:15,040
got the software stack

00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:15,040
uh including python support

00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:21,119
when oh i should say that the oc

00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:21,520
excel there's a presentation at 10 35

00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:23,760
a.m

00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:25,760
central time on track 2a to give you

00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:29,280
more details on this

00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:31,839
um and then we've got the uh the ddin

00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:33,119
the rmid dim microchip actually made a

00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:35,200
buffer chip

00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:37,200
um and that's got less than ten nine

00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:38,160
seconds latency adder over a standard

00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:40,720
arduin

00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:42,800
uh in terms of uh you know keeping that

00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:43,680
that memory channel is efficient as

00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:46,640
possible

00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:49,119
for the processors and today we can

00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:51,359
actually connect these rmid limbs into

00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:53,599
the fpga fabric

00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:56,160
to really amplify the memory bandwidth

00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:58,960
of the fpga fabric

00:48:56,160 --> 00:49:01,119
and to that end uh oscar menstrual from

00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:03,839
max ella will be given a lightening talk

00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:05,599
on fpga application acceleration of

00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:07,599
memory bound problems

00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:09,920
with omi it's going to be at the birds

00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:13,839
of a fairer panel session at 1 20 p.m

00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:15,760
central time today on track 2a again

00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:17,520
the key thing to take away here is all

00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:17,839
of this i've just i've just talked about

00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:20,800
is

00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:21,920
is all the rtl in the software is proven

00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:24,640
and fully open

00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:24,640
open sourced

00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:31,200
so um looking a bit more into the

00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:33,119
hardware the power nine systems that

00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:37,359
support open cap e3

00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:39,280
include the ibm ac 922 platform

00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:41,440
which was number one in number two in

00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:42,319
the top 500 supercomputers for the last

00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:44,760
few years

00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:45,920
until recently and then we've got the

00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:48,240
ic922

00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:49,440
for bringing in storage dense servers in

00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:52,559
an ai

00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:53,280
uh production now which also supports

00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:55,520
the open cap

00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:56,960
free so we've got some good good server

00:49:55,520 --> 00:50:00,400
level products supporting the

00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:01,599
the open cappy environment on the fpga

00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:04,079
accelerator front

00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:05,200
we've got a multitude of of offerings uh

00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:08,240
from alpha data

00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:09,599
and bitwear focuses on all acceleration

00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:12,400
use cases

00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:14,160
bit wares is more focused around the uh

00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:16,319
the storage the different medias and

00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:18,079
attaching them to opencapi

00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:19,680
to bring the different meters in from

00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:22,960
zenand uh and

00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:26,160
and and nand devices whereas alpha data

00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:29,200
is focusing more on the larger fpgas

00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:30,720
which also include the hbm memory on on

00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:32,720
package

00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:34,240
um and i'm delighted to say that uh

00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:36,480
craig petrie from bit where we'll be

00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:39,280
giving a lightning talk at the birds of

00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:41,680
a fever panel session at 120 central

00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:45,680
again on track 2a

00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:45,680
so i encourage you to come along to that

00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:50,559
so with all of that infrastructure we've

00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:53,040
got uh for quite a while now we've got

00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:55,040
some quite a few success stories here

00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:56,480
and i won't go into them in details if

00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:58,960
you look in the in

00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:00,640
in the in the agenda you will see these

00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:01,520
different tracks which will give you

00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:03,839
some

00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:06,839
good examples of what you can do with

00:51:03,839 --> 00:51:09,040
the with this with this open cappy

00:51:06,839 --> 00:51:10,880
framework

00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:13,599
going back to the open capy memory

00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:15,599
interface in a little bit more detail

00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:18,720
really what we're trying to do with with

00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:21,280
uh omi is we're trying to hurt the diver

00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:22,000
divergent memory choices because now

00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:23,440
everything

00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,960
can be treated as memory and we're

00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:25,920
wanting to increasingly treat it as

00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:28,480
memory

00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:29,040
um and and so therefore we have to we

00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:31,760
have to

00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:32,559
colonize these these interconnects the

00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:34,319
trades

00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:37,119
between these which ones you choose for

00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:39,280
your system are quite a multitude depth

00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:41,920
versus latency versus bandwidth versus

00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:43,440
persistence versus power versus cost

00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:45,119
and depending on which one you choose

00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:46,240
you'll get a different balance of those

00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:48,400
factors

00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:49,680
they all have their own unique

00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:51,839
interfaces

00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:53,440
not one of them is really compatible but

00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:55,839
compatible with the other

00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:58,160
and so omi is really trying to normalize

00:51:55,839 --> 00:52:02,000
that memory those memory interfaces

00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:02,240
and for now uh whilst uh we we can use

00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,920
no

00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:06,640
mi memory buffer for these different

00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:09,520
interfaces and that's what we're doing

00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:10,960
so obviously the ddr4 omid it's the

00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:13,280
critical one to get in place and the

00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:14,960
latency is is pretty damn fundamental on

00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:16,720
that one

00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:19,040
and that's available today from smart

00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:22,319
modular samsung and micron

00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:24,559
and bitwear's 250 hms has given us

00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:26,079
access to low latency nand on the

00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:29,280
opencapi bus

00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:31,200
and uh bit whereas 250 soc is also

00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:32,000
uranus access on the opencapi bus to

00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:35,680
nand

00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:37,359
uh via nvme storage so we have

00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:38,720
we've covered a good few of the bases

00:52:37,359 --> 00:52:42,240
here um

00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:43,599
and uh also if if that with the emerging

00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,960
memory that's coming out there is an

00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:46,559
opportunity for these

00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:48,000
these companies to actually support

00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:50,480
natively omi

00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:53,839
on their devices which will be a nice a

00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:53,839
nice change moving forward

00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:58,640
so but why you know why omi what is the

00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:01,680
omi advantage over

00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:03,680
other approaches um you know one is it

00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:04,079
exists in production today so that's a

00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:06,240
pretty

00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:07,760
compelling one but the key thing here is

00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:09,920
you're getting memory bandwidth and

00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:12,240
depth at low cost

00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:14,800
and so the way i'm showing this is this

00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:16,160
is the power 10 die and i'm representing

00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:18,240
it by how much uh

00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:19,920
you can get how much memory bandwidth

00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:22,319
you can get on the i o edge

00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:24,640
so there's eight omi interface fives on

00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:26,960
the left edge and eight on the right

00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:28,800
and it takes up 12.7 millimeters of the

00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:30,319
die this is all to scale that i'm going

00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:31,599
to show you and they're all based on

00:53:30,319 --> 00:53:36,400
seven nanometer

00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:39,040
uh process nodes the amd epic rom io die

00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:39,839
has has ddr4 memory channels at either

00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:42,480
end

00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:43,520
and so it has four memory channels uh at

00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:45,920
one end

00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:47,680
and you can see it's slightly bigger

00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:50,559
edge area for those four channels

00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:53,599
compared to the eight lmi channels

00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:54,400
similarly on the uh nvidia ampere device

00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:58,400
it's got uh

00:53:54,400 --> 00:54:01,119
six hp two channels and one hbm

00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:02,240
is is is slightly smaller than the eight

00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:05,280
oh my

00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:08,240
five channels are on the power 10

00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:09,520
again seven nanometers but to really

00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:11,440
compare these we need to look at the

00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:11,760
gigabytes per second of those channels

00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:14,319
so

00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:15,760
four ddr4s is about 100 gigabytes per

00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:17,920
second on the epic

00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:18,800
we're getting 400 gigabytes per second

00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:22,079
out of the eight

00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:25,040
omega channels and we're getting 311

00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:27,599
gigabytes per second out of the hbm2

00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:28,319
channel so when we look at it is a

00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:33,119
gigabyte

00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:35,440
per second per millimeter uh parameter

00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:36,319
of edge of edge die you can see that

00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:40,079
open cappy

00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:41,839
really does the lmi that really does win

00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:43,760
on all categories significantly

00:54:41,839 --> 00:54:47,680
bandwidth voice over ddr4

00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:50,839
and surprisingly faster than the hbn2

00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:52,000
um which is really quite quite quite a

00:54:50,839 --> 00:54:54,960
surprise

00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,640
and when it comes to depth it there is

00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:59,760
just no contest

00:54:56,640 --> 00:55:02,880
uh so it with dram uh the

00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:04,400
the the the power 9 is more than 2x of

00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:07,119
ddr4

00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:08,640
and uh compared to the hbm it's

00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:10,319
significantly greater because you're

00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:13,760
limited in capacity because

00:55:10,319 --> 00:55:15,760
it's on package memory and lmi goes even

00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:16,799
further with different media types other

00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:20,000
than ddr4

00:55:16,799 --> 00:55:23,200
like the 250 hms you can get to 1.9

00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:27,040
terabytes per millimeter or greater

00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:27,440
so this really is as compelling as it

00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:29,520
gets

00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:30,640
in my entire career i've not seen

00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:33,280
anything more compelling

00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:33,839
and it's in production today so it

00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:38,000
merely

00:55:33,839 --> 00:55:40,799
is a no-brainer to adopt this technology

00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:42,079
so we're not talking this is no concept

00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:44,079
this is reality

00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:45,599
open cappy is connecting the memory data

00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:47,839
plane continuum

00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:49,119
and uh we can see it with power nine and

00:55:47,839 --> 00:55:51,119
soon to come power ten

00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:52,799
and the zones ultra scale fpgas and

00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:53,760
their anniversary ones coming down the

00:55:52,799 --> 00:55:56,880
pipe

00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:59,040
so really i call to action here

00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:59,920
put your processor here or your memory

00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:02,559
here

00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:04,160
in this this this fabric this is

00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:04,559
definitely the best way to go if you

00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:06,079
want

00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:08,079
if you want to shine with with the

00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:10,960
technology you're offering

00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:14,160
and remember all the open cap in omi rtl

00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:16,880
and software is proven and open sourced

00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:17,200
so in is our journey though is still

00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:19,200
just

00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:20,799
really beginning please join the open

00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:22,559
cafe and contribute back into our

00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:26,640
community

00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:28,559
in in summary we do have this

00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:30,799
hybrid world that we've come from it's

00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:32,880
been around for 15 years

00:56:30,799 --> 00:56:34,160
um hybrids are not going to well on the

00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:36,880
electric on the

00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:38,720
on the hybrid car front and so maybe

00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:39,760
we've got a few more years left in this

00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:43,040
approach

00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:44,799
um but one thing's for sure

00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:46,799
is the purity of the data centric

00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:48,559
approach is really a no-brainer for

00:56:46,799 --> 00:56:49,040
high-performance computing applications

00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:51,440
today

00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:53,440
an absolute no-brainer and the only

00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:56,000
thing i'd ask you to take away

00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:57,760
is whichever camp you you sit in the

00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:01,200
hybrid camp or the pure

00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:03,680
the pure camp of data centric computing

00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:06,000
really look at your problems consider

00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:07,760
this data centric template for your next

00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,599
domain specific architecture and if you

00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:12,079
look at your problem from this

00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:13,760
light you will be able to come to the

00:57:12,079 --> 00:57:16,400
correct conclusions as to

00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:16,960
what is the best way to to to build your

00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:20,000
computing

00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:22,000
architectures so thank you very much

00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,599
may i encourage you all to come along to

00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,040
the birth of a favorite panel session

00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:29,040
that i will be chairing

00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:31,680
at 120 central time and track 2a

00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:31,680
thank you again

00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:42,480
thank you alan and now for our last

00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:44,559
keynote speaker uh mendi furmanic

00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:46,480
she is the director of power open

00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:49,200
hardware business development

00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:51,119
and the president of the openpower

00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:54,559
foundation

00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:57,920
uh and she'll be showing a quick video

00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:57,920
on ibm

00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:09,839
so please welcome mindy

00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:32,079
ibm power

00:58:33,359 --> 00:58:36,880
beginning as an ibm research project in

00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:39,040
the 1970s

00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:40,640
ibm power cpus have been helping

00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:43,680
organizations of all sizes

00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:43,680
innovate for decades

00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:47,040
reduced instruction set computing or

00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:50,480
risk

00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:52,880
pioneered by ibm improve now with a

00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:55,280
second generation of risk

00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:57,200
the power architecture performance

00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:58,720
optimization with enhanced risk

00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:00,319
we believe we were making a more

00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:02,160
advanced risk machine

00:59:00,319 --> 00:59:04,240
and we did whatever we thought was

00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:06,880
necessary to get the best possible cost

00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:06,880
performance

00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:14,960
[Applause]

00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:15,920
development watson what is executor

00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:20,480
right

00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:20,480
same category 1600 answer

00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:26,160
ibm power based cpus can be found in the

00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:28,240
smartest ai supercomputers in the world

00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:30,480
game consoles and throughout the solar

00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:32,240
system and satellites and in planetary

00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:34,480
rovers on mars

00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:36,319
but power has been especially pivotal

00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:38,319
for enterprises

00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:39,520
eighty percent of the us's highest

00:59:38,319 --> 00:59:41,760
revenue companies

00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:44,000
use ibm power for their mission-critical

00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:45,839
i.t applications

00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:47,680
many of the world's largest banks

00:59:45,839 --> 00:59:50,319
retailers and healthcare systems

00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:52,160
literally rely on ibm power to power

00:59:50,319 --> 00:59:54,160
their business

00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:56,160
now power brings its legacy of

00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:57,280
innovation to the hybrid cloud with the

00:59:56,160 --> 01:00:00,160
launch of ibm

00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:02,559
power 10 designed over five years with

01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:04,960
hundreds of new and pending patents

01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:06,319
ibm power 10 is built to meet the needs

01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:08,079
of enterprise cloud computing

01:00:06,319 --> 01:00:09,040
environments that demand security

01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:12,319
reliability

01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:15,280
and performance but what makes ibm power

01:00:12,319 --> 01:00:19,599
10 unique from its predecessors

01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:22,480
first energy efficiency ibm power 10 is

01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:24,160
ibm's first 7 nanometer processor

01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:26,400
and it delivers three times greater

01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:28,079
energy efficiency and capacity

01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:29,680
allowing for greater performance and

01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:33,040
more work

01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:34,559
second scalability ibm has made memory

01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:36,559
more available in the cloud

01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:38,400
with a significant breakthrough in ibm

01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:41,599
power 10 called memory

01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:43,599
inception the cell sounds very sci-fi

01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:46,000
but essentially this clusters physical

01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:47,920
memory across a pool of systems

01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,920
where any of the systems in the pool can

01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:52,720
access the entire pooled memory

01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:54,480
up to multi-petabyte memory clusters

01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:56,240
this allows for businesses to reduce

01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:58,559
their costs on the cloud for memory

01:00:56,240 --> 01:01:02,559
intensive workloads

01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:03,520
third ai with ai improvements to its cpu

01:01:02,559 --> 01:01:06,400
cores

01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:08,000
ibm power 10 delivers up to 20 times

01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:11,440
better performance for ai

01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:13,200
inference workloads than ibm power9

01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:15,520
meaning it can take previously trained

01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:18,880
ai models and deduce new information

01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:20,799
up to 20 times faster than ibm power9

01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:22,640
this brings greater infusion of ai

01:01:20,799 --> 01:01:24,799
workloads into typical enterprise

01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:27,599
workloads on the hybrid cloud

01:01:24,799 --> 01:01:29,359
and last but not least security in

01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:31,680
today's world of cyber threats

01:01:29,359 --> 01:01:33,200
your data needs to be secure wherever it

01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:35,760
resides

01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:38,559
ibm power 10 has four times as many

01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:40,559
encryption engines as ibm power9

01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:41,680
keeping your data safe in the hybrid

01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:43,920
cloud

01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:44,880
over decades ibm power has been

01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:48,799
elemental and

01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:48,799
vital to shifting technology trends

01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:52,079
and as the world has changed and moved

01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:54,319
to the cloud power

01:01:52,079 --> 01:01:56,400
10 underscores ibm's belief in the

01:01:54,319 --> 01:01:59,839
fourth platform of it

01:01:56,400 --> 01:02:00,799
hybrid cloud with co-optimized hardware

01:01:59,839 --> 01:02:03,280
and software

01:02:00,799 --> 01:02:07,839
ibm power 10 based servers will deliver

01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:07,839
the future of the hybrid cloud

01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:27,839
hi this is mindy farnack and i am very

01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:30,079
excited to be here as always

01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:31,119
um with some some new announcements for

01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:34,400
today and

01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:35,839
that video was just showed um about you

01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:39,359
know power 10 because we're

01:02:35,839 --> 01:02:42,960
very excited about um the fact that

01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:45,200
power 10 has finally been revealed um

01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:46,480
you know it was revealed last month at

01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:48,480
hot trips

01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:51,359
and you know you saw in that video some

01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:52,480
of the exciting uh news with respect to

01:02:51,359 --> 01:02:54,400
power 10.

01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:55,920
um but there will be a talk today going

01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:58,559
through um

01:02:55,920 --> 01:03:00,839
the the details of the power 10 features

01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:03,839
so i really invite you to join attract

01:03:00,839 --> 01:03:03,839
live

01:03:13,119 --> 01:03:16,480
just some of the features of power tag

01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:18,319
you see you've got the data plane

01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:20,319
bandwidth the capacity

01:03:18,319 --> 01:03:23,039
the visibility scale just really

01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:24,880
unparalleled uh flexibility ranging

01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:26,559
from mission critical large scale to

01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:27,359
purpose-built systems to cloud data

01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:28,799
center

01:03:27,359 --> 01:03:31,119
and you can see that you know through

01:03:28,799 --> 01:03:33,920
that video that the history of power

01:03:31,119 --> 01:03:34,960
shows to just the broad spectrum of

01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:37,200
solutions

01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:38,880
power over the 30-year decade history

01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:41,119
has been able to tackle

01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:42,799
um with this new powertrain core we've

01:03:41,119 --> 01:03:44,240
got the new core architecture which

01:03:42,799 --> 01:03:46,319
we're super excited about

01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:47,520
because you know this is one of the

01:03:46,319 --> 01:03:50,000
architectures

01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:51,760
uh that was contributed to open power

01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:54,319
with the opening of the isa

01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:58,400
they contributed the iso that was used

01:03:54,319 --> 01:04:00,400
in power nine which was version 3.

01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:02,720
but also for power 10 they contributed

01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:04,160
the latest and greatest 3.1

01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:06,799
and so there's going to be a talk about

01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:08,319
that as well on track 1 at 10 35 by

01:04:06,799 --> 01:04:11,280
brian tonto

01:04:08,319 --> 01:04:12,400
um you know right afterwards there's

01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:15,520
another one at 11

01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:16,319
10 which will be focused on a particular

01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:18,960
new feature

01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:20,079
on the mma feature so i really invite

01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:22,319
you to

01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:24,960
participate in those two sessions as

01:04:22,319 --> 01:04:27,200
well if you want to learn more about the

01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:28,559
of the contributed comprise as well as

01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:32,319
new feature function

01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:34,079
of version 3.1 this new architecture

01:04:32,319 --> 01:04:36,480
enables flexibility

01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:37,920
um in the power 10 chip involving caches

01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:39,520
which is legacies

01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:41,200
and then we have what we're own for

01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:43,599
which is the end-to-end security

01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:44,480
you know end-to-end all the time and

01:04:43,599 --> 01:04:46,559
then here we

01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:48,240
go efficiency we're going to be 3x

01:04:46,559 --> 01:04:50,079
improvement over power 9

01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:52,400
agree of data centers for a cleaner

01:04:50,079 --> 01:04:53,280
planet and then aifu scores

01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:55,839
supercharging

01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:55,839
enterprise

01:05:07,039 --> 01:05:10,640
it being revealed for people to learn

01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:12,400
more about it and what they can do to

01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:13,680
open community with respect to the

01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:16,960
technology

01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:20,799
that it brings to the community

01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:23,839
next up is a new exciting

01:05:20,799 --> 01:05:24,720
announcement i get to make so uh back in

01:05:23,839 --> 01:05:27,359
june we

01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:29,119
we announced that the a2i core which was

01:05:27,359 --> 01:05:30,559
uh in order core

01:05:29,119 --> 01:05:33,520
uh and now we're announcing the

01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:33,920
follow-on uh which is for the hro4 which

01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:37,520
is an

01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:41,520
out of order version of the html port

01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:42,960
over there sorry is designed to optimize

01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:43,920
for single thread performance over

01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:47,280
throughput

01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:50,400
so while it's a follow-on to the

01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:52,640
a2i it really gives a different

01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:54,400
market segment that the capabilities of

01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:56,400
this court can go after

01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:58,640
example applications artificial

01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:01,039
intelligence autonomous driving security

01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:02,720
anything that really needs that single

01:06:01,039 --> 01:06:06,559
drug performance over

01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:08,160
you know what the hype is for such as

01:06:06,559 --> 01:06:09,760
it still has that same balance

01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:10,880
performance and power with modular

01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:14,319
design

01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:14,319
um and then this one

01:06:15,770 --> 01:06:19,440
[Music]

01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:20,240
ibm um very long i think most people

01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:23,760
know we

01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:25,920
uh heavily use vhdl um and you'll

01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:27,599
sell that gsgo is starting to be more

01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:31,039
widely supported because

01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:34,480
we are putting things out in the hdl but

01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:35,440
um you know we do have the a2 report and

01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:38,000
verilog

01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:39,200
um so we're excited about that um please

01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:43,119
come here the details

01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:45,680
at track 1 155 central with bill flynn

01:06:43,119 --> 01:06:47,280
uh the repository is open uh it's out

01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:50,160
there on github this morning

01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:50,480
so the rtl documentation in a full fba

01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:52,880
uh

01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:54,000
ga environment just like we did with the

01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:55,520
hyper

01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,280
and again it's got that actually

01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:58,240
interface you can use in the fpga

01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:59,839
platform

01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:02,480
um so come here to talk if you want a

01:06:59,839 --> 01:07:05,520
little detail it'll be right after the

01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:06,400
uh details on a2i you can come see both

01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:09,599
the a2i

01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:12,319
and the e304 next

01:07:09,599 --> 01:07:14,000
up is another announcement and usually

01:07:12,319 --> 01:07:17,359
i'm always talking about

01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:19,200
uh you know open hardware announcements

01:07:17,359 --> 01:07:21,760
but this time i get to talk about

01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:23,920
you know quick software announcement so

01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:27,280
we will also be announcing at the summit

01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:29,520
uh opening power ai so

01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:31,280
it's going to be under a new name called

01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:34,480
opence which stands for the

01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:35,280
open cognitive environment a little bit

01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:37,920
of the history

01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:38,799
of power ai and it was started in 2016

01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:41,680
as a

01:07:38,799 --> 01:07:42,880
nldl ai package proof of concept and

01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:46,000
within a year

actually have

01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:21,920
channels slack channels for each track

01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:24,320
and then

01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:25,760
a thread dedicated to each talk so

reply

01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:32,880
uh to the thread and uh um it'll all

categorize uh based on each talk for the

01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:36,239
q

01:11:33,199 --> 01:11:38,400
a uh q a will be handled within zoom

so you'll be able to submit your uh

01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:43,520
questions um

be able to

01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:48,000
select it and read it out loud and

01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:51,040
answer it you'll also be able to

01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:52,080
if there's multiple speakers it's

01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:53,920
potential for

01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:56,239
one of the speakers to actually answer

01:11:53,920 --> 01:12:00,080
that uh your question

01:11:56,239 --> 01:12:02,320
um in line and then hand it off to

01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:03,679
the primary speaker to read it out loud

01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:05,440
or answer it

01:12:03,679 --> 01:12:07,040
you can also raise your hand and then

01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:09,600
the speaker can unmute you you can

01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:11,520
answer your ask your question live

01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:13,199
so there's a couple different ways to

01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:15,840
handle q a

01:12:13,199 --> 01:12:16,880
but it will be handled within zoom so

01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:19,120
please leave all

01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:20,640
discussion and chat within the slack

01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:23,280
channels

01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:24,880
and uh within each thread so that we can

01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:25,199
easily navigate and see which ones

01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:28,560
you're

01:12:25,199 --> 01:12:31,600
