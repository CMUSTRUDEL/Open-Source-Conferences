good afternoon good evening ladies and

00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,839
gentlemen

00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,279
welcome to this webinar where i would

00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:10,160
like to present

00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:11,519
a a small concept of integrating

00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,880
industry 4.0

00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:16,400
and ibm power systems uh what we call as

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,640
open power systems

00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,800
and we will be doing that using a

00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,880
probable use case scenario

00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,920
uh taking into account developing

00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,199
economies

00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:29,039
uh which are in the present scenario of

00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,359
the economic turnaround are trying for

00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,719
an industrial ramp up

00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:36,719
right uh so before i begin uh

00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,320
go ahead further i would just like to

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,520
present myself a bit

00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:45,440
and achievements and you can call me sen

00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,800
and i'm from india and graduate and now

00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,520
pursuing masters and

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,360
did a small internship in um mitsubishi

00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,960
fossil in japan and

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:58,239
that's where the interest of

00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,359
industry 4.0 and the related aspects

00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:04,640
came into

00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:04,640
existence so i would like to go ahead

00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:10,479
uh so today in this webinar why

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,320
are we here the purpose is to

00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:16,080
demonstrate the capability of

00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:18,240
ibm open power to make industry 4.0

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,840
uh transition in the developing economic

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,720
landscape

00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,400
so basically that means that in in the

00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,799
developing economies we do not hear too

00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,400
much

00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:32,560
about industry 4.0 and we would like to

00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:35,840
take advantage of this rising scenario

00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:38,000
to incorporate the technological

00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:41,200
advancements that we already have

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,240
from ibm open power

00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:47,759
and uh what are the motivations behind

00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:51,119
this uh uh kind of approach

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:54,560
let's say that uh most of the economies

00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:56,880
are trying to become self-reliant

00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,560
for which they are trying to make a

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,520
strategy where they could make

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,159
uh the manufacturing more local than

00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,479
going

00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,719
you know globally local or global let's

00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:09,119
say so it's more local now

00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,840
and the industries are shifting bases

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,680
from

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,920
other countries chief producing

00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:17,840
countries to countries where

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,640
they can have more revenues and more

00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,000
profits

00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:24,080
and ultimate control so

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,680
multiple mnc manufacturers are aiming

00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,640
for developing nations

00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:31,519
so that's the main goal behind this

00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:34,800
entire presentation

00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:38,000
so if we say that what do we have now

00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,879
we have industries which are

00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,920
quite advanced with the automation and

00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:45,200
we have

00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:48,080
engineers and diploma graduates

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,200
who are ready to you know skilled enough

00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:53,040
to take care

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:57,519
of these industries but what we do need

00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:59,840
is is something a bit of a ramp up

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,120
and they are called as smart industries

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,239
in the arena of

00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:07,840
industry 4.0 which would have

00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:09,920
smart automation and

00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,280
basically we would try to incorporate

00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,319
machine learning

00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,360
and artificial intelligence in in layer

00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,760
of

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,040
self learning and improving processes

00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,200
and then we have a

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,720
scale up for factories that's what we

00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:26,159
need that's

00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:29,280
really a need of this art

00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:33,200
so how do how do you go about it

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:37,200
so let's say we have a token strategy

00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:39,360
in which the major four points

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,720
of which may at the first major point

00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,159
would be to have

00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:47,120
a global approach of ibm open power

00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:48,239
which means that the industries would be

00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,599
using

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,720
the ibm open power capabilities in all

00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,599
those areas

00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:58,400
which it is able for which it might be

00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:01,599
able to incorporate

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:04,000
so and i mean basically it's easier

00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,760
said than done so let's say why would

00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
they wants to do it

00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,040
so this is a model which would like to

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,200
create

00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,840
a perspective where would they they

00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,360
would understand that it's more

00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:18,479
affordable and they would have a quicker

00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,160
roi based system so that's like the

00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:23,199
second point

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,479
why industry would like to take this

00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,440
approach

00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,800
right so now we have the third point

00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,600
where would they would like to

00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,960
you know make the best utilization of

00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,479
local resources

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,720
and that would lead to further profit

00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:40,320
incentivization

00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,880
right and let's not forget behind all of

00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,199
this

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,560
we have the most important aspect which

00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,840
is the data

00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:51,280
so we have to take a lot of uh

00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:54,000
i mean a lot of care in identifying

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,520
where we would like to you know retrieve

00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,639
the data we would like to

00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:00,720
use that data and and henceforth

00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,280
you know so the importance of data is

00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:07,039
really huge

00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,080
so what next so we would like to develop

00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:11,759
a system

00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:14,800
a one-stop system uh which would

00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:17,360
have an end-to-end process

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,320
this creation of the system would have

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,639
been done

00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,840
from all the available modules of ibm

00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:26,800
open power

00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:29,759
and in order to incorporate all these uh

00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,120
systems all or let's say the end-to-end

00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,880
processes

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:37,360
uh we have to train the employees

00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,320
with these systems in the arena of the

00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,039
existing

00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,919
um manufacturing arena right so

00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:45,199
basically

00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:46,800
you know a small phased change let's say

00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,919
of the technology and also

00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,120
a skill ramparts and what would we like

00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:53,680
to do that

00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,039
so that would be another good question

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,759
that

00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:59,039
any uh profit making industry would like

00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:02,400
to answer

00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:05,199
so the two main things that would be

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,800
the most highlighted would be reduxing

00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,840
reduction in manual processes

00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,800
and errors and the chance to enhance

00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,000
profit margins

00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,199
but for more importantly also deliver

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,240
quality products

00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:22,160
uh let's say an aspect of

00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:24,479
six sigma right and how do they

00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,560
plan to do that or let's say how would

00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:28,639
be they able to do it

00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,160
so that would be by changing the

00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:33,199
approach of training

00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,160
for the new employees what i mean by

00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:38,160
this

00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:39,039
is it's a it's a very tricky situation

00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:43,039
when we say that

00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:44,960
we have an uh a full-fledged automation

00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,880
and we will have more incorporation of

00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,960
machines and machine learning

00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:52,000
and artificial intelligence what will

00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:55,199
happen to the existing employees etc

00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,199
so that aspect could be to an extent

00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,880
answered by saying that okay we will

00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:02,000
have a phased

00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:05,759
skill ramp up and these

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,880
would lead to less of uh you know

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,880
iterations in the in the

00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,000
number of employees in the organization

00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,479
and he would

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,520
i mean tend to lose lesser of the more

00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:18,000
skilled people

00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,800
on people who know that existing systems

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,960
well

00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,400
so the phased training process would be

00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,960
one of the aspects

00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,160
which would be really really important

00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,599
and then we have

00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,680
the introduction of trainings and

00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:33,440
systems and the institutions

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:36,080
so basically the graduates or diplomas

00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:38,639
or less the postgraduates would have

00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,160
uh you know the learning factories which

00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,800
we really tend to call

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,080
these days and uh these will be the

00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,360
centers where they

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:50,960
would be exposed to the systems which

00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,800
would be really functioning and

00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,160
although in a small scale but they will

00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,479
be exposed to the system

00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,080
in order to be able to you know

00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,160
implement the knowledge which they

00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,560
gain in the institutions when they come

00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:05,039
to the industry

00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,680
um the third approach uh would be like

00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,520
uh

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,039
to create some open research and

00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,639
competition collaborations with

00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:14,800
institutions so basically this is

00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:16,720
something uh more of a open

00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,800
you know game day or something like that

00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,840
open competition day

00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,360
so this is another approach so that

00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,240
leads to more of uh

00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,039
you know self learning and self skill of

00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,599
processes

00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:31,759
within people who are interested into

00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:35,120
diverging in this kind of industry

00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:37,919
right so what does it

00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,880
mean to establish an e3 system with ibm

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:44,240
open power so

00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:47,920
when i said an end-to-end system i

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:51,440
wanted to refer that we would have

00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:53,120
real-time optimization of the process so

00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,240
let's say we have a system and we want

00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:58,640
to optimize each of those processes

00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,279
but however i mean sometimes we do not

00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:03,519
have an opportunity to implement

00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,200
uh the modules that are existing from

00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,560
ibm open power so we would try to

00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,680
maximize

00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:14,480
the utilizations of these

00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:14,480
modules and optimize the process itself

00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:18,880
meanwhile we will also have real-time

00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,920
feedback loops through ai and

00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,800
algorithmic

00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,440
back-to-base sorting so this is

00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,720
something

00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:29,360
which is again interesting and i mean

00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,040
i mean in leopards we would be able to

00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:34,399
create a customizable

00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:35,040
e2a system for example an fmcg industry

00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,839
would have

00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,040
a completely different requirement of an

00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,920
e3 system

00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,360
or idiot production system which is more

00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,480
digitalized

00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,120
for the industry 4.0 than an automotive

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,839
industry

00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,040
or rather let's say logistic and a

00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,519
logistic form

00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:56,000
so we would i mean utilizing these

00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,519
systems or the modules of ibm open power

00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,440
we will be able to create

00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:05,680
a customizable e2a system so that we can

00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:08,560
provide services to most of the sectors

00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,040
so optimize use of ibm cloud is another

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,680
factor

00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,480
which could uh actually lead to a lot of

00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,839
help

00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,320
i mean basically let's say that ibm

00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:20,240
cloud

00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:22,399
is underutilized so we can be utilizing

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,240
we can actually utilize it to a larger

00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,160
greater extent and provide

00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,000
more facilities out of it just like

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:31,839
amazon web services does

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,480
these days so this end-to-end system

00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,800
basically

00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,760
is the creation of the digital twin in

00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,360
the long run

00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:43,040
so that's what is the final goal of this

00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:46,000
entire project so

00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,200
after explaining what the influence

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,880
system would look like

00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,120
i would like to highlight something

00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:53,680
about the case use case scenario

00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,040
and using a new use case scenario so so

00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:59,680
that it's a bit more

00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:01,920
clear of how to go about it

00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,880
so let's say that we would like to do

00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,320
some product

00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:08,240
quality tracking and

00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,360
let's say a product a is being

00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,440
manufactured

00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:16,160
by some xyz company and

00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,720
it has sub suppliers and suppliers and

00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:21,360
oems and dealers and distributions

00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,240
centers and sellers and then consumers

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,079
and then we have

00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:28,880
the recycling process so i mean i have

00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,519
in this uh exact normal boxes i have all

00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,760
the

00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,880
uh life cycle management system

00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:36,079
highlighted

00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,560
so if i'm looking at any one aspect of

00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:39,120
this

00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,160
and i say that okay let's say that we

00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,959
have a problem

00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,560
in any one of these areas let's say the

00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:47,519
sub supplier has a

00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:49,279
problem in one of the components and or

00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,240
the supplier has a problem in one of the

00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:53,440
components

00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,000
so what next how do we do it so

00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,760
basically

00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,480
in the recent times let's say

00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,639
out of the as you can see here out of

00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,880
the 350 let's say random

00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,320
small components we have a complaint

00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:10,320
from

00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:14,240
the field and the failures in four years

00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:16,639
it leads to a greater warranty claim so

00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,560
a lot of uh research is being done in

00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:21,519
the quality analysis field

00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,399
we do some perito rca agriculture

00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:25,600
analysis

00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:28,959
fishbone analysis and then we have fma

00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,519
and and henceforth so a lot of time is

00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,839
taken

00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,560
a lot of personnel is devoted and a lot

00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,680
of

00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:37,200
money is being used for that at the end

00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:40,000
of the day of course the companies

00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,880
are identified and the suppliers or

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,519
let's say

00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,560
the point of origin of the failure is

00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:48,079
identified

00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:50,320
and it's resolved right so what

00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:51,120
do we have in the new system is

00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,160
something

00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,200
called component voice tracking so that

00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,680
if a component

00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,800
fails at some point and if it is

00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,839
iterative

00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:04,959
then we would like to track without

00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:08,240
utilization of personal

00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:11,680
in in in a scale which is

00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:15,519
as huge as today so

00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:18,639
the main target is to do the tracking

00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:19,600
of the quality failure without the

00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:22,720
utilization of

00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:25,760
personal so we can use a lot of

00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:29,440
actually a lot of technology for that

00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:32,639
uh in fact ibm open power has a lot of

00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:34,560
technology within its arena

00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,399
so we can have actually codings and

00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,639
numbers and sensors

00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,399
uh in the production system where it

00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,720
could be tracked remotely and then

00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:46,320
control charts are redefined

00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:48,320
yeah and you know the research is done

00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,760
for new adjustments and the solutions

00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,360
are narrowed down with

00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:55,360
lesser uh utilization of the budget or

00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:58,480
the monetary allocation

00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,360
so this is one of the aspects where i

00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,600
would like to say

00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,560
that the quality tracking would become

00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,760
much more

00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:08,480
faster much more easier

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,440
although we would have you know applied

00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,480
a lot of

00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:14,560
technology and sensors etc

00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,560
but what i would like to highlight here

00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:20,000
is we have the capabilities

00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:22,800
within the ibm open power systems

00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,240
so we can use i mean actually utilize a

00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,560
lot of the iot

00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,920
and the edge computing from ibm open

00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:31,279
power which would actually

00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:34,399
lead to faster resolution of a problem

00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:36,639
of this sort so this is just

00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,920
one of the use case scenario and these

00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:41,360
kind of scenarios

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:42,639
are plenty innumerous in a manufacturing

00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,880
scenario and these

00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:46,000
all could be you know put under one

00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:49,040
umbrella

00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,839
to have uh you know a you know

00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:54,240
a wholesome e2a system so that that

00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:57,519
could be tracked monitored and

00:14:54,240 --> 00:15:00,000
fully functional to provide more better

00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,000
results

00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:07,279
so the implementation plan is

00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:11,760
pretty simple it's

00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:14,800
it's kind of uh of a cycling

00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,519
nature so we would have a development

00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,000
teams

00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:19,920
which would dedicatedly develop the e2e

00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,360
system based on

00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:26,240
a generic plan basically

00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,199
and these independent modules which we

00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,240
have from ibm

00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:31,839
open power will be looked uh further for

00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,399
how they could be integrated

00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:36,000
and you know cross-functionality of each

00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,399
of these modules could be

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,440
achieved and they could be made as a

00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:42,240
unified system

00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,240
this is basically one and then looking

00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,160
at the company's perspective

00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,000
we would have more come we would like to

00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:51,839
have more companies you know

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:54,800
onboarding because of the unique roi

00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:56,639
plan that we provide them with and

00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,959
unique business models that we provide

00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:01,440
them

00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:05,360
with so uh after all this is done

00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:08,720
we would provide a demo architecture

00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:11,839
demo system and

00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:14,800
this would lead to probable use case

00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,519
of the requirement based for the company

00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,160
or

00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,199
let's say very specific to the company

00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,360
itself

00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,880
and then the universities would have the

00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,920
training modules once the system is

00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,079
developed basically

00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:28,000
this integrated system of ibm is

00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:30,000
developed the universities would have

00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,199
some hands-on training for the prices

00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,680
for getting trained

00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:35,519
the students to getting for you know to

00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:39,040
get trained and come to the

00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:41,199
arena much more ready to work with the

00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,959
systems already available

00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:44,880
so what could be the next steps uh

00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:46,880
henceforth uh we could have more

00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:50,000
companies getting reserves

00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:52,560
of the e2e system and the stage for the

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,480
digital twin is set up

00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,639
next is we would unlock the full

00:16:54,480 --> 00:17:00,240
potential of

00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:01,120
driving open power and that would lead

00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,240
to revamp
