	IBM's POWER10 Processor - William Starke & Brian W. Thompto, IBM

Speakers: William Starke, Brian W. Thompto

POWER10 is IBM's next generation POWER micro-processor focused on enterprise computing. This talk will describe many of the new innovations and capabilities of POWER10 that build upon the strengths of recent generations and provide flexibility for the enterprise cloud.  POWER10 is fabricated using Samsung 7nm technology. It features a new core microarchitecture focused on energy efficiency, thread strength, increased SIMD execution capabilities, and instruction set enhancements targeted toward AI optimization. It also provides a substantial data plane bandwidth increase coupled with next generation OpenCAPI accelerator attach and Open Memory Interface (OMI) capabilities. A modular packaging architecture enables a broad range of deployments optimized for socket throughput, thread strength, cost, and scale. The PowerAXON high bandwidth, low latency, multi-protocol link architecture combines with numerous scaling architecture enhancements to provide robust large system characteristics and with scale-out system architectures to provide disaggregated memory clustering capabilities.
