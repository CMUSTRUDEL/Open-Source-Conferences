	The LibreSOC Initiative: A hybrid CPU/VPU/GPU - Luke Leighton, LibreSOC

Speakers: Luke Leighton

LibreSOC is a hybrid CPU, VPU and GPU that is to be free of DRM and spying backdoor coprocessors, and to be libre licensed to the bedrock. To engender business and end-user trust the design is being developed fully transparently following best Libre Development practices, aims for full coverage with Formal Correctness Proofs, first class documentation suitable for both educational engagement as well as customer and developer support, and to act as a Reference and experimental Platform for exploration of advanced 3D and Video extensions to the Power ISA, under the guidance and mentorship of the OpenPOWER Foundation. With EUR 350,000 funding from NLNet under their Privacy and Enhanced Trust Programme, LibreSOC's first target is a 180nm test ASIC, as a first step on a roadmap that includes a Quad Core SoC suitable for use in tablets, netbooks and the SBC Industrial markets.
