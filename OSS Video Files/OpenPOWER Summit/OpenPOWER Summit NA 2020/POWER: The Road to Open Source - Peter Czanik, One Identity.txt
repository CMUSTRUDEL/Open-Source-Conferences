	POWER: The Road to Open Source - Peter Czanik, One Identity

Speakers: Peter Czanik

Peter has been a POWER user for 27 years and Open Source contributor for 25 years. From this subjective history lesson you can learn, how the relation of POWER and Open Source changed in the nearly three decades: RS6000, PowerMac, Genesi, POWER, OpenPOWER. One interesting trend is that while at first a few open source applications ran on top of AIX, a closed OS, it changed to a fully open source ecosystem, and now commercial applications, like SAP Hana, run on top of open source. It is Linux running in little Endian mode, which makes porting and optimizing software easier. The other trend is, that developers are a lot more active when they can build software natively on the desktop and run it in the cloud. There were many active developers before 2010, most of them disappeared when only high end servers were actively produced, and with the Raptor workstations development is active again.
