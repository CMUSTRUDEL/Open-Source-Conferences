	ThymesisFlow: A Hardware/software Open Framework for Software Defined Disaggregation Based on OpenCAPI - Christian Pinto, IBM Research Europe

Speakers: Christian Pinto

In this talk Dr Pinto will introduce ThymesisFlow, a hardware/software open framework based on OpenCAPI for implementing off-tray peripherals disaggregation via a software defined interconnect. Peripherals can be borrowed from a remote server and interfaced to the local processor, in the same spirit an off-chip peripheral is connected to the processor. ThymesisFlow is based on the OpenCAPI 3.0 specification and relies on a custom MAC that interfaces to a low-latency network. Each ThymesisFlow instance serves as bridge between the local coherence domain of a POWER processor and a remote counterpart, mastering unmodified OpenCAPI transactions towards the correct remote coherent domains based on the target address. During this talk Dr. Pinto will drive the audience through the hardware/software design of a main system memory disaggregation prototype using ThymesisFlow, its full stack evaluation on a set of cloud workloads, as well as a live demonstration on two IBM AC922 POWER9 servers.
