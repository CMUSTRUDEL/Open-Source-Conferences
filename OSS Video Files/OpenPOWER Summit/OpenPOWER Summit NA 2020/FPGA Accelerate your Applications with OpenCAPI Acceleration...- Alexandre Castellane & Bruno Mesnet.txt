Description: 
	FPGA Accelerate your Applications with OpenCAPI Acceleration Framework (OC-ACCEL) - Alexandre Castellane & Bruno Mesnet, IBM France

Speakers: Bruno Mesnet, Alexandre Castellane

OpenCAPI Acceleration Framework, abbreviated as OC-Accel, is a platform allowing programmers and computer engineers to quickly create FPGA-based acceleration solutions. Both acceleration action's software and hardware parts coherently share the server host memory data through OpenCAPI interface. Designers can thus quickly design an accelerator and benefit from the bandwidth, latency, coherency and programability advantages of OpenCAPI. Applications can be written in Python facilitating technology discovery.
