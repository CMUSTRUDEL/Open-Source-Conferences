	COVID Detection - Deep Learning Solution on power 9 AI Box - Shivansh Shukla, IIT Patna

Speakers: Shivansh Shukla

In addition to the immeasurable suffering and loss of life, the deadly coronavirus is already impacting the world economy, but there is a silver lining. COVID has sparked a wave of innovation. We, here at Object Automation Software Solutions Pvt Ltd tried to contribute by developing a Covid-19 detection/classification program from the x-ray scans, leveraging the state of the art VGG-16 convolutional model. We then built and tested this on our low-cost Power 9 Development Box for AI, Deep Learning & Machine Learning. This box provides the fastest, simplest way to deploy deep learning frameworks This Covid-19 detection/classification application can also be very easily developed on the PowerAI Vision tool, which automates the machine learning and deep learning workflow without any skills in deep learning technologies. It can then train and validate a model in a GUI interface to build customized solutions for image classification and object detection.
