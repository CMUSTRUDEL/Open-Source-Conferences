n Q2 of 2020 CINECA deployed its new Tier-0 HPC cluster: Marconi100. The cluster is currently ranked at position 9 in the Top500 Supercomputer list. The nodes of this machine are equipped with 2 IBM Power9 processors and Nvidia V100 GPUs. Currently we are porting several codes on this new machine. In this lecture we will present the new machine, the methods to have an access on the machine and a couple of successful examples of porting.
