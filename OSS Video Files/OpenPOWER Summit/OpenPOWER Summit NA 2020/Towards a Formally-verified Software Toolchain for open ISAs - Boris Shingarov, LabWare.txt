	Towards a Formally-verified Software Toolchain for open ISAs - Boris Shingarov, LabWare

Speakers: Boris Shingarov

This talk summarizes lessons from several years of experimenting with automatic generation of compiler toolchains from processor description languages (PDL), using approaches ranging from superoptimization via logic programming to SMT-based binary analysis, and presents a new experimental system which builds on these lessons. The new approach takes ISA specifications written in the Sail PDL, as the starting point for software-tools synthesis and verification. Sail is used by practicing engineers to create full-scale formalizations of real ISAs; on the other hand, Sail is based on Lem and is mathematically rigorous. This talk demonstrates how the tool transforms a short sequence of POWER instructions into a proof of an invariant of the final state holding universally over the space of allowed behaviors.
