	The Open Power ISA: Architecture Compliancy and Future Foundations - Brian W. Thompto, IBM

Speakers: Brian W. Thompto

The Open Power ISA enables access to unencumbered open innovation and a mature software ecosystem developed over the last 30 years.  In this talk, we will review the major options for architectural compliancy that provide freedom of choice in design, including four recently specified compliancy subsets, separate optional features, and custom extensions. IBM has also recently contributed the Power ISA Version 3.1 to the OpenPOWER Foundation. This latest architectural version includes a number of new features developed for the POWER10 server including a new foundation for future expansion via the introduction of an instruction prefix. New capabilities and compliancy implications will be summarized.
