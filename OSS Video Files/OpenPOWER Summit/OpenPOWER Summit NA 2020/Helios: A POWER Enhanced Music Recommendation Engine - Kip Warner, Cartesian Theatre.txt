hey everyone

00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,480
my name is kip warner i'm here on behalf

00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,400
of my tiny vancouver-based outfit

00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,000
cartesian theater

00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,840
i'm going to talk to you today about a

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,480
power9 accelerated solution for the

00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,039
music in

00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,800
entertainment industries called helios

00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,880
so what is helios

00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,240
helios is a patent-pending technology

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,320
that can be used to search large

00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,720
commercial music catalogs using music

00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,080
itself as the search key

00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,840
let's take a few minutes and watch a

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,840
short video to help you understand

00:00:33,670 --> 00:01:50,990
[Music]

00:01:52,840 --> 00:02:05,900
foreign

00:01:53,860 --> 00:02:05,900
[Music]

00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:12,710
do

00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,710
[Music]

00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,760
heliosports an easy-to-use

00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,520
cross-platform rest api

00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,280
provide it with a song as a search key

00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,520
and it will respond back with a ranked

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,520
listing of similar music

00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,520
in a nutshell for the engineers here

00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,120
it's a systemd service that runs in a

00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,879
server data center environment

00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,879
or really wherever the customer wants

00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,360
helios is intended for businesses in the

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,879
music and entertainment space looking to

00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,959
assist either themselves

00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:44,160
or their own customers find and license

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,440
music for their productions

00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,519
there are many different potential

00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,599
business users these include commercial

00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,920
production and film studios

00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:53,599
major and independent record labels

00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:57,440
streaming services

00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:59,840
digital jukeboxes online music stores

00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,680
social networking platforms for artists

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,760
and many others

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,920
in 2019 the music industry alone

00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,879
accounted for 20.2 billion in global

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,239
revenue

00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,640
that doesn't even include the film

00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,239
industry but the music industry and the

00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,159
labels specifically created some

00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,239
interesting architectural constraints in

00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,840
the design of helios

00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,599
being able to host their own server

00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,440
anywhere they want is a really big deal

00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,280
in the music industry that might not be

00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,920
to other industries that have no problem

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,640
depending on services hosted by aws

00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,400
or other third parties the way they

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,159
explained it to me many times you can

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,720
have the best algorithms and software in

00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,040
the world

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,640
but for many of them if you require them

00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,599
to have to upload and analyze their

00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,720
music catalogs

00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:42,799
off-site their legal teams will say no

00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,640
whatever magic your solution does it has

00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,799
to do it there or not at all

00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,280
that means they need hardware powerful

00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,280
hardware

00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,400
so why would a record label or

00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:56,640
commercial music catalog need

00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,280
helios well there's currently no easy

00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,879
reusable

00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,640
automated way for them to search their

00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:03,120
own catalogues using similar sounding

00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,799
music as a search key

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,720
consider that they've got thousands

00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,640
sometimes millions of songs

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,799
customers approach them on a daily basis

00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:13,599
needing music for their commercial film

00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,720
documentary or what have you the label

00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,479
wants to sell them what's called a

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,239
synchronization license to use the

00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:20,320
perfect song they need

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:22,240
inevitably the customer always comes

00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:25,520
with samples in hand from vimeo

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,199
youtube bandcamp soundcloud or wherever

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,759
that captures the vibe for their use

00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,320
case

00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,759
they already have in mind instead of the

00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,320
label having to do what it currently

00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,840
does

00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,520
have a poor intern sit there with

00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,520
headphones manually sorting through the

00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,639
catalog which can take days or sometimes

00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,160
weeks

00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,680
and at the risk of the customer going

00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,600
elsewhere in the interim

00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,440
helios could produce for the customer in

00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,560
seconds the best matches from within the

00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,560
catalog

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,560
it can even directly consume music as a

00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,240
search key from the external services i

00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,240
just mentioned

00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,000
searching music using music itself as

00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,919
the search key has many advantages

00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
over the old ways which sometimes

00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,120
included relying on free form textual

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,039
tags like

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,639
happy or melancholy that method requires

00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:08,400
every song in the catalog to have a set

00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,840
of manually generated tags

00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,680
but those tags are usually not

00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,840
translated into other languages

00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,720
in other words markets they're not

00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,960
complete or even universally agreed upon

00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,639
as an example maybe someone in beijing

00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,919
doesn't have the word grunge immediately

00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,639
spring to mind when they're listening to

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,320
nirvana

00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,320
for the first time that maybe someone

00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,080
somewhere else might have

00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,240
research has shown time and time again

00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,160
that the best search key to use is the

00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,000
customer's music itself

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,280
music contains more information within

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,520
it than any exhaustive

00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,120
linguistic description so how does

00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,560
helios work

00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,400
what it does is it performs what's

00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,280
called a sub-symbolic analysis on the

00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,199
music

00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,759
this involves a complex digital signal

00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:50,080
processing on time and spectral domains

00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,919
as well as other information in other

00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,960
words helios actually listens to the

00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,639
sound of the music

00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,000
doesn't rely on statistical tricks to

00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,039
profile customers and make

00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,960
recommendations

00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,160
based on what some other customer it

00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,960
thinks was similar

00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,560
liked it is bias free and looks only at

00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,520
the objective characteristics of the

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,680
song

00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,360
if you are an independent musician that

00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,120
doesn't have the prominence of the trent

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,520
reznor or tom york

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,000
helios will recommend you based solely

00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,440
on the merits of what it heard

00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,680
so what's any of this got to do with

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,919
power or the open power foundation

00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,759
well as it turns out a lot although

00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:25,520
heavily optimized helios is

00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,280
computationally heavy

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,520
its codebase is highly portable and

00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:32,000
leverages multi-core systems

00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,039
it works well on 64-bit intel and arm

00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,560
processors

00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:37,520
but if that were all i of course

00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,360
wouldn't be here right now

00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,960
i've been collaborating closely with ibm

00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,080
since the fall of 2019

00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,840
with the generous help of their

00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,840
engineers and their hardware i'm very

00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,000
happy to say that helios performs very

00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,720
well on power9 systems and will continue

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,560
to seek more improvements over time it

00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,759
will likely remain my preferred platform

00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,280
for deployment in the field to customers

00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,800
my experience has been that helios

00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,400
provides a novel and intriguing

00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,319
application to power that helps give

00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,160
this next generation hardware platform

00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,160
greater exposure outside of technical

00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,840
fields it is my prediction that it will

00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,199
help to establish a greater beachhead

00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,560
into the music and entertainment

00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,720
industries

00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,800
many of us remember the colorful bubbly

00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,960
power g4s that were a favorite in those

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,199
industries in the 90s and early 2000s

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,880
before intel's dominance

00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:24,400
so powers returning to these creative

00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,400
spaces will be long overdue

00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,479
i'm ready to wrap things up but i'd like

00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:30,160
to take a moment to provide a special

00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:32,400
thank you to my gifted animator and

00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:36,000
