Description: 
	OpenCAPI BoF - A Memory Centric Fabric for a Data Centric World - Allan J. Cantle, Nallasway Inc.; Marcy Byers & Alexandre Castellane IBM; Craig Petrie, BittWare & Oskar Mencer, Maxeler

Speakers: Alexandre Castellane, Allan J. Cantle, Craig Petrie, Marcy Byers, Oskar Mencer
Concluding the OpenCAPI track there will be two additional lightning talks followed by the described BoF moderated by Allan Cantle.

FPGA Accelerators including Hybrid Memory Subsystems - BittWare - Craig Petrie

Applications that can benefit from OMI enabled FPGA Acceleration - Maxeler  - Oskar Mencer

As the computing industry shifts towards a Disaggregated, Heterogeneous, Data Centric World, we've seen a myriad of Fabric Technologies being proposed and developed in what has commonly been referred to as Fabric Wars. This BoF reviews the key attributes of OpenCAPI, which is the only Fabric in production that's focused on lowest latency and high bandwidth direct connections with Memory, Accelerators & other Systems. The primary aim of the BoF is to both educate and to debate the merits & shortcomings of OpenCAPI when compared to alternate fabrics that typically have a broader scope. Is OpenCAPI a bus standard for the HPC world where only the highest performance will suffice and can such an open technology significantly help in democratizing the High Performance Computing Community once and for all?
