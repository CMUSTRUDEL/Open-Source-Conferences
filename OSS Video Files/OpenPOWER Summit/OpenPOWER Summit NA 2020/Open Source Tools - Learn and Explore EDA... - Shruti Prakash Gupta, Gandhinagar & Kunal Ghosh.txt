VLSI industry is developing at a much faster rate and the core factor is the development in the Electronic Design Automation industry. It reduces the effort and time demanded for any design procedure, but at the same time requires high-end tools and large set up to deliver high performance. Most of the freshers aspiring to get into the industry fail to get hands on experience with the tools due to their restricted availability. Open source tools come to the rescue at this point. However, they do not provide an equal level of ease in accessing, due to the technical complexities involved or due to lacking in the user-friendliness. This is an attempt to make the procedure of accessing these tools and other utilities as simple as possible for any beginner to get started with. This project includes a detailed report about how to get access to the tools involved in front- and back-end ASIC design flow. It focuses on the openPOWER ISA soft-core but is extensible to any general purpose.
