	IBM open sources the A2O Core! - Bill Flynn, IBM

Speakers: Bill Flynn

An out of order, single thread optimized core derived from the highly scalable in order commercially proven A2I core will be described.  The design leverages the same tightly coupled AXU accelerator interface as A2I.  An overview of key microarchitecture and features and a brief description of cost/power benefits when implemented in the 7nm technology will be offered.  Finally, a description of the associated FPGA environment and simple how to video will be shown.
