	LinuxKI on POWER: The kernel Performance Toolkit Porting Experience and Challenges - Sergey Kachkin, YADRO

Speakers: Sergey Kachkin

There are a lot of Linux performance tools. Some of them are already working on the OpenPOWER platform, while some are not properly ported yet. The LinuxKI Toolset is an open source performance troubleshooting tool for Linux. It is designed to identify performance issues beyond the typical performance metrics and results in faster root cause identification for many performance issues. In this presentation, I'll share the porting experience of this kernel performance tool on OpenPOWER, as well as address challenges and techniques that can be used to port modules if you are a performance engineer and not a professional programmer.
