Speakers: Dr Manish Modani

The Weather Company, an IBM Business, offers the personalized & actionable weather data and insights to millions of users. Weather Company uses 100+ state of art weather models to provide hyper-local weather forecast across the world. The Artificial Intelligence techniques and Human Intelligence (150 + Meteorologists) used to have the most accurate weather forecast for better decisions. Recently IBM operationalized the unique weather model IBM GRAF, developed & deployed jointly by NCAR & IBM, running on IBM Power 9 and NVIDIA GPUs. IBM GRAF runs at 3 KM resolution, across the world with the hourly update. This talk will explore the weather forecast models, translation of those forecasts into insights and impacts for decision-makers, using high-performance computing, artificial intelligence and the internet of things. The performance of IBM Weather models in predicting the cyclone NISARGA & AMPHAN will also be discussed.

i would like to start now hope you all

00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:07,440
can hear me

00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:10,559
um good morning good evening

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,519
thanks for joining the session today i

00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:13,440
will

00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,880
discuss about the weather company and

00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,440
ibm business

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,119
how they use the advanced technology to

00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:24,240
provide the

00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:24,240
weather forecast across the world

00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:29,199
before starting any questions are

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,000
welcome

00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,719
please put them in the q a section you

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,880
can

00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,800
write any questions i will try to take

00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,800
them in between otherwise

00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,719
in the end i will try to address all the

00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:44,879
questions

00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:48,719
with that i would like to start now

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:50,559
so today i am going to discuss the

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,120
application of

00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:55,520
ai cloud iot and high performance

00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:58,320
computing in weather forecasting

00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,680
so weather forecasting has a lot of data

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,239
then it requires

00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,680
uh you know advanced techniques like i

00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:06,080
ai

00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,159
the solution is provided through cloud

00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,560
now iot is also there

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,760
and certainly weather model needs hpc

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,640
system to

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,479
make forecast in time so before we

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,000
starting i would like to start with the

00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:21,439
video

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,560
it's a advertisement video company shoot

00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:26,799
on me i became the hero here but

00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,150
there is a message about weather company

00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:48,320
in that so

00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:55,840
[Music]

00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:55,840
yellow khana

00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:05,440
[Music]

00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,509
foreign

00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,630
[Music]

00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:20,840
[Applause]

00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:23,840
[Music]

00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,840
foreign

00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:40,800
foreign weather is a hidden layer of

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,879
insight that can predict how we feel

00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,360
and the decisions we make the foods we

00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:46,080
crave and how and where we satisfy our

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,239
appetite

00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,319
we drink more fizzy drinks when it rains

00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,239
and eat more yogurt when it's windy

00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:54,879
indoor paint sales increase when there

00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,959
is above the average wind

00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,239
hand and body lotion sales increase when

00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,400
there is no cloud coverage

00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,760
auto gas sales spike when temperatures

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,920
are colder than average

00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,040
arthritis and copd can increase on

00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,120
specific days

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,159
you can get an advance warning and not

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,239
miss medication

00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:12,480
the weather company and ibm business

00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,879
acts as your personal weather advisor

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,360
to help you plan your day when to go for

00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:19,599
a run swim or play cricket

00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,720
organizations can now use weather events

00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:24,080
and emotional triggers

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,959
to better serve customers impacting

00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,760
lives across

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,519
india with 15 minute forecasts available

00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:33,800
every 500 meters across

00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:36,899
villages and districts in india

00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,899
[Music]

00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:45,680
so before starting let me

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:47,920
brief about myself i am phd

00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,879
from indian institute of technology

00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,680
delhi i did psd in applied mathematics

00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,239
where

00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,799
i developed the mathematical model for

00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,879
the dispersion of air pollutants

00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:01,120
which i run them on the high performance

00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,400
system and did the scalability analysis

00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:06,560
on ibm

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:10,560
sun solaris and other system during psd

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:12,720
then i joined ibm in 2010 where i was a

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,159
hpc application specialist for the

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,959
initial two years

00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:18,639
then i was part of ibm research where i

00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:22,000
chance to work in ibm

00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:25,600
uk at client site then i was

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,360
a technical computing leader from 2015

00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,560
to 2017

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,639
and right now i am a technical lead and

00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,440
senior metrologist the part of weather

00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:38,639
company from 2018 onwards

00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,520
onwards and i take care india and south

00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,960
asia

00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,880
um region so

00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,960
let's talk about the weather company how

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,120
it works what it does and

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,400
how the advanced technologies are being

00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,199
used

00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,720
so before uh so first thing first is

00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:57,440
what is the input and then

00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,360
how it gets the output i mean what is

00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,680
the input to make weather forecast and

00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,280
how

00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:07,280
how it is derived so whether company has

00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,960
their own approximately 200 000 weather

00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,080
station across the world they get input

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,840
from their

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,240
weather company doesn't believe in one

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,880
weather model so they run at a time

00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,400
around they have their own model which

00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,720
they run on their system and

00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,720
as well as they take the data from

00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,320
across the world various organization

00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,680
like european meteorological

00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:29,039
organization

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,560
um and then ncep and

00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:33,120
there are many other organizations

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,120
across the world so around total 178

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,240
forecast model are being used

00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:40,000
and symbol of those models being used to

00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,440
derive the forecast at the given

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,440
location

00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:47,120
we have so for vertical data the weather

00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,080
company have tie up with various

00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,160
airlines

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,320
where we give data weather data to

00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:55,440
airlines for their scheduling

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,720
and routing the flights as well as we

00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,759
get the data from

00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,600
the flights as they when they fly they

00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,120
they have the sensor so they give back

00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,840
the readings of the

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,319
weather in the vertical atmosphere the

00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,680
last

00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:12,080
is the example of iot where nowadays we

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,440
start taking the data from the mobile

00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,440
phone

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:18,000
a mobile phone with the weather channel

00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:21,039
app can provide us

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,560
pressure reading temperature pressure

00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:25,600
wind and humidity in general we know

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,319
that

00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,039
with mobile person may sit with air

00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,199
condition

00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,319
so the temperature and wind may not be

00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,400
correct

00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,440
so we take only pressure from those

00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,560
mobile

00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:40,400
now pressure in the given area if all

00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,319
many mobiles at one location the

00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,960
pressure will remain same

00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,880
and based on that those pressure reading

00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,039
being used as a data simulation

00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,440
technique in the weather model where

00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:52,160
we check the accuracy of the model as it

00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,880
progresses

00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,840
for the forecast and we correct it over

00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,880
the time

00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:01,039
right the

00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,000
now the next thing come is very

00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,639
important is how

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
frequently the forecast gets updated in

00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,560
our database

00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,400
so we update the forecast in every 15

00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:14,840
minutes in our database

00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:17,520
every time one gets the refresh

00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:19,840
forecast accuracy wise

00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,560
as any software developed the gartner

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,199
gives the

00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,440
rating for the accuracy the weather

00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:29,520
company forecast is being

00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:31,120
uh give check by independent agency

00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,919
called forecast watch

00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,199
which evaluate all the private agency

00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,039
provided forecast

00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,800
and ibm weather company is the number

00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,960
one in that

00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,919
precision wise we have coverage across

00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,160
the world

00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:47,599
so there is no issue any place in the

00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,599
world we have coverage

00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:56,479
right we should type

00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:57,360
in a segment so the weather company is

00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,720
well known

00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:04,160
and it has tie up with the uh

00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,759
so there we have on apple the default is

00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,800
weather channel app

00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:10,840
on google if you search any

00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,400
weather the first result come from

00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,560
weather.com

00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,879
in india the we have the tie up with the

00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,280
leading newspaper times of india

00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,639
there is a samsung phones high-end phone

00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:25,120
they have a default

00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:27,280
general app there is a facebook yahoo

00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,120
the weather.com weather provided weather

00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:33,200
and then cnn that also user

00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:36,560
ibm provide weather right

00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,640
now the next in this slide i would like

00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:42,080
to discuss about the data

00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:45,519
and how big the data being supported

00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,080
and on around the clock right so weather

00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,279
requests

00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:52,800
across the world can be asked anytime

00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:53,440
in the day and the number of calls what

00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,959
we

00:08:53,440 --> 00:09:00,800
support in a day is around 26 billion

00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:02,160
per day api request now the competitive

00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:05,040
scale for this is

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,080
on google what we do the search everyday

00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,240
search

00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,440
those are around six to seven billion

00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,480
search and

00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,320
on a given day so our volume to

00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,480
address the weather query is around four

00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:20,880
to five times more

00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:23,120
um then we ingest every day the 24 plus

00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,920
terabyte of data

00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,839
and then based on those data we derive

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,000
the solution of weather solutions

00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,120
so now the weather company is not only

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,279
the weather provide

00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,279
weather data providing company but we

00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,800
are providing solutions of weather data

00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:39,360
in various segments

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,560
those include agriculture renewable

00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,080
energy

00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:46,080
aviation logistic transportation

00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,000
any segment you say we have the solution

00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,320
based on weather data

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,200
all these data solutions are provided

00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,440
through cloud

00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,800
now the weather company all offerings

00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,920
are con

00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,640
migrated to the ibm cloud so ibm cloud

00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,120
is supporting

00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,360
all these infrastructure and we are up

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:06,880
around the cloud without any downtime

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:10,560
right we

00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:13,360
divided the earth into 2.2 billion

00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,959
grid points and every location which is

00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,640
a hyper local location

00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:20,959
every 500 meter by 500 meter resolution

00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:23,040
the weather data is available so any

00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:24,000
place like long given and there the

00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,920
weather data is

00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,680
available for the given location so

00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,120
now every location what we see across

00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:34,959
the world we provide

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:38,320
around 40 plus weather parameters

00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:41,200
at every location which include the rain

00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,000
precipitation or temperature humidity

00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,000
dew point

00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,959
wind visibility cloud cover

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,680
uv index moon phase moon rise sunset

00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,480
sunrise ghi is being used in renewable

00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,040
energy

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,680
weather severity and so on any parameter

00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,000
one needs

00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,519
we provide all the parameter so across

00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,160
the world all the parameters with the

00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,279
update of

00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,800
every 15 minutes that's the scale what

00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:08,320
weather companies

00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:12,160
are providing the weather forecast right

00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:14,800
how to get the data access so

00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,839
any place lat longs are being preferred

00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,480
so

00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,519
if we know any place like long one has

00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,920
to

00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:24,959
change in this url we give everything on

00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:27,760
cloud solution so based on api request

00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,240
one can access the weather data this url

00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,959
can be

00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,920
used for access the weather data so 15

00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:35,120
days forecast

00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:37,600
can be you can be

00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,480
obtained using this url where jio code

00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,120
is

00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,360
shows the location or where one is

00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,760
interested to fetch the forecast

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:48,079
the output format is json format which

00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:51,519
is easily integrable in any mobile app

00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:54,480
dashboard web page units

00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,360
ibm weather channel supports three kind

00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,000
of unit

00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,360
metric english and hybrid so different

00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,480
part of the word

00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:06,160
different units are supported but

00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:08,959
here user has option to select the unit

00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,079
language right now it is selected as

00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:13,120
english of us

00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:14,480
but we provide around 60 languages

00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,399
across the world

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,639
including few regional languages in

00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:22,720
india which are supported by the

00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:25,519
ibm weather service now the last is key

00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:28,160
so we give the any user the api key

00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,360
one can get those key and fetch the data

00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,079
it's so simple

00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:34,079
nothing else needs to be done the output

00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:36,720
will be json format as i said before

00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:40,399
which is easily integrable in

00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,440
company's application now i would like

00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,480
to talk

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,959
a little bit about ai how ai being used

00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,240
in the

00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:50,959
ibm provided weather forecast so as i

00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:53,120
said we have around 178

00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:54,720
model or 170 plus model the number

00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,360
varies here there

00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,800
depending on the time and you know the

00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,160
time of the day and

00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:04,160
when we are looking for but those models

00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:07,040
and those output vary in terms of

00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:10,160
resolution in terms of frequency

00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:13,680
in terms of the methodology used

00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:15,839
for you know getting those forecast data

00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,360
so first thing first we need to fuse all

00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:20,399
the model to make on a

00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:22,639
same forecast then we need to verify

00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,240
verify whether the forecast provided by

00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:27,440
those model making sense

00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:30,480
or it's a garbage and based on that

00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:32,320
finally we need to assign in

00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,959
some weightage for each model and then

00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,680
we need to find the right forecast which

00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:39,360
can be used

00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:40,720
at the given location right so generally

00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,920
the standard equation

00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,639
which is used is uh we need to find the

00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,920
bias

00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,399
first in the forecast if there is any so

00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,600
uh

00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:54,399
that bias is uh being

00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,199
estimated by using the forecast and what

00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,240
is the

00:13:55,199 --> 00:14:01,199
actual forecast so our algorithm

00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,560
continuously update the bias by taking

00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:05,920
the

00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:08,079
actual what happened to the day here is

00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,639
what the provided as the forecast so

00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:11,519
that what difference was there the bias

00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,399
is estimated

00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:16,720
based on that and same way when we we

00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,639
realized that which model working well

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,800
the weight is given according to that

00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:23,920
model and it's all dynamic

00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,519
operational so that's how the final

00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,839
forecast is derived

00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:32,240
using those many and symbol model

00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:35,120
um for example the if we want

00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,079
to know the temperature at noon on a

00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,000
given day

00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:39,360
there are various model each model is

00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,959
giving the temperature

00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:46,160
some say 60 degree and some says 50

00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:47,360
fahrenheit and so on so how to derive

00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,320
for the one

00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,519
what we do is we give the weight for the

00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:56,160
each model

00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:59,199
uh and then respective model forecast

00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,639
and after wait how they look like and

00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:02,880
based on that the final

00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,480
cost is being dived right the bias

00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:07,440
corrections has been done

00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:10,399
weight is given and then we derive the

00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,639
final forecast

00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,160
the next is i would like to discuss

00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:18,079
about the ibm

00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:21,360
graph model which is recently launched

00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:23,680
and this is a unique to ibm which is an

00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:26,079
application of ibm high performance

00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:28,800
computing system capability

00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:30,320
then the modeling work what ibm

00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,160
scientist has done

00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,000
and then how it is updating the

00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,000
continuous forecast

00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,360
which is helping to provide most

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,560
accurate forecast

00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,759
weather data by ibm weather company and

00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,600
which enables

00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:44,880
users to have solutions in their

00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,720
respective domains

00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:50,880
right so this is the weather model which

00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,880
run across the world on three kilometer

00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,440
resolution

00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,040
let me means there is a in a world

00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,519
hardly any one or two

00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:01,759
national agencies they are running their

00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,839
model at three kilometer resolution

00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,839
otherwise most of the government

00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:08,160
agencies across the world they run the

00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:11,600
model at 10 kilometer resolution

00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:13,839
so we are and then those agencies

00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,880
in general run the model at their for

00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,199
their country

00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,800
but where ibm is coming ibm would like

00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:20,639
to run the model

00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,040
for across the world because weather

00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:25,279
doesn't have any geographical barrier

00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,560
one country's weather impacts to another

00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:28,240
country that's why

00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:31,360
ibm is running the weather across the

00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,720
world right now it is being used for 15

00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,880
hour forecast

00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,720
but soon it will be used for longer

00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:39,040
terms

00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,199
it is being updated every hour so if you

00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,240
see any national agencies they generally

00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:45,199
update forecasts

00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:47,199
four times in a day whereas this model

00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:48,320
using ibm high performance computing

00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:51,759
capability

00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:53,839
it is able to run the model every hour

00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:54,880
and then frequency of output every five

00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,920
minutes we

00:16:54,880 --> 00:17:01,519
we store it is operational since

00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:04,559
uh last year november 2019

00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:06,480
and that's been used so these are

00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:08,079
technical details about the model that

00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,120
what data simulation technique and

00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:12,240
dynamic core

00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:15,199
so this model is called m-pass by

00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:17,120
and when ibm implemented we call it as

00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:20,400
ibm graph model

00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:23,760
it is being implemented on ibm

00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:28,160
power9 based system um

00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:31,200
which is a hybrid system in terms of

00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,320
cpu and gpu gpu is a graphics processing

00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,240
unit

00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:37,520
on which the number crunching is being

00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:40,160
done so ibm power9 system which has many

00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:41,440
gpu those gpus are being provided by

00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,160
nvidia

00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,039
and there this weather model is being

00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,559
off

00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:51,280
ported now it is the first weather model

00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:53,039
across the world which is running on gpu

00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,200
and operational

00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:56,799
it was it is the first model which run

00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,039
across the world

00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:00,000
operationally as well as it's the first

00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:04,559
operation model which

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,559
is running on gpu and cpu together right

00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:11,679
so um these are little more detail that

00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:12,160
this model has a variable resolution it

00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,400
can

00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:17,200
run over land at three kilometer and

00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:20,480
over ocean it's a 15 kilometer

00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:22,880
and this is empass as developed by the n

00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,600
car ibm collaborated with encore

00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,960
national center for atmospheric research

00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,440
and nvidia

00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,039
and then we developed ported this model

00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,120
on ibm system so

00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:35,440
here are the agencies which work with

00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:38,799
ibm to port this model

00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:42,400
so ncar university of wyoming uh

00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:45,280
nvidia ibm and the weather company

00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:47,600
uh this calibration only lead the

00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,559
empires that is accelerated on gpu so

00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,440
without gpu

00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:51,919
every hour update was not possible uh

00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,000
because

00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:56,080
everything on cpu is a there is a

00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,039
limitation in terms of heat in terms

00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,720
of you know number crunching so that's

00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:03,760
why it is being used

00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:06,640
now to make the things work on gpu the

00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:09,360
open sec directives were used

00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,679
uh you can see the right side the how

00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,080
the

00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:12,720
original code was and after in inserting

00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,840
open

00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:18,960
acc directives the how the code

00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,520
there are around 2 600 directives being

00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,520
used

00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,679
so accordingly the code lines are

00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:26,960
increased right

00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:30,480
now it took around two years to

00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:31,440
make it uh offloaded on gpu and make it

00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,640
work

00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:37,440
and now this is operational and

00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,480
the graph is available for an

00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,280
operational

00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:43,280
on gpu that's what it is this

00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:46,799
calibration lead to

00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:47,600
um a system size so approximately the

00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:50,880
system

00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:54,559
has 676 gpu node

00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:58,559
which each gpu node has a 4 gpu

00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:59,360
right so 76 into 4 those many gpus are

00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:02,960
there

00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:06,000
they are tesla v100 uh we have

00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:09,840
per node 16 cpu node

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:13,120
that is power 9 system um

00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:15,970
then there is a 6

00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:18,880
ddr4 memory and

00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:22,080
[Music]

00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:24,720
then on the nodes which has

00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,159
cpu and gpu there are 2 into 20 cores so

00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:29,679
40 core system

00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:32,880
that that is so

00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:36,159
now i would like to show where

00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:39,520
this graph is helping so um

00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:42,000
this is the live example uh

00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,799
i'm showing over india how the graph is

00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,880
helping

00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:48,000
so left side is the standard resolution

00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:51,039
being by

00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,640
any national agency around 10 to 12

00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:56,240
kilometer resolution

00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:58,720
right and right side is the resolution

00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:02,159
high resolution 3 kilo medium graph

00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,520
model uh this is the result from ibm

00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:05,280
graph model so in this picture i will

00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,440
show you the difference with

00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,120
higher resolution model and frequently

00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,840
update of the model

00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:13,039
first let's try to see the bottom of the

00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,520
screen

00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:18,240
uh if you see on sri lanka there is a

00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:20,320
wind stream coming this is sri lanka

00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,159
and here the wind stream is coming which

00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:26,559
is visible only in this

00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:28,159
graph model which is not visible in the

00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:29,919
coarser resolution or existing

00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:30,720
resolution model you see this wind

00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:32,880
stream

00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,400
that is going over sri lanka it is not

00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,280
at all captured by the

00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:40,320
coarser resolution model so we were not

00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:43,120
able to capture the weather phenomena

00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:44,080
more accurately before because the

00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,240
resolution was

00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,280
coarser and frequent update was not

00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,520
there

00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,320
similarly if you see the center part of

00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,080
india

00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:54,240
there is if we see the coarser

00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,840
resolution it shows the bigger area

00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:59,919
where it may rain

00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:02,240
and so darker the color it shows the

00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:04,559
higher the rain but it is showing the

00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,880
bigger area where it may rain and gives

00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:07,919
the tentative idea this red patches and

00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,919
all

00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:12,159
if you see the right side we are showing

00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:14,960
the small small patches red patches so

00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:17,440
it shows clearly at which location

00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,679
and how much rain will be there and that

00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:22,799
makes more accurate hyper local

00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:24,640
weather forecast right an example of

00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:26,480
this what we did is we worked with the

00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,799
ministry of agriculture

00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:33,280
in india where we provided the weather

00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:35,440
forecast to the 400 000 farmers

00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:38,159
and they were receiving the weather

00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:41,280
forecast every day for next seven days

00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:44,720
to plan their activity on the field

00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:46,640
on their mobile phone through sms so ibm

00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,360
worked with the ministry of agriculture

00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,280
where

00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,280
on their portal ibm enable the weather

00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:53,840
forecast and

00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:55,360
whether keys and all you are a link for

00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:57,520
a particular reason

00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,440
and then the ministry fetch fetched

00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:02,240
those forecasts and provided

00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:04,240
it to shared with the farmers so scale

00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,280
was every day four lakh farmer was

00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,360
receiving the

00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,799
weather forecast and finally we

00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:11,200
collected the feedback so

00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:12,880
the farmer appreciated and they that

00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,159
helped them in their decision making

00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,720
like when to irrigate

00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:18,080
how much to irrigate then when when to

00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,000
do harvesting and so on

00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,520
so that's where now the graph is helping

00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,559
to provide the hyper local weather

00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,880
forecast

00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:26,240
for the farmers or any user in any

00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:29,200
domain

00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:31,039
one more use case would be that in the

00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,520
renewable energy segment

00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:36,720
one has to predict the energy

00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:38,559
requirement at least 24 hours before

00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,760
based on the indian government rule in

00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:42,080
the exchange

00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:44,159
now to have the hyper local requirement

00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,799
of energy in the given area

00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:48,559
one has one should know the temperature

00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:50,480
and humidity in advance

00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:51,919
because higher the temperature the

00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:55,120
geezer runs more

00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:57,520
which warms the water and if

00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,400
the higher the humidity air conditions

00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,600
run more

00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:04,240
the requirement increases so accordingly

00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,440
so to know the hyper local weather ibm

00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,000
weather is helping the

00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:10,080
energy companies to know exactly what

00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,360
will be the weather for next 24 hours at

00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,760
the given location

00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,960
and accordingly those being used for the

00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:18,159
weather forecast

00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:21,760
right so this

00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:24,000
graph model is being used as i said

00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,559
right now it is being used for 15 hours

00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,679
so

00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:29,679
more focused is for next

00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:32,400
six hour what is the forecast it is

00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:35,600
being for all the mobile devices

00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:37,840
on television then on internet we have

00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:39,520
dashboard ibm dashboard through that we

00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:41,919
are providing the forecast

00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,720
and then the turbulence for aviation

00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:44,799
industry

00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:47,200
where will be the turbulence and for

00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:49,440
that also the graph model being used

00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,720
there are a few examples of ibm graph

00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:54,640
model

00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:57,120
with that i would like to end my session

00:24:54,640 --> 00:25:00,640
thanks for listening uh i would like to

00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,640
know if there is any q a

00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:05,600
