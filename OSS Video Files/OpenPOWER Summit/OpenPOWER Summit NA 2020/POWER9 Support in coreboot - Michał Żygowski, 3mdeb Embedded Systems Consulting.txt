	POWER9 Support in coreboot - Michał Żygowski, 3mdeb Embedded Systems Consulting

Speakers: Michał Żygowski

coreboot is an open source firmware development framework and its history is reaching 1999. Its primary goal was to boot the machine as fast as possible and launch a Linux kernel. OpenPOWER firmware has a similar goal: initialize the hardware and launch a Linux kernel. coreboot has always been in favor of open hardware and open firmware solutions. The best proof is that the first open firmware implementation for RISC-V appeared right here, in coreboot. Now the time comes for OpenPOWER. This talk will describe the plans of porting the POWER9 architecture to coreboot along with Talos II and Talos II Lite machines. With joint cooperation of 3mdeb Embedded Systems Consulting, Insurgo Technologies Libres/Open Technologies and Raptor Computing Systems this plan may become a reality in the near future. In this presentation, the details of the coreboot port for POWER9 will be discussed covering hostboot, skiboot and petitboot and how they fit into coreboot firmware model.
