	IBM open sources PowerAI as Open Cognitive Environment! - Jason Furmanek, IBM & Chris Sullivan, Oregon State University

Speakers: Chris Sullivan, Jason Furmanek

This talk is an introduction to a new open source project called Open Cognitive Environment (Open-CE).
Open-CE is a mid-stream integration community project that aims to foster collaboration between communities, vendors, user/enterprises, and academic institutions. Open-CE is designed to minimize the time to value and increase the consumability and inclusivity of important foundational AI and deep learning frameworks, libraries and tools, including TensorFlow and PyTorch, by providing a pre-integrated, multi-architectural set of recipes, build scripts, predefined Continuous Integration pipeline code and cutting edge models for building a complete environment of packages for AI development and/or production capacities.

Open-CE is based on the code from IBM's PowerAI project, which was launched to market as IBM Watson Machine Learning Community Edition. Therefore, Open-CE supports OpenPOWER (ppc64le) out of the box with options for GPU acceleration enablement throughout.
 
OpenCE provides even greater flexibility to users by embracing open source and removing barriers for users to build integrated packages and environments from source targeting platforms, environments and applications that users care about most. Build what you want, how you want it. We also hope to gain more members, users, builders and hosters for the project.
