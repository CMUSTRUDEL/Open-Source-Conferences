In this talk, we will look at the importance of Kubernetes Quality of Service, itâ€™s journey & evolution. QoS is a Kubernetes concept that is leveraged by the Kubernetes scheduler to make scheduling decisions about pods onto nodes. How will this benefit you? We were compelled after seeing significant improvement by merely switching between different QoS Classes & eventually exploiting POWER Architecture thus application performance boosted when compared to other architectures, so what changes now? A "DevOps" scenario with a workload similar to a MEAN stack (Mongo, Express, Angular, and Node) / PostgreSQL was selected to purposefully demonstrate the POWER Architecture value proposition when compared with other architectures.
