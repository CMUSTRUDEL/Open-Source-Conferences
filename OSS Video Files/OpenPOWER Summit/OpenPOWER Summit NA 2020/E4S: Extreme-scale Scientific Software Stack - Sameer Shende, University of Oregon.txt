	E4S: Extreme-scale Scientific Software Stack - Sameer Shende, University of Oregon

Speakers: Sameer Shende

The DOE Exascale Computing Project (ECP) Software Technology focus area is developing an HPC software ecosystem that will enable the efficient and performant execution of exascale applications. The Extreme-scale Scientific Software Stack (E4S) [https://e4s.io], is a coherent software stack that will enable application developers to write parallel applications that can target diverse exascale architectures. E4S provides both source builds through the Spack platform and a set of containers that feature a broad collection of HPC software packages. E4S exists to accelerate the development, deployment, and use of HPC software, lowering the barriers for HPC users. It provides container images, build manifests, and turn-key, from-source builds of popular HPC software packages developed as Software Development Kits (SDKs). It will introduce the E4S containers are being deployed at the HPC systems at DOE national laboratories using Singularity, Shifter, and Charliecloud container runtimes.
