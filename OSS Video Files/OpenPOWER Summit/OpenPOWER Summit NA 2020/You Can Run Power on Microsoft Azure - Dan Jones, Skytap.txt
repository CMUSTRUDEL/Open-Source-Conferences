Description: 
	You Can Run Power on Microsoft Azure - Dan Jones, Skytap

Speakers: Dan Jones

Microsoft Azure is the public cloud of choice for many organizations, but what about IBM Power systems? Now you can run your Power workloads on Microsoft Azure. In this session, join experts from Skytap to learn just how easy it can be. Skytap is a cloud service designed to natively run traditional applications, including AIX, IBM i, and Linux on Power, in the public cloud. In this session we will explore how Skytap partners with Microsoft to run Power in Azure, and we will discuss use cases from application development to key production workloads to disaster recovery.

hi everyone i'm dan jones svp of

00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,240
products of skytap

00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,160
i want to thank you for tuning in today

00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,480
i hope everyone is staying safe and that

00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,440
we can return to in-person events next

00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,719
year

00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,599
today i'm going to share with you what

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,560
skytap is doing with microsoft to enable

00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,279
running of ibm

00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,039
power workloads in azure i'm going to

00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:21,840
turn off my video for the presentation

00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,119
so the content

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,960
is maximized for your screen so here we

00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:28,800
go

00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,000
all right so let's get rolling so you

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,600
can run power

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,239
on microsoft azure we'll take a look at

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,800
the

00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,000
solution offering key capabilities and

00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,000
use cases

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,079
then jump into network and a bit of the

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,239
technical architecture

00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:47,680
walk through a demo and then talk about

00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:47,680
where the service is available

00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,239
skytap is designed to natively run ibm

00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,960
power applications in

00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:57,360
azure and i'll get into the architecture

00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,840
in a few slides but the key word here is

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,359
natively we're not doing emulation

00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,080
whatsoever

00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,799
this allows us to support all three os's

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,840
on power

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:10,320
aix ibm i and linux

00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,159
and we also support traditional x86

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,320
applications running on windows

00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,320
or linux these are apps that for

00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,159
whatever reason cannot run natively on

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,439
azure vms without some level of

00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,560
refactoring

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:25,360
we also see use cases where an x86

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,000
app needs to be deployed alongside the

00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:30,479
app components running on power

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,320
typically this is a requirement around

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,240
very low latency

00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,600
and the point of all this is to enable

00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,840
businesses to accelerate

00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,280
their migration to azure and spend more

00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,439
time on innovation

00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,119
than on refactoring or re-platforming

00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,560
their applications

00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,399
on the right-hand side you see a

00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,920
screenshot of our ui

00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,920
we'll see more of this in the demo

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,360
in terms of key capabilities top of the

00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,200
list is compatibility

00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,600
and we're focused on eliminating the

00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,880
need for any part of the power workload

00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:06,079
to be changed when moving from on-prem

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,399
into azure given the robustness

00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,520
of the platform this isn't always easy

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,520
and while i'll say

00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,280
our team has done an excellent job to

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,800
date of removing barriers

00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,879
there's still more work for us to do

00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,080
self-service has always been a hallmark

00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:23,840
of of our design

00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:26,480
principles prior to skytap i worked in a

00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,239
an i.t at a large retailer and every

00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,360
time my team needed a vm

00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,959
or config change to a vm we had to open

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:37,200
a support ticket

00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:39,680
and wait wait for the operations team

00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,480
to get it into their queue get it

00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:45,200
prioritized and act on the ticket

00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,319
also across all of it and app dev we

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,879
maintained

00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:50,080
numerous static integration environments

00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,680
and these are always in

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,280
different states of i'll call it

00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,360
correctness

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,959
all this is total nonsense and a waste

00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,519
of resources

00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,319
skytap allows controlled delegation of

00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,319
action

00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,720
so as an admin you can effectively

00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:06,800
sandbox individuals and teams

00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,360
enabling them to manage within their

00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,599
quota but stay focused on productive

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,560
activities not waiting for tickets to be

00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:15,200
prioritized

00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,239
and acted upon it also ensures that you

00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,040
can control

00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:22,159
spend so individual users can't rack up

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,159
large monthly bills

00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,120
with extensibility skytap can be

00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,360
integrated into existing tool chains

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,560
such as terraform we happen to have a

00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,959
terraform provider

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,920
but through our restful apis you can

00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,560
integrate into

00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,959
other aspects of your tool chain and

00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,840
automation is such a key element of ci

00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,239
cd

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,519
that that integration is is really

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,920
critical

00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,760
in addition since we're running in azure

00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,959
you have low latency access to native

00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,640
azure services

00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,159
to extend the value of your power

00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,280
workloads

00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:56,560
and lastly certainly not least is

00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,239
agility

00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,080
i mentioned before the static

00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,720
integration environments that we had to

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,920
maintain

00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,120
in my previous employer a key concept

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,439
within skytap

00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,959
is an environment and you can think of

00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:11,439
this as a virtual

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,159
data center that encapsulates compute

00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,640
network

00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:16,160
and storage and data there are some cool

00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,239
things you can do with environments to

00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,959
increase the productivity of your teams

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:22,320
such as eliminating the need to babysit

00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,479
static environments

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,400
and instead focusing on innovation we'll

00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:29,840
see more of those capabilities

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,840
when we get to the demo

00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:37,120
for use cases typical set production dr

00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:39,040
dev test virtual labs i'd like to use

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,720
some customer examples for each one of

00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,600
these to highlight what our customers

00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,840
are doing

00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,639
how they're using the service to make

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,960
good on

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,240
each of these individual use cases so

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,639
for production

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,759
a large food large food processing

00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:56,080
company

00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:58,240
think hams bacon hot dogs etc their

00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:01,120
manufacturing control system

00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,400
runs on aix while they were up against a

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,160
hardware refresh

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,680
they really didn't want to do the

00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,720
capital outlay

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:11,360
to refresh their their hardware platform

00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,639
so they moved all of the aix components

00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,720
into skytap

00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,000
they still have some x86 components that

00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,240
run on-premises

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
and they're using vpn to connect between

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,320
skytap and on-premises

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,360
and then that manages all their

00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,639
production

00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,880
manufacturing control systems they also

00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,479
have in their situation they have some

00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:33,280
non-production environments

00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:34,400
that they use to validate changes before

00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,440
they deploy them

00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:39,039
to production those environments

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,479
they just bring up when they need it and

00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,240
then they shut it down when they don't

00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:44,400
need it

00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,080
disaster recovery is a use case that

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,800
we've really seen

00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,000
sort of take off in the last 12 months

00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,479
or so

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,120
to illustrate here there's a high-end

00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:57,440
furniture and textile manufacturer

00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,960
on the east coast they run all their

00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:02,000
manufacturing systems on

00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:04,400
ibm i they used to do daily backups

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,800
and then store those off-site and in the

00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:09,919
event of a disaster they would

00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:12,400
bring the backups back on site and

00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:14,560
uh get back up and running that's all

00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,280
fine as long as you don't lose your

00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,160
production

00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,639
site which in 2012 they happen to lose

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:23,039
their production site because of

00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,800
hurricane sandy so they lost all power

00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,960
to their production site

00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,600
so they brought in maxeva which is an

00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:33,840
isv in the ibmi space that has

00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,960
a disaster recovery solution and skytap

00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,280
they brought up

00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,240
they brought online ibm i instances in

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,880
skytap

00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,840
and deployed max ava between on-prem and

00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,960
skytap

00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,560
to do a hot dr solution this

00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,400
they're currently streaming about 6

00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,280
million transactions per day

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:53,039
between on-prem and skytap and now if

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,479
they hit an outage on their main server

00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,400
or their main data center

00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,000
they can quickly be back up and running

00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,080
with zero data loss

00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,120
so pretty exciting for them a game

00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,960
changer for them

00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,720
and they're able to do this without

00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,759
having to go do a big capital

00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,280
outlay for a second data center and a

00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,599
second set of hardware

00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,639
they can run only what they need to run

00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,319
to keep dr

00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,000
up and running and then in the event of

00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,000
a disaster they can bring

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,919
the system up to sort of full speed if

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,880
you will

00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:23,840
in the dev and test space i mentioned

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,599
what the

00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,120
food processing company is doing with

00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:30,319
non-production environments

00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,000
another good example here an isv who

00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:35,199
provides a data operations

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,880
platform to retail consumer packaged

00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,759
goods financial services and other

00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,240
industries

00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,319
well their solution only supported suse

00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,919
linux on x86

00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,360
but they were faced with a significant

00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:47,199
sales opportunity

00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,759
where they needed to validate their

00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:52,639
software on suse on power

00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,759
the customer was already running linux

00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,680
on power

00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,479
for various other workloads and they

00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,560
wouldn't accept an x86 solution

00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:02,240
the isv didn't have any access to power

00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,520
hardware they didn't really know what

00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,479
they were going to do

00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:08,400
well in walk skytap and within a week

00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:10,240
their test engineers were able to stand

00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:13,120
up the skytap environment

00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,919
on an ibm power platform running suse

00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,039
linux

00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:19,199
deploy their software and

00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,240
perform a smoke test to verify that

00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,560
their tool sets

00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,599
such as qa automation would work as

00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,919
expected

00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:27,759
everything worked beautifully and they

00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:29,680
immediately moved into performing their

00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:32,240
full set of regression tests

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,599
confirming that their platform worked in

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,360
the customers environment

00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,120
so it was a big win for them and they

00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,919
were able to do that with no capital

00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,039
outlay

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:44,000
in a very short amount of time

00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,560
the last use case virtual labs we see

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,120
two

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,920
sort of sub-use cases here one are sales

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,959
demos

00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,800
where at an isv their sales teams are

00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:53,760
doing demos of their product to their

00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,080
customer base or

00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,680
opportunities and virtual training where

00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,399
they're delivering training of their

00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,600
product

00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,880
to their customers well uh

00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,120
well we don't have a lot of power

00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,920
customers that are doing this just yet

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,120
we do have a large number of x86

00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:12,240
customers

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:14,080
using skytap for these two use cases one

00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,920
example that comes to mind as a

00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,000
networking and network security software

00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:21,120
company they were hosting

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,000
60 to 70 in-person events a year

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,680
then the pandemic hit which canceled all

00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,760
in-person events

00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:30,399
their com their competitors started

00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:33,120
offering webinars and online training

00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,399
well with skytap they were able to

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,320
quickly respond

00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,160
uh to what their competitors were doing

00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,480
by offering free virtual hand

00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,080
hands-on training events running all

00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,720
those on top of skytap

00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,839
today they're hosting up to 150

00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,760
attendees

00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,519
at any given time and if they have

00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,519
last-minute registrations

00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,800
they can easily accommodate those

00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,360
students

00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,959
bring them online with very little

00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,120
effort whatsoever

00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,800
so they get that elasticity and

00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,120
contraction as they need

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,399
based on what what they need to the

00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,120
number of students that they need to

00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,880
train

00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,399
well without skytap they wouldn't have

00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,000
been able to respond as quickly as they

00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,880
did to the changes in the market

00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,880
and the competition

00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,800
network architecture and i'll talk a

00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,399
little bit about the technical

00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,000
architecture as well

00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,440
so on the left-hand side you have the

00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,399
on-premises data center

00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:26,320
right-hand side you have an azure region

00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,720
within the azure region

00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,560
you have the azure subscription that's

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,720
the customer subscription there they

00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:35,760
have their azure vms azure vnets

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,760
and native services like sql azure on

00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,640
the right-hand side you have skytap on

00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,959
azure

00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,959
and the blue box and skytap on azure

00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:45,600
labeled azure dedicated

00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,880
there's a azure engineering team that is

00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,279
responsible for

00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,160
these non-standard workloads such as

00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:53,279
skytap

00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,959
netapp cray and others so we work

00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,480
closely with them we have been over the

00:10:54,959 --> 00:11:00,959
last couple of years

00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:04,720
to deploy our exact specification

00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:07,440
for hardware into an azure region and so

00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,560
microsoft does that deployment for us we

00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,120
layer skytap

00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:13,680
on top of that this is what allows us to

00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:16,000
natively run power applications in azure

00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:18,959
microsoft is purchasing ibm power

00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,160
hardware and deploying it on our behalf

00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:24,720
under the covers we deploy s922s

00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:27,760
the 922 was chosen specifically because

00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:30,399
it has such amazing price to performance

00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:32,079
ratio and covers a significant portion

00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,519
of the power workloads we can run all

00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:36,240
three operating systems

00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:38,560
on a 922 but there are some workloads

00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,680
especially large ibm i applications

00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:43,760
that the 922 can't handle this is

00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:46,720
somewhat a licensing restriction from

00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:48,720
ibm on what they limit the 922

00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,839
to run for ibm i and not a hardware

00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,399
limitation

00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:54,240
however we're at work on a separate

00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:55,200
offering think of it as a second power

00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,519
vm type

00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,040
to address these larger workloads but

00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:01,600
since this is still under development

00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:04,480
that's about all i can say at this time

00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,440
so from a network infrastructure they're

00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,519
separate so

00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,680
your your software-defined networks on

00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:12,160
azure are separate from your azure

00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:14,639
v-nets so you'd attach your power vms

00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:17,920
and your x86 vms running in skytap

00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:20,079
to a skytap sdn your azure vms to an

00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,079
azure v-net but you can connect the

00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:24,800
v-net and the skytap

00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,600
networks together through an azure vpn

00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,639
gateway

00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,519
or through express route and given the

00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,399
proximity

00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:34,639
of the service of skytap and the and the

00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,959
azure services in the same region

00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,880
the ping times on average over the vpn

00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,240
gateway or four to five milliseconds

00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,200
which is fine for

00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,959
most applications and then average ping

00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,399
times over express router about half

00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:48,399
that

00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,680
and to connect to on-premises you can

00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,079
use express route

00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:54,079
you could use azure vpn gateway or you

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:58,160
could connect a vpn directly between

00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:58,160
on-premises and skytap

00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:02,880
so let's do a demo

00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,160
okay we're into our demo i'm logged into

00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:11,200
the product and i'm

00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,800
currently viewing my environments so in

00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,120
environments can be private to a

00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,839
particular user or i can share them out

00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:20,720
with other users such would be the case

00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:23,760
with a production or dr type environment

00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,279
and as a reminder environments are are

00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,959
you can think of them as a virtual data

00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,519
center so they're an encapsulation of

00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:30,720
compute

00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:32,399
network and storage

00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,760
if i go into this environment which

00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,920
isn't running

00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:39,600
we'll take a quick tour of it so i have

00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:41,680
three vms i have some x86 vms a power vm

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,279
i have a number of networks defined in

00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,639
here i have some networks that don't

00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:46,880
have things attached to them

00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,760
i have other networks where i have vms

00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,240
attached and

00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,920
vms can attach to multiple networks so

00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:55,199
you can have multiple nics

00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:57,040
on a vm to do whatever network

00:13:55,199 --> 00:14:00,079
partitioning you need to do and you have

00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,519
full control over the subnet ranges

00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:03,199
now some interesting things i can do

00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:06,000
with an environment

00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:08,000
is i can save it off as a template which

00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:12,000
creates a read-only version

00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:14,079
of that environment customers will

00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,240
in non-production scenarios will

00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:17,279
integrate skytap into their ci cd

00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,320
pipeline

00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:21,040
and after each good build they'll create

00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,519
a template

00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,800
from that good build and that way

00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:29,199
testers have a known

00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:30,320
good place to go grab a test environment

00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:32,240
they don't have to go through any

00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,040
configuration they know it pass smoke

00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,800
tests

00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,800
they can create their own copy of it and

00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,240
get up and running very quickly

00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,920
the other thing i can interesting thing

00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,680
i can do with an environment is

00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,360
i can create a copy of it i can create a

00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:46,399
clone of it

00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:49,279
so we'll name it demo2 it's copy

00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,480
and we'll go copy now what this is doing

00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,959
under the covers is

00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,920
it's making an exact copy of all these

00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,760
vms

00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,680
all of the networks all of the

00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,000
configuration so if i have

00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,600
vm sequencing enabled on this because i

00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,480
want the vms to come up in a certain

00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,040
order

00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,839
all that metadata is copied along with

00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:09,120
it

00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:13,120
this creates a new isolated environment

00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:15,360
same three vms same networks

00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,320
and because environments are isolated

00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,199
anything i do

00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,920
in this copy doesn't impact the original

00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:23,279
one

00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:27,199
so a very very powerful capability

00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:27,920
within skytap so where do environments

00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:30,399
come from

00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,120
i mentioned the notion of the concept of

00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,360
templates

00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,360
if we go over and look at our templates

00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,199
users can have their own templates

00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,680
you can have company-wide templates that

00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,480
you share out and we have some public

00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,880
templates

00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:45,519
as well let me scroll down here and find

00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:49,040
a complex one so this template has

00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:51,199
11 vms it has seven networks so again a

00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,759
template encapsulates all the vms the

00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:53,839
data

00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:55,600
the networks et cetera and creating a

00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:57,839
new one is as easy as saying

00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,880
new environment if we take a look at our

00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,120
public templates

00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,320
so these are ones that we make available

00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,759
we have some ibm i

00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:08,800
public templates so here's one for 7.4

00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:10,880
it only contains one vm and one network

00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,160
but i can say new environment and this

00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:16,959
will say

00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:16,959
open power if i can type

00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,000
and say go and what this is going to do

00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,160
is from that public template

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,199
it's going to create a new environment

00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,320
for me

00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:31,120
with this single ibm i vm in it so

00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,800
great way to get started very rapidly

00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,000
with the product is just using those

00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,959
public templates

00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,240
and then start migrating your lpars into

00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,680
it

00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,399
so let me go back out and take we'll

00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:45,040
take a look at a running

00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:46,720
environment so here's our open power

00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:49,279
demo

00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:51,759
environment this one has more vms in it

00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:55,600
so it has 11 vms

00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:58,800
again a mixture of x86 vms and power

00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,720
vms i mentioned vm sequencing

00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,560
power options so if this was a dev or

00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,079
test environment that you didn't want

00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,760
running 24 hours a day

00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,360
you could set it up on a schedule so

00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:10,799
that it would shut down at a certain

00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:14,799
particular time each day now

00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:17,439
accessing vms is really straightforward

00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:18,720
i could if i had this vpn back into my

00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:22,079
on-premises

00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,039
then i could certainly do an ssh session

00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:26,160
into it

00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:27,120
i could put a public ip on it to access

00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,120
it over

00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,880
over the public internet where i could

00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:34,400
ssh into it

00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:36,960
or we provide a secure connection

00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,160
which is a browser-based access directly

00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:42,720
into the console

00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:45,679
and so here i can log into this

00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:47,840
vm over this secure connection and it's

00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:51,440
just like i'm sitting at the console

00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:54,720
so very straightforward very easy

00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,919
if it's a if it's a windows vm or a vm

00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,039
with a ui

00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:01,039
you get a full gui interface for

00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,679
non-production scenarios you might want

00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:04,960
to save

00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:07,200
credentials along with the vm now

00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,520
you still have to have access to to

00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:12,559
skytap or access to that environment

00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:14,000
in order to to access it but

00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:15,840
but this saves you from having to have

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,880
an excel spreadsheet somewhere with

00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,280
credential saved off and then we can log

00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,240
it in

00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,960
log into there and we have a full gui

00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,960
interface

00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:28,480
that we're essentially at the console of

00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:30,960
the vm

00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,720
if i jump over here i have an ibm i vm

00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,120
running i'm already logged into it so

00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,760
you get the beautiful green screen

00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,640
and you can do stuff you know any of

00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:42,240
your favorite

00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:44,480
ibm i commands so here we are

00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,520
on the system status and i'm going to

00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,200
hit f5

00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:49,440
if you look at the clock up here it's

00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,440
going to refresh so

00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,480
it's just like being at the console and

00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,360
again

00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,320
i could use i could use a local client

00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,480
to connect to this

00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,160
if i was if i had a vpn connection or

00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:03,919
put a public ip

00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:05,919
on it if i flip over

00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:07,200
to another environment so here i have an

00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:12,240
aix and a

00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:14,240
linux vm running as i think it's ubuntu

00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,000
and these are connected so these are

00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,880
connected to a single network and this

00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,480
single network

00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:22,080
has a vpn connection over to azure

00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,520
so i'll flip over here to my azure

00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,760
account and

00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,280
in my resource group i have my vpn

00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:30,960
gateway defined

00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:34,640
i have my i have a vm

00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:36,840
azure vm running on here its ip address

00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,240
is

00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,000
10.5.0.5

00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,320
and if i come back over to my

00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,880
environment

00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:47,120
i can go ahead and get to the console of

00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:50,840
this vm

00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:53,840
and i'm already logged in and i can ping

00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,840
10.5.0

00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,679
so we can ping that and if i switch over

00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:00,400
to my

00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,400
ubuntu

00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:08,880
vm let's get

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,880
logged back in

00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:19,919
and i can ping 10.5.0.5

00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,880
pretty cool and i can do i think i have

00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:23,520
a trace route

00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,360
in here um so there's a tracer out to my

00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:28,159
other to my aix vm

00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:29,120
you know it jumps right there and here's

00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:32,400
the trace route

00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,640
out to that azure vm so you can see that

00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,039
it's

00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,760
it's going through our gateway is

00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:38,720
traversing

00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:40,080
over the vpn gateway and then it's

00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:43,440
hitting the azure

00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:45,840
vm so that's how i would bridge that

00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:49,679
again i could use azure vpn gateway

00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:54,080
or i could use route to connect my

00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:55,600
my skytap network out to my azure v-net

00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,840
now there's a whole other host of

00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,559
features that we don't have time to go

00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,240
over

00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:02,960
as administrators you can create

00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,559
sandboxes for users and groups of users

00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,679
and limit the resources that they have

00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,679
available to them

00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:08,799
there's a fairly robust auditing system

00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:11,440
so you can track

00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:12,880
what's what users are doing who did what

00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,159
and when

00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,000
another interesting thing is for

00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:17,840
production environments you can

00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,440
lock the environment and so this will

00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:24,320
prevent anybody from making

00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:24,320
inadvertent changes to the environment

00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:30,240
so let's pause there and jump back over

00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:32,720
to the presentation

00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,840
all right so from uh in terms of

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,760
availability

00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:38,480
we're currently available in azure's

00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:40,320
east u.s region out of virginia

00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,640
we're in the process of expanding to

00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:44,960
azure regions in south central us

00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,760
out of texas west europe which is in

00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,159
amsterdam

00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,679
and southeast asia which is hosted out

00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:51,440
of singapore

00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:52,960
these are currently underway and i

00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,000
expect them to come online before the

00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,000
end of the year

00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,679
and we're in discussions with the azure

00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
team on the next set of regions but

00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:01,679
nothing to announce today

00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,440
we are available in the azure

00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:05,520
marketplace if you log in with your

00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,640
azure credentials search the marketplace

00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,320
for skytap

00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,159
and you can provision a service and

00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:13,760
start running your first power workload

00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:14,720
in under 10 minutes default pricing is

00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,559
pay as you go

00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,320
so you're going to pay by the hour we

00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:20,080
monitor down to the second but think of

00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:23,120
it as paying by the hour

00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:26,480
for compute it's gigabyte ram hour

00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:27,280
so if you have a 2 2 gig lpar you run

00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,480
for one hour

00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:31,679
that'd be two gigabyte ram hours worth

00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,400
of compute

00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:35,039
aix licensing is included in the cost of

00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,320
compute

00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:40,400
ibm i os licensing has a separate charge

00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:43,679
um that we make available through the

00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:45,520
service and then linux is byol

00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:47,280
storage is calculated by the gigabyte

00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:49,200
hour now storage

00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,480
you pay for what you consume compute

00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,559
you're only paying for compute when

00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,159
you're running it so if you shut it down

00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:55,840
then you're only paying for the storage

00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:57,520
behind that

00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:00,000
in the next few weeks we'll be releasing

00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:01,280
support for reserved capacity

00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,880
this is where you make a yearly

00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,080
commitment to a certain amount of

00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,480
capacity

00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:08,720
and for that commitment you get a lower

00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,960
price but it's a use it or lose it

00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:13,520
type of commit commitment you can think

00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:17,440
of this as a bit like reserved instances

00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,440
but a little more flexibility

00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:22,080
