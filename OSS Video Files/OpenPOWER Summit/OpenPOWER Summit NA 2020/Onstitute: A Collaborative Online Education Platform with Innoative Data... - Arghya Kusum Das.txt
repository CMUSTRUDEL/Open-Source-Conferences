	Onstitute: A Collaborative Online Education Platform with Innoative Data-Education Curriculum - Arghya Kusum Das

Speakers: Arghya Kusum Das, Ph.D.

Starting from enterprise applications to scientific and engineering applications to applications in humanities and liberal arts need data analytics. However, with the current expanse of data science education, it is far from satisfying this huge demand for skilled data-labors which is growing exponentially. Data-education curriculums should be innovated to teach students from multiple disciplines regarding analytics with hands-on experience also required demonstrating the scale of applications. In this presentation, I will present 'Onstitute', a collaborative online education platform, that brings real-world data analytics experience at scale to the students utilizing the power of virtualization on top of cutting edge HPC technology such as, POWER-based hardware. I will demonstrate and discuss the innovative features of the platform together with curriculum plans, real case studies, and a future roadmap to improve the data-learning-outcomes of the students from different backgrounds.
