Description: 
	Onstitute: A Collaborative Online Education Platform with Innoative Data-Education Curriculum - Arghya Kusum Das

Speakers: Arghya Kusum Das, Ph.D.

Starting from enterprise applications to scientific and engineering applications to applications in humanities and liberal arts need data analytics. However, with the current expanse of data science education, it is far from satisfying this huge demand for skilled data-labors which is growing exponentially. Data-education curriculums should be innovated to teach students from multiple disciplines regarding analytics with hands-on experience also required demonstrating the scale of applications. In this presentation, I will present 'Onstitute', a collaborative online education platform, that brings real-world data analytics experience at scale to the students utilizing the power of virtualization on top of cutting edge HPC technology such as, POWER-based hardware. I will demonstrate and discuss the innovative features of the platform together with curriculum plans, real case studies, and a future roadmap to improve the data-learning-outcomes of the students from different backgrounds.

	00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:07,359
all right i think i should start uh

00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,880
so good afternoon everybody uh i am

00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:12,160
arguable

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,240
and i am from uh university of

00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,080
wisconsin at platteville i am an

00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:20,000
assistant professor there

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:23,680
so uh regarding uh some of my

00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,960
regarding my background a little bit uh

00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,880
so i my interest

00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,080
research interest is mostly like big

00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,280
data analytics

00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:36,880
and artificial intelligence and

00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:39,040
that part and i also enjoy like the data

00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,320
engineering data infrastructure and all

00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:44,239
those parts

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:47,680
so today i am going to describe

00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:50,960
uh institute which is a new

00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:54,160
online education platform uh for

00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,320
innovative data education curriculum and

00:00:54,160 --> 00:01:00,640
i am also going to describe

00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:02,399
how am i doing all these things and what

00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,479
are the students experience in our

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,840
university and all these things

00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:11,280
uh so and i will try to finish

00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:14,560
the presentation by

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,159
25 minutes and after that we can have a

00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,360
question answer session

00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:22,479
uh if you haven't i'll be happy to

00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:25,520
uh answer so

00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:30,799
uh first of all uh

00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,799
let's start with a brief background of

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,840
a brief background of uh what is the

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,880
current

00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,520
state of data science education so one

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,680
of the

00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,640
major focus for the data science is like

00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,520
data science

00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,399
is creating lots of jobs data science is

00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,040
uh

00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,920
making more money for the people and all

00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,159
these things

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,680
but at the same time there are some

00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,840
revolution happening in the

00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,560
in terms of education in data science

00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,560
also so these big data artificial

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,200
intelligence high performance computing

00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,719
they are

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,560
actually changing the domain of

00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:08,720
education also and honestly nowadays

00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,759
this ai and big data education has

00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,800
become a

00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:14,959
huge market uh so let's

00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,040
analyze let's see what is the current

00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:21,599
state of data science education

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:24,239
here so um if we look at the domain of

00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:27,200
big data analytics and everything we can

00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,840
broadly classify this domain into three

00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,400
different

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,200
three major different domains the first

00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,239
one is

00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,920
uh programming models like mapreduce

00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,519
graph processing no sql

00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,680
then there are some analysis type like

00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,480
batch analysis stream analysis and all

00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,000
those things

00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:45,599
and finally we have something like these

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,200
different types of

00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:51,040
hardware let's say these disk based and

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,000
in memory and all these things

00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,400
so what is happening if you take any of

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
this

00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:00,080
combination uh there is a new technology

00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,480
being proposed every day for example

00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,480
like map reviews batch analysis with

00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,840
disk based computing that means the

00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,200
hadoop framework

00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:11,920
let's say this nosql uh

00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,640
interactive or bad interactive query in

00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,599
memory

00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,400
that is uh let's say readys so lots of

00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,480
different

00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,800
things are being proposed and on top of

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,879
that there are lots of performance

00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,440
analysis tools also which are being

00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,640
proposed

00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,640
every day so how to keep up with all

00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:32,159
these technology

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:35,200
changes this is really a hard job

00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:38,400
for any instructor

00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:42,159
so the next thing is uh like

00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:45,200
not only these uh

00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:47,360
big data analytic things there are a

00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,720
huge revolution in terms of artificial

00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,280
intelligence there are like

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,720
uh this is not only confined into

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,159
traditional machine learning

00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,159
there are deep learning statistical

00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:57,519
learning transfer learning and so on and

00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:00,720
on and on

00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:03,360
and on furthermore uh there

00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,040
are like revolution happen in terms of

00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,599
high performance computing

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,760
so there are several things that have

00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:12,239
been improved like cpu speed

00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,120
gpu flops io performance memory

00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,160
performance

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:18,079
lots of things have been changed and

00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,639
not only that there are like different

00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,880
types of cluster architecture based on

00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,919
the business demand have been proposed

00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,800
like super computing cluster cloud based

00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,120
cluster

00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,720
commodity cluster what is scale up scale

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,759
out lots of different things have been

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,720
proposed

00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,880
ah so you now if we just try to look at

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,800
the mode of education how to

00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,560
teach all these different technologies

00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,960
and different things we will see that

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,040
okay

00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,639
the traditional offline mode is still

00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,639
there like this

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,880
synchronous face to face learning and

00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:51,280
everything uh but

00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,199
there is some problem in traditional

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,560
learning there is like it totally

00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:57,919
depends on the personal

00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,680
interest of the instructor uh if the

00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:03,039
instructor is not up

00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,080
up to the change then the learning curve

00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:06,720
will go down

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,840
and then there is limited collaboration

00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,160
opportunities

00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,960
also there like other staffing and admin

00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,960
issues like

00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,240
universities cannot invest just like

00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,560
that for a

00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,600
computing infrastructure or uh they

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,639
cannot hire

00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:24,000
many people at the same time so

00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:26,960
uh those are the problems for offline

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,759
although online have uh the online

00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,639
education

00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,039
uh have been uh have alleviated some of

00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,560
these

00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:36,000
problems but still these things are

00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,240
really like

00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,440
most of these online courses are like

00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,000
very much

00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,199
lecture heavy so that means there is not

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,360
much proactive

00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,600
interaction between teachers and

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:51,039
students not much of hands-on

00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,080
and also like many people are like

00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,560
skeptic about

00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,400
ability to apply the skills learned and

00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,720
also there is some

00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,919
things like in terms of data education

00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,400
there is a

00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,840
comment like there is a low investment

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,680
on return

00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,520
and also there is some kind of like

00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:11,199
hybrid mode of education

00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:13,440
uh where students can get access to many

00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,960
different resources they can talk to the

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:18,319
instructor but still

00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,880
uh when it comes to the real big data or

00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,919
ai

00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:25,280
education the question is is it enough

00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:28,720
where is the infrastructure part

00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:32,000
and all these things so uh the question

00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:34,319
is how to evolve how to change your

00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,039
educational infrastructure how to design

00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,639
the course

00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:40,240
or rather what is the way out to evolve

00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,039
the education with the technology

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,520
changes

00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:48,400
or like let's say how to bring the hpc

00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:49,039
infrastructure into education in a cost

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:53,280
uh

00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:55,360
effective way so these uh

00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,319
to answer all these things a

00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,479
collaborative

00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,919
infrastructure or a collaboration is

00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,160
extremely important

00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,960
so that's what i am going to discuss in

00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,039
here

00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,880
so first let us discuss about the issues

00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,400
and challenges in the online data

00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,479
related courses

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,840
first there is a course structure

00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:14,479
related issues

00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,080
courses are like very much lecture heavy

00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:19,840
and fewer are trivial

00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:23,440
hands-on and also it is uh very hard

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:25,520
that where to focus on how to teach for

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,560
a fundamental data science course or

00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,479
something like that

00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,560
uh whether you should learn tensorflow

00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:33,199
whether you should learn tokai torch

00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,039
and how to manage all these things how

00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:38,080
to take care of the learning

00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:41,280
needs of the students the

00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,000
second one is the infrastructure related

00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,319
issues

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,720
in the online mode of course there is

00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,360
virtual lab experience and all these

00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,960
things

00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:54,000
but uh ui experience does not feel like

00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,199
real world many times you will work on

00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,879
some kind of let's say

00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:00,960
the web-based c plus plus compiler or

00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,440
web-based python compiler something like

00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,120
that

00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:06,879
but when you move to industry and when

00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,160
you start working in the real

00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:11,599
infrastructure

00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:14,000
that experience is totally

00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:15,520
different sometimes and in some of the

00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,039
universities uh

00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,039
they really do not have the

00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,599
infrastructure backend infrastructure

00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,919
even

00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,800
not only university uh some small

00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,280
companies and

00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,160
everyone and not the great

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:30,240
infrastructure

00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:32,800
is uh accessible to all so there is a

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,440
problem with the course infrastructure

00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,159
also

00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,919
so as a result what we can see is uh if

00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:42,880
it is an online or whatever

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:46,640
mode of education learning in the first

00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:49,519
few uh for in the first place it is uh

00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,519
very nice uh when it comes to the theory

00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,080
part and all these things that learning

00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,880
part is

00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,640
excellent but in the end when the

00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,200
practical learning learning come into

00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,640
picture

00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,160
uh it is very poor uh and at the same

00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,640
time we can see that

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,880
there is a lots of students are

00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:09,839
enrolling for different types of data

00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,200
courses available over internet but

00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,080
there is a

00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:16,240
very big issue in terms of student

00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:19,680
retention

00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:23,600
so how to take care of all

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:26,320
those things that i will uh

00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,440
that i will discuss about uh in this

00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,880
presentation

00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:34,320
so the uh so the

00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:37,600
thing that we have to focus really on

00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:40,800
is a collaborative mode of

00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:43,519
learning like uh collaborative solution

00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,800
means uh it i'm not talking only about

00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,360
like collaborating with

00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,920
one or two industry partner and like

00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,120
that

00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,720
but what i am trying to say is a unified

00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,760
learning solution or an

00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:58,959
entire ecosystem uh which

00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,320
can uh nurture the improved nurture and

00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:03,760
improve the collaboration

00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:07,360
experience so if we see the traditional

00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:11,120
experiences so far we can see that

00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:12,880
the entire uh ecosystem was confined

00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:16,160
into the first two part like

00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:18,079
the learning solution and the software

00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:22,000
or middleware because

00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:22,800
uh there are like uh very few infrastruc

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,640
i mean

00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,160
most of the things were like all the

00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,000
software uh

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,640
they have like windows support they have

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,440
like linux support and all these things

00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,000
and there were not much variation in

00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,360
terms of

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,240
hpc platform or there was not much of

00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,800
the software

00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,440
uh being proposed to address some

00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,480
specific

00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:47,440
issues so all those things were there so

00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,640
in terms of choice there was some

00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,760
limitation

00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:56,000
but in the last few years if we

00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:58,480
look back then we will see there is a

00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,160
revolution happen every day new

00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,640
technologies are being proposed

00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,399
and not all the technology supports all

00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,000
the different types of infrastructure

00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:09,200
they have dependencies

00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,880
uh someone performs on linux some

00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:15,120
performs on windows some performs better

00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:18,480
on ibm power9 some perform

00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:22,240
some are developed for nvidia uh like

00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:25,440
these uh p100 gpu something like that

00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:28,880
so we have to take care of all

00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:32,480
these things and not only

00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:34,640
that at the same time uh there are

00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,160
demands from different students today

00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,440
different students have different types

00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,160
of demands

00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,200
someone is just interested in learning

00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,680
let's say

00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,760
the machine learning parameter tuning

00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:49,360
that student just

00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:52,880
are targeting for that type of job uh

00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:55,200
job for the career and some students

00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,240
are actually focusing on data

00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,880
engineering

00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,000
and need to know more about the

00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,399
infrastructure

00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,279
configuration and all these things and

00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,760
there are some

00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:07,279
folks who really need some advanced uh

00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:10,880
need to know some advanced

00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:12,320
stuff so how to deal with all these

00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:15,519
things

00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:18,560
so uh there should be like

00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:19,120
in the collaborative infrastructure the

00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,920
courses

00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,480
should be divided into like two or three

00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,800
different

00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,600
uh structure due to or two different

00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,760
levels

00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,079
so in the 100 level the students may

00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,399
learn like the inception and histories

00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,760
components building blocks application

00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,000
and start on like

00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,279
coding on pre-configured infrastructure

00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,959
something like that

00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:42,959
and then on the next intermediate level

00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:44,720
they can start learning the theoretical

00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:47,600
basics architecture details

00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,720
installation configuration code on your

00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,720
on the server

00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,079
uh impact of different types of

00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,720
configuration on different

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:56,560
types of hardware infrastructure cluster

00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,320
infrastructure like that

00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:01,040
then in the there should be some

00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,680
advanced level like how to optimize the

00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,000
code

00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,200
uh some kind of let's say some specific

00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,839
tools code

00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,360
for specific hardware infrastructure

00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:12,079
specific cluster

00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:14,160
uh how to optimize the data structure

00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:16,480
all those things they need to learn

00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,920
but and also there are some professional

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,079
needs which are like really

00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,920
project-based learning and consultancy

00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:23,120
they are also looking for their own

00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:27,040
learning needs

00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:28,079
so how to cope up with these so there

00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,360
should be some

00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:33,200
this type of uh demands will always be

00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,839
there because there are variations

00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,519
nowadays

00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:40,639
actually uh we are facing these type of

00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:44,240
challenges uh so what we

00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:45,120
need to do is so uh previously what we

00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,079
used to do like

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,880
uh there are like let's say uh when we

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,279
are

00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,600
taking these all these learning things

00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,639
to these uh software or middleware like

00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,560
uh there are like

00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:58,639
programming related issues like there

00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,600
are lots of programming language like

00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,320
python or

00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,360
java c plus plus javascript and then

00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,639
there are like

00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:09,440
hadoop stack is there for big data stack

00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,160
like uh there are lots of hadoop related

00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,199
things

00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:16,800
and also there are like ibm's power ai

00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:19,519
stack which is really great for uh

00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:21,120
which is like doing lots of different uh

00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,680
addressing lots of machine learning

00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,399
related

00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,680
issues so there are a lot of different

00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:28,800
software tools and

00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,160
the uh which is making the situation

00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,600
more challenging

00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:36,800
is to mapping the students demand

00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,519
with these uh all these different type

00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:41,360
of

00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:41,920
software tools and the another level of

00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,800
challenge

00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:46,800
is these all these things have different

00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,399
type of implication on different type of

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:51,760
hardware infrastructure

00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:55,839
and on different operating system so

00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:58,320
uh so so far whatever learning process

00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,519
have been done they just focused on

00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,279
these two things

00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,760
just the learning and then the software

00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:06,079
and middleware but

00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:07,680
nowadays what we can do which can

00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:09,519
revolutionize and which

00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,880
can make the learning experience really

00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:13,680
better is a

00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:15,600
docker-based container so here actually

00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,920
we can do like uh

00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,199
open shift and containerize all the

00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,639
learning solution

00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:23,199
just like this like the learning

00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:26,399
repository hardware and optimized images

00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:29,600
and then provide just

00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:31,839
as much that is required to the student

00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,160
and then we can provide different type

00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,240
of

00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,199
infrastructure where the students can

00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,399
really

00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:41,519
learn their uh things i mean learn their

00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:44,959
all the needs so and

00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:45,519
like also there is a huge growing demand

00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:48,160
like

00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,120
how to separate out the data computation

00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,839
with data

00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:54,000
so that student can get like 100

00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:56,160
gigabytes of data kept in the same

00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,120
infrastructure and through the docker

00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,399
infrastructure

00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,920
uh different students can uh utilize the

00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:05,680
data for different types of

00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:09,440
learning so and these docker images

00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:10,639
should be like platform optimized so

00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,839
that the student can

00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:15,759
learn more about like ibm power9 power

00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,839
cloud and all these different types like

00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:20,000
nvidia gpu intel cluster

00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,680
uh amazon web service so that they can

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,440
learn all these different types of

00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,399
things

00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,759
so uh that is why we need a

00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,880
collaborative uh

00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:34,240
platform and that is what exactly

00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:37,040
institute can provide so before uh so

00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,000
uh just let here are some use cases like

00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,399
uh

00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,120
we have uh i have collaborated with some

00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:44,480
academic

00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:46,800
institute uh like uh students who wants

00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,959
to learn new topic in big data and ai

00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,560
instructor can refer to you this site

00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:53,600
and all these things

00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:55,759
there are several folks in industry

00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,360
who actually are interested to learn

00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:00,560
different data

00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:02,880
data science related topics uh sometimes

00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:06,079
it is like because of their new project

00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:09,280
sometimes it is because of their uh

00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:10,000
own learning needs and uh something like

00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,760
that

00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:16,559
so uh here uh uh by

00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:18,240
with institute online platform we are

00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:21,760
actually collaborating with

00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:23,919
both different types of uh organizations

00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,360
like the first uh one of the project is

00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,959
genomic error correction which is

00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,679
totally an academic research based

00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,240
project

00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:32,000
where the hpc cluster was shared by all

00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,919
these universities and

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,440
then there was lots of publications and

00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:39,840
all these things going on

00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:42,240
uh the next is uh like we have a

00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:45,280
collaboration with an another university

00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:47,919
uh which is uh situated in kolkata india

00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,320
so we have collaborated for a blockchain

00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,799
based

00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,400
healthcare research so where actually we

00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:56,000
had lots of cluster

00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:58,320
uh in many different places and

00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,679
they are actually we actually created a

00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,240
blockchain network to

00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:03,840
share healthcare into to test our

00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,240
healthcare interoperability

00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,919
now the best part was it was started as

00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,720
a educational project

00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:12,320
but suddenly we got lots of different

00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,480
outcomes and everything

00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,919
and recently we have published a paper

00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,840
on uh jamie

00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:20,720
uh the journal of medical and

00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:23,600
information informatics research

00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,480
and also not only this university

00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,400
project

00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,400
many as i told there are several

00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,400
industry folks actually getting some

00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,640
benefit from this institute

00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:35,520
like there are some folks who is working

00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,240
on arista consulting and there are some

00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,799
folks

00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:41,600
from deloitte so they collaborated with

00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:43,440
some university students and

00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,039
fun filled with in a fun filled way they

00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,039
are learning uh like

00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:48,240
different types of things like

00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:50,799
classifying frames

00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,640
uh image analysis nlp time series

00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,440
analysis and all these different types

00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,360
of things

00:18:53,440 --> 00:19:00,320
just according to their need

00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,520
so now the thing is uh when i'm talking

00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,400
about all these things

00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,679
so now it's a time for a demo how

00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:09,280
everything looks like

00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:11,760
when it comes to uh really

00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,600
in the real practice so the real

00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:16,960
practice is basically a

00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:20,000
website where you can register

00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:23,600
and this is i'm going to show a demo

00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:26,919
and here this is the home page for the

00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:28,240
website and the name of the website is

00:19:26,919 --> 00:19:30,679
institute.academy

00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,400
so whenever you will type

00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:33,360
www.institute.academy you will land in

00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,520
this page

00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,039
and here i am going to show you the

00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,760
experience

00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:41,360
so once you will go to the courses page

00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:44,400
you will see lots of different

00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:47,600
uh courses here and

00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:49,840
then let's select this big data and this

00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,400
big data will take you to the big data

00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,880
course

00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,600
and here actually you have to register

00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,120
so

00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,760
uh this la this here you can actually

00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,760
register

00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,280
your name and email id that takes just

00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:04,400
like a few seconds

00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:08,000
and once you will click this button

00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:09,919
it will start the video lectures

00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
and now these video lectures has

00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:15,200
different type of lectures you can go

00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,679
through based on your learning needs and

00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:20,000
let's

00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:22,559
go to these tensorflow

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,360
let me just switch it off uh switch the

00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:25,679
sound off

00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:28,960
so as you can see here actually this is

00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:31,039
a big data 100 level course and

00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,240
200 level course is coming soon to take

00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:34,799
care of the students

00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,679
who need some more about configuration

00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:38,559
and all

00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:39,760
and the best part is the student while

00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:43,440
watching the video

00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:46,840
at the same time they can

00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:49,919
learn with their on top of different

00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:52,799
infrastructure so for example uh

00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,919
this course for this course actually we

00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:57,600
got the

00:20:53,919 --> 00:21:00,400
uh infrastructure from u oregon and uh

00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,679
this is basically a power nine

00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,720
infrastructure

00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:07,840
where the students can really write

00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:12,120
their code according to their need so

00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:16,559
let's say like uh import

00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:19,039
tensorflow as tf

00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:21,039
something like this so i mean they can

00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:23,440
write any type of things and the best

00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:26,240
part is they are really doing it on a

00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,600
very high performance computing or

00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,960
computing uh

00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,840
infrastructure and they really do not

00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,159
need to

00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,840
do only theoretical learning but they

00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:38,240
can learn on top of like

00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,760
world-class power architecture or any

00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,080
type of architecture

00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,039
like here if you just click on this

00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,159
hardware button

00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:47,280
you can see lots all the infrastructure

00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:49,919
and everything

00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:51,840
and not only that sometimes in industry

00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:53,919
it is required that

00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:56,159
you have to do the performance analysis

00:21:53,919 --> 00:22:00,559
for different type of data analytic

00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:03,039
tools and then select it on different uh

00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:05,120
and then select the best tool for the

00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:06,000
next project so that the customer is

00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,640
happy

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,280
so there you can do something like so so

00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:14,880
far i was on a

00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:17,120
power nine based cluster and here just

00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,760
by a single click

00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:21,600
you can directly go to an intel cluster

00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:24,400
which was actually given by

00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:27,200
uh donated by i mean uh contributed by

00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:30,080
the uw platteville that is my university

00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,640
and there you can check the performance

00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,360
like

00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,320
let's say you have a heavy tensorflow

00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:37,120
workload

00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,760
and you want to change uh you want to

00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,919
check the

00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,280
real performance on different uh

00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:44,720
infrastructure

00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:46,080
so uh i'm not sure what is happening in

00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:51,120
here anyway

00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:54,480
so no oh i'm sorry so this is like

00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:57,039
import so here if you just

00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,039
run it

00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,360
so here if we

00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,600
[Music]

00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,400
so there is some kind of syntax here

00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:12,000
okay

00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:13,919
as here all right so

00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,240
these are the several things students

00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:18,159
can get like really great hands-on

00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,200
experience and compare different types

00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:21,039
of performance

00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,039
uh implication of different hardware

00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:26,720
infrastructure like power 9

00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:27,360
versus some power 8 or nvidia gpu or

00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,000
whatever

00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:32,240
they want and if the students do not to

00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,039
want to do on the super computer they

00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,799
can download

00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:39,840
our docker image just they need to fire

00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:41,440
this command from here on their machine

00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:43,120
and they need to have the docker

00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:46,400
installed on their machine

00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:49,760
and then just click on the connect

00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,799
and it will connect to their local

00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,840
machine and

00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:54,720
inside this local machine they can uh do

00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,039
something with

00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,000
their python code and here also

00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:00,159
everything is

00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,440
installed like tensorflow and all these

00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:06,320
things and

00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:09,919
not only these they can also like

00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:12,480
change to their terminal

00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:14,559
where they have like not only these uh

00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,840
machine learning tools they can learn

00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:18,880
about

00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:20,880
like hadoop

00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,480
and all these different things are

00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:25,360
already installed

00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,320
so let's say like pi spark and

00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,559
everything is

00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:30,559
installed in those docker images and

00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:32,480
these docker images are really optimized

00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:34,640
for different type of infrastructure

00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,159
so we have our own docker repository for

00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:39,600
that

00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:42,240
so that is about the

00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,600
demo and here actually you can find the

00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,000
hardware infrastructure

00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,279
setup details and all other links and

00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,480
everything

00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:52,559
and uh so

00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,080
now let me go back to the presentation

00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:57,520
once again

00:24:54,080 --> 00:25:00,330
so here actually so this is

00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:01,600
whatever institute is so um
