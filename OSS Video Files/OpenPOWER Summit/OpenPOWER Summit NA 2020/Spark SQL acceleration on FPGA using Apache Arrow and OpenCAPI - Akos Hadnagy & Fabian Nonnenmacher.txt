	Spark SQL acceleration on FPGA using Apache Arrow and OpenCAPI - Akos Hadnagy & Fabian Nonnenmacher, Delft University of Technology

Speakers: √Åkos Hadnagy, Fabian Nonnenmacher

One of the research topics of the Accelerated Big Data Systems group at TU Delft is transparent acceleration of Spark SQL programs on FPGA. This talk discusses our design, the modifications that were necessary in Spark, FPGA programming tools that were developed, and a fully integrated proof-of-concept on an OpenCAPI platform.
