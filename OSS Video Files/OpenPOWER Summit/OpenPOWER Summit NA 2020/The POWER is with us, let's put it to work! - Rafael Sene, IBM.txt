	The POWER is with us, let's put it to work! - Rafael Sene, IBM

Speakers: Rafael Sene

We have the POWER, let's put it to work and expand its reach by creating a healthy ecosystem to empower developers: the fuel that keeps the ecosystem moving and evolving. Developers needs access to resources that can empower them to get the most of their applications and amaze their customers. As the architecture that is the core of the #1 and #2 fastest supercomputers in the world, POWER is where they need to be, but how developers can leverage it as part of their daily activities? This presentation will demonstrate how everyone can get free and paid access to the POWER architecture and start building, porting and tuning their applications right away. It will show how to build on POWER using GitHub, Travis CI, and GitLab, create multi-arch container images and how to deploy a build pipeline using OpenShift on Power.
