Description: 
	High-Performance MPI and Deep Learning with Introspection on OpenPOWER Platform - Dhabaleswar K (DK) Panda, X-ScaleSolutions and The Ohio State University & Donglai Dai, X-ScaleSolutions

Speakers: Dhabaleswar K (DK) Panda, Donglai Dai

This talk will focus on high-performance and scalable middleware for Message Passing Interface (MPI) and Deep Learning on OpenPOWER platform with NVIDIA GPGPUs and RDMA-enabled interconnects (InfiniBand and RoCE). The focus will be on two packages with commercial support being available from X-ScaleSolutions. The first package will focus on the OSU MVAPICH2 MPI libraries and their capabilities for high-performance computing with both CPUs (OpenPOWER) and GPUs (NVIDIA). The second package will focus on tight integration between the OSU MVAPICH2-GDR MPI library and the Horovod stack to provide high-performance and scalable Deep Learning (DL) with deep introspection (DI) capabilities for DL frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch and MXNet. The DI capabilities allow DL users and runtime developers to easily optimize their DL applications on modern systems. Performance results from the ORNL SUMMIT system (#2nd) and Lassen (#14th) with thousands of GPUs and POWER9 CPUs will be presented.
