	Accelerated Big Data Systems - Experiences with OpenCAPI - Joost Hoozemans, Delft University of Technology
Speakers: Joost Hoozemans
In this talk, the Accelerated Big Data Systems group of Delft University of Technology shares experiences on the POWER9 OpenCAPI platform. A key goal of the group is to make programming accelerators (and specifically FPGAs) easier, more portable and more efficient. To this end, ABS has contributed several open source tools and technologies to the community, and created multiple demonstrators that apply these tools in big data analytics and genomics application domains. The presentation provides an overview of the ABS toolchain, the new tools that were developed, and show results of the use cases that were created.
