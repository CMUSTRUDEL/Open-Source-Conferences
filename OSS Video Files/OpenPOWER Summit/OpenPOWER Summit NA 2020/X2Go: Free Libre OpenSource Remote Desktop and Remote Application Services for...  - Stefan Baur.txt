Description: 
	X2Go: Free/Libre/OpenSource Remote Desktop and Remote Application Services for Linux - on POWER - Stefan Baur, BAUR-ITCS UG (haftungsbeschrÃ¤nkt)

Speakers: Stefan Baur

When people read the term "POWER" in a CPU related context, they usually either think of the old PowerPC-based computers of the past, or of modern-day number-crunching machines, fast GPUs, AI, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and the like. What most people aren't aware of is that they can also run full Linux desktops - or single Linux GUI applications - on their POWER servers, and access them over the Internet. X2Go enables them to do so, but way faster than VNC or classic X-forwarding over SSH, more akin to Windows RDP and Citrix XenDesktop/XenApp. X2Go can be used for remote administration as well as for a multi-user graphical terminal server environment, using Linux on POWER, rather than MS Windows on Intel. This talk will be a POWER-centric demo of X2Go's current features, with an additional outlook of upcoming features that are currently in beta / in development.

hi there i'm stefan bauer and i'm the

00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:08,240
owner and managing director of power

00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,240
itcs

00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,080
but i'm also extra goals community

00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:17,119
manager

00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:19,199
event planner and lead evangelist

00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:20,800
which means that i am usually the one

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,320
traveling around telling people how

00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,920
great extra goal is

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,439
well unless you're in the middle of a

00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,039
pandemic and the world is covered in

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,199
death

00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,960
so uh instead of talking to you live on

00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,120
stage as i would usually do

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,040
i have recorded this message for you in

00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,840
my little improvised recording studio

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,280
here

00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,200
so i can still tell you about a cool

00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,440
piece of software anyone can use for

00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,440
free

00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,840
but first let me express my deepest

00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,640
gratitude towards the openpower

00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,399
foundation

00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,000
as well as towards the linux foundation

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,879
for having us

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,079
it really is an honor to be here today

00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,239
while we've had a booth at

00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,920
open power summit europe in amsterdam

00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:02,079
back in 2018

00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,080
we couldn't make it to the 2019 european

00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,560
summit nor have we ever been able to

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,240
make it to the us

00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,920
which is too bad because we might have

00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,799
been able to meet daniel or christopher

00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,520
in person

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,880
so here's a shout out to you guys um i

00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,960
hope you're watching this

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,560
and if not hopefully someone in the

00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,119
audience knows you and points you to

00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,040
this recording

00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,640
now uh you may be wondering why we've

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,600
never been to one of the us or north

00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,400
america summits

00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,320
well this is our neck of the woods and

00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,000
while ex2co has volunteers from pretty

00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,680
much all over the world

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,280
most of the core team members are

00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,479
located in the central and western

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,960
european area

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:42,640
so most of the events we attend are in

00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,640
germany austria and switzerland

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,840
so uh let's zoom out a bit and see where

00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,040
open power summit north america usually

00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,640
takes place

00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,119
on the west coast of the united states

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,079
so oops that's quite a distance and a

00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,159
lot of water between

00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,159
us

00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,439
coincidentally the west coast is also

00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:05,040
where our power-based

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,040
ex2go demo server is hosted

00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,039
currently sponsored by oregon state

00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,640
university's open source lab

00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:12,239
by the way christopher that's not the

00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,840
only reason for the shout out you've got

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,080
to watch this till the end to find out

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,080
right

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,239
so uh how many miles are we talking well

00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,160
about

00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:25,840
5 hundred miles or if you prefer metric

00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,560
over nine thousand three hundred

00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,560
kilometers

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,400
that's not quite halfway around the

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,239
world but almost a quarter

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,080
so i guess you can see why being an open

00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,040
source project on a perpetually tight

00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,040
budget

00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,360
most of us call team members usually

00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,040
can't take part in u.s events

00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,040
that's not to say there's no activity in

00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,959
the u.s at all mike de polo who

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,200
currently hails from new york city

00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,640
and recently joined red hat represented

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,560
extra go at a few events in the

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,920
philadelphia and massachusetts areas in

00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,920
the past

00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:59,120
but flying him from coast to coast and

00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:01,200
back would similarly bust our budget

00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,800
now before we start there are two things

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,040
i need to apologize for

00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,519
first of all sorry we usually do this

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,959
live but this is a recording

00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,959
while extra go doesn't need much

00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,560
bandwidth the video stream does

00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,800
and while germany has a no limits

00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,239
autobahn its information highway turns

00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,560
into a cobblestone road as soon as

00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,159
you're hitting the outskirts of town

00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,879
and i think we can all do without 30

00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:25,680
minutes of grainy and blurry video

00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:27,680
second sorry there's about 10 minutes of

00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,840
tech savvy slides coming up

00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,120
which are necessary to explain the

00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,360
concept and features of

00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,400
go we'll have a live demo at the end to

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,400
make up for that so

00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,760
please hang in there it gets better at

00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,440
the end i promise

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,120
let's have a quick overview of what to

00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,480
expect today um

00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,480
we have just passed the introduction

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,799
slides we are going to look at what x2

00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,560
go

00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:49,840
is we're going to look at the server

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,840
side further advantages of x2 go

00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,959
and the client side with the syncline

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,599
edition as well

00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:57,360
and finally the live demo and the q a

00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,959
and important urls

00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,400
so let's have a look at what extra go

00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,319
has to offer

00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,920
the two most relevant modes of operation

00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:05,439
from an end user perspective

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,840
are remote desktop and remote

00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:09,519
applications let's focus on the remote

00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,959
desktop first

00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,640
now if you've used windows remote

00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:16,000
desktop protocol rdp or

00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,759
vnc before or maybe citrix xen desktop

00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,680
this will look familiar to you there's

00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,759
two desktops one basically nested into

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,960
the other

00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,560
let me highlight this for you so

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,000
the highlighted area is the remote

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,040
desktop and the outer desktop is the

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,720
local desktop

00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,320
like i said pretty much the same as with

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,120
rdp or vnc

00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,960
two differences though one in our case

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,120
that inner remote desktop is not a

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:42,720
windows desktop but a linux tester

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,560
running on a power machine two

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,800
we are way faster than what you're used

00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,720
to from vnc

00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,560
now i used to say that on slow links we

00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,880
are faster than rdp as well

00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,560
but over the last few years microsoft

00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,120
has done quite a good job at catching up

00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,040
to us

00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,479
so there will be so much cases where

00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,479
they are slightly faster

00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:04,080
others where we are slightly faster but

00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:04,080
we are pretty much on power these days

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,479
so what's this remote application thing

00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,400
again we have a local windows desktop

00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:14,400
but now instead of having a full remote

00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,440
desktop window blocking major parts of

00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:19,039
our stream

00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:21,440
all we have are two remote applications

00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:24,800
running seamlessly in our local desktop

00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,720
just as if they were local applications

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,800
in the intel world this used to be a

00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,039
citrix xenapps domain

00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:34,479
until microsoft started to offer this

00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:35,919
with more recent versions of rdp as well

00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:37,520
on the other hand if you're a unix

00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,759
person you'll probably notice the

00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,639
similarities to x forwarding you log in

00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,960
via ssh

00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,639
forward your display run your graphical

00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,639
application on a remote machine

00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,320
and get the display output back to your

00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:49,919
local machine

00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,000
and yes that's basically what we are

00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:54,000
doing behind the scenes as well

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,600
but we have a few tricks about sleeves

00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,560
to make things way faster than what

00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,840
you're used to

00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,840
plus some other neat features

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,400
so here's our feature overview x2go is

00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,240
like vnc

00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:09,840
xdmcp or x forwarding but on steroids

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,319
we offer full screen and windowed

00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:15,280
desktops as well as seamless emotes

00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:17,840
we are faster more responsive we also

00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,759
have bi-directional audio support

00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,680
and local printing support even for

00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,880
windows gdi only printers

00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,960
as long as they're connected to a

00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,360
windows client

00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:30,160
we also have local media support for usb

00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,080
storage media cd dvd and fixed disks

00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,600
the only thing we don't have in that

00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,880
aspect currently is

00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,360
generic usb puzzle that is a feature

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,240
that

00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,800
is technically possible but no one has

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,520
sponsored the development for it yet

00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,600
and finally all this is wrapped in a

00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,280
nice and friendly user interface so you

00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,240
do not have to deal with cryptic shell

00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,360
commands this is

00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,479
aimed user friendly software but wait

00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,720
there's more

00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:59,039
we also have an optional session broker

00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,800
for large scale deployments

00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,160
this allows central administration of

00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,919
users and sessions

00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,759
as well as load balancing between

00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,919
several x2go servers

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,800
so you suspend your session you

00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,440
reconnect to

00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:14,000
the load balancer and you end up on the

00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,960
same server where your suspended session

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,280
is parked now on the other hand if you

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,280
are

00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:22,160
connecting with a new session you will

00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:24,000
end up on the least busy server

00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,919
now this feature is actually not that

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,840
important on power and i'll explain

00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:29,680
later on once we get past the next two

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,759
slides why

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,039
we have clients available for all major

00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:36,080
operating systems

00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:36,639
so windows linux mac os our client

00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,120
supports

00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,240
theming and corporate branding so we

00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,319
have a company logo

00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,240
a corporate color scheme no problem we

00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,639
can add dynamically

00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,440
so you do not need a custom build of our

00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,440
client for this

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,000
we also have an html5 app and reminder

00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:56,400
integration in the works

00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,599
and we offer a customizable thin client

00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,160
image build script

00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:01,840
so you can deploy your own custom think

00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,240
line image to your users

00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:07,440
with additional drivers vpn or wifi

00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,759
credentials and whatnot

00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,280
now like i said earlier x2go can be used

00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,000
by anyone for free

00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:16,479
that is because execo is fully gpl just

00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,360
like for example the linux kernel vlc

00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:22,000
media player ansible or wordpress

00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,440
this means no license fees ever not even

00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,160
for commercial use

00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,280
and all features are usable immediately

00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,199
and permanently

00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,400
this is not drywall there are no time

00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,640
bombs included

00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:35,680
no license keys or software activation

00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:37,760
to worry about just install and run

00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,760
and when i say just install and run this

00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,560
is because it's really easy to try out

00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,240
x2go

00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,919
all you need to do is grab a copy of

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,880
ubuntu 1804

00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:48,959
or 2004 or debian 10 and run these

00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,760
commands on the server on your client

00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:53,760
and you're ready to go for other

00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,519
distributions and more advanced features

00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,519
like the session broker you will have to

00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,200
add our own software repository

00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:01,920
the instructions for that can be found

00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:04,240
in our wiki which is linked here

00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,080
so let's look at the advantages of x2go

00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,399
on power

00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,640
first you can keep all your data and all

00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:14,160
your applications in one place

00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:16,080
on your power machine and power

00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,959
performance levels and scalability

00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,279
results in

00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,160
that you usually do not need to scale

00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:23,839
out

00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:27,440
one single server is enough you just add

00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:30,399
ram and cpu as needed so all you need

00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,080
is a batch script with approximately 70

00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,600
lines of code comments not included

00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,320
that's all that's your session broker if

00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:39,680
you're using power on a single server

00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:41,760
on the other hand if you were using a

00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:44,480
multi-server setup you would require

00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:47,519
ldap nfs a central database so when all

00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:50,959
this would have to be highly available

00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:54,399
not so with power one box one script

00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:56,720
with 70 lines of code so the entire

00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,560
solution becomes a lot less complex on

00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,000
power

00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,399
this allows you to turn your power

00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,200
machine into a full-fledged graphical

00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,560
terminal server and if you're using your

00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,519
power machine with a green screen

00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,600
terminal

00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,279
you can check if you can phase that out

00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:15,279
as well

00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:15,920
um or if you're using aix and xdmcp on

00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,519
aix

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:22,480
or x forwarding on aix you do not

00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,760
need to pay to get x2 go server ported

00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,720
to aix

00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,880
all you do is you install a little linux

00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,000
lpash side by side to your aix

00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,800
installation

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,040
and you can use your x2go server in that

00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:38,640
linux helper and use it as a jump host

00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:40,480
to connect to the aix machine

00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,000
which in turn will automatically speed

00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:46,079
up your

00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,399
x4 warning you also do not need to add

00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:50,399
intel or amd servers to your data center

00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,680
just to be able to work from home during

00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,360
kobit 19.

00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:56,079
you can use the power machine you

00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,200
already have and with ssh two-factor

00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:59,120
authentication

00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,120
it's even more secure than hooking a

00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,800
windows rdp server directly up to the

00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,720
internet

00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,920
now x2go client also runs on the

00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,880
raspberry pi

00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:10,640
so you can avoid the intel and amd world

00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:13,440
even on the client side

00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:16,320
a simple raspberry pi 3 is good enough

00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,399
as an incline for x2go

00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,000
you can also access your server from

00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,920
anywhere in the world

00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,600
all you need is an internet connection

00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:26,000
and your x2go client

00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,120
and for office work you can usually make

00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,079
do with something like

00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,040
between two megabits per second per user

00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:34,320
and as low as

00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,920
64 kilobits per second per user so the

00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,200
times where you would download a

00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,399
100 megabyte document via vpn make a few

00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,200
edits

00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,560
try to upload it again and wait and wait

00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,600
and wait until it completes

00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:49,839
those times are over because everything

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,240
happens on the server

00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:54,399
and this also brings another advantage

00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,079
there is no longer a version mismatch

00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,000
between your documents and applications

00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:00,959
you are using to edit them

00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,639
no matter the client device your desktop

00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:04,639
always looks and feels the same your

00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:07,200
application versions are the same

00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,720
like you've probably used microsoft word

00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,920
before

00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:13,680
you uploaded your document then edited

00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,040
the document same document on a

00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,560
different computer with a different

00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,240
version of word maybe

00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,000
or a different printer driver and all

00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,240
your formatting is broken this

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,760
simply does not happen here anymore

00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:27,600
because all

00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:30,079
you do you do on a server you can also

00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,440
deploy a special purpose linux apps like

00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:34,160
say open form for

00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,800
computational fluid dynamics in seamless

00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,720
mode

00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:39,519
so the users aren't confused by a

00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:42,320
foreign looking linux desktop

00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,760
you can use any windows mac os or linux

00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,560
computer

00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:49,200
as a client you can even bring your own

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:52,639
extra think line on bootable usb media

00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:54,959
on a cd or dvd and like i said earlier

00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:57,519
on we are working on html5 client

00:12:54,959 --> 00:13:00,880
so android and ios devices will be

00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:03,680
supported in the future as well

00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:05,040
and you can use x2go to increase your

00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,800
system security

00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,880
because the typical ransomware coders

00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,760
they aim for winter not for linux on

00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,600
power

00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,240
so if you run your browser on your mail

00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:17,120
client on your linux on power machine

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,000
you get a window displayed on your

00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,160
windows machine

00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,160
so you can look but you can't touch you

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,279
have a clear separation between the evil

00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,639
internet

00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,639
and your corporate data

00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,360
and finally you can use think lines with

00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:34,560
a linux based office desktop environment

00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,839
and a branding of your choice so like i

00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,160
said earlier

00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:40,000
corporate identity theming is not an

00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,760
issue

00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,760
so let's look at x2go client it's

00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,959
available for all major client operating

00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,040
systems

00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:50,160
for windows we have a 32-bit client but

00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:52,800
it runs on 64-bit as well

00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,480
we recommend you use vista on your with

00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,440
a current client

00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:59,040
if you absolutely need to use windows xp

00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,959
you can find a client for it in our

00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,560
download archive it will still connect

00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:06,480
to a current extra go server it just

00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:10,000
does no longer receive security updates

00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,880
for linux we offer 32-bit and 64-bit

00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,320
clients

00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:16,240
even in big-endian singles for the

00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,240
server as well by the way so

00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,760
if you're stuck on a big engine linux

00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,480
distribution on power

00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:24,480
no problem we have you covered so we

00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,399
offer binary packages for all the major

00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,320
linux distributions out there

00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,160
and while the operating system itself

00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,720
has not reached its end of life

00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:35,760
we will have a current x2go client build

00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:39,519
ready for it as well

00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:40,639
now for mac os we offer 32 and 64-bit

00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:43,760
clients for

00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:46,560
mac os 10.5 and 10.6 and

00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:47,440
64-bit only for the newer versions and

00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,880
similar to the

00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:54,720
situations with windows xp

00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:56,800
um we have clients for mac os 10.5 to

00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,959
10.8 that are still available and

00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,880
working but out of security support

00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:02,480
the ones that are receiving security

00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:05,920
support are for

00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:09,240
versions 10.9 to 10.13

00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:10,399
and the 10.13 version should work on

00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,959
10.14

00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:15,680
and 10.15 as well it might require some

00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:19,519
tweaking of your system settings

00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:22,079
so finally x2go thin client edition

00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:24,240
we have two flavors of thinkline edition

00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:25,920
the classic one

00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,680
just gives you a full screen login

00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,519
window as you can see in the screenshot

00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:32,000
and afterwards you connect to a full

00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:35,279
screen remote session

00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,680
the other flavor is martin mini desktop

00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:39,040
this is based on the regular version but

00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,440
has some additional features

00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:45,040
and we'll cover this in more details

00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,040
later during the demo part

00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,920
so exogenous incline edition this can be

00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,959
booted via pixi

00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,959
or via local media usb flash like

00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:58,079
internal flash of its incline

00:15:54,959 --> 00:16:01,120
fix this cd dvd

00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:04,399
you name it we have it we also do

00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,040
not require nfs so unlike the classic

00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,720
disk

00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,720
workstation approach that is common in

00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,600
the linux world we

00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,320
have no need for nfs we can make do with

00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,920
ftp

00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:19,360
http or https for netbooting

00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:22,800
now we do need tftp or ipxc

00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,600
to load the kernel or init id but no nfs

00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,160
server

00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,240
we do not require any high availability

00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,959
solution for this

00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,839
and our fixed disk image can even be

00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:34,800
injected

00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,600
into a ntfs file system and booted via

00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:39,199
the windows

00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:41,040
bootloader so this can be deployed via

00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:43,120
existing windows software deployment

00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:46,399
tools and does not require reformatting

00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:48,880
or re-partitioning the drive

00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:50,639
netbooting aside this is the fastest way

00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:54,079
to turn a windows pc

00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:55,279
into a thin client and because we don't

00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:57,279
reformat the drive

00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:59,120
we can provide an easy fallback to

00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,240
windows in case of problems during the

00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,160
rollout

00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,000
one extra push of a button during the

00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,439
boot phase and you're back into your old

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,199
windows world

00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:12,559
so this was the last text heavy slide

00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:13,839
next up is the live demo and for the

00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:17,360
live demo

00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:17,360
we'll boot an extra go think line

00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,799
and we won't be using the regular extra

00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,199
gold

00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:24,720
inclined because that's pretty boring

00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,280
all you would see is a full screen login

00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:29,840
window and a generic linux system

00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,039
so instead we are going to look at mate

00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,280
mini desktop

00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:35,840
multi-mini desktop features a local

00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:38,400
desktop with a local taskbar

00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,960
and comes with a local firefox and or

00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,880
chrome

00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,039
or chromium for streaming and

00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,120
conferences

00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:46,320
because this has direct access to a usb

00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,320
webcam

00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,000
we don't require usb forwarding and have

00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,799
no latency issues for

00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,679
the web conferencing part this is

00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:55,440
intended

00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:57,520
to be used with exogo's published

00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,559
application mode but you can use full

00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:02,080
screen or windows

00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:04,720
sessions as well if you want and

00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,640
we also offer optional local green

00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:10,720
screen support so we can integrate

00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:14,000
x 5250 or x 3270 emulations into the

00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:17,440
local client so marti mini desktop works

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,919
in general but still is in beta

00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:22,320
some open bugs remain and we are

00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:25,360
actively looking for sponsors to help us

00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:27,039
iron out these bugs possibly

00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:31,039
using multi mini desktop in their

00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:31,039
production environment later on

00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:36,240
so let's have a look at marti mini

00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,240
desktop

00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:45,120
and oops

00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,000
this entire presentation you've seen so

00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,440
far

00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:52,320
has been coming from the

00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,400
server on the west coast in the us and

00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:57,440
the client you are now seeing

00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:59,840
is located in germany those

00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,360
9 300 kilometers away i mentioned

00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,679
earlier

00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:05,200
and this is live well you're seeing it

00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:08,640
as a recording now but

00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:10,160
for me this is live we can now see that

00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,760
there's a browser window running in the

00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,120
background you can see

00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,120
and tell from the different camera

00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:17,760
perspective this is a usb

00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,360
webcam feed from my demo laptop well the

00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:22,480
camera you're seeing

00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,360
for the large stream i'm in focus that's

00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:27,760
the differences

00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:31,039
uh that's a different setup so on

00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:34,240
what you can see here is firefox

00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:38,240
chromium x2go client

00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:41,679
and the local taskbar

00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,000
now if we weren't using a full windows

00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:46,160
uh

00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:48,240
a full linux desktop here

00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:51,600
you would have a second start menu here

00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,600
for the remote applications

00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:56,720
so let's just check the ip address here

00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:00,480
you can see that we are located in

00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,480
the southern part of germany somewhere

00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:10,480
you're soaking it this is the real deal

00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:12,400
and this is the palm olive effect that

00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,320
christopher referred to in his talk at

00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,480
open power summit north america back in

00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:18,559
april 2018.

00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,320
funnily enough we had the same idea

00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,760
using that old palm olive ad in our

00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,159
presentations

00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,120
completely independent of him in june of

00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:27,919
the same year

00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,640
when we did a presentation at ibm zurich

00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:30,799
like i said

00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,400
for this demo we were using a full

00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:34,080
remote desktop rather than published

00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,720
applications because that's easier for

00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:39,280
you to tell local and remote apps apart

00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,720
and libreoffice in presenter mode works

00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,039
better that way

00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,480
so you saw the open chromium window with

00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:46,960
jutsu mead

00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:49,120
so one last slide before we show the

00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:52,000
important urls

00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,400
at the 2019 european summit there was a

00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,600
talk

00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,320
by daniel herrick from red hat which was

00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,360
titled

00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:02,240
desktop on open power systems yes

00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,440
and in slide 14 which we've copied here

00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,159
you can see he wrote

00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,520
demo depends on open power laptop which

00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:09,120
didn't exist back then

00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,880
and still doesn't though there's one in

00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,720
development as we learned from roberto

00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,440
innocente's talk earlier on

00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,400
well daniel no need to wait any longer

00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,880
next time

00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:21,120
just install x2go and yes we run on red

00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,880
hat enterprise linux and fedora too

00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,880
and you can present your powerbase linux

00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,280
desktop live on stage during your next

00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,320
talk

00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:30,480
just like we did so you can find links

00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,240
to all the videos on the last slide

00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,919
i suggest you watch christopher's and

00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,080
daniel's presentations

00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:37,679
if you haven't seen them and if you have

00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:40,799
any doubt that what we have

00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:42,559
done here today can be done live

00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:44,000
then please watch our series recording

00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:47,039
because that one was filmed live

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,039
in front of an audience

00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,760
so here's a quick recap and a list of

00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,360
important urls

00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:57,520
remember on ubuntu 1804 and 2004

00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:00,480
as well as debian 10 you can install

00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:02,080
straight from the default repositories

00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,320
next is the x2go website and the

00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,039
download url for windows and mac os

00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,799
clients

00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:09,039
followed by the list of commercial

00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:13,840
support providers for x2go

00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:13,840
and our recommended video links

00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,400
as this has been a recording i may have

00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,840
been able to answer your questions

00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,960
during this session

00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,440
if not feel free to ask away now and of

00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,280
course

00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,840
thank you for watching and thank you for

00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,840
your time

00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,080
hi there i hope everybody can hear me so

00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,880
um

00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:48,880
this is the life part now as you can see

00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:52,080
by the slightly different outfit

00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:54,400
um if anyone has questions please feel

00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:57,919
free to ask now

00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,919
ah there's a question coming up

00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:06,960
so there's a question if x2go

00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:09,440
only works on linux the server side is

00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,520
only available for linux yes

00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,120
clients like i said are available for

00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:16,799
all major operating systems

00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:20,320
and we're working on an html5 client for

00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:22,640
ios and android support as well

00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,520
and porting x2go server to different

00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,640
unixes

00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:29,280
would in theory be possible um

00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,080
so far there's only been one attempt at

00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,520
porting it to

00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:36,320
a freebsd but that attempt was aborted

00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:37,840
um the coder that was working on it has

00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:41,600
just given up on it

00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:43,360
um but if you have a commercial interest

00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:45,919
in it i'm sure we'll have uh

00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:47,120
one or two support companies for x2go

00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:51,840
that are willing to

00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:51,840
work on a port for in exchange for money

00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:05,760
now roberto innocente the

00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:09,600
powerpc laptop guy um he asked if

00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:10,080
uh x2go server is running on ppc 64 big

00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,559
engine

00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,679
yes as long as your distribution is big

00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:16,080
engine

00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:19,840
we have a big engine server component

00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,840
and client component for you as well

00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:26,000
roberto you're welcome and i'm actually

00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:28,240
really curious to get my hands on one of

00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,720
your powerpc laptops once they're

00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,720
available

00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:38,400
and marcus asked if we have a

00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:39,919
support for ppc 32-bit as client or

00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,400
server

00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:44,400
this will depend on your distribution we

00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:47,760
are not providing bills for that

00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:49,840
ourselves as far as i can tell but

00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,600
if your distribution packages x2go

00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:56,960
clients some do like debian

00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:56,960
and ubuntu then you might be in luck

00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:06,240
okay any further questions that i can

00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:14,240
answer for you feel free to ask away

00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:17,360
nope ah

00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,960
so marcus again he asked if

00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:21,840
i could speak about a technical

00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:25,440
requirement for ports to other platforms

00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:29,120
well basically x2go is based on

00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:32,799
ssh and on the x window system

00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:36,000
so if your operating system uses

00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:39,360
wayland or windows

00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,159
ui or the mac os the graphical desktop

00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,559
environment

00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:44,480
then no there will not be an x2 go

00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:48,000
server for this environment ever

00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:51,520
but if you're using x windows server

00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,400
then porting x2co server to this

00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,480
platform

00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:57,840
is basically possible with enough

00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,840
manpower and enough money

00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,799
the client side should actually be

00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,360
easier as long as you have an x server

00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:06,480
for the

00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:09,440
client system available as well

00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,000
it will most likely only require

00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,760
downloading

00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,200
the source code and compiling it for the

00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:15,200
platform you're trying to use it on

00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,360
and of course we have mailing lists

00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,320
which you will find linked on our wiki

00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,720
page so

00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:30,080
for more technical questions that a

00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:33,279
developer could answer

00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:35,120
better than i could um just subscribe to

00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:38,320
our x2go developer mailing list

00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:41,520
and ask your

00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,520
technical questions there

00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:49,600
uh here's a question coming in whether

00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:52,640
the desktop we saw is on power

00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:54,720
nine yes the demo

00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:57,440
you saw in the video was running on a

00:26:54,720 --> 00:27:00,000
power 9 machine

00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:02,240
marcus again asking how many sessions

00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:06,240
can you handle in parallel

00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:07,360
that totally depends on the siding of

00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,240
your machine

00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:11,360
and what your users are doing so if

00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,600
they're using

00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,600
um

00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,880
oh wait there's a follow-up question

00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:23,679
from say on pro 9.

00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:23,679
um so

00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:31,120
it well the platform is of course

00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:32,720
relevant to this question but it also

00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,320
highly depends on what your users are

00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:37,279
doing like

00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:38,159
if everybody is trying to surf the web

00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:41,120
this will

00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:43,279
cause a higher load than any everybody

00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:46,559
just using uh thunderbird and

00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:47,360
uh maybe libreoffice so it really

00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:50,880
depends

00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,880
on what your users are doing

00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:55,679
like you could probably run 200 500

00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,720
sessions in parallel

00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:00,880
as long as they're idle the question is

00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:03,200
how much network bandwidth do you have

00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,919
how much ram how much cpu power do you

00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,480
have in

00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:08,399
your machine it's really something that

00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:11,600
you should try out

00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:14,960
in a small scale demo environment before

00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:16,240
starting a rollout um but since we are

00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,480
open source

00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,440
you can just download it and try it for

00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:23,520
yourself

00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:26,640
you do not need to discuss demo

00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:27,279
conditions with someone or sign up for

00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,799
some

00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:34,720
evaluation license try it for yourself

00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:34,720
see how much your server can handle

00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:41,600
ah okay emily is asking us to

00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:45,840
to wrap things up so i guess this has to

00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,840
be our last question

00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:52,240
so um again thank you everybody for

00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,799
watching

00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,840
thanks for asking smart questions at the

00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:59,520
end

00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:01,840
um

00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:03,360
okay so let's let's do this as a last

00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:06,000
question here uh the question is how

00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:13,840
much it costs for open source developer

00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:13,840
um like i said x2go is free

00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:20,960
free as in beer and free as in speech

00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:28,720
so um i guess this is it um

00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,360
you can of course also ask questions in

00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,279
the

00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,720
channel later on i'll be monitoring that

00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:34,720
for the next few days and

00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,399
uh again thank you for your time thank

00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,919
you for watching thank you for asking

00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:40,000
questions afterwards

00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:41,520
have a nice day enjoy the rest of the

00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,399
presentations

00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,399
