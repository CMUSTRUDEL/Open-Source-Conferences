	X2Go: Free/Libre/OpenSource Remote Desktop and Remote Application Services for Linux - on POWER - Stefan Baur, BAUR-ITCS UG (haftungsbeschr√§nkt)

Speakers: Stefan Baur

When people read the term "POWER" in a CPU related context, they usually either think of the old PowerPC-based computers of the past, or of modern-day number-crunching machines, fast GPUs, AI, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and the like. What most people aren't aware of is that they can also run full Linux desktops - or single Linux GUI applications - on their POWER servers, and access them over the Internet. X2Go enables them to do so, but way faster than VNC or classic X-forwarding over SSH, more akin to Windows RDP and Citrix XenDesktop/XenApp. X2Go can be used for remote administration as well as for a multi-user graphical terminal server environment, using Linux on POWER, rather than MS Windows on Intel. This talk will be a POWER-centric demo of X2Go's current features, with an additional outlook of upcoming features that are currently in beta / in development.
