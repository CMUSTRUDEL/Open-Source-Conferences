Description: 
	Building Cache Coherent, Heterogeneous-ISA Processors Using P-Mesh - Jonathan Balkind, University of California, Santa Barbara

Speakers: Jonathan Balkind

P-Mesh is the manycore cache coherence system underlying the OpenPiton research platform, which originally used the SPARCv9 ISA. A number of extensions to P-Mesh were needed to build the Bring Your Own Core (BYOC) platform, which added support for building heterogeneous-ISA processors made of cores of new, open ISAs like OpenPOWER. In this talk, Jonathan will introduce P-Mesh and the changes made to turn it into an ISA-agnostic memory system. Jonathan will detail the specific changes needed to support different ISAs, the new Transaction-Response Interface (TRI) for connecting cores, and initial efforts to support cores using the OpenPOWER ISA. Jonathan will also discuss efforts to connect multiple cores of different ISAs to build a single heterogeneous-ISA system.
