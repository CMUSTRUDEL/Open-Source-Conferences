Speakers: Toshaan Bharvani

This presentation is about how we transformed our Data Center from a vintage server center to a dynamic DevOps inspired Cloud. In the process we build an open source Linux distribution and provide a wide range of software that can run directly on multiple platforms to our customers that enable them to take advantage of a cloud based approach. The use of open source software enabled us to build and maintain a platform that has multiple CPU architectures, multiple CPU optimizations and get the maximum from the hardware and software. PowerEL, the Linux distribution, that enables us to get an optimized experience for the users while utilizing the maximum of the hardware. In addition to that we recompile optimized version of many open source components to be able to deliver software rapidly and conveniently.
