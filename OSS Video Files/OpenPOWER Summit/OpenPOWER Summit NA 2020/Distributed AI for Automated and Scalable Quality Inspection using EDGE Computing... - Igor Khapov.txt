	Distributed AI for Automated and Scalable Quality Inspection using EDGE Computing on OpenPower - Igor Khapov, IBMT

Speakers: Igor Khapov

AI-assisted quality inspection is a critical feature for all manufacturing companies. Igor led IBM Development team to create production solution using Edge computing approach. Igor will present how to use Kuberntes and edge computing technologies in data science and video inspection. From this presentation you will understand how to combine ppc64le, arm and x86 architectures to get the cost-effective solutions. The team developed an AI-assisted automated quality inspection solution cross multiple plants for manufacturing. The solution is based on the latest technologies, for example, IBM PowerAI Vision for model training, edge computing for model deployment and management, and Nvidia Jetson TX2 devices for inferencing. The solution includes a centralized web dashboard for Model Developers and Quality Engineers. This solution now at the production stage across the globe.
