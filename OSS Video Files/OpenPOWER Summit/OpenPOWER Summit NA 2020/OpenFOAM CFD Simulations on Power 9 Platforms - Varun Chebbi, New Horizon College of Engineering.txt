Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is concept used solve various fluid flow problems.CFD requires intensive computational power and typically needs high-performance computing to reduce potentially long experimentation times.The Cloud based CFD simulation can help many industries in solving their complex fluid flow problems in every field.Of all the CFD tool OpenFOAM is an open source tool for complex fluid flow problems. In the world full of digitalisation,we as a mechanical engineer have eased our R&D projects by running our complex CFD computation using Power 9 cloud servers. IBM Power9 platform incorporates workflow management and multi-cloud implementation across various cloud resources.Here, we present the components of our technology in using it to create a cloud-based version in Analysis CFD software. Our CFD experiment report is mainly on the flow simulation of the heat exchange fluid flow and analyse the thermal flow using couple of test cases using Power9 HPC cloud platform.
