	OpenFOAM CFD Simulations on Power 9 Platforms - Varun Chebbi, New Horizon College of Engineering

Speakers: Varun Chebbi

Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is concept used solve various fluid flow problems.CFD requires intensive computational power and typically needs high-performance computing to reduce potentially long experimentation times.The Cloud based CFD simulation can help many industries in solving their complex fluid flow problems in every field.Of all the CFD tool OpenFOAM is an open source tool for complex fluid flow problems. In the world full of digitalisation,we as a mechanical engineer have eased our R&D projects by running our complex CFD computation using Power 9 cloud servers. IBM Power9 platform incorporates workflow management and multi-cloud implementation across various cloud resources.Here, we present the components of our technology in using it to create a cloud-based version in Analysis CFD software. Our CFD experiment report is mainly on the flow simulation of the heat exchange fluid flow and analyse the thermal flow using couple of test cases using Power9 HPC cloud platform.

uh hi

00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,799
hi guys uh sorry for the delay in fact

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,200
um

00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:14,400
uh this is from uh

00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,200
bangalore uh so basically uh today i'm

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,400
here to

00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:22,240
present my uh research work on

00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:26,160
uh cfd simulation on cloud

00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:28,800
platforms so basically uh my main

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,320
research work was not on data data

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,680
analysts for

00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:36,640
ai or not other things so it's

00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,600
purely on high performance computations

00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,879
where

00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:43,440
we run the simulations of fluids

00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:44,320
and study the behavior of the fluid flow

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,399
basically

00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:51,600
so that was my research field so

00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,079
so hope uh you guys know about the

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,199
things

00:00:52,079 --> 00:01:01,120
where uh where uh where where the

00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:04,799
uh the flow such as

00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:08,320
such as in aerospace field it might be

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,200
might be in uh turbo machinery renewable

00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,720
energy

00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:15,119
wherever the fluid flow takes place

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,880
apart from the solid we use this

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,080
technology called computational fluid

00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,479
dynamics

00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,280
so the with the advancement of

00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:24,479
technology

00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,000
and the digitalization so we as a

00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:29,360
mechanical engineers believe

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,759
that the work has to be conducted in a

00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,200
very

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,159
smooth manner no doubt the problems are

00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,119
very complex

00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,920
and still more innovations have to be

00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:41,920
carried out

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:44,399
in many of the fields so

00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,280
don't don't mistake me because i'm held

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,240
up with my

00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,560
laptop where i was unable to do so so

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,600
i'm just presenting in my phone

00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,399
so here you can see the screen so my

00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,960
main

00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,960
presentation contains what is uh

00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:01,920
computational fluid dynamics

00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,719
uh its applications uh and uh

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,119
applications

00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,759
and how where in which shawl field the

00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:09,200
open

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,080
foam and the fluid dynamics is used so i

00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,120
have also

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:16,160
run a simulation on the power platforms

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,480
where uh where i have shown that the

00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:21,520
efficiency of the power 9

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,599
systems along with the gpus so

00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,520
in the presentation further we'll just

00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:28,959
include that

00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:32,000
and coming to uh we have also created an

00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:35,360
ecosystem in the india where

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,080
i and uh mr ganeshan sir who is the open

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,200
power leader

00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,760
for education and research

00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,440
i have worked on creating an ecosystem

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,400
among the

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,200
indian education system so i'll just go

00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,400
through it and

00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:53,840
what are the future scope of work

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:58,640
what are the what are the

00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,640
goals we have in order to reach and

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,720
do some good things out there so let me

00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,239
start

00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:09,360
with the introduction by saying that

00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,360
we have many

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:17,280
software tools such as ansys

00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,280
and all those things in order to

00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,239
run the simulation and make the

00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:25,280
mechanical problems very easily

00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:27,200
uh in order to uh solve these problems

00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,400
the

00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:33,120
uh we require a lot of

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,239
engineering knowledge along with the hpc

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,120
clusters

00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:39,760
so what these hpc clusters do is it's

00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,799
more of a cloud computing kind of thing

00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:45,519
where the ease of computing uh the high

00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:49,040
performance computing takes place

00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:51,440
and i i appreciate the

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,799
power systems for this because it's not

00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:56,480
only in terms of

00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:58,239
uh ai and data driven but

00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,560
in terms of high performance

00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,319
computations where the problems are

00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,760
really high

00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:07,920
of high complex we can able to solve it

00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,599
so coming to the background of

00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,959
computational fluid dynamics

00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:15,200
uh we know that there is a equation

00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:18,639
called navier-stokes equation

00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:21,359
where we run these where all the

00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:25,120
simulations of the fluid dynamics are

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:27,199
based on this so let me let me brief you

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,280
about this navier-stoke equation

00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,720
so in our school days we would have

00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,919
studied about the

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,560
inlet and the outlet uh

00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:38,240
velocity of the flow along with the time

00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,400
so this navier stokes also

00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,000
works in the similar way where the

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,440
viscous fluid

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,560
flows with respect to time and the

00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:52,080
difference of the fluid flow and

00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:54,840
at that particular point the

00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:57,120
flow or the fluid the characteristics

00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:00,160
are

00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,880
studied and main

00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,880
main problems can be physical problems

00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:09,120
can be determined

00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:11,280
so uh coming to the conventional

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,960
definition so computational fluid

00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,960
dynamics is nothing but a branch of

00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:18,080
fluid dynamics where we study

00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,120
the fluid flow along with uh with the

00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,080
help of

00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,400
boundary conditions and the super speed

00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,039
supercomputers for the better solutions

00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:29,120
and the

00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:33,360
accurate uh and accurate

00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:36,400
results so uh coming to the applications

00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:39,600
we have seen many of the

00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:42,960
uh many of the industries using this

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:46,800
uh uh tool uh where

00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:49,440
we uh the ease of

00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,120
ease of maintaining the roof temperature

00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,400
and the data servers

00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,880
so we designed this data cooling room so

00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,319
that

00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:03,120
in order to prevent uh the

00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:05,759
prevent the heat produced and also

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,960
and also the feasibility of the weather

00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,199
temperature in

00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,960
in terms of in the days where the kovid

00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:14,400
19 situations were there the

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:17,520
flow of infections reduction was

00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:20,639
a major uh problem so hence

00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,120
hvac and the cfd played a major role in

00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,280
the

00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,560
maintaining the corporate offices and

00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:28,160
other things

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:31,280
and also we use cfd in uh automobile

00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:34,800
and aerospace field where the design

00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,680
and drafting of the aerospace and

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,440
automobile

00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,520
takes place and i'm also currently

00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:42,639
working on the aerospace

00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,680
domain where uh where there is lots of

00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,080
research scope

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,520
because nowadays what has happened is

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,639
the

00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,639
indian government in india we have

00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:55,599
the privatization in the aerospace

00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:58,160
industry so there is lots of scope

00:06:55,599 --> 00:07:00,160
not only in india as well as abroad so

00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,479
the space researchers are going on

00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,639
and there is a huge scope and coming to

00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:08,319
electronic circuits and batteries

00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:11,360
uh with the growth of the technology of

00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:15,440
electric vehicles the there is

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:18,080
lots of thermal and

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,720
flow flow problems uh where the heat is

00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,680
produced

00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,520
in order to reduce the heat and the

00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:28,720
monitor amount of heat

00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:32,000
we we use such technologies for the

00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:34,400
for the computation of the

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,400
for the computation of the fluid flow

00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:39,360
and coming to renewable energy

00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,000
you know that the wind uh wind solar

00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,240
everything

00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,000
creates a radiation and also the fluid

00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:48,319
flow so hence this concept of fluid

00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,479
computational fluid dynamics is used and

00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:51,280
also it is used by the astrophysics

00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:54,400
where

00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:56,879
they study about the space and

00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,360
other parameters and also naturally the

00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:02,720
turbo machineries and other things

00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:06,160
so let me uh as i

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:09,280
i wasted my time in problem solving the

00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:12,319
technical issue here so i'll just uh

00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,680
jump few slides so the major players are

00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,960
the answers

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:20,319
of power flow and out of all this open

00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,639
form is one of the tool where it is used

00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,680
by

00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:26,400
used by any uh as it is an open tool

00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,919
open source tool where where we can run

00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,639
where there is no limitation for

00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:32,479
anything

00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:36,320
either it may be a mesh generation

00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:38,320
or any any sort of uh

00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,440
boundaries it might be there is no

00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:43,519
boundary for it

00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:46,080
until and unless we have a supporting

00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,279
hardware such as ibm power systems and

00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,560
uh hpc

00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:53,519
cloud clusters like ibm power nine

00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:55,760
so so uh there is no boundary conditions

00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:58,160
but whereas in ansys and other

00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,880
tools there are limitations and they are

00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,480
more of

00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,680
a business oriented organization what i

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,839
would call is

00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,000
so coming to what is the advantage of

00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:11,040
this cloud computing

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,440
so there is a low low initial cost and

00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,279
easy backup and elastic computing

00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:19,360
resources

00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:22,240
so in the age where the

00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,040
the economic constraint comes into the

00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,600
picture

00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,399
even an individual according to his

00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,880
requirement

00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,399
can a mechanical engineer or an

00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:35,040
aerospace engineer

00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:37,920
can explore his fields where he can

00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,120
learn his own simulations and uh make

00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,360
the things done

00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,279
and it is the storing of data is no

00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,800
longer a big issue nowadays

00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:50,399
because of the cloud and all those uh

00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:52,800
upcoming uh technologies so coming to

00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,839
my uh the work which i have done uh i

00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,120
would like to share

00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:59,680
so basically cfd

00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,640
simulation consists of three major parts

00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,519
uh it's uh

00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:05,120
pre-processing solver solution and the

00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:08,160
post processing

00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:10,640
uh it's in your ai

00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,600
you would have you would have heard

00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,640
about the

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:17,440
neural networks uh because

00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,519
in in terms of mechanical engineers and

00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,360
all the cfd enthusiasts

00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,560
this neural networks is a very new

00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,680
concept

00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:29,440
and rather we

00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:33,279
we also have this uh

00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:35,920
uh we we provide the input

00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:37,519
such as the initial conditions uh what

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,920
type of the fluid is flowing

00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:42,320
through and other other parameters when

00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:46,399
we are inputting a

00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:49,519
fluid inside a solid workplace

00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,399
so solver what it does is it takes all

00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,440
your data

00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:56,320
input data and all the constraints so

00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,360
yeah so by default there are many

00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,680
equations

00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,440
and the solutions are already present

00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,600
where the computations

00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,800
takes place using this cloud computing

00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:09,519
concept and

00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:12,800
some amazing things is done by this

00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:16,240
power nine systems so that we can get

00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:19,519
the results very easily and very fast

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,240
more so in post processing what we get

00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:23,360
is

00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:25,279
we we obtain a graphical output for

00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,720
the user interface where the

00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,560
interpolation of

00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,920
results for this various parameters

00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,920
takes place so

00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,519
it's post processing is all about the

00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:37,440
analysis of the result

00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:38,079
uh to the real time mechanical results

00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,200
where we

00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:42,079
calculate uh using the matlab and other

00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,279
uh

00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:48,640
tools such as photron and so on

00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,120
so the main aim of my uh research work

00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:53,279
was

00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:57,519
we we used uh we used a fluid

00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:59,760
fuel fluid flow in the uh aerospace

00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:01,200
aircraft basically actually it's a

00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,160
confidential project

00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,120
so i just took a part of it and i'm just

00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,959
explaining you

00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:11,680
so this is the open forum

00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,399
input pre-processing screen where where

00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,839
we input

00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:18,320
all these uh parameters uh such as uh

00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,600
the fluid type the fluid gradient the

00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,639
inlet velocity

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:25,200
and the pressure of inlet and

00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:27,200
other veloci other parameters such as

00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:30,399
the starting time the end time

00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:33,279
and at what time you just need to

00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:33,680
obtain the result the result where you

00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:37,040
get

00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:38,560
uh the at what time the characteristic

00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:42,000
of fluid is doing

00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:44,480
so and these uh each and every point

00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,079
you get the data and at each and every

00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:49,040
coordinate you get the data

00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,680
and uh every second every minute second

00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,000
if you need

00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,959
we get the data so that is the beauty of

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,720
this uh

00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:58,560
software called open form as as anyone

00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,920
in this world can use it as it is an

00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,880
open source tool

00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,079
but the problem with this is we need to

00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,920
code the stuffs

00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:07,200
as i have told you that we don't have

00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,440
any

00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,760
borders boundary conditions and other

00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:14,320
things so it is easy to

00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:16,399
perform our computations so this is the

00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,880
cad design which we input in our pro

00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,519
post

00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,320
pre processing and we just go for the

00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,040
meshing

00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,920
uh what basically machine is we just

00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,279
divide

00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:30,800
the as a computer-aided design

00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:33,760
into billions of parts

00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,959
at what time we just need the result the

00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:38,320
accurate result

00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:40,800
so the hence we divide the uh model

00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,440
into billions of parts where we

00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,720
integrate

00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:47,920
and uh get the result done and this

00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,120
is the solver uh we just uh

00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,160
this is the place where all the

00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:54,240
computations takes place and

00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:58,240
this is the user interface called para

00:13:54,240 --> 00:14:00,639
view where all the simulations and

00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,880
computations are visible to your eyes

00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:06,240
using the power 9 gpu

00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:09,680
processors so this is the

00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:11,360
para view where the results are obtained

00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,680
so this is the post processing where

00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,959
your graphs and other results

00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:19,360
come into picture and uh you can

00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:21,519
tally with your real-time uh real-time

00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:25,040
experimental data with the

00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,920
machine so here is the post-processing

00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,040
screen of

00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:32,320
the open form where

00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:34,959
where you can see the uh time

00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,360
uh at what time what is the behavior of

00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,839
the

00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,800
fluid flow at uh you can see the screen

00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:43,360
that at the point of 41.8 second

00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,720
these are the constraints of the fluid

00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,279
and at what time

00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,839
at what place at what coordinate the

00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:51,360
fluid

00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:53,040
is located so it's a beauty of the

00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:56,480
technology my friends

00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,480
uh basically uh

00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,320
anything what i believe is after

00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:02,720
starting my career

00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,360
uh the problem statement has to be very

00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,600
clear

00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,959
with the advancement of the technology

00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,720
and the

00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:11,199
uh computations uh so any any problem

00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,600
can be

00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:15,360
solved but the our problem statement has

00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,440
to be very clear

00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,800
so these are the results at the time of

00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,920
75th second

00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:24,079
the coordinates the fluid flow the

00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,279
what is the temperature and all those

00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:28,880
constants are

00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:32,720
visible here uh okay

00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:33,600
so apart from our computation and

00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,959
research

00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:39,199
we have we me myself and

00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:41,440
ganesha narayan swamisa who is the open

00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:44,639
power leader for education and research

00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,519
have created an echo system uh you know

00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,880
in india

00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:51,519
so that people take uh take the

00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,320
interest in the these kind of

00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:55,759
technologies

00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:58,399
where where uh where we still uh see

00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,600
people use old conventional machineries

00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,959
lathe machines

00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,320
and all other things but why not and uh

00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,839
the place where i come from the

00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,360
bangalore it is called the silicon

00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:10,240
valley of india

00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,279
and more people are into the i.t jobs

00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,199
but

00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:18,320
and it's more of a

00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:19,519
ecosystem where the iteit professionals

00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,759
are represent

00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:24,240
in that place we encourage the

00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:27,360
mechanical engineers to take up such

00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:30,079
challenging and technologies

00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:33,120
and work on the same so these are some

00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:35,360
of the pictures i would like to share

00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,560
so what is the future now so we have

00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:41,839
done all the research

00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:41,839
and all the things but how it can uh

00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,839
so how it can uh

00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:03,279
so how it can benefit our society

00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:07,439
so what what our future plans are

00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:07,439
to to in fact

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:15,520
encourage the startups in terms of uh

00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,919
education and research and also our aim

00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,839
is

00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:19,360
to create an ecosystem where the

00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:21,199
artificial intelligence and machine

00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:24,480
learning takes picture takes place

00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:27,520
in terms of cfd where there is huge

00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:30,559
amount of data and

00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,200
the previous data models can be treated

00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:33,919
and

00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,799
other things can be done so i would like

00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,840
to

00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:38,240
end my talk as i think that i'm very

00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,280
late

00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:44,160
and due to technical issues

00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,760
if there is any q and a question and

00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,600
answer i would

00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,919
surely answer you guys i'll be very

00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,919
happy to answer the same

00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:53,280
thank you thank you so much i'm sorry

00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:56,880
sorry for the delay

00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,880
