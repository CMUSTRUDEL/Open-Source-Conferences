	The "New Normal" or An Evolution - David Leichner, SQREAM

Speakers: David Leichner

The "New Normal" that we are experiencing with COVID-19 together with the exponential growth of IoT devices and the digitalization taking hold in the market, is moving us out of the Big Data generation and into the era of Massive Data. Enterprises who were struggling to keep up with maintaining and analyzing the data in their legacy Data Warehouses and data lakes, are being completely overwhelmed with the rapid growth of data that they are experiencing. This session will discuss various ways that companies are changing their data management infrastructure to try to keep up. It will look at the movement to the cloud, upgrades of existing legacy systems and other technologies being implemented to resolve some of these issues. The session will also highlight the use of POWER 9 and GPUs as the underlying processing power being used to resolve these challenging issues.
