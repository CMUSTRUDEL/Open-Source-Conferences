Speakers: Toshaan Bharvani

This presentation is about how easy it is to migrate workloads on OpenPOWER systems, mainly looking at the ppc64le architecture. Firstly we will look at some examples of how difficult is is to migrate existing open source software to ppc64le. In the second part, some optimizations will be looked at, and how these optimizations can lead to better performance and the effort to this is not as difficult as expected.
