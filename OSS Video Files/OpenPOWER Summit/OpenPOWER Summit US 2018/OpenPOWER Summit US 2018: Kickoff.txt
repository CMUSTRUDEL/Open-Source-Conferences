see we have a full agenda for you this

00:00:56,060 --> 00:01:02,149
morning we have a few panel discussions

00:00:59,149 --> 00:01:04,399
and keynote presentations from members

00:01:02,149 --> 00:01:06,530
of the open power foundation covering

00:01:04,399 --> 00:01:08,630
both academia and commercial entities

00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:12,020
and showing you how they're leveraging

00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:13,520
open power for themselves we also have a

00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:15,619
lunch will be served up on the third

00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,910
floor and while lunch is being served a

00:01:15,619 --> 00:01:18,470
trade show kicked off there will be an

00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:20,000
opportunity for you to see that the

00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:22,280
various offerings and open cow

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,810
foundation members the trade show and

00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,280
lunch will continue a trade show season

00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:27,080
will continue all afternoon lunch will

00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,220
conclude around one o'clock and that's

00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,869
the point where we'll kick into the

00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:32,030
technical sessions for the afternoon we

00:01:29,869 --> 00:01:33,440
have six parallel tracks a really

00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:35,060
interesting really wide range of

00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,950
technical presentations which I

00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,790
encourage you to to take the opportunity

00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:40,760
to review

00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:42,409
they'll also all be recorded so if you

00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,850
find yourself in that dichotomy of I

00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:45,770
don't really want to be in two places at

00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:47,210
once you all got to catch up later and

00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:49,369
that will all be made available through

00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:52,490
the open power the open power web site

00:01:49,369 --> 00:01:53,540
the afternoon will conclude around four

00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:55,490
o'clock with hors d'oeuvres and the

00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:58,460
trade show will continue at that point

00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:59,780
and will be an opportunity to network

00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:01,390
and again sort of view that view the

00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:04,820
boost up on the up on the third floor

00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,470
this is an exciting time for open

00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:09,290
parents a positive inflection point in

00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:12,079
the history of open power we have the

00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:14,329
power nine CPU a heart high high

00:02:12,079 --> 00:02:16,790
performance fast leading microprocessor

00:02:14,329 --> 00:02:18,680
so we have a really really rich software

00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:21,140
ecosystem both free software open source

00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,880
software and commercial offerings and of

00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:24,590
course a really really vibrant community

00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:27,530
backing it all up as well as part of

00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:29,209
that broader ecosystem right yeah later

00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:30,380
on this morning actually will be

00:02:29,209 --> 00:02:33,590
moderating a panel

00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:35,480
of few Robles power foundation members

00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:38,480
who are actually part of this thriving

00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:40,040
and growing software community we also

00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,350
have a really really wide range of

00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:44,450
hardware now for open power we have high

00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:47,090
performance desktops we have hyper scale

00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:48,740
servers available we've got monster SMP

00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:51,200
systems there's really a wide range of

00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:53,480
hardware available within the hardware

00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,680
side of the open power ecosystem you'll

00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,450
get the opportunity to hear a little bit

00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:58,490
more about that in a panel that will run

00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:59,810
a little later this morning but also up

00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:01,970
in the the trade show you'll actually

00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:05,270
get to see and put your hands on a lot

00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:06,680
of that a lot of that kid the other

00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:08,150
thing that I wanted to talk about sort

00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:10,400
of in the context the open is actually

00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:12,470
the openness of open power one of the

00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,750
things that I think is really important

00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:17,240
to recognize with with open powers that

00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:19,760
we have in the open power hardware

00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:21,980
ecosystem the most open software stack

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,600
you have the firmware the BMC the

00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:26,450
operating systems that run or open power

00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:28,400
are really the really open from the

00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:30,250
factory from top to bottom and you can

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,060
either or do you have your servers

00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:33,680
arriving with that Hardware

00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:34,520
pre-installed by the manufacturer or

00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,080
install it later

00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,430
other things that's nice about open

00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,170
power I guess is that the only operating

00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:47,270
system that runs on the process is the

00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:51,410
one you asked for oh yeah one more all

00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:53,990
right the Flair slide in from ecosystem

00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:56,990
standpoint we're growing as open power

00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:59,540
we have over 300 members a healthy set

00:03:56,990 --> 00:04:04,040
of working groups and a pretty cool

00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:06,770
academic discussion group as well and to

00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:08,450
I guess steal a word from our

00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:13,130
illustrious president Bryant Alec this

00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:15,110
is what revolution looks like so with

00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:18,320
that I'll end our little dog and pony

00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:22,670
show skit here and again welcome you to

00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:23,930
the 2018 open power summit and hand over

00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:25,880
to huge introduce our next speakers

00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:28,250
thanks sy oh my great pleasure to

00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:29,960
introduce IBM's Brad McCready and the

00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:32,030
invidious Jerry Chen who all could you

00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:35,200
oh you do the first keynote for us this
