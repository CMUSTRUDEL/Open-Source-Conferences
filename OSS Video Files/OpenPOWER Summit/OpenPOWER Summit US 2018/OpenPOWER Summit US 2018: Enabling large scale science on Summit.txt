	00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:06,509
the next talk should be given by my

00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:09,480
collaborator chair extrema from oak

00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:16,109
ridge he wasn't able to travel after we

00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:17,910
initially planned but I'm collaborating

00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:20,430
with him so the title is enabling large

00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:22,080
scale science on Summit with highly

00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:23,369
efficient scientific applications

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,340
developed through the Center for

00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:30,720
accelerated application readiness or car

00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:33,780
so this is our progression Jaguar Titan

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:37,129
Summit and then on to frontier right now

00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:47,489
summit is the the focus of most of our

00:00:37,129 --> 00:00:49,379
technical of efforts so yeah I slowly

00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:52,680
show this there's our picture of the

00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:54,840
power 9 processor it was this particular

00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:58,170
image was not showing this morning it

00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:01,289
has up to 24 cores the choral machines

00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:04,140
have 22 cores for yield optimization on

00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:07,740
the very first processors and it has a

00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:10,049
PCI Express 4 which is it was quite

00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:14,549
novel and attractive in vlink

00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:17,670
- and we're using the version with a for

00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:20,040
Hardware threads right that's the p9

00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:24,720
that we're getting and here's the Nvidia

00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:26,790
Volta it's a very very strong GPU I

00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,740
would say you know you get nice

00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:30,360
percentages of increase in the

00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:34,079
performance and the peak performance

00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:36,150
going from Pascal the Volta the memory

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,189
management on the Volta is very much

00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:40,530
improved and actually so you'll you

00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:43,140
should expect to get higher percentages

00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:47,040
at peak from the Volta then you saw on

00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:49,770
the pascal of course what's new and was

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,020
actually surprising to us when it was

00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:54,570
announced about a year ago are these

00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:56,969
cuda cores for doing reduced precision

00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:59,100
analysis that was not something that we

00:01:56,969 --> 00:02:02,610
knew about in the the procurement but

00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:06,450
added new focus and new interest to the

00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:10,250
project that we were executing and it

00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:13,160
just the same way adam indicated we had

00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:20,810
early access system that we call summit

00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:23,840
dev is sub three racks of 54 Minsky

00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:25,580
nodes we've had it for about a year and

00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,520
a quarter in order to work on

00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:33,830
application development so they are a to

00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:37,090
power 8 plus 4 GPUs Pascal's per node

00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:40,160
connected by the version 1 of env link

00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:42,050
there's 4 racks shown here one was one

00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,950
two fourth rack was given to the system

00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:47,690
development experts the HPC Operations

00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:49,970
Group in order to test their hardware

00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:55,370
and work on file system development and

00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:58,100
related activities so when we execute a

00:02:55,370 --> 00:03:00,800
project like this assign the initial

00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:04,040
contracts we begin working straightaway

00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:07,940
on the applications so we we did a call

00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:09,970
for application readiness projects we

00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:13,780
initially budgeted for eight of these

00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:16,940
projects we had budgeted for six in the

00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:19,489
Titan project but we got 29 proposals

00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:25,280
and we consider 28 of them to be

00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:29,209
excellent the 29th one was the one we

00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:32,330
got in 2000 2014 on machine learning and

00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:34,400
it was immature even the PI of the

00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:36,890
project said it was immature that shows

00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,870
you how quickly our community is moving

00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:42,980
I think from the beginning of this

00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:46,040
project to where we are now and so we

00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:49,489
expanded the number of projects in

00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:52,760
created budget added effort and accepted

00:03:49,489 --> 00:03:56,450
13 of these application readiness

00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:57,950
projects and these were part of the

00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:00,670
activity of the center of excellence

00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:05,570
that Adam mentioned where we're working

00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:08,120
together with Livermore and IBM and

00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:10,250
NVIDIA experts on understanding making

00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:12,470
the plan for how these applications are

00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:15,140
going to be ready to for Summit and then

00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:18,079
doing the work on a regular basis to

00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:20,330
move them and get them ready for Summit

00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,620
first on Summit dev and then on to

00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:25,199
Summit now our goals in

00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:28,230
for sure early science achievements we

00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:30,300
want applications to begin being very

00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:33,150
productive very early in the life of our

00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:35,729
machine everything's too expensive and

00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:38,220
they live too short to sort of get the

00:04:35,729 --> 00:04:41,669
applications up after the machine has

00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:43,440
arrived we have to begin skating to

00:04:41,669 --> 00:04:47,280
where the puck is going to be to quote

00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:49,800
Wayne Gretzky so and then demonstrate

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:52,050
the that the work of application

00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:55,740
readiness has been a fruitful activity

00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:57,990
we need to prepare pis to write

00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:00,840
proposals to our major application

00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:04,440
programs and what's very very important

00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:07,560
is to harden the supercomputer for full

00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:09,840
user applications because the acceptance

00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:12,120
suite can never be sufficiently complete

00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,330
to catch all the bugs to catch all the

00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:17,580
problems so we need to throw at it more

00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:21,600
applications as the Machine matures in

00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:25,620
order to root out all remaining bugs if

00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:32,490
possible these are the 13 projects they

00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:36,330
are uncomfortably long list of mails but

00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:39,870
they are applications that have been

00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:41,669
running at petascale and some that have

00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:43,470
not been running at petascale for

00:05:41,669 --> 00:05:45,810
example some applications here have been

00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:48,900
running on Titan but about half of them

00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:52,789
are new to petascale computing they

00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:55,580
include projects and climate science

00:05:52,789 --> 00:05:59,810
several projects in chemistry

00:05:55,580 --> 00:06:02,490
astrophysics plasma physics cosmology

00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:08,090
molecular dynamics nuclear structure

00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:08,090
physics combustion engine combustion

00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:17,460
global seismology these are some of the

00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:19,560
rather traditional simulation science

00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:23,669
fields represented by these projects and

00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:29,250
these pis so each each of these projects

00:06:23,669 --> 00:06:33,349
was a how did I come out of presentation

00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:33,349
though yeah

00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:41,280
the reason I'm pausing is because I hid

00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:46,340
some of these slides and they're not

00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,340
hidden now that's strange

00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:54,449
okay

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,759
now we're going so I want to say if give

00:06:54,449 --> 00:07:01,410
a few results from summit dev for a

00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:03,229
selection of these projects so Bronson

00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:05,610
Messer is the PI of this he's a

00:07:03,229 --> 00:07:09,030
computational astrophysics at Oak Ridge

00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:12,090
and he's studying Astrophysical flames

00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:15,539
and explosions in particular things like

00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:17,819
the explosion of a suit of a star of a

00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:20,009
heavy star as a supernova or the

00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:22,710
explosion that results when a black

00:07:20,009 --> 00:07:26,490
holes or neutron stars would merge and

00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:30,060
produce gravitational waves the code is

00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:31,530
using is multi is a community code

00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:34,440
originally from the University of

00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:40,229
Chicago called flash originally funded

00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:43,070
by NSA science programs and the current

00:07:40,229 --> 00:07:45,330
flash status on summit dev is that

00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:47,849
somebody dev provided a unique

00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:50,940
opportunity to experiment with different

00:07:47,849 --> 00:07:53,250
programming models for flash we're open

00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:56,280
ACC and open and P 4.5 have been

00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:58,530
explored they were able to determine the

00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:02,069
optimal number for the adaptive mesh

00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:05,250
refinement blocks per GPU of production

00:08:02,069 --> 00:08:07,349
of the large memory both the large GPU

00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:11,219
and CPU memory allowed hundreds of

00:08:07,349 --> 00:08:13,139
blocks per MPI rank even for large

00:08:11,219 --> 00:08:17,190
network runs here we're talking about

00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:20,009
the chemical reaction network that

00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:24,620
describes the synthesis of new new

00:08:20,009 --> 00:08:27,870
elements in these stellar explosions

00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:29,250
determining the match being able to

00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:31,229
predict and understand the natural

00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:34,620
abundance of heavy elements in the

00:08:31,229 --> 00:08:38,490
universe is one of the Holy Grail

00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:41,190
science projects for this area so here's

00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:44,670
some performance numbers on Summit dev

00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:45,700
in terms of time to solution versus a

00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:49,540
number of blocks

00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:52,510
of the AMR refinement activity and

00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:57,030
basically the solution here says that

00:08:52,510 --> 00:09:00,310
the the the number is he it says that

00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:02,740
the GPU can retire roughly a hundred

00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:06,100
blocks at the same time as one block of

00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:08,710
the CPU so the the expansion you get and

00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:11,680
the size of problem you can do is very

00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:13,900
very large in terms of moving on to the

00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,660
GPU accelerated problem this size of

00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:21,340
problem couldn't be attempted on Titan

00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:26,500
the the memory would not allow it so GT

00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:30,070
C is a is a tokamak code to solve the

00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:32,530
gyro kinetic equations for the energy

00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:35,460
transport within a tokamak which of

00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:38,440
course is a large a doughnut-shaped

00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:41,200
fusion reactor the P I here is from

00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:45,370
University of California Irvine a Z Hong

00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:49,090
Lin and this is a long standing mini a

00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:52,210
widely used code and plasma physics on

00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:55,210
the current status on Summit dev the

00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:57,430
code already uses a GPUs effectively on

00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:59,860
Titan and actually on many other GPU

00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:02,620
accelerated clusters worldwide using

00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:07,170
open ACC and the additional development

00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:11,020
work has been done to optimize that

00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:14,260
particle push for summit dev the code

00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:16,900
also now uses the Nvidia library AM GX

00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:19,960
solver to improve the performance over a

00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:22,540
pet see field solver and here the wall

00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:26,860
time has been shown up to have a

00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:31,900
speed-up of about 3 X comparing the GPUs

00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:35,320
on Summit dev to the GPUs on Titan hack

00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:39,310
is the hardware accelerated cosmology

00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:42,130
code this is a code that that represents

00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:44,590
the whole cosmos the whole universe as a

00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:46,060
series of particles and then evolves

00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:48,220
them through the Big Bang of the

00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:51,400
universe in order to understand the

00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:54,100
distribution of matter and in the in the

00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:56,020
universe the code was started at Los

00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:58,250
Alamos National Laboratory when Salman

00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:59,720
Habib was there happy

00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:04,390
his group are now at Argonne National

00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:07,520
Laboratory performing synthetic

00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:10,070
simulations of synthetic skies they can

00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:13,250
be used for these large experimental

00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:16,960
large Observatory measurements that are

00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:20,210
planned for the future this is a large

00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:23,600
simulation activity and also has very

00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:26,120
strong data analysis activities the test

00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:29,510
problem that was chosen for Summit death

00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:35,240
is basically a thousand cubed particles

00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:37,190
in a 115 mega parsec box and it was

00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:40,220
running on 32 this this configuration

00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:43,250
would run on 32 Titan nodes one of

00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:45,320
course with each K 20 processor this

00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:48,080
thing when some of dev would take 8

00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:51,790
nodes each with 4 P 100's and they're

00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:55,660
getting the expected 3 and 1/2 X

00:11:51,790 --> 00:12:02,570
performance improvement on the key and

00:11:55,660 --> 00:12:04,970
computationally intensive routines the

00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:07,790
last one I'm going to highlight is one

00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:11,060
is Nandi it's a very popular leica

00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:14,210
dynamics code out of University of

00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:17,990
Illinois urbana-champaign the P I here

00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:21,400
is Jim Phillips one of the superstar

00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:23,839
developers of this code this code is

00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:27,550
primarily focused on computational

00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:31,760
biophysics activities and as a large

00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:34,280
large community of users and so by

00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:37,610
porting this code we we potentially

00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:39,490
could get many applications for use in

00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:44,960
our new supercomputer

00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:49,520
the summit dev work has focused on new

00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:53,240
non-bonded force kernels program through

00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:55,910
CUDA new particle mesh kewal reciprocal

00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:57,770
forces for the long-range forces to

00:12:55,910 --> 00:13:00,110
compute the long-range forces an

00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:02,270
explicit solvent calculations on Nambiar

00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:05,210
now one and a half to two and a half

00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:09,020
times faster on the GPUs the implicit

00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:10,750
solvers simulations on Nambiar now again

00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:13,210
one and a half to five and a half times

00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:15,400
faster and faster simulations on on

00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:19,950
systems that multiple GPUs per known

00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:24,130
here's some data that shows roughly a

00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:27,280
factor of two speed-up on a variety of

00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:31,060
the kernels well factor of two to a

00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:33,250
factor of a factor of one to factor of

00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:34,630
two there and here a factor of one and a

00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:40,300
half to factor of five and a half just

00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:43,090
as the notice a oh yes one more this is

00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:46,870
q MC pack this is electronic structure

00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:50,410
code for materials of led by paul kent

00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:51,700
at Oakridge this is a way of solving for

00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:54,370
the electronic structure of materials

00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:56,260
that's more accurate than say dis a

00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:58,420
functional theory but it's also more

00:13:56,260 --> 00:14:00,340
computationally intensive but because of

00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:02,230
the monte carlo nature of the code it

00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:06,400
should be well-suited to massively

00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:10,480
parallel supercomputers as they move

00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:13,180
this from titan on to summative they

00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:15,220
observe that that some of des nodes were

00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:16,960
about a factor of twenty faster than

00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:19,270
titan that's actually more than you

00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:23,530
might expect the factor twenty comes

00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:26,230
from the overall more graceful way that

00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:28,710
the memory is being managed for example

00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:32,440
in moving data from the CPU and the GPU

00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:35,830
the the generation two PCIe bus was a

00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:38,110
very strong limit a strong bottleneck on

00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:41,170
this code and that's been very much

00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:45,370
relaxed and there was a 14x speed-up of

00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:47,200
the four p 100's if you just compared to

00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:49,089
the 2 power ace if you just limited the

00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:52,839
code to run on the two power rates so

00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:55,750
this this group considers the transition

00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:58,690
from Titan to summit and then eventually

00:14:55,750 --> 00:15:00,160
the summit Titan to summative and then

00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:04,150
eventually a summit to be a real

00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:10,810
game-changer for their science and with

00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:13,650
that I'll just summer say that we did

00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:17,830
after working on these applications from

00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:21,160
2015 we additionally did a call for

00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:25,600
early science proposals in December

00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:29,740
and the idea was to open up early access

00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:31,380
to summit to additional projects that is

00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:33,880
projects in addition to the ones we

00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:36,970
selected in our application readiness

00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:39,790
call three years earlier a lot had

00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:42,550
changed in those three years and this

00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:44,770
opportunity to provide fresh codes to

00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:47,740
come in people who are independently

00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:50,700
preparing for the future they were able

00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:53,620
to come in and apply to be an early user

00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:56,500
we got sixty two letters of intent this

00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:59,580
was actually many more than we expected

00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:02,110
they came from a variety of sources

00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:04,980
about half of these had been running

00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:08,320
with us in the past about half have not

00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:11,050
and right now these are the 60 or so

00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:15,220
teams that are getting early access to

00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:17,950
the part of Summit basically the 25% of

00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:22,390
summit that we accepted in December as a

00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:24,700
preliminary acceptance and they are

00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:27,270
trying to show that they can take

00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:30,130
advantage of Summit at scale right now

00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:32,230
in terms of scaling out on large number

00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:34,810
of nodes and making effective use of its

00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:36,970
GPU accelerated architecture they're

00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:40,180
gonna write proposals for early science

00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:42,400
I access that they can submit when they

00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:44,560
are ready to submit them but we expect

00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:48,250
them to be due by the beginning of June

00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:50,890
and the early science period will will

00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:53,260
extend from the time that we accept the

00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:55,540
machine later the summer through the

00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:59,710
beginning of normal user operations in

00:16:55,540 --> 00:17:03,160
2019 so with that come to the end of

00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:06,220
this presentation so some is still under

00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:08,620
construction it looking for it later

00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:11,230
this year and we're continuing to work

00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:15,150
on hardware installation and software

00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:15,150
