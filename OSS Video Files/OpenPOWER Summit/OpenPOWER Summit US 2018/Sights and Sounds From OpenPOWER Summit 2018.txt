understand the road map and also network

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:48,090
with the entire community to code my VP

00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:50,870
we're declaring this Zayas platform to

00:00:48,090 --> 00:01:03,800
be google strong

[Music]

00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,950
Center for computational science has

00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:11,270
simply said is to build the largest

00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:13,490
supercomputer we can in terms of our

00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:15,830
future we've planted it for power nine

00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:19,190
pretty quickly now and we're looking at

00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:20,810
finding more about the open copy and the

00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:24,050
power 9 so that we can go to the next

00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:28,000
next stage in our development ip9 for us

00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:28,000
you know we are we're excited about that

00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:33,739

solve new problems in marketplace a lot

00:01:56,710 --> 00:02:00,370
of machine learning all the things are

00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:03,630
gonna make a difference for partners for

00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:03,630
