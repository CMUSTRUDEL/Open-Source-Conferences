[Applause]

00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:07,250
good morning folks

00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:10,410
very excited to be here my name is Maura

00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:12,990
systems hardware engineer at Google and

00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:14,910
I'm also proud of the fact that I'm on

00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:16,949
the board of directors for the open

00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:19,710
power foundation this year I'm the

00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:23,100
treasurer so it's been two years since

00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:25,830
we had a summit and I've got a lot of

00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:29,849
exciting things to talk about and so

00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:32,399
with that let's get started so today I

00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:37,860
want to cover two key topics the first

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:40,550
is technology trends and and growth

00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:43,559
trends and the implication for

00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:46,770
supply-demand gap and the second part is

00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:48,899
that's a challenge and how open power

00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:51,719
systems can help us address that

00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:56,760
challenge through core and system

00:00:51,719 --> 00:01:00,210
innovations so Brad stole my thunder

00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:02,730
earlier this is a beautiful chart from a

00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:04,830
textbook by Patterson and Hennessy a

00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:07,200
computer architecture connotative

00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:09,810
approach what's nice about this charge

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,630
is it shows the different phases key

00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:16,020
phases of technology trends so the green

00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:18,720
era was the era of Dennard scaling so

00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:20,520
transistor shrinking but power density

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,610
remaining the same and he saw

00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:26,549
performance improvements of 52 percent

00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:29,369
year-over-year amazing but that ended

00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:31,530
about 15 years ago then we went into a

00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:34,220
phase of multi-core multi-threaded

00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:38,640
platform systems along the lines of

00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:42,240
Amdahl's law and now in this recent

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:46,380
phase since I last spoke in fact we see

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:48,299
a era of slower scaling in technology

00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:50,939
trends I think this is appropriately

00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:56,450
read this is a challenging time for us

00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:59,670
in terms of technology trends now on to

00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:02,219
growth trends so the last time I spoke

00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:04,950
at the summit two years ago I mentioned

00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:09,270
three applications where we had over 1

00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:13,280
billion users that is Gmail YouTube and

00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:16,760
search and we've had an exciting right

00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:19,930
to google now we can add at least four

00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:25,490
more applications to that list that is

00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:28,010
Android Maps chrome and place so seven

00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:32,540
applications phenomenally growing demand

00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:35,420
not more not only is our demand growing

00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:39,700
significantly the shape of our demand is

00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:42,040
changing and just to double-click on one

00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:45,550
technology area and that is our own

00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:49,310
Google's web starts this chart shows the

00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:51,590
evolution of features in our web search

00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:54,950
at Google and although the chart is ends

00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:57,440
in 2013 I think some of you may be

00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:59,900
familiar with the fact that we're

00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:03,560
continuing to invest in having a more

00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:05,780
intuitive experience for our users for

00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:10,370
users of web search and that's an

00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:13,310
investment along the lines of image

00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:16,730
search speech recognition video search

00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:21,650
and we've declared ourselves to be an AI

00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:25,070
first company so with technology

00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:28,690
transload on growing demand and changing

00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:31,760
demand we have a pretty challenging

00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:34,190
situation we have what we call a supply

00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:37,040
demand gap which means the slip supply

00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:40,220
on the technology side is not keeping up

00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,829
with this phenomenal demand growth that

00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:44,750
we have and that makes it hard for us to

00:03:42,829 --> 00:03:47,840
balance that equation that we call

00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:49,549
performance per TCO dollar so

00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,549
performance per total cost of ownership

00:03:49,549 --> 00:03:55,430
this problem is not unique to Google

00:03:52,549 --> 00:03:57,380
this is an industry-wide problem so how

00:03:55,430 --> 00:04:01,160
do we go about addressing this challenge

00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:06,019
and for us one of the ways that we do

00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:07,670
that is to rely on open ecosystems so

00:04:06,019 --> 00:04:09,769
we've been very busy in the space of

00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:13,280
open ecosystems in the last couple of

00:04:09,769 --> 00:04:15,350
years we've collaborated with Rackspace

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,039
IBM and through the open power

00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:21,400
foundation developed our next-generation

00:04:18,039 --> 00:04:24,930
open power system that has called this

00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:27,000
we release the hardware design for the

00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:30,780
daya's platform through the Open Compute

00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,090
Project we've also done other project

00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:36,000
activities in the open ecosystem space

00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:36,860
so tensorflow has been enabled on the

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,699
power8

00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:45,750
platform and I feel for us the fact that

00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:47,789
and an aspect of the open power

00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:50,759
foundation became so significant that

00:04:47,789 --> 00:04:55,979
have formed foundation of its own which

00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:59,070
is open copy is a sign of the growth of

00:04:55,979 --> 00:05:03,419
the open power foundation and continuing

00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:07,949
the success of that platform so now

00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:10,710
having described our work and open

00:05:07,949 --> 00:05:13,080
ecosystems I'm going to talk about three

00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:16,229
technology areas in which open power

00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:21,110
systems can Excel and can help us with

00:05:16,229 --> 00:05:23,849
the challenge of technology trends so

00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:27,500
earlier this year my colleagues

00:05:23,849 --> 00:05:30,300
presented a paper at HPC a which is a

00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:34,229
high-performance computer architecture

00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:37,650
symposium and the focus of that paper

00:05:34,229 --> 00:05:41,190
was Google's web search Google's web

00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:43,710
searches are our IP are a super-secret

00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:46,409
intellectual property so not much known

00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:48,720
as a is known about how our work load

00:05:46,409 --> 00:05:53,310
behaves on general computer

00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:55,470
architectures when we did this study we

00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:59,280
gained some pretty key insights and the

00:05:55,470 --> 00:06:01,620
first insight was that is that standard

00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,919
industry benchmarks like spec in trade

00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:07,830
don't adequately affect the behavior of

00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:10,770
Google's web search on processors and

00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:13,259
then with regard to technology insights

00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:17,099
on the first chart on the left you can

00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:21,330
see a plot of queries per second which

00:06:17,099 --> 00:06:24,659
is a key web search metric against core

00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:26,610
count and we found that performance

00:06:24,659 --> 00:06:29,849
queries per second scale linearly with

00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:31,949
core count and then on the right we

00:06:29,849 --> 00:06:35,760
looked at platforms with different

00:06:31,949 --> 00:06:37,280
thread count per core on the left-hand

00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:40,360
side actually is

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:43,520
an Intel platform on the right is an IBM

00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:45,170
platform and we found that when you

00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,710
write size the architecture in

00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:51,620
particular having the properly sized l2

00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:54,169
cache their performance of web search

00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:57,080
scales really nicely with thread count

00:06:54,169 --> 00:07:00,919
so for web search which consumes a

00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:04,310
significant amount of compute resources

00:07:00,919 --> 00:07:09,410
at Google more threads and more cores is

00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:10,550
a good thing in the second chart we

00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:13,220
talked about a different type of

00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:15,160
workload so we've been developing our

00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:17,960
own machine learning hardware

00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:20,660
accelerator we call this a tensor

00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:24,320
processing unit in the picture on the

00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:26,450
Left we show a standard configuration so

00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:28,880
this is a PCIe attached tensor

00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:31,430
processing unit accelerator and although

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:34,630
we have this accelerator we still need

00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:39,889
general-purpose hosts compute to provide

00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:42,669
supporting tasks tasks to support and

00:07:39,889 --> 00:07:46,400
make this accelerator successful in the

00:07:42,669 --> 00:07:50,180
ecosystem and what we found for this use

00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:52,610
case there's in this particular example

00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:54,650
we looked at our work effort that is

00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:58,090
called a parameter server and the role

00:07:54,650 --> 00:08:00,590
of the parameter server is too many

00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:03,740
gradients for machine learning models

00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:06,860
and what we found was that when you

00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:08,539
dedicated the host CPU in the chart on

00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:11,090
the right you can see that you can

00:08:08,539 --> 00:08:14,660
accomplish some pretty good performance

00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:17,479
latency when we introduced other tasks

00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:20,720
to that same processing processing unit

00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:23,150
the host processor the latency

00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:27,020
performance of this particular type of

00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:29,690
model was significantly impacted and so

00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:33,050
what that means is you've built this

00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:35,180
beautiful accelerator you invested all

00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:37,880
of this effort time and resources to

00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:39,950
make that an amazing hardware platform

00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:44,510
but if the host processor can't keep up

00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:46,520
with that as my colleague said did you

00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:49,100
really have an accelerator did you

00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,980
really accelerate the fleet and what we

00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:53,699
found

00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:55,649
that the first limiting factor was diem

00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:58,949
bandwidth so there was contention on the

00:08:55,649 --> 00:09:01,139
dram interface so in this case more

00:08:58,949 --> 00:09:06,899
memory bandwidth is what we need in a

00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:10,079
platform and in this third example that

00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:12,120
I want to talk about today we have DRM

00:09:10,079 --> 00:09:14,339
technology and we have non technology

00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:17,399
and in between we describe the

00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:21,240
opportunity for what we call far memory

00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:25,940
so the characteristics of DRM are super

00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:28,290
low latency high bandwidth and and

00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:30,899
compare that Anand which has

00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:34,019
significantly higher latency thousand

00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:36,029
decks much lower bandwidth but on the

00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:38,910
other hand NAND is much cheaper than

00:09:36,029 --> 00:09:41,970
DRAM so we feel that there is a pretty

00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:45,899
big gap between nand and demand an

00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:48,180
opportunity to make our platforms much

00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:50,329
more performant and impactful and the

00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:52,589
opportunity lies in finding a memory

00:09:50,329 --> 00:09:55,199
technology that sits in between these

00:09:52,589 --> 00:09:57,750
two and we want to have a technology

00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:59,730
solution that platform and vendor

00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:05,430
agnostic meaning that multiple vendors

00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:09,389
can have nvm technology set on memory

00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:13,500
bus our i/o high i/o interface and today

00:10:09,389 --> 00:10:16,620
the closest vendor agnostic products

00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:20,579
that exist on the market are samsung's g

00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:24,269
SSD and intel's obtain these are PCIe

00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:26,760
gen3 attached devices and so there

00:10:24,269 --> 00:10:29,130
although they're pretty good and have

00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:31,829
something like 10 micro second latency

00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:34,260
average there's still significant room a

00:10:31,829 --> 00:10:39,149
significant gap to get to where a dram

00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:41,790
is so we feel that open copy presents an

00:10:39,149 --> 00:10:44,430
amazing opportunity for nvm attach and

00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:47,610
to have a technologies at lower costs

00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:53,040
and DM but still delivers much other

00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:57,630
performance characteristics and so with

00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:59,730
that I'll move on to talk about what we

00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:04,470
are doing with open powerpuffs

00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:06,299
Google so when we spoke at the summit

00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:08,730
two years ago we talked about the fact

00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:11,249
that we were committed to developing a

00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:14,040
paranoid system platform we named our

00:11:11,249 --> 00:11:17,489
project Zaius and just a quick recap on

00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:23,429
mods aliases so Zaius is a dual socket

00:11:17,489 --> 00:11:26,850
L'Orange CPU platform amazing memory

00:11:23,429 --> 00:11:30,449
bandwidth so eight ddr4 tiles per

00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:33,569
processor amazing i/o bandwidth and what

00:11:30,449 --> 00:11:36,389
we appreciate is industry-leading PCI

00:11:33,569 --> 00:11:39,839
agent for the forest processor to market

00:11:36,389 --> 00:11:43,290
with PCI a Gen 4 along with that is the

00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:46,139
open copy interface 16 lanes that are 32

00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:49,679
lanes 25 gigabits per second each 16

00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:53,459
lanes per processor this platform is 48

00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:58,019
volts open rack compatible and built on

00:11:53,459 --> 00:12:00,749
open power boot farmer so open software

00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:03,509
and we leverage open BNC to do the

00:12:00,749 --> 00:12:05,579
system software management and as human

00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:08,309
generally err we feel that open power

00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:11,609
foundation is pretty unique and enabling

00:12:08,309 --> 00:12:14,039
both open hardware and the open software

00:12:11,609 --> 00:12:21,029
that you need to make this platform work

00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:23,519
for you and so if you so let me get cut

00:12:21,029 --> 00:12:27,029
to the chase and talk about the status

00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:28,649
of Zayas at Google so we're pretty

00:12:27,029 --> 00:12:31,739
excited at the progress that we have

00:12:28,649 --> 00:12:34,279
made with this platform we've deployed

00:12:31,739 --> 00:12:36,480
this in Google's data center and this

00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:38,489
background photo is actually a

00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:42,660
photograph of machines in the data

00:12:38,489 --> 00:12:46,019
center that one of my friends a hardware

00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:50,699
ops technician took a photograph of so

00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:55,109
we're at the phase for the this Zayas

00:12:50,699 --> 00:12:57,239
platform where we're ready to scale up

00:12:55,109 --> 00:13:00,179
the number of applications and we're

00:12:57,239 --> 00:13:03,449
ready to scale up the machine count so

00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:07,109
where that means and as to code my VP

00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:12,289
we're declaring this Zayas platform to

00:13:07,109 --> 00:13:12,289
be Google strong and so

00:13:14,139 --> 00:13:21,439
and so we've talked about how you can

00:13:18,709 --> 00:13:23,689
build this platform design from ground

00:13:21,439 --> 00:13:29,239
up using open hardware and open software

00:13:23,689 --> 00:13:31,819
if if you want to get a jump start do

00:13:29,239 --> 00:13:33,799
join the Rackspace Tech Talk I wanna

00:13:31,819 --> 00:13:36,079
call today where they'll talk about how

00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:38,719
they've qualified different technologies

00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:43,489
like from an accelerator from nanotech

00:13:38,719 --> 00:13:45,769
NVIDIA GPU mullennixes Nick interface

00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:48,709
and many other technologies so you can

00:13:45,769 --> 00:13:54,829
get going quickly on the Zayas platform

00:13:48,709 --> 00:13:58,249
or and so with that I invite you to join

00:13:54,829 --> 00:14:02,209
us the paradigm open Power Systems

00:13:58,249 --> 00:14:06,789
platform is here join us in innovating

00:14:02,209 --> 00:14:06,789
