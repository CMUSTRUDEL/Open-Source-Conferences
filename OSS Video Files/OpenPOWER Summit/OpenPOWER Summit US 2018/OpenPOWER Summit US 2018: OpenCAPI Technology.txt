	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:19,830
all right so I see that part of my job

00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:22,140
is going to be I'll do my best

00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:24,029
right I spend more time trying to take

00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,500
one of my other pitches and trying to

00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:27,660
narrow down the scope then it did

00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,510
building it up so I you know we'll give

00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:32,520
it a shot here but okay so I'm gonna go

00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:34,140
through I have about 20 charts so I

00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,610
should be okay but let's just let's go

00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,230
through these by the way this is a

00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:39,719
typical tile that we use for the open

00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:41,730
copy you know talks the bottom row are

00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:44,219
by the way are the what we call

00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:46,410
strategic members of the consortium so

00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:48,719
it's it's kind of interesting but the

00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:50,910
first five on the left-hand side started

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,610
this ball rolling so it was AMD Google

00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:55,320
IBM Mellanox a micron started getting

00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:56,820
this whole concept of getting the soap

00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,129
and Kathy thing on its own feet out in

00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:01,109
the industry of course IBM was you know

00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:03,149
this is ibm's base technology but

00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:06,180
everybody saw a lot of promise in this

00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:08,729
and then nvidia Western Digital Xilinx

00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,920
had jumped on the train shortly after

00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:12,299
but we're only through the consortium by

00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,820
the way is only a little bit of year old

00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:18,950
but let's let's get into the talk itself

00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:18,950
so what these are the topics I wanted

00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:44,320
typical quote unquote

00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:45,610
education package that we do with people

00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,940
the first time you meet them takes about

00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:52,830
an hour and a half walking through this

00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:52,830
so like I said dancing

00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:08,229
demonstrations I actually have a few

00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:10,239
demonstration slides on that is the home

00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:11,950
and you know one of the questions that I

00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,450
do get asked in this will come up a

00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:15,400
little bit later but it's like whoa

00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:16,510
that's interesting why is there an open

00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,820
Cathy consortium

00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:20,830
why isn't it's just a thing the part of

00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:23,800
open power foundation or whatever but

00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:25,420
I'll touch on that now something I did

00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:27,160
here because I knew I only had 30

00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:29,470
minutes I decided to put a list of

00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:52,120
takeaways and what I wanted to do was

00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:54,299
make sure that but this is a high

00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,299
performance

00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:02,090
I just know Beauty this thing this is

00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:05,209
the take away

00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:07,940
there's no OS no firmware overhead

00:03:05,209 --> 00:03:09,709
anything involved with open path goodbye

00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:12,110
passage back this is one of the reasons

00:03:09,709 --> 00:03:13,069
why our latency so low moving out a

00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:16,099
little later

00:03:13,069 --> 00:03:19,280
and of course it's got high bandwidth by

00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:21,950
the way it's not a power thing this can

00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,780
work with our you can work with the x86

00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:26,360
you can work with power to work with

00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:28,400
anything so this is probably the biggest

00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:30,560
reason why we're not a part of the old

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,180
photographer vision we've had

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,940
discussions and continue to have

00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:43,400
discussions with the other guys but this

00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:46,549
is something that's not powered let's

00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:50,090
see I call this very low accelerator

00:03:46,549 --> 00:03:54,349
design overhead I'll give an example a

00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:58,610
little bit later on but we talked about

00:03:54,349 --> 00:04:01,900
how much logic design has to go on to

00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:01,900
the accelerator itself

00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:12,050
we actually did some work on it it was

00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:14,420
less than 5% guys that going to so it

00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:18,980
was a small overhead that goes on these

00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:20,989
accelerators programming ezel talked a

00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:23,540
little bit about that little bit later

00:04:20,989 --> 00:04:25,220
it's ideal for accelerated cocoon and

00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:27,380
storage class memory storage class

00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:30,820
memory keep your eyes in this space this

00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:32,990
is going to make data centers change

00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:34,550
you're gonna see a lot that's gonna go

00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:39,320
on that's why it's been so much focused

00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:42,260
on this place on that space memory so

00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:44,990
this is ideal for that because it is

00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:47,150
agnostic because like I said but it'll

00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:48,890
also support ongoing generations of this

00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:52,040
new memory technologies which is kind of

00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:53,720
using this thing built then it also

00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:55,820
supports the heterogeneous environments

00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:57,830
so now this is storage class memory it

00:04:55,820 --> 00:05:00,560
does all your accelerators and all these

00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:03,680
different form factors GPUs a6 whatever

00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,540
you got going on there right so in that

00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,950
regard it does you know networking etc

00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:09,470
and I'll talk a little more about that

00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:11,000
it is optimized within a single system

00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:12,800
and I'll show a little bit pitcher

00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,580
faculty might be a next pitcher or it's

00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,470
used but we took all that engineering

00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:20,690
learning in terms of latency reduction

00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:22,190
in bandwidth etc so we wanted to

00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:24,830
optimize performance with an assistant

00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:26,570
note ok there's some that want to

00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:29,900
optimize themselves across the full

00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:32,450
dataset definitely making some

00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:34,220
trade-offs we did not want to make that

00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:35,690
trade-off we wanted to go after the

00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:37,669
performance where we find native being

00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:41,260
stuck within the box itself more than us

00:05:37,669 --> 00:05:41,260
so it is optimized for that

00:05:46,900 --> 00:06:08,390
by the way like I said this is not a

00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,530
specification in flight this is

00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:10,550
something exists today and they're

00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:13,520
building part they're building stuff

00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:15,740
today right that's important to know so

00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,780
those that I think if I had a net out

00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:19,340
where the key takeaways and you're gonna

00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:20,390
hear some of these themes over and over

00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:21,980
there's I go through this thing that's

00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:27,050
why I felt it's just important just us

00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:29,090
put it out there all right okay

00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:34,940
let's talk about this industry chart now

00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:36,680
you know as long as I think you know the

00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:40,190
growth for computational needs has never

00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:48,830
slowed down well you know these emerging

00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:51,110
were close analytics this is driving a

00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:53,090
ton of computational information that or

00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:55,840
the capability that that needs to exist

00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:55,840
but but

00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:26,390
that's kind of existing but you know the

00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:29,540
huge benefit we used to have years ago

00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:31,340
by remapping a prior silicon chip into a

00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,850
new technology it's not there anymore

00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:36,790
guys

00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:36,790
other than density so this is a big deal

00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:41,900
but I need more I need more so how are

00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:44,180
we going to satisfy that well that's

00:07:41,900 --> 00:08:07,000
what's driving this whole thing of his

00:07:44,180 --> 00:08:07,000
hardware acceleration so this is the

00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:11,780
rolling out this way the hyper scale

00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:13,550
guys and the data centers the

00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:16,190
high-performance guys and you hired

00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:22,250
network bandwidth deep learning an HPC

00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:24,230
going on and as I mentioned memory

00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:26,960
technology there's star for bandwidth

00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:29,450
and low latency especially if you have

00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,940
these huge gobs of memory storage class

00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:34,070
memory right next to a processor it's

00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:35,690
gonna want it's gonna want this latency

00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:39,530
low right and that's that's that's

00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:41,690
critical so you know these accelerators

00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:43,460
these workloads that are driving these

00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:45,920
accelerators these accelerators

00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:47,450
essentially now driving what do we need

00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,640
because if you're gonna use accelerators

00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:58,850
you're gonna have to get stuff in and

00:08:49,640 --> 00:09:00,140
stuff out fast and these accelerators

00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:02,960
essentially defining the characteristics

00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:04,130
of what that bus needs to look like so

00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,930
now we're getting to the point that I

00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:08,000
made a little bit earlier why did it

00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:10,310
open cab to come about why is it here

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,740
these are the driving factors

00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:14,930
they have to be over that many custody

00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:16,610
all right so you have this drawing the

00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:21,080
man for network performance and network

00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:22,190
baccala we call it you got coherence if

00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:24,980
you're gonna put all this God's

00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:27,020
especially of memory and these

00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:28,610
accelerators everybody didn't want start

00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:30,950
shooting em because he celery is coming

00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:32,750
up hold back the mountain middle to so

00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:33,950
the host and he's accelerated down when

00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:36,200
it's our package so they start sharing

00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:38,240
their memory so coherence use deep into

00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:40,430
the space here and like I said we got

00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,200
the the the storage class memory stuff

00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:52,130
and by the way one thing that we've

00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:54,440
learned and we're yet and I kind of had

00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:56,210
this gut but now I believe it there's no

00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:58,370
more form factors benefit and

00:09:56,210 --> 00:10:00,050
everybody's pertly sir this stuff is

00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:02,000
going to constantly evolve we're gonna

00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:04,040
see FPGA isn't going to satisfy a

00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,760
requirement GPUs to satisfy certain

00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,020
requirements

00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:08,180
ace it's going to satisfy certain

00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:09,890
quirements not one's gonna rise above a

00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:12,110
ball and say this is the answer this is

00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:14,060
whatever is going to use it's all about

00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:16,250
choice because depending where you want

00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:19,150
development cycles what you're doing any

00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:21,589
one of those things are gonna come out

00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:23,530
so you need a bus once again it's gonna

00:10:21,589 --> 00:10:25,310
be flexible to take these kind of things

00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:28,490
almost sounds too good to be true

00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:29,750
right but all this stuff is relevant to

00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:32,140
these modern data centers what I'm

00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,140
talking about

00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
okay

00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:47,180
especially the cloud deployment

00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,590
hyperscale guys that's why they're

00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:50,870
looking very close at this thing and in

00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:52,760
fact some guys took the next step by the

00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:55,550
way I don't know if you guys were in hmm

00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:57,800
if you were in the talk with the keynote

00:10:55,550 --> 00:11:00,080
speakers this morning yeah so you saw

00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:02,690
what Google announced today Google Mouse

00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:04,700
right say deploy Zaius and Zaius empower

00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:35,570
nine that has that open carry technology

00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:37,700
capability okay so where do we so

00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:41,090
anything from accelerators you know

00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:44,540
coherence network controllers storage

00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:46,910
class memory stuff right it's network

00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:50,000
controllers it's got all of this but the

00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:51,890
interesting thing is we you know if we

00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,440
did it all on this peripheral there all

00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:55,870
of this stuff right and we start talking

00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:58,250
about well how about the standard eval

00:11:55,870 --> 00:12:01,880
now one thing you have to understand is

00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:04,730
iBM has had decades of engineering

00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:08,390
effort going into attaching DRAM and

00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:10,700
microprocessors so we took this spec and

00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:14,200
we took a one step further we took all

00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:14,200
the learning that we've done

00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:25,480
I keep up a spec called and the latency

00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:30,010
on this thing is incredible

00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:31,150
I mean actually if you guys can see

00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:34,900
we're here they'd be buying it too big

00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:36,700
but this 3.1 all those decades of

00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:39,010
learning and took the latency even a

00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:41,380
little bit further and down to reduce it

00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:43,990
so now you can take your classic DRAM

00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:47,380
memory and we have this bus call 3.1

00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:49,990
it'll do that too so the intent here was

00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:53,050
we wanted to insert a buffer chip a

00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:56,050
memory buffer check okay it's not a

00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:57,820
power 9 our next our next processor is

00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:59,440
gonna have it it's called this could

00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:01,750
fall onto powerdyne we'll have this

00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:04,800
buffer chip capability well have that

00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:07,840
3.1 speck on that on that processor and

00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:09,490
we we added this because first off gives

00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:11,170
you capability by putting a buffer there

00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:13,480
you could put more dims behind that

00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:15,970
buffer so now you have more D Ram right

00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:17,350
by the provided processor but the beauty

00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:20,080
of this thing is the added latency

00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:25,960
because of that buffer to your your a

00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:26,830
single-digit nanoseconds tiny so you

00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,450
need to see it

00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:30,190
so that's that's the engineering that

00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:31,480
went behind this 3.1 spec and that's

00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:34,960
what all the learning was behind it to

00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:38,170
do that so that's that's round-trip by

00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:40,300
the way okay so now what's neat about

00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:42,810
this is and we took the step we said you

00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,810
going that way

00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:58,519
now I will tell you that these are not

00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:00,529
the final specs

00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:02,060
those specs that are posted on our

00:14:00,529 --> 00:14:05,029
website we're the ones that I've been

00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:08,589
contributed to the consortium but it

00:14:05,029 --> 00:14:08,589
gives you certainly a very good flavor

00:14:08,769 --> 00:14:13,040
so you know feel free you know go ahead

00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:14,750
down and take a look at those things

00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,730
right now if you want the latest and

00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:28,519
greatest and there have been changes to

00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:31,700
the specs obviously but all that works

00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:33,380
going on in the consortium itself so

00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:35,000
that's so that's where we use it it's

00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:36,680
virtually when we said heterogeneous we

00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:47,390
meant it you could use it just about

00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:49,940
everywhere one case versus the other all

00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:53,029
right let's talk about some of the key

00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:56,959
attributes so as I mentioned a bit

00:14:53,029 --> 00:14:59,390
earlier this is an agnostic bus any

00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:01,130
architecture could pick it up right it

00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:01,730
is optimized for the high bandwidth and

00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:03,110
low latency

00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:05,600
there's been a lot of engineering behind

00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:08,079
it to make that happen this is important

00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,079
it has

00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:42,130
- that's as proprietary bus that exists

00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:44,470
between IBM think of the SOPA so but but

00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:49,870
it has it usually that that 25 gig link

00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:51,010
that's 25 dignify right coherency I

00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:53,440
talked a little bit about that as

00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:55,060
coherency starts to play a more of a

00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:58,540
role as you attached these accelerators

00:15:55,060 --> 00:16:00,850
live at law the host accelerator to the

00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:03,730
devices devices - host that's gotta be

00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:06,970
becoming more interesting virtual

00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:08,920
addressing is used in open Kathy so we

00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:11,260
use virtual addressing it's got very low

00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:13,450
head this is what enables to keep all

00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:16,300
that code crap out of it

00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:22,720
right it doesn't slow us down so we

00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:24,040
avoid all that nonsense so virtual

00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,450
address he plays a big role here and I

00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:28,060
have a separate chart under some of the

00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:30,340
added advantages of virtual addressing

00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:33,880
and I mentioned a little bit early it's

00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:36,370
a wide use of use cases here there's the

00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:39,520
CPU coherency to the device itself the

00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:41,140
home agent memory submerging is it's

00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:43,060
architected for both and I mentioned

00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:45,370
this classic memory and it's in this

00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:46,540
emerging storage class memory so of

00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:48,910
course it does both that's the

00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:51,850
difference between that 3.1 at 3.2

00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:54,690
and as I mentioned earlier also it has

00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:54,690
its minimal design

00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:11,130
whatever but if whatever law just got to

00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:12,059
go in at FPGA is its so you know you're

00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:15,540
not gonna even know it's there

00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:17,720
maybe 5% or less so so there's that so

00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:19,860
that's another big advantage right

00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:21,240
trying to make the guys who designed

00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:22,079
accelerators we're trying to make it

00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,459
easy for you guys

00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,780
we're trying to make the coding easy

00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:26,160
ever try and make the designs and see

00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:29,580
all right it's hard that was

00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,750
what's that yeah well capture stab well

00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:33,179
that's that's the highway to get you

00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:36,170
there no doubt but but but but just the

00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:36,170
amount of work I'm sorry go ahead

00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:52,710
good question there's I will say that

00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:55,470
there's work underway work there's

00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:59,760
certainly discussions underway it's too

00:17:55,470 --> 00:18:01,770
early to say at this point but I was

00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:05,690
gonna ask what can be represented

00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:05,690
there's a gentleman in our cut oh

00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:13,850
absolutely

00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:13,850
so you you know you know shopping

00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:40,900
I'm gonna show you a chart a little bit

00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:45,390
later in his deck you're gonna see wow

00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:45,390
we are not only there were beyond there

00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:49,620
no no

00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:31,419
yeah agree agree that's why I cap that's

00:19:30,729 --> 00:19:33,759
why I'm power8

00:19:31,419 --> 00:19:39,629
be warned how our knives different story

00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:42,119
so yeah but but hanging it with me see

00:19:39,629 --> 00:19:44,440
yikes okay we run out of time here guys

00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:45,700
okay I gotta have this to pick up the

00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,739
pace here all right

00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:49,899
iBM has always had this strong family of

00:19:47,739 --> 00:19:56,709
Io right so we now we were leading the

00:19:49,899 --> 00:19:59,049
pack with Gen four PCI Gen 4 NV link 2

00:19:56,709 --> 00:20:01,629
we have that and then of course the open

00:19:59,049 --> 00:20:04,059
copy but what we did was you know this

00:20:01,629 --> 00:20:06,549
is kind of depicting the dyes capability

00:20:04,059 --> 00:20:08,649
in power 9 right we got 48 lanes for PC

00:20:06,549 --> 00:20:10,869
Gen 4 and there's you know you could

00:20:08,649 --> 00:20:13,269
bounce between gen 3 Gen 4 and then we

00:20:10,869 --> 00:20:14,709
have 48 late forty eight lanes dedicated

00:20:13,269 --> 00:20:16,719
for that twenty five gigabit linked out

00:20:14,709 --> 00:20:20,229
to tell you about that either could be

00:20:16,719 --> 00:20:23,289
envy Nvidia to link or envy link or the

00:20:20,229 --> 00:20:25,209
open copy link right so let me keep

00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:26,919
going here so now I'm gonna and I

00:20:25,209 --> 00:20:30,309
apologize again it's only 225 after a

00:20:26,919 --> 00:20:32,219
while so on virtual addressing we

00:20:30,309 --> 00:20:34,179
operate in a virtual address space

00:20:32,219 --> 00:20:36,429
eliminates like I said the software

00:20:34,179 --> 00:20:39,729
overhead right to get the the latency

00:20:36,429 --> 00:20:41,499
down to the lowest without it runs

00:20:39,729 --> 00:20:43,389
without the kernel interference

00:20:41,499 --> 00:20:45,429
simplifies the programming which is a

00:20:43,389 --> 00:20:47,529
nice thing and of course it improves

00:20:45,429 --> 00:20:50,109
overall celery our performance all the

00:20:47,529 --> 00:20:56,859
virtual you know address translation

00:20:50,109 --> 00:21:00,070
virtual physical that's done on the

00:20:56,859 --> 00:21:02,639
processor side reduces that that that

00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:04,839
design complexity and on the accelerator

00:21:02,639 --> 00:21:07,239
ensures more than interoperability

00:21:04,839 --> 00:21:08,950
between the devices and secured I mean

00:21:07,239 --> 00:21:11,739
Security's been a big buzzword lately in

00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:13,179
industry added bene of having the

00:21:11,739 --> 00:21:15,369
virtual addressing is nobody can get

00:21:13,179 --> 00:21:18,279
direct access to the from your from your

00:21:15,369 --> 00:21:20,129
attached devices into your hosts so that

00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:23,200
that kind of shields any kind of

00:21:20,129 --> 00:21:24,309
concerns there so I'm going to just kind

00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,169
of race through this here a little bit

00:21:24,309 --> 00:21:28,959
so here's some of the paradigms that

00:21:26,169 --> 00:21:30,940
that or some of the acceleration things

00:21:28,959 --> 00:21:33,040
that you can come up with right so we

00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:35,290
have the basic you know

00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:37,720
Loic celebrators you have egress and

00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:40,270
ingress of information out of the

00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:41,920
accelerators operate on that data real

00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:43,140
time you know it's really interesting a

00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:45,400
lot of the government stuff especially

00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:46,990
looking for terrorist activity those

00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,280
kinds of things in the internet so these

00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:49,960
things play very well in that space

00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:51,280
right I know a lot of countries do like

00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:53,500
pornography checks and things like this

00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,330
so egress ingress is something like that

00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:57,280
there's a there's a approach called

00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:58,570
needle in a haystack engine or you just

00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,700
got to go out and find something this

00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:03,220
huge data place you've got stuff they

00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:05,200
can do both way obviously right so you

00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:06,700
know the the the whole architecture of

00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,470
the open capi does well in this space

00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,400
and the let's talk about the memory I'm

00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:10,990
going to fetch a little bit about the

00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,580
memory piece of this thing now you've

00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:15,220
got a common interface for the memory

00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:17,050
between non memory memory devices right

00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:19,210
so as I mentioned you know the cap III

00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:21,490
okay be used systems out anywhere

00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:23,530
extreme bandwidth for DVR that I

00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:25,060
mentioned you could have right into the

00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:27,610
memory interface you know this is for

00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:29,950
the buffer chip capability it's agnostic

00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:31,810
so as this emerging memory technology

00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:33,430
continues to emerge the new technologies

00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:36,580
coming out this bus would be able to

00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:39,970
handle it because it is agnostic and you

00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:42,670
know it separates the separates the the

00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:51,820
buffer from the raw host okay optimize

00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:53,590
your cost performance approach now where

00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:55,360
you could have some nearby your classic

00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:57,220
memory DDR but then you get a storage

00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,270
class memory on that there's a lot of

00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:59,530
interest to some of the large data

00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:04,090
center guy who's been looking at this

00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:06,100
too okay performance I had two slides of

00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:08,490
performance so that was like we saw the

00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:10,690
performance very first ones performance

00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:11,530
you know the pieces latency part it

00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:14,980
should be interesting that you're

00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:17,080
looking at so we did we did a cap yet

00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:20,440
you had Kathy one so that's tied to

00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:24,130
power aids and then Kathy to an open

00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:26,680
case on power 9 alright and that's the

00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:28,750
specific silence FPGA that we use these

00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:30,490
are the actual bandwidth that we

00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:35,970
measured so empower eight when we

00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:41,110
introduced this on and on that Kathy one

00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:43,060
right so obviously interface but then we

00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:45,190
took it on to Gen 4 interface we

00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:47,260
introduced it on power 9 of course has

00:23:45,190 --> 00:24:00,820
gotten better but then when we ran this

00:23:47,260 --> 00:24:04,060
on power 9 with the open okay now that's

00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:06,340
performance now if you look at latency

00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:08,110
right I know this is a busy chart

00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:10,450
I tried we try it now this is stuff that

00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:12,820
we thin our lab we this is dance or a

00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:14,680
legal review like 10 times because we're

00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:16,840
showing Intel ready here now right so

00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:18,100
they scrutinize the heck out of us but

00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,780
we had to stand tall and make sure that

00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:21,550
this stuff is real but I want you to

00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:23,590
focus on this piece here cuz this you

00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:52,180
know all these conditions but you start

00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:54,210
off with power 9 you've got open but

00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:58,540
that's but that's the legacy that we got

00:24:54,210 --> 00:25:01,600
370 now seconds that range so when you

00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:04,270
ask the question is it better yeah we

00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,920
got past that point now and this chart

00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:08,410
is the first time we've shown this chart

00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:10,990
in the industry today we've been holding

00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:12,730
this off to the side so Brad I think

00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:14,590
Brad McCready is gonna show it if he

00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:17,230
hasn't shown it already today I'm

00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:18,880
showing it today and this will be

00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:20,860
showing Open Compute tomorrow

00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,420
so in fact I gotta leave tomorrow

00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:25,380
morning for open computer but it's the

00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:28,300
first time we're showing this chart guys

00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:29,710
yes it is very specific when you get the

00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:33,850
slides you could you could check out the

00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:35,350
mother the exact system etc ok so that I

00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:37,060
want to make that clear this yeah we've

00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:39,880
done the nut benchmarking now that we're

00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:42,460
pretty pretty bullish about this thing

00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:55,030
it's a simple test this is simple test

00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:58,679
around so nothing too complicated but

00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:58,679
just to create the traffic

00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:22,080
yeah yeah the difference carryover since

00:26:18,299 --> 00:26:23,909
we're asking okay so um here's two

00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,529
examples some of the the cars that we

00:26:23,909 --> 00:26:27,960
have there that are open Cappy and able

00:26:25,529 --> 00:26:29,730
you got the Mellanox oops they just ran

00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:36,269
in its own that's strange

00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:36,690
okay so okay hmm typical eye diagram to

00:26:36,269 --> 00:26:42,809
bottom

00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:44,549
that's our 25 figure 25 and we've done

00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:50,820
so many these measurements but these

00:26:44,549 --> 00:26:52,889
eyes are very clean at 25 and so what we

00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:55,499
did was we ran I only put two demos here

00:26:52,889 --> 00:26:57,600
but what I wanted to show was that that

00:26:55,499 --> 00:26:59,809
we this is Harvard exists right we

00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:03,259
wanted to make sure that was clear that

00:26:59,809 --> 00:27:03,259
what's going on

00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:15,730
huh there you go nice range so the

00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:24,640
bottom right-hand side you can see on

00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:27,190
the gigabytes per second so we're very

00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:30,450
happy with this we ran this I only have

00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:30,450
two slides in here there's things like

00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:38,380
at the at the table I show a number of

00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:42,370
demos of over different systems there we

00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:45,790
have a me hawk system from from West Ron

00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:48,370
we have a LAN yang system from the Ben

00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:51,040
tech we have the barreleye g2 system we

00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:53,590
have Google's a system we have IBM's new

00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:55,120
wheel system we ran all these demos on

00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:56,890
these systems and you can see that our

00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,990
booth I only took two year because the

00:27:56,890 --> 00:28:01,120
thing was just so large and this thing

00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:02,559
is I got mine on its own okay so what I

00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:07,210
want to do is it was hard to see the

00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:08,679
diagrams by trying to draw the picture

00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:11,169
to show this wasn't something that we

00:28:08,679 --> 00:28:12,790
made up and I think over here - that's

00:28:11,169 --> 00:28:15,090
that that's the Alpha data card there in

00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:19,510
the system when we did the demo there oh

00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:22,059
there we go now it's okay so keep going

00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:23,049
here let me talk a little bit about the

00:28:22,059 --> 00:28:25,120
consortium here

00:28:23,049 --> 00:28:27,880
yeah probably past the point now where

00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:32,740
it's 132 here's the consortium I just

00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:35,590
want to say let me start this thing

00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:36,820
today we have over 35 members we have

00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:37,690
like five more to queue a lot of

00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:40,350
universities are starting to get

00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:42,910
interesting now you still they just had

00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:46,740
pink from them they want to join we got

00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:48,880
one from University out in India we had

00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:51,160
yeah so you could look at the current

00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,960
members I'll get there in a second so

00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:54,880
we're well established we've got a

00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,500
functioning you know stick technical

00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,870
steering committee we've got you know

00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:00,790
our legal stuff's in place we got our

00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:02,260
marketing communications the work groups

00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:04,990
is where all the activity is we have a

00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:09,270
TL specification work group a deal

00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:09,270
specification work group bicycling

00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:22,500
so that's why we have our own you know

00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:25,380
signaling there and the mechanical

00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:27,330
compliance and enablement and you know

00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:28,470
it's a big deal and I'll tell you a

00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:29,640
little more about that a second as a

00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:31,500
chart that shows what we've got

00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:32,940
available today we create we're in

00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:35,250
approximately get the memory software

00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:36,720
accelerator work groups who are looking

00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:39,570
those get them ready

00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,590
I mentioned the open Cappy spec is on

00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:41,880
site it's the one that I've been

00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:43,500
contributing you could look at it today

00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:46,890
if you want to knock yourself out like

00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:49,080
130 pages of the Tal it's like it's less

00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:50,040
but but you know I encourage you still

00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:52,680
take a look at that thing

00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:55,050
design enablement this is what you get

00:29:52,680 --> 00:30:08,700
today this stuff exists today so if you

00:29:55,050 --> 00:30:10,470
want to go fill the accelerator card the

00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:11,760
one thing that's hanging out I think in

00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:13,800
fact I think the reference drivers are

00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:15,120
gonna become available shortly the

00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,620
reference card design we were hoping to

00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,000
get that out this quarter but that

00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:19,860
slipped into the next quarter I think

00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,540
it's going to be early second quarter so

00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:23,490
all this all this stuff exists today if

00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:25,530
you want to do an accelerator this is a

00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:27,720
different membership levels you know the

00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:33,840
Louis is 5k we wanted to get something

00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:36,000
in there that that just like PCA current

00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:43,380
members today I kind of depict a little

00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:44,730
bit this way here deployment then you

00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,780
get the research and now you get

00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:46,950
University is starting to get

00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:47,550
interesting they're starting to join

00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:49,650
over there

00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:53,660
and that's starting to build up so the

00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:53,660
message here is you know certainly right

00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:06,830
and and if you haven't stopped by the

00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:08,240
booth

00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:10,280
I'm hanging out there so you can talk

00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:12,920
over more about this all right I

00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:14,750
apologize it's already uh I know I try

00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:17,360
to cram in here it's 1:35 already passed

00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:25,640
by a limit here guys okay we'll take

00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:27,890
what anyone question two questions okay

00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:30,020
all right folks thanks and I'll be I'm

00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:31,820
around so I'll be here all day so stop

00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:33,320
by see me Jeff's by the way I'll

00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:34,910
introduce Jeff's new clean the back room

00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:36,830
was talk I was talking to answer

00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:39,170
questions our look earlier Jeff is one

00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:40,670
of the architects and IBM that actually

00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:42,410
contributed to the creation of the spec

00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:42,920
so if you really want to go down deep

00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:44,600
and dirty

00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:45,830
Jeff is certainly be able to answer just

00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,810
about any question that you have also

00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:51,590
and he's around he's hanging around the

00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:54,610
booth and the show - yeah alright thanks

00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:54,610
