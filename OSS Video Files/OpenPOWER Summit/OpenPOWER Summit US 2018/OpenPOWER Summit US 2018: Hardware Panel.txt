[Applause]

00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:09,389
[Music]

00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:11,550
but I believe we're gonna be doing our

00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:15,690
first panel discussions so I'd like to

00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:16,860
invite some of the members of open power

00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:18,780
up here to join me

00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:20,730
I'm Scott Schultz I am from Mellanox

00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:22,890
I've been with open power from from the

00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:24,810
beginning I wasn't in the closet with

00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:33,510
the rest of them but I but I was at the

00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:39,870
first board meeting so it we have a

00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:47,789
Renee sakakibara son from Hitachi Renee

00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:53,219
from a toss James from inter-gang from

00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:58,019
from Y strand Adi and and hi Renee

00:00:53,219 --> 00:01:04,949
hi let's see I think I will sit over

00:00:58,019 --> 00:01:08,009
there okay um so thanks for for joining

00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:10,530
us we've been making a lot of progress

00:01:08,009 --> 00:01:12,570
here I think on the hardware side and I

00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:16,439
really appreciate you guys joining us so

00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:18,930
I want to thank both or Renee and and

00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:23,070
sokka Baris on from Hitachi James from

00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:26,880
inspir Adi and and cong and because we

00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:29,460
all love hardware we we really only have

00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,619
about 20 minutes for this session so I'd

00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:33,509
like to to set the context of the

00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:35,460
discussion and around three general

00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:37,700
points right really what is the value of

00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:40,500
open power for you and your customers

00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:43,500
how was your solution fitting into the

00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:45,930
ecosystem and and vice versa and then

00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,540
you know what key features do do your

00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:50,939
solutions bring to the table okay so I

00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:54,180
think we'll start with with a toss

00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:55,680
we'll ask you know a toss is is really a

00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:58,380
known global leader in systems

00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,659
integration what role do you see for

00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:03,090
Linux on open power solutions and the

00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:05,960
enterprise and and how do you facilitate

00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,960
the integration

00:02:11,519 --> 00:02:16,440
are we all miked up or do you have I'm

00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:19,660
sorry

00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:23,650
here's an extra one you yeah this is

00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:25,930
better I think yeah so we see a growing

00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:31,900
interest from also from our enterprise

00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:38,590
customers for linux open power opens

00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:41,799
open source we help them to facilitate

00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:44,739
our customers in different ways one

00:02:41,799 --> 00:02:48,130
thing which is the relatively easy one

00:02:44,739 --> 00:02:51,989
is the new projects we do have full

00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:56,049
implementations based on Linux and open

00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:59,110
open source the more complex are the

00:02:56,049 --> 00:03:02,709
migrations from legacy solutions into

00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:06,519
the open source world there we have

00:03:02,709 --> 00:03:09,040
invested in a toolset which helps our

00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:12,069
customers to migrate and maybe even more

00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:15,040
important to do assessments to quickly

00:03:12,069 --> 00:03:17,920
see what the impact will be to do the

00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:20,230
migration of a legacy to an to an open

00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:23,730
source Linux environment which can be

00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:27,130
implemented on our open power solutions

00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:29,139
and there it's the bigger advantage for

00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:34,440
our customers in terms of a deity Co

00:03:29,139 --> 00:03:38,200
gain and lastly we are working on

00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:38,560
leveraging the new capabilities we see

00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:44,010
today

00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:46,870
like in GPU data database processing

00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:50,290
which becomes available with the with

00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:53,169
the current open power solutions and

00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:55,419
with the latest

00:03:53,169 --> 00:04:05,099
open power server we have announced

00:03:55,419 --> 00:04:08,799
recently ok thanks so Sakakibara hitachi

00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:10,989
launched your supercomputer the sr20

00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:15,430
4000 right which is an achievement for

00:04:10,989 --> 00:04:20,079
open power using power 9 and of course

00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:23,169
the Tesla V 100 GPUs so Hitachi is

00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:25,720
offering this to the Japanese more

00:04:23,169 --> 00:04:29,139
could you tell us Itachi's view on the

00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:32,050
Japanese HPC market and Hitachi strategy

00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:33,810
on how you're developing attractive

00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:37,800
products and solutions for the market

00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:41,740
yeah in Japan as in the other regions

00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:46,060
there are two major sectors public and

00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:49,120
private and he touches of has has been

00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:52,979
focusing on the public sector especially

00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:57,040
on national research institute because

00:04:52,979 --> 00:05:00,510
they requires relatively large systems

00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:04,389
and that these customers tend to light

00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:10,540
their programs own programs by

00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:13,090
themselves Fortran or C languages and

00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:19,630
the one difficulties they encounter is

00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:23,110
that they need to port the programs by

00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:25,750
themselves on to other problems when

00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:29,669
whenever they change the proteome

00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:33,460
architecture so study has been

00:05:29,669 --> 00:05:38,410
supporting these customers for a long

00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:43,169
time and we have technical advantage in

00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:48,099
this area by our automatic parallelizing

00:05:43,169 --> 00:05:51,180
compiler so now hatachi developed a new

00:05:48,099 --> 00:05:55,710
version of Fortran compiler based on

00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:59,280
open power technology it it detects

00:05:55,710 --> 00:06:05,760
automatically pair ism in the program

00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:10,479
and that with this new Fortran compiler

00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:14,220
users can pause the program very easily

00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:19,770
and they can get very performance

00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:28,069
without rewriting their programs

00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:31,460
so Hitachi is going to provide our

00:06:28,069 --> 00:06:35,340
solutions with this Fortran compiler

00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:41,460
so we are going to provide the products

00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:44,400
open power protests in in Japan is

00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:47,099
Hitachi offering your solutions only to

00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:50,880
the Japanese market or or this for

00:06:47,099 --> 00:06:57,030
worldwide yes hatachi is willing to

00:06:50,880 --> 00:07:00,509
offer in G as a reagent if there are the

00:06:57,030 --> 00:07:07,639
requirements we as as Japanese customers

00:07:00,509 --> 00:07:11,509
has and about about our Fortran compiler

00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:16,610
we are going to support various kinds of

00:07:11,509 --> 00:07:19,889
directives such as open SEC open V and

00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:21,810
even other companies directives super

00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:25,259
computer directives photon compiler

00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:29,969
directives in addition to such compilers

00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:33,449
so it makes users to port your program

00:07:29,969 --> 00:07:37,229
to open power technology so it will very

00:07:33,449 --> 00:07:40,169
attractive solutions for every users HPC

00:07:37,229 --> 00:07:43,710
users ok thank you thank you

00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:49,979
I think the next next question here is

00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:54,389
for James so so what's the competitive

00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:56,130
advantage for Firenze burg ok computer a

00:07:54,389 --> 00:07:58,469
competitive advantage

00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:59,490
I want to talk more about how his sinker

00:07:58,469 --> 00:08:02,280
ball competi

00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:05,190
pretty other one is open power system

00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:09,180
learned to talk about a company's

00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:11,610
advantage in my opinions I think the

00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:14,960
first of all the first advantage it

00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:18,389
should be is the most advanced his

00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:22,050
advanced technology genius because open

00:08:18,389 --> 00:08:25,590
power in highly the power system but I

00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:29,180
believe most of as we leave power system

00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:31,650
have have a overwhelming advantage in

00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:32,870
computing technology for example in

00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:34,729
terms of performance

00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:39,190
tons of reliability or serviceability

00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:43,550
you promise I have very advanced

00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:46,400
technology shall fall and cause open

00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:48,560
power is opening noticed we have a

00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:50,480
chance to look into the details look

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:53,870
into the technical details and design

00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:57,920
details and we found people we did into

00:08:53,870 --> 00:09:00,110
power system we found more advantage so

00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,480
the first advantage to build a technical

00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:07,400
leading technology knowledge II yell a

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:10,250
second and I think of tacos to to crawl

00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:12,980
over power ecosystem will be more likely

00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:15,800
more easy to be over calling any other

00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:19,460
new emerging computing system for

00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:21,800
samples Allah smoke eyes because for

00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:24,380
open power system we have too many

00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:26,210
features we have too much problem as a

00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:28,430
bit with a little bit power consumption

00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:33,050
for example but we are doing succession

00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:35,630
in technically I understand is it would

00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:37,940
be more easier learn to do addition for

00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:41,089
our skies we are doing to do for some

00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:45,260
promising increase and to do new feature

00:09:41,089 --> 00:09:49,400
to do what Power has done but I say it

00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:52,070
will be more more easy to open power

00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:56,480
ecosystem so the advantage should be we

00:09:52,070 --> 00:10:00,020
have more perspective ecosystem for for

00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:02,690
my power that is why is that we we

00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:03,260
karela joint venture with IBM to do open

00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:07,160
for business

00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:11,240
we do a very good post petty the future

00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:11,959
prosperity ecosystem and part of the

00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:15,650
second Apollo

00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:19,130
company's advantage is per actually we

00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:21,620
have keeping the most moksha in channel

00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:25,040
for many years and we have big customer

00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:27,350
base and we do a lot of joint I don't

00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,930
know miss customer especially with the

00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:33,470
Internet large-scale datacenter customer

00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:37,640
we have a good very good customer base

00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:41,980
and and also for to develop our own

00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:45,579
power business we can leverage it is

00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:49,920
big warrior and local leaders at table

00:10:45,579 --> 00:10:54,339
computing block from as 86 yeah it's a

00:10:49,920 --> 00:11:00,070
bishop advantage of company to develop

00:10:54,339 --> 00:11:03,220
open power system so I am more confident

00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:06,850
we will be open power Marquis just like

00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:09,209
we what the SAT says in China thank you

00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:12,339
very good thank you thank you very much

00:11:09,209 --> 00:11:15,339
hi Adi hello

00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:17,769
alright so how about now I I know you

00:11:15,339 --> 00:11:18,760
have an open power blog yes I actually

00:11:17,769 --> 00:11:20,560
read it

00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:22,209
oh that's so I quite quite a bit thank

00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,550
you so for those of you don't know you

00:11:22,209 --> 00:11:27,100
could introduce yourself just briefly

00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:30,070
and um yeah absolutely

00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:30,970
I'm Adi I'm a senior systems design

00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:37,089
engineer at Rackspace

00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:39,579
and I work on our power 9 server and you

00:11:37,089 --> 00:11:41,320
know in collaboration at Google and we

00:11:39,579 --> 00:11:43,060
call that same server let's say is

00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,920
motherboard and chassis wrapped around

00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:46,630
it we call it battle idea generation 2

00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:50,790
you know as a follow-up to the previous

00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:54,670
service that we generated but yep and

00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:56,170
and you know I'm here on this panel and

00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:59,199
overall when you know when we do

00:11:56,170 --> 00:12:00,399
hardware design if you know the

00:11:59,199 --> 00:12:03,459
background of Rackspace rack space

00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:04,810
offers IP services on top of hardware it

00:12:03,459 --> 00:12:07,390
doesn't offer hardware itself directly

00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:09,540
so bring a little bit of likes a

00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:12,370
solution and serviceability aspects to

00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:16,510
hardware design and that's what that's

00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:18,220
why I'm going to put it so what is so

00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:20,920
what what's really special about about

00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:22,690
your servers but barreleye yeah engine

00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:24,339
is too many cool things about the server

00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:26,470
and just to kind of wrap it up in few

00:12:24,339 --> 00:12:29,140
minutes but I do have a talk on that

00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:31,449
deep dive into that later today I'm

00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:35,019
going to touch the high points here you

00:12:31,449 --> 00:12:36,899
know in barrel ihe to server you know

00:12:35,019 --> 00:12:41,019
which has this motherboard essentially

00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:43,199
it's it's it's an Open Compute form

00:12:41,019 --> 00:12:45,670
factor so it's built for large-scale

00:12:43,199 --> 00:12:47,500
scale out deployments if you will and

00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:50,079
then there's a lot of serviceability and

00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:51,670
focus and you built a system so it's

00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:55,020
very easy to use

00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:57,220
for you know hyperscale datacenters and

00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:59,980
you know there's some of the other more

00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:02,650
you know cooler things is basically it's

00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:04,960
a 48 world server so very disaggregated

00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:07,210
implementation of 48 volt and the CPUs

00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,510
and dims they use 48 volt point of load

00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:10,690
today

00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:13,690
but GPUs and and storage is gonna get

00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:15,280
there and when when that happens you

00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:17,080
know we're in very very good position to

00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:19,750
support the server it has that kind of a

00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:23,410
design and for storage side you know the

00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:25,150
server supports a SATA and nvme in all

00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:27,610
this large so you know that's kind of

00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:30,220
very flexible architecture essentially

00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:33,130
it you know it'll help Rackspace use it

00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:35,200
in different products without actually

00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:37,480
having a different SKU for each each of

00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,040
the server and the last thing I want to

00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:41,170
touch on is that you know the server

00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:44,650
supports for a scale-up server supports

00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:46,960
both NV link and open copy accelerators

00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:50,140
which is you know very flexible we've

00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:52,000
kind of made a lot of options available

00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:58,990
so that you can use the system the way

00:13:52,000 --> 00:14:01,600
you want so maybe could you tell us how

00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:04,030
you're solving for emerging AI workloads

00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,770
using this server and and really how

00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:08,170
does this really benefit the users in

00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:09,460
the end in the end game yep you know and

00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:11,740
we've talked about a lot of hardware

00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:13,990
features and you know cool things and

00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:16,150
things like that but eventually you

00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:18,010
wanna you wanna solve for you know real

00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:19,890
word workloads right some of the

00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:24,970
workloads that we are you know looking

00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:27,340
optimally on this server is essentially

00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:29,020
like deep learning workloads not just

00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:32,830
like say deep learning when it comes to

00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:35,470
GPU we can be used for a lot of GPU

00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:37,930
analytics high-speed data analytics a

00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:39,610
lot of frameworks around and that can be

00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:43,240
really good to be leveraged on this

00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:45,310
platform you're also looking at like no

00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:47,920
sequel databases and things like that

00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:50,590
so that's the you know which data which

00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,150
workloads right but how right I'm gonna

00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:53,920
point out a little bit about how we are

00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:55,810
actually how this differentiates that

00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,640
you know for a specific workload deep

00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:59,770
learning today I think you know there's

00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:01,420
various stocks and and various venues

00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:03,280
people mentioned or deep learning

00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:05,250
there's one hindrance for deep learning

00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:07,080
to scale and

00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:09,840
actually there's two entrances for

00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:13,770
Ferdie planning scale is the slow G CPU

00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:15,500
to GPU you know connection be in the

00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:19,230
mainstream systems today lucky and three

00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:21,089
PCIe gen3 right and and the other

00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:23,160
bottleneck is slow server to server

00:15:21,089 --> 00:15:26,070
networking we're just looking at hundred

00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:27,960
gigs essentially of bandwidth between

00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:30,510
server to server and that's you know

00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:33,060
sometimes not enough you know for D

00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:35,040
planning workloads in this system we

00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:37,230
have is we leverage the CPU GPU and we

00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:39,089
link for the first hindrance to remove

00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:41,460
the first hindrance and the second one

00:15:39,089 --> 00:15:45,120
actually I'm gonna a little bit cool

00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:47,700
demo later today where we demonstrated

00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,920
one terabits per second server to server

00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:52,320
bandwidth one that's that's that's

00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:56,160
pretty significant essentially and not

00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:58,100
many systems can support that yep okay I

00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:01,650
look forward to seeing that

00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:06,480
okay so we have Weiss written with us as

00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:08,850
well and would like to know what are

00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:12,560
some of the benefits that why Stern

00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:15,600
brings as open power products provide

00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:18,000
you know your solutions and and and how

00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,930
you work as a business partner yes thank

00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,880
you Scott

00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:23,190
good morning everyone my name is can

00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:26,370
compile and it's my honor to represent

00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:28,380
with strong in this open power semi with

00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:31,470
strong is a professional design

00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:33,330
manufacturing service company we provide

00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:36,690
all kinds program for Tier one branding

00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:38,820
company since the year 2000 which wrong

00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:42,089
enterprise business group we work with

00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:44,760
ID and PowerPC put online more than 15

00:16:42,089 --> 00:16:48,390
years our first project is based on

00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:50,670
powerful processor and today we are very

00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:53,910
happy to launch in multiple power 9

00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:55,020
servers together with strong capability

00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:58,250
involves

00:16:55,020 --> 00:17:00,870
electrical design but we're coding

00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:03,450
thermo structural simulation

00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:06,420
mechanical level 10 system integration

00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:09,990
and regulatory reliability and

00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:12,510
compatibility testing the key message is

00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:14,970
with strong profiles customization

00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:16,800
services and one-stop shopping solution

00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:20,459
to our customers

00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:24,120
we hope today we can work with more

00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:27,209
partners here to provide more mature

00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:31,350
ecosystem and to help open power

00:17:27,209 --> 00:17:33,570
community together thank you so so you

00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:36,240
also have a couple of new power 9

00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:37,830
platforms can you first tell us a little

00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,390
bit about that and really what is unique

00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:43,530
and different for these these new

00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:45,090
platforms yes Sanka yes we understand

00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:48,120
there are three types power line

00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:51,300
processors three times and we strong is

00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:53,730
demoing to power 9 servers today in our

00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:56,250
booth the first one is the based on

00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:59,310
Lagrange processor our internal code

00:17:56,250 --> 00:18:02,790
name is mihawk mihawk is the stinger

00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:05,460
19-inch to you server it comes with the

00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:08,730
open carry capability pH and for

00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:12,120
connection and maximum 4 terabyte memory

00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:15,780
capacity it's a very good for big data

00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:17,790
AI ancient at Cline application the

00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:20,160
second one is based on for some

00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:23,780
processor our internal code name is a

00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:28,290
song ji-sun she is a 2 o/u

00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:31,770
21 inch OCP phone picture and it also

00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:35,790
comes with the PCM for connection a BME

00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:39,090
storage and the 48 fold purpose part

00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:42,030
design which means for hyperscale data

00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:44,790
center and carl environment and they can

00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:47,280
utilize that it's 48 volt design to

00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:53,670
enhance and optimize the power

00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:56,430
efficiency that's our special ok so

00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:59,460
Renee we would touch just briefly on the

00:18:56,430 --> 00:19:01,740
on AI we heard from from Adi what what

00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:05,450
role does open power play and in your

00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:08,460
strategy around around machine learning

00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:13,320
in general power has a long history

00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:15,870
within our company we celebrated last

00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:17,940
year our 25 year anniversary

00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:21,630
using power technology in developing

00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:24,360
together at IBM and open power has has

00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:28,160
reinforced a strategy and gave much more

00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:31,520
options than we had had before

00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:34,610
in terms of machine learning one of our

00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:39,290
key elements is the the recently

00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:42,500
released server which we call the l3o

00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:44,980
p90 in which the o P stands for open

00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:47,180
power as a recognition that is a server

00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:50,720
developed out of the open power

00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:53,060
initiative and that is clearly something

00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:56,300
are in our agenda to continue to work

00:19:53,060 --> 00:20:03,740
with and we are currently working on

00:19:56,300 --> 00:20:06,050
initiatives to also have h devices built

00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:10,660
based on cooperation within the open

00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:16,640
power community okay thank you

00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:18,740
maybe one more for James let's see I

00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,480
think I had one more here for you so

00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:23,240
well actually maybe maybe the similar

00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:26,200
question what what is your your key

00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:29,930
market targets move moving forward okay

00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:32,060
we will prepare for stay open power put

00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:36,230
online to meet the needs of different

00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:39,500
industry I think the major we are

00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:41,840
talking as me to three marquee first of

00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:45,760
all we will talk a large-scale data

00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:49,640
center customer to possibly a new emoji

00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:52,850
computing intensive workloads to provide

00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:55,490
more choose more options for large

00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:58,550
containers in the customer to to leave

00:20:55,490 --> 00:21:01,760
fresh layer hover platform especially we

00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:07,760
use open power the base product we have

00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:11,540
for example new perform ways open KP PCI

00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:16,460
4.0 and lotto new most advantage leading

00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:19,880
technology to provide to call service or

00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:23,440
picked our customer and the second is

00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:28,150
about artificial intelligent application

00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:31,520
we found more and more artificial

00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:34,250
startups companies application layer

00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:36,410
fairly focused on for example image or

00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:39,410
voice and ignition or augmentative

00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:40,700
driving and not top allocation

00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:41,780
innovation you know marquee

00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:46,140
so

00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:49,710
we will provide more integrated solution

00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:53,400
combine the inspir inspire I prefer and

00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:58,950
IBM advanced power solution together to

00:21:53,400 --> 00:22:01,800
provide a I end-to-end solution to these

00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:05,760
top companies we see it will be a very

00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:09,330
big potential the last web I say is

00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:11,820
about industry Internet we in China

00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:15,120
recommen is promoting the development of

00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:18,000
industry combining big data and IOT of

00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:20,790
modern manufacturing so we will I think

00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,670
we will combine database application and

00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:26,460
a purpose virtualization technology to

00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:28,920
have customer to build a layer build are

00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:31,560
more flexible will secure private cross

00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:34,620
service infrastructure for customer to

00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:38,070
put high end high end digital

00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:39,740
transformation up in the price I see ok

00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:43,080
thank you thank you

00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:48,000
so any any final thoughts you'd like to

00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:50,730
to leave us with yeah I think you know

00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,760
power line right it's a break to

00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:55,680
processor of our afar time I think you

00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:59,130
know it's enabling a you know new class

00:22:55,680 --> 00:23:00,900
of workloads essentially but to get

00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:02,400
there there's still some many new things

00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:05,100
you know that we have to kind of solve

00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,960
for and in the road to kind of do that

00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:09,450
it's actually together it's it's through

00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,010
collaboration and you know and that

00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:13,680
should be an industry-wide collaboration

00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:17,940
you know so that every one of us can

00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:20,490
benefit here right yep ok well I'd like

00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:22,410

the insight and some of the insights to

00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:30,240
your hardware and I totally agree right

00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:33,240
I mean we've done so much so far through

00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,920
the the work of open collaboration from

00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:36,570
