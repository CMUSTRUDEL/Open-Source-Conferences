[Music]

00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:19,610
doing me work at know we're working yeah

00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:22,520
hey good morning everybody

00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:26,300
night nice to see you all here and and I

00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:29,419
was sitting there I was thinking our

00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:31,939
very very first open power summit I

00:00:29,419 --> 00:00:34,040
think we were in a closet with like a

00:00:31,939 --> 00:00:36,320
little little stool to stand on for a

00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:39,290
stage it was this is great I mean this

00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,550
guys did a really nice job something I'm

00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:42,200
not going I don't I don't even feel

00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:44,480
worthy to stand up here I'll give it a

00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:46,429
shot all right okay we'll go on up here

00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:50,050
I like you better down there but closer

00:00:46,429 --> 00:00:52,309
but it's nice up here this is nice okay

00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:55,850
yeah and one other thing I wanted to do

00:00:52,309 --> 00:00:57,679
is is there is a great friend and one of

00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:59,989
the people that was really instrumental

00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:01,190
to getting open power started I hadn't

00:00:59,989 --> 00:01:02,899
see him sticking around where's Gordon

00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:05,150
at I wanted to just at least give a

00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:08,659
shout out to Gordon our first chairman

00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:10,430
of open power he emerged from retirement

00:01:08,659 --> 00:01:12,560
somewhere in the North Woods of Canada

00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:14,000
and and came here to see us and it's

00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:18,170
good to see you Gordon so thanks for

00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:23,450
coming so are we going to talk about

00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:27,439
here today actually today I wanted to

00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:28,790
talk about a few things and actually

00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,619
most of them were things that I've

00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:33,790
talked about before in some ways is a

00:01:30,619 --> 00:01:36,350
bit of a retrospective on open power and

00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:37,969
you know what do we set out to do how

00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:42,140
does it evolve how has it changed over

00:01:37,969 --> 00:01:44,240
time and where are we at now this chart

00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:47,750
on the left up there you know the

00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:50,270
classic Moore's Law chart it's actually

00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:53,719
a chart that I first showed in 2011 at a

00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:56,000
packaging keynote that then you know

00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:59,390
Gordon who I mentioned and I actually

00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,789
refined and shaped over time it was

00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:04,189
really to answer the question of why are

00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:07,579
we doing open power it was it's a

00:02:04,189 --> 00:02:09,710
problem statement and you could see what

00:02:07,579 --> 00:02:12,800
it is is the y axis of the chart on the

00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:15,500
left there is price performance and you

00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,950
know as technologies and processors

00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:20,660
cease to provide that cost performance

00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:22,490
improvement you got to go find something

00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:24,110
else to fill in the gap you got to go

00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:25,730
find something to fill in the gap and

00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:28,250
that's what most of the

00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:30,500
industries working on right now and and

00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:32,090
right now you know I would argue you

00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,530
know we've put a lot of things in there

00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:35,000
to fill that gap you know the first

00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:37,010
thing you know I always say that we've

00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,590
put in to fill the gap you know is

00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:41,840
virtualization right you know it's a way

00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:43,970
to improve cost performance of a system

00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,769
by about five times but you take it from

00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:48,110
ten percent utilization to fifty or

00:02:45,769 --> 00:02:49,849
sixty percent utilization don't need a

00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:50,390
new microprocessor don't need anything

00:02:49,849 --> 00:02:52,790
else

00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:55,610
and yet wallah you got a 5x cost

00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:58,670
performance improvement that's one of

00:02:55,610 --> 00:03:00,410
the biggest gap fillers the problem is

00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:02,120
is once you virtualize you're done you

00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:04,489
know it doesn't scale year after year

00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,230
you know he can virtualize once then

00:03:04,489 --> 00:03:09,109
you're you've got it then you got to go

00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:11,569
find something else and I would argue

00:03:09,109 --> 00:03:12,890
that the biggest gap filler between you

00:03:11,569 --> 00:03:14,299
know what most of the industry is

00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:17,329
plumbed on and working on the Moore's

00:03:14,299 --> 00:03:18,769
law and where technology and processors

00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:20,209
are taking us today the biggest gap

00:03:18,769 --> 00:03:22,519
filler we see going forward is

00:03:20,209 --> 00:03:24,709
acceleration and and putting

00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:27,049
accelerators in the systems I think

00:03:24,709 --> 00:03:28,190
that's a pretty solid trend you know on

00:03:27,049 --> 00:03:30,829
the right side you know on the

00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:33,560
consumption models I think everybody

00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:35,030
knows those but the biggest one and the

00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:37,900
one that's having the biggest impact on

00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:40,130
us now is cognitive computing and

00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:41,870
cognitive computing is just driving

00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:43,340
consumption up like crazy you know so I

00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:45,769
got on the left you know that we have

00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:47,599
you know a diminishing of what's been

00:03:45,769 --> 00:03:49,910
providing cost performance improvement

00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:52,700
it's coming on in the industry at the

00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:54,560
same time the consumptions going up it

00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:56,959
was kind of funny as I'm gonna throw

00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,730
this chart up here it was kind of funny

00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,680
I was I've been telling this for quite a

00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:01,519
while and then just yesterday I did a

00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:05,630
snapshot

00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:07,700
sumit Gupta one of our original open

00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:10,190
power members of he actually was part of

00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:12,260
Nvidia now he's part of IBM but he sent

00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:14,590
this to me yesterday he said hey Brad

00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:17,870
you know you got a little you got a

00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:20,209
little validation this is actually a

00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:21,799
Dave Patterson's chart you can actually

00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:23,180
tell it's Dave's Patterson start because

00:04:21,799 --> 00:04:26,510
it shows that the most improvement is

00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:27,830
due to RISC processors you know it's

00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:29,690
like you look at any say oh yeah of

00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:31,520
course that's a de Patterson chart but

00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:34,130
you know he was just showing this this

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,289
week and actually I find that to be the

00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:39,350
case right we were talking about this

00:04:36,289 --> 00:04:41,720
you know in 2013 2012

00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:44,330
quite a bit I think the industry is

00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:45,650
moving and everybody's really realizing

00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:48,590
that these are the pressures that were

00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:50,390
faced with and what sumit told me was as

00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:52,280
after at Patterson's show this chart his

00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:56,810
next chart was yep the answer is

00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:58,670
accelerated computing this this is a

00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:00,800
this there's a lot of versions of this

00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:02,330
chart out here but this is just an

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,220
example right you know as you sit there

00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:05,540
and you say you're being pressured and

00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,800
you're being pressured it's harder and

00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:08,390
harder and harder to continue that

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,460
improvement and show that cost

00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:12,740
performance improvement you know this is

00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:14,540
what's happening in the market and you

00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:16,220
know this is there's a lot of versus

00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:18,560
this prediction but this is you know how

00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:21,230
the total addressable market is growing

00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:24,350
you know it's been on a pretty steady 5%

00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:26,570
tagger for forever and that we've all

00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:28,850
been measuring and we're seeing this

00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:30,560
this exponential take off which is

00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:33,140
really the new markets that are defined

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,850
by artificial intelligence and and

00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:36,590
that's just taken off and going like

00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:38,300
crazy you know one of the most

00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:40,400
interesting things about this particular

00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:43,490
piece of that conversation though is is

00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:45,320
now all that stuff in white right that

00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:47,030
all of us in this room have been doing

00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,710
for the previous years you know the

00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:51,320
biggest workload down there in the white

00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:53,720
section of course is database but it's a

00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:56,510
whole process automation and when you

00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:58,850
approach somebody and say hey you know

00:05:56,510 --> 00:06:00,260
let's go you know let me give you some I

00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:02,810
T let me sell you some computing let me

00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:05,540
sell you some software all that you can

00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:07,580
really do right is save them money so if

00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:08,750
they're spending five bucks on a process

00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:11,120
you know what I'll get it done for for

00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:13,970
for you spending seven bucks I'll get it

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,430
done for six the green part is really

00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:19,310
really different the green part is

00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:20,570
different in nature now what's happening

00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:22,880
in the green part which is why it's

00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:24,860
taken off exponentially as you go to

00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,530
them you say hey I got artificial

00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:30,740
intelligence for you now your company

00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:32,390
can make $10 more you were making five

00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:34,040
I'll get you to ten you know you're

00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:35,810
trying to you're trying to service your

00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:37,460
clients and figure out when they need to

00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:39,170
get a service done or trying to find it

00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:41,510
figure out one you can go and buy

00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:43,490
something or sell something I'll figure

00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:46,190
that out for you better faster stronger

00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:48,169
and you'll make money off it now you go

00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:50,419
from being an automation and a way to

00:06:48,169 --> 00:06:52,910
save money to one of a competitive

00:06:50,419 --> 00:06:55,340
advantage and that is why the

00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:56,930
and for IT in that space is going to

00:06:55,340 --> 00:07:00,950
take off like this it's different in

00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:02,360
nature so this is this is another chart

00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:04,160
which is like one of the very first

00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:06,020
church this is actually a chart to Brian

00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,570
talak our current president made for me

00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:11,090
when we very first started open power

00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:12,680
and it tells an interesting story and it

00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:14,630
will vary much along the lines of the

00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:18,350
one that I did I just told you the

00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:19,790
narrative for is this is the chart we

00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:22,040
made the answer to question well what is

00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:25,610
open power and we made it back in

00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:27,320
2012-2013 you know and lauda this has

00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:29,360
been alluded to right it's the top left

00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:31,880
hand corner is the open firmware stack

00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,680
you know we've said open power is open

00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,540
when we make everything open and

00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,550
actually that really took off that's

00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:40,160
been a very good success story for open

00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:42,260
power as we created the open BMC and

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,520
that open firmware stack we're now

00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:45,230
actually seeing the rest of the industry

00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,970
come and get onto that stack

00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:49,370
there's a matter of fact there's a group

00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:53,090
we know of that involves Intel Microsoft

00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:55,100
Google IBM all taking our open BMC

00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:56,990
standardizing on it and making it's part

00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:59,060
of the open Linux Foundation that's

00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:00,800
that's a great thing wheat went and move

00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:03,110
the needle in the industry to a more

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,210
open firmware stack that now we've got

00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:07,190
everybody working on that's the kind of

00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:09,410
thing that we set out to do because this

00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:11,120
is all about making the plumbing much

00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:13,120
more ubiquitous and easy to get to and

00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,860
of course you know you've got the

00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,600
operating environment software stacks we

00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:19,970
got a lot of them up and running on the

00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:22,160
platform a lot of them optimized on the

00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:25,340
platform but the interesting part of the

00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:27,080
story that's down on the bottom is is

00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:29,480
when we started when I first started

00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:31,460
open power with with a lot of the people

00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:34,039
in this room everybody was going to

00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:36,169
become a microprocessor designer it was

00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:38,390
great everybody was like are you really

00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:40,130
gonna take the power IP and let me take

00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:41,780
it and go build micro processors and I

00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:44,510
said knock yourself out we'll do that

00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:46,910
and really yeah you know and then you

00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:48,800
realize it cost about 250 or 300 million

00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:51,650
dollars to do that and it's like that's

00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:53,300
not quite so exciting but but something

00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:55,690
else happened but you know something

00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:58,880
else happened and something else changed

00:08:55,690 --> 00:09:01,190
what also happened is is accelerated

00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,950
computing happened all at the same time

00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:05,180
but if you think about it right this is

00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:06,010
the really interesting shift that

00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:08,170
occurred in the end

00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:09,610
as we were going along as you think

00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:12,070
about it if you went into the

00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:13,420
accelerated computing right now what's

00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:15,130
the average accelerated computer well

00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:17,050
the most easy one to point to is a deep

00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:20,050
learning training platform we have one

00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:22,720
on the AC 922 but there's many of them

00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:24,940
out there a processor and four GPUs well

00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,200
what is that well a processor these days

00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:28,240
is about six seven hundred square

00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:31,480
millimeters of silicon state-of-the-art

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:33,370
silicon GPU 700 square millimeters of

00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:37,390
state-of-the-art silicon four of those

00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:39,640
man you're staring at you know 30,000

00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:41,470
square millimeters of silicon just to do

00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:43,090
one solution are we gonna integrate all

00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:46,990
that put it on a chip and ship it out

00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:50,820
now technology's not scaling as fast so

00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:52,150
what really is happening is this oh

00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:54,220
there it is

00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:55,780
yeah what really is happening is this is

00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:57,370
this people are really wanting to

00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:59,380
optimize their architectures around

00:09:57,370 --> 00:10:01,600
accelerated computing and now it's

00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:03,490
becoming what are you doing to open up

00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,730
your interfaces give me the performance

00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:09,490
I need give me the technology I need to

00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:13,090
go and attach and what I want to attach

00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:15,880
to the processor in an open way in at my

00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:18,160
convenience on my terms and naturally

00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:19,950
the detour that we took and and in your

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,990
part of the offshoot of the open power

00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:24,490
ecosystem is the open capi ecosystem but

00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:26,980
this is strategic this is where the

00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:29,140
industry is going this is where the

00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:31,420
future of IT is and it's gonna ratchet

00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:33,640
redefine and reshape what the

00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:35,860
architecture of systems is going to be

00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:38,500
and and you can see we're attaching

00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:40,300
everything to it that that top path

00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,560
still exists it's still part of open

00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:43,570
power and anybody who wants to become a

00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:45,460
microprocessor designer see me after

00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:47,950
class and we're gonna go and we'll set

00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:51,640
you up but bring a wheelbarrow full of

00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:53,680
money you know it cost a lot of money

00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:55,660
but that that path is still there we're

00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:58,060
still available to people but it's not

00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:59,440
the big differentiator it's not the big

00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:00,910
differentiator I don't think you're

00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,980
going to be able to take over the world

00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:05,620
you know being able to do it trying to

00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:07,240
do it all in one piece of a super SSC so

00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:08,800
this is the shift in the industry this

00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:11,590
is the big shift that's taking place in

00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:13,930
the industry right here cores and caches

00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:15,700
and system buses used to be the

00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:17,769
differentiator that used to be the way

00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:19,869
that everything changed and

00:11:17,769 --> 00:11:22,839
and that's where all the value set now

00:11:19,869 --> 00:11:24,459
and no an oh by the way the IO that was

00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:26,259
plumbing right you know that we

00:11:24,459 --> 00:11:27,579
Northbridge and Southbridge is wherever

00:11:26,259 --> 00:11:29,379
you want to call them that that used to

00:11:27,579 --> 00:11:31,149
be plumbing now that's the

00:11:29,379 --> 00:11:32,559
differentiator that's where the

00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:37,029
technology and the value is going to

00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:40,869
come from is from the the IO attach and

00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:42,399
and the the memory attached and then

00:11:40,869 --> 00:11:45,129
cores and caches are going to really

00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,299
become the plumbing and and this is a

00:11:45,129 --> 00:11:48,309
shift that's taking place in the

00:11:46,299 --> 00:11:51,369
industry and this is a shift that we're

00:11:48,309 --> 00:11:53,649
leading with open power and with our

00:11:51,369 --> 00:11:55,089
partners and open power if you go and

00:11:53,649 --> 00:11:57,759
you look right you know the system

00:11:55,089 --> 00:12:01,449
bottleneck now is is very likely going

00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:03,040
to be you know an i/o bus you know if we

00:12:01,449 --> 00:12:06,189
could a lot of today's architecture if

00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,449
you're dangling off a PCIe gen3 that's

00:12:06,189 --> 00:12:09,730
very likely to be your solution

00:12:07,449 --> 00:12:11,489
bottleneck now and now if you go and

00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:14,679
look at where we're at today you

00:12:11,489 --> 00:12:17,040
mentioned you know power 9 you know

00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:20,110
we're doing seven to 10x that bandwidth

00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:22,480
especially out to our NVIDIA GPUs using

00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:24,399
NV link that we started as one of our

00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:28,569
first open power projects with Nvidia

00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:32,230
you know in Nvidia is is exactly I think

00:12:28,569 --> 00:12:34,209
a great example of a group that saw the

00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:35,470
trends and and what happened in that

00:12:34,209 --> 00:12:37,959
fork in the road that I saw they

00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:39,939
identified it early and invested heavily

00:12:37,959 --> 00:12:43,689
against it and they're reaping a lot of

00:12:39,939 --> 00:12:45,819
benefits from it and to that end I'm

00:12:43,689 --> 00:12:49,059
gonna actually ask Jerry to come up and

00:12:45,819 --> 00:12:50,740
join me from Nvidia to say a few words

00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:52,420
about the investments they made he

00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:54,160
Jerry's a little bit unique in the video

00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:56,589
he's been there since I was a 600 person

00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,059
company he joined in 2000 and he's

00:12:56,589 --> 00:13:00,160
watched all the trends and all the

00:12:58,059 --> 00:13:02,110
investment that into MIDI has made to

00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,480
get out ahead of the trends and the

00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:05,619
curves that I'm describing here and so

00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,329
Jerry once you go ahead and share if you

00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:09,699
were raised with everybody about about

00:13:07,329 --> 00:13:11,290
your journey over over Nvidia yeah I'd

00:13:09,699 --> 00:13:13,689
love to thanks Brad it's pleasure being

00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:15,309
here with all of you so so you know I've

00:13:13,689 --> 00:13:16,959
been on this path for a long time of

00:13:15,309 --> 00:13:19,629
course and we definitely have a shared

00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:22,059
vision and recently we've definitely

00:13:19,629 --> 00:13:24,610
been seeing a lot of news and a lot of

00:13:22,059 --> 00:13:26,079
people have been captured and really

00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:26,949
inspired by a lot of the news and

00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:29,919
breakthroughs that have been happening

00:13:26,949 --> 00:13:31,810
happening in order in an accelerated AI

00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:33,520
and cognitive

00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:36,040
but the reality is that this is simply

00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:37,810
the latest workload that we're seeing of

00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:39,670
a long line of workloads on this path

00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:41,560
that we've been following for probably

00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:43,510
over ten years now for accelerated

00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:45,430
computing and at the very beginning it

00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:47,980
started with you know relatively small

00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:49,870
small communities of researchers and

00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:51,280
developers that were targeting these

00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:53,050
domains and they're making these

00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,490
fantastic breakthroughs but these

00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:56,350
breakthroughs were at the beginning

00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:58,870
relevant to kind of these narrow spaces

00:13:56,350 --> 00:14:00,760
for like physics or chemistry in all

00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:03,820
kinds of other areas the difference

00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:05,040
nowadays though with accelerated AI and

00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:07,660
with cognitive computing is that

00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,970
suddenly now all these accelerated

00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:12,430
workloads are relevant to everybody

00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:15,340
these kinds of technology is affecting

00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:17,650
major sectors are of our economy now and

00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:19,770
they're not just small impacts their

00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:22,600
hitting sectors like manufacturing

00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:25,030
energy production and transportation

00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,740
distribution transportation and

00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:28,990
healthcare these are all sectors that

00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:31,210
touch our lives every single day and

00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:32,830
they're really potentially the the

00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:35,410
potential here for transformative impact

00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:36,730
for these workloads is is is really

00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:39,910
tremendous

00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:41,770
so we're I'm expecting to see a lot of

00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:43,630
really really strong and and really

00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:45,010
transformative impacts with these latest

00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:47,680
workloads and I think it's actually just

00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:49,270
the latest in a long series of workloads

00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,620
that we're seeing that benefit from

00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:52,060
these types of architectures so I'm

00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:53,110
really looking forward to the future and

00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:55,720
I think this is gonna be a really

00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:58,150
exciting time for us Thank You Jerry

00:14:55,720 --> 00:15:01,060
so I was thinking you know as you were

00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:02,590
saying and talking about it that you

00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:04,330
know what you're really saying is is I

00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:05,980
think two things right you know one you

00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:08,860
got your AI workload it's just gonna

00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:10,510
touch everybody and then oh by the way

00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:12,340
we're gonna also pick up lots of new

00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:13,330
workloads and accelerate those in the

00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:15,520
future as well

00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:16,960
so what do you think the role is of

00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,940
these you know advanced system

00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:21,790
architectures like I said in the ability

00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:23,140
and the ability of accelerators to

00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:24,700
address more work books because that's

00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:26,230
gonna be the trick obviously in the

00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:27,820
industry as good accelerators to touch

00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:30,550
more and more workloads yeah absolutely

00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:33,100
absolutely so as many of you know that

00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:34,600
are in this space the fuel that feeds a

00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:37,420
lot of these cognitive workloads

00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:39,130
ultimately is the ability to ingest huge

00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:41,020
amounts of data and then be able to

00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:42,730
compute on that data across large

00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:44,230
systems large pieces of infrastructure

00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:44,899
and a lot of the breakthroughs that

00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:47,269
we've seen to

00:15:44,899 --> 00:15:48,949
they really are are at the node level

00:15:47,269 --> 00:15:49,999
and these are achieving some fantastic

00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:51,740
breakthroughs especially with these

00:15:49,999 --> 00:15:53,869
great systems that we're seeing now with

00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:55,790
lots of GPUs and lots of bandwidth in

00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:57,410
the system but I think the next big step

00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:59,269
given that there's so much data coming

00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:00,529
in now and the computational workloads

00:15:59,269 --> 00:16:02,929
are getting bigger and bigger and bigger

00:16:00,529 --> 00:16:05,059
the next big step is the ability to be

00:16:02,929 --> 00:16:07,670
able to spread these computations across

00:16:05,059 --> 00:16:08,869
clusters of systems where this the the

00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:10,279
kinds of technologies we're talking

00:16:08,869 --> 00:16:11,959
about here with high bandwidth

00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:14,329
interconnects between multiple systems

00:16:11,959 --> 00:16:16,399
each nodes being highly accelerated is

00:16:14,329 --> 00:16:17,779
going to be fantastic and that's going

00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:19,790
to be the next stage of evolution that

00:16:17,779 --> 00:16:21,110
we're gonna see all right Jerry great

00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:22,490
thanks a lot and I appreciate you coming

00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:27,319
up here to join me thanks very much it

00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:30,589
was a pleasure yeah okay so throw the

00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:32,990
last chart up there I can't can't can't

00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:34,699
do an open power meeting which we don't

00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:36,649
at least throw the roadmap up actually

00:16:34,699 --> 00:16:37,819
this this roadmap chart doesn't look

00:16:36,649 --> 00:16:40,459
that different than the last one which

00:16:37,819 --> 00:16:43,220
is always a good thing we have a lot of

00:16:40,459 --> 00:16:45,290
consistency in the roadmap you know but

00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:46,910
the one thing again that I keep that I

00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:49,160
always like to point out with this chart

00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:51,759
and I'm going to reiterate it here is is

00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:54,350
if you go and you look at everything

00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:57,139
prior to power eight actually we dropped

00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:59,420
off power 6 so that guess to the left

00:16:57,139 --> 00:17:03,050
there but you can still see you know

00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:05,120
power seven power 7 plus power 8 every

00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:08,120
chip was in a different technology no

00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:09,709
technology was the driver you go forward

00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:11,959
right and you can see it if you look

00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:14,390
carefully at the chart you can see it

00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:16,250
that now all of the innovation and

00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:18,409
what's happening in these roadmaps is

00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:20,809
all about advanced i/o and signaling and

00:17:18,409 --> 00:17:22,429
connectivity that's that's where the

00:17:20,809 --> 00:17:24,620
performance is coming from NASA where

00:17:22,429 --> 00:17:25,789
the value is being generated again which

00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:29,120
is consistent with what I've been

00:17:25,789 --> 00:17:31,669
telling you and I think that's a very

00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:33,080
very important piece as you look to the

00:17:31,669 --> 00:17:35,539
future and you look at what we're doing

00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:38,299
with open power but we're enabling our

00:17:35,539 --> 00:17:39,500
open power or ecosystem to do and then

00:17:38,299 --> 00:17:41,360
all the way what we're gonna enable you

00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:44,390
guys to do to create new and creative

00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:47,779
solutions for your clients and your use

00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:49,370
cases so with that I'm gonna wrap up and

00:17:47,779 --> 00:17:51,890
thank you very very much appreciate your

00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:53,450
all's attention it's always great to get

00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:55,309
a chance to share with you what we're

00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:58,159
seeing what we're doing here at IBM and

00:17:55,309 --> 00:17:58,750
as well as I appreciate all of you

00:17:58,159 --> 00:18:00,580
always involve

00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:02,110
an open power and your participation in

00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,470
that ecosystem with us so thank you very

00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:06,940
much

00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:06,940
