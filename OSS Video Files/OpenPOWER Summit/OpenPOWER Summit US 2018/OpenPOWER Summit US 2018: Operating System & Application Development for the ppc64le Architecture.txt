I'm Scott Herald I'm a senior manager of

00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:07,230
product management at Red Hat I'm also

00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:09,809
one of the open power foundation board

00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:11,700
of director members so here today to

00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:13,410
just talk about things that we've done

00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:15,379
at Red Hat to kind of help rethink the

00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:18,570
way that we deliver an operating system

00:00:15,379 --> 00:00:23,730
to help with application development for

00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:26,910
the power architecture so quicken agenda

00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:28,410
talking about how x86 64 you know still

00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:31,170
kind of factors into the equations of

00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:34,050
how we operate talk about the value that

00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:35,850
the OS still provides to modern systems

00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:37,410
today how we enable our hardware

00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:40,260
partners how we look to attract the

00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:41,760
right is v's into the ecosystem and a

00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:44,910
quick little brief slide about just you

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,039
know Red Hat and you so one of the quick

00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:48,539
things that I want to highlight you know

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,860
someone has to talk about the elephant

00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:51,750
in the room is if you look at the

00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,820
overall market share out there there's

00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:58,260
no secret who owns that it's you know

00:00:53,820 --> 00:01:00,030
the x86 64 space trying to take the

00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,649
market data that we see from all of the

00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:03,480
analysts and say why should people

00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:05,519
invest in power why should people invest

00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,830
in the ARM architecture why should

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,170
people continue to invest in s/390 X or

00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:13,260
mainframe there are a lot of very good

00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:15,240
reasons trying to share that with

00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:18,060
executive leadership also often faces

00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:20,460
challenges how do we you know convince

00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:22,830
these executive leaders that look at

00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:24,330
numbers and data like this and say why

00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:27,299
should we care about power you know what

00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:29,280
is the value that we that we can get out

00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:31,530
of something like that the second one

00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,740
that we run into is our product teams

00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:37,049
our developers the model that we used to

00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:38,280
run by was every single product team

00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:41,159
that would have to take a portion of

00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,170
their engineers and say you have to go

00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:46,170
port something over to the power or

00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,770
big-endian architecture or now we have

00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:49,079
little-endian

00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:51,329
now you have to go reduce some of that

00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:52,979
work it wasn't a very healthy model for

00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:54,509
our internal engineers our internal

00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:56,909
development teams and it was disruptive

00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:58,469
to our product lines and what their

00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:03,030
route to market and their business plans

00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:04,530
were that was the third thing is how do

00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:06,719
we avoid that disruption to the core

00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:08,610
business what our products see as the

00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:11,160
market opportunity and telling them wait

00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:13,140
stop we need to make sure that this

00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,830
works on power as well so a lot of

00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,200
internal Paula

00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:17,490
takes a lot of internal discussion at

00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,020
the end of the day we actually managed

00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:21,210
to get through a lot of those in

00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:24,150
conversations with IBM many partners

00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:25,170
that we have in the overall ecosystem to

00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:27,600
the point where we convinced our

00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:29,940
executive leadership and the simple

00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,320
response that I got was you know don't

00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:34,560
 it up

00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:36,540
plain and simple is there are absolutely

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:40,380
opportunities that we see for the power

00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:42,090
architecture and we realized that in

00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:44,880
order to be successful there RedHat had

00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:48,210
to change the ways that we approached

00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:50,160
the operating system to get there first

00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:51,990
and foremost one of the things that you

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,860
know we've suffered you know probably a

00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:55,020
little bit more than any other

00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:57,240
distribution out there is parity across

00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:59,550
the operating systems if you take a look

00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:01,709
at rel for x86 versus rel for power

00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:02,850
versus rel for mainframe every one of

00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:04,980
those had a different set of

00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:06,990
capabilities that were available or not

00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:09,510
available and we saw that as a big

00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:11,490
challenge what we needed to do was tear

00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:13,800
down the barriers of adoption for our

00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:15,330
customers when they choose rel they get

00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,890
rel regardless of the underlying

00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:19,590
hardware platform that they choose to

00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:21,390
run it on they should expect to see the

00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:23,370
exact same experience from a set of

00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:25,440
virtualization capabilities to container

00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:27,450
enablement technologies with the OCI

00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,850
format they shouldn't have to stop and

00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:30,989
think if I go with the mainframe I'm

00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:33,180
gonna have to go look at a different

00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:35,910
distribution in order to get containers

00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:38,730
running it just wasn't a model that was

00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:40,910
working we needed to have that dedicated

00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:43,200
focus we couldn't pull people away from

00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:46,650
individual engineering product teams

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,239
what we had to do was build essentially

00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:50,760
a parallel organization whose sole

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:53,040
responsibility that I lead is to enable

00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:56,400
multiple architectures that includes

00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,110
power arm as 390x how do we get all of

00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,239
these architectures up to the level of

00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:02,430
having feature parity and do so without

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,290
disrupting the core product teams so we

00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:06,930
have a dedicated set of engineers that

00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:08,489
don't have to come in and spend a

00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:10,620
portion of the day working on the power

00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:12,780
architecture they get to come in and

00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:14,640
actually work on you know the next

00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:17,190
generation of cognitive computing by

00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,540
enabling rel for power just the

00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:20,790
mentality that they were dedicated to

00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:23,460
something and we laid out the plans the

00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:25,380
vision to them in that fashion actually

00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:27,060
has had people excited to come in and

00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:29,130
work on these new architectures where

00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,870
before it was pulling them away from

00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:33,720
moving into the latest greatest

00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:35,460
container technologies to stop him back

00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:38,100
port work that they did 18 months ago

00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:40,440
into a new architecture and of course

00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:42,540
the goal is not just delivering an

00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:44,220
operating system it's why do people need

00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:46,470
an operating system well it's to run

00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:48,600
their applications on top so we needed

00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:50,760
to look at the portfolio products that

00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:53,400
RedHat provides on top of rel our

00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:56,190
OpenStack offering our revelation

00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:57,840
offering our openshift container

00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:59,490
management platform these are what

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,500
customers are coming to us asking for

00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:03,900
they're not coming to us and saying we

00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:06,000
need rel we're saying we need a way to

00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:07,560
run containers we need a way to manage

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,410
our virtualization we need to build a

00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:12,540
private cloud using OpenStack and that's

00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:14,430
the direction that's helped us you know

00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:16,169
really focus these areas not just on the

00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:18,389
operating system but the operating

00:05:16,169 --> 00:05:19,740
system plus what the customers are

00:05:18,389 --> 00:05:23,280
looking to run on top of it

00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:26,130
I mentioned earlier the value of the

00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,540
operating system I think VMware 10 years

00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:30,000
ago claimed the operating system was

00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:32,280
dead I still don't think it could be any

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,070
further from the case the operating

00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:36,390
system itself is responsible for doing

00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:39,510
all of that communication to the

00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:41,850
hardware making sure that the system

00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:44,220
calls in the kernel ABI

00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:45,780
doesn't change making sure that if

00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:48,479
you're running on x86 are you running on

00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:50,400
power the same tooling the same commands

00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,020
work regardless of what hardware you're

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,340
running on and we saw a great example of

00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:55,440
that in the keynotes this morning with

00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:57,870
Oregon State showing the two compilers

00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,900
side by side doing the exact same tasks

00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:02,520
running rel and not caring the fact that

00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:06,030
one was a power architecture and one was

00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:08,400
an x86 64 based architecture to help

00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:10,590
also manage these common tasks the

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,030
automation the management of the

00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:14,400
infrastructure we need to provide a

00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:16,289
common interface in a common way so

00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,270
people don't need to stop and say if

00:06:16,289 --> 00:06:20,400
this is power I need to manage this

00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:23,160
differently than I would an x86 based

00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,990
infrastructure and the most important

00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:26,729
thing is connecting the applications to

00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:28,979
the dependencies that they have all of

00:06:26,729 --> 00:06:31,410
the libraries that are required for

00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:33,300
these applications to run so that was

00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:35,880
also a very large effort on our part is

00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:39,240
you know a modern Linux operating system

00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:40,590
I believe rel has upwards of 4,000

00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,080
packages in rel

00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:45,890
seven that's a hell of a task trying to

00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:48,720
make sure that everything is built for

00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:51,000
no arch compatibility that when it

00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,590
compiles and builds it's going to work

00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,090
on all these architectures there were a

00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:55,680
few instances where some of these

00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:58,590
packages some of these dependencies were

00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,390
artful very specifically targeted for

00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:01,950
one architecture or another and I

00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:04,200
actually use you know kind of the

00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:06,750
container technology three to four years

00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:10,500
ago of that exact example containers

00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:11,100
were built with only x86 64 in mind top

00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,840
to bottom

00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,940
no way around it everything about it was

00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:18,390
all about x86 computing out in Linux

00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:20,220
what we saw is a major effort Google

00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:21,750
helped with that was heavily involved

00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:24,360
sousei was heavily involved with us

00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:25,830
working on how do we take that and how

00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,170
do we scale that to these other

00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:30,870
architectures and not just the ability

00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:33,120
to run containers but kubernetes how do

00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:35,340
we take the frameworks that are managing

00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,220
containers and port that so it doesn't

00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:40,920
care about architecture when I do a you

00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:43,260
know run see Postgres how do I know that

00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:44,880
a container that I get has the right

00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:47,790
base image I'm not going to try to run

00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:50,550
an x86 based base image on a power base

00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:52,620
server we created the the feature that

00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:54,420
our manifest lists that actually sends

00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:57,420
server information up to the registries

00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:58,920
so it knows what proper packages and

00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:00,930
containers to send down

00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:02,910
so there's compatibility and that had to

00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:05,760
all be designed and built within the

00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:08,370
last two to three years to help support

00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:09,360
this push of multiple architecture to

00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:12,630
make sure that the containers were

00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,880
possible on power architecture in the

00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:16,470
first place and that's the most

00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:18,660
important thing is making sure that we

00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:20,610
remove that thought process from the

00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:22,560
operators this admins that they don't

00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:23,940
need to stop and think well this is

00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,520
power so I have to do something

00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:28,590
differently we're fundamentally with the

00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:30,990
operating system building it up so that

00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:33,900
the user space and everything that the

00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:37,890
consumer sees uses and runs is identical

00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:39,990
across all of the architectures you know

00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:43,560
why does this matter you know we go back

00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:45,900
to I believe if we go back far enough to

00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:47,910
the left we support back to power 5 with

00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:49,560
what Red Hat was doing but looking at

00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:52,800
all the architectures going forward

00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:53,910
power 7 8 9 there was mention of power

00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,360
10 coming

00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:59,790
online you know in 2020 so historically

00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,310
the om has been IBM well now with open

00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:03,930
power we see significantly more vendors

00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:05,940
opening up the space we see a lot of

00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:09,870
hardware vendors out there on the show

00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:11,640
floor with Hitachi Wistrom inspir NEC

00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:13,950
who was out there the growing number of

00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,600
hardware providers and OAM o DM

00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:17,880
providers is growing

00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,260
using the power architecture so starting

00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:21,210
with power 8 and our involvement with

00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:23,010
open power was making sure that we

00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:25,020
conformed to the standards work closely

00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:26,610
with IBM and the partners to be able to

00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:29,070
provide that common operating system

00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:30,960
experience provide those OS capabilities

00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:32,880
that historically have been missing on

00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:35,550
power and as we made the transition from

00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:38,160
a big-endian focus to a little Indian

00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:39,660
focus with power 9 was making sure that

00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:43,470
we got our virtualization capabilities

00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:45,420
our container OCI capabilities up to

00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:47,790
where we needed to be making sure that

00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:51,180
we're driving is vs we're now a part of

00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:53,790
the power AI offering from IBM we have

00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:55,440
sa P Hana certifications for power 8

00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:57,240
starting to work with them on the

00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,460
upcoming power 9 and getting

00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,290
certification with sa P for that how do

00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:03,780
we continue to grow those ISVs and

00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:05,610
ultimately get into the use cases where

00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:07,350
the power architecture is taking us

00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:09,480
cognitive artificial intelligence

00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:11,490
machine learning Big Data these are the

00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,470
real opportunities that we see it's not

00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:15,540
about running an operating system but

00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:17,760
it's enabling the use cases that we see

00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:20,640
on top and we want the operating system

00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,890
do you be able to prove to essentially

00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,180
make that invisible to the users as to

00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:26,270
how they get there and make sure that

00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:29,430
power is treated as a tier 1

00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:31,590
architecture for the customers looking

00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:33,210
for you know the what is really the

00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:36,930
highest performance cost performance

00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:38,400
value that's out there you know so what

00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:40,290
do we do how do we enable the hardware

00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,640
partners you know we have to have

00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:43,950
partner alignment we can't just go out

00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:45,630
there and turn on all of our

00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:47,580
applications all of our use cases for

00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:49,290
everyone we work very very closely with

00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:51,720
our partners and we very specifically

00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:53,370
look at what are those use cases so

00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:55,020
those use cases that I mentioned in that

00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:56,760
previous slide we worked incredibly

00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:59,820
closely with IBM and our partners to

00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:01,800
know where they were building the power

00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:03,390
architecture to go in the future if

00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,190
someone comes to me and says hey we want

00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:07,680
to go put power 9 at the edge in the

00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:09,809
telco I'm probably going to say

00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:12,540
not a chance nothing we've done up to

00:11:09,809 --> 00:11:14,100
this point was built to you know a

00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:17,339
company that use case the networking

00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:19,769
capabilities the NFV to that level we

00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:21,180
have it has not been identified as a use

00:11:19,769 --> 00:11:25,290
case we're not really going to start

00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:26,970
building these capabilities just because

00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:28,019
the architecture is available we want to

00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:29,759
make sure that we are aligning to the

00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:30,959
proper use cases and we can only do that

00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:34,499
through a communication with our

00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:36,149
partners and invest wisely all the way

00:11:34,499 --> 00:11:38,579
through product delivery you know making

00:11:36,149 --> 00:11:40,559
sure that what we send out the door is

00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:42,240
something that works is been validated

00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:44,069
has been tested in alignment with our

00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,139
partners so when a customer sees this

00:11:44,069 --> 00:11:47,639
and receives this he knows it's going to

00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:49,860
work through hardware certification

00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:51,929
through other mechanisms that we put

00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:53,910
into place and even working with our

00:11:51,929 --> 00:11:55,439
partners on helping do field enablement

00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:59,519
making sure we're highlighting the

00:11:55,439 --> 00:12:02,459
benefits of what power provides the high

00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:04,189
performance really you know getting

00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:06,720
moving towards the exascale computing

00:12:04,189 --> 00:12:07,800
the cost per performance all the numbers

00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,869
and information that we've seen

00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:12,179
throughout the day is where he is really

00:12:09,869 --> 00:12:13,529
where we see this leading and we do a

00:12:12,179 --> 00:12:15,360
lot of enablement with our hardware

00:12:13,529 --> 00:12:17,160
partners to get the marketing messaging

00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,040
right to help get out the door and help

00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:21,420
deliver solutions as partners not we're

00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:23,569
going off and trying to do this alone

00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:25,949
iBM is gonna go tell a different story

00:12:23,569 --> 00:12:28,350
in Spurs gonna tell a different story

00:12:25,949 --> 00:12:30,029
it's all aligning to you know aligned to

00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:33,749
what those use cases are and where

00:12:30,029 --> 00:12:35,040
people are are moving into market so in

00:12:33,749 --> 00:12:37,350
terms of just enabling these hardware

00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,209
partners you know we have alone with IBM

00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:40,920
over an 18-year history

00:12:39,209 --> 00:12:43,079
in partnering with them we provided

00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:45,569
support since power five around late

00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:48,240
2005 is when we started to invest in

00:12:45,569 --> 00:12:50,009
power back when it was only big endian

00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,529
and that's continued through power six

00:12:50,009 --> 00:12:55,290
power seven power 8 into the little

00:12:52,529 --> 00:12:59,009
endian transition and going to continue

00:12:55,290 --> 00:13:02,129
on to power 9 and we'll see what happens

00:12:59,009 --> 00:13:03,959
as we get to 2020 with power 10 we have

00:13:02,129 --> 00:13:05,459
a very strong ability to enable our new

00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:08,129
partners platforms and architectures

00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:11,790
quickly everything that Red Hat does is

00:13:08,129 --> 00:13:13,529
100% upstream first no matter what

00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:15,660
we will never put anything into a

00:13:13,529 --> 00:13:17,670
downstream Red Hat product without it

00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:20,209
being accepted by the upstream community

00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:21,589
and that's one of the values that

00:13:20,209 --> 00:13:23,149
we like to provide is we have the

00:13:21,589 --> 00:13:25,069
engineers that are contributing the code

00:13:23,149 --> 00:13:26,629
a lot of times are the maintainer z' of

00:13:25,069 --> 00:13:28,720
the code or specific sets of

00:13:26,629 --> 00:13:31,249
functionality to make sure that we're

00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:35,360
always committing to the open community

00:13:31,249 --> 00:13:36,470
open standards upstream first as we pull

00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,240
that down and work with our hardware

00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:44,240
partners we also have a full hardware

00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:47,059
certification program and that includes

00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,259
certification kits for power 9 making

00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:49,999
sure that when customers get the

00:13:48,259 --> 00:13:55,429
hardware there's a level of confidence

00:13:49,999 --> 00:13:57,199
that what they get the operating system

00:13:55,429 --> 00:13:59,319
that runs and the applications on top of

00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,319
that

00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:13,970
are are going to work and when they work

00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:16,280
it's going to work for a guaranteed

00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:17,990
period of time so one of the things that

00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:22,940
we have is a ten-year Support Lifecycle

00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:24,830
on any major version of realm what that

00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:27,440
means is any application that's built

00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:30,740
based off of any version of you know say

00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:32,570
rel seven whether it's 71 72 73 it's

00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:35,750
going to continue to work throughout the

00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:37,670
entire lifecycle of that rail release no

00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:43,160
application changes needed nothing

00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:44,270
needed by a ISVs or hardware partners to

00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:48,500
make sure that we maintain compatibility

00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:50,090
across versions and as we saw earlier

00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:52,520
today we have that consistent set of

00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:54,800
compilers libraries and tools to make

00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:56,750
sure that if you build for multiple

00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,400
architectures it's going to build the

00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:01,430
same way using the same commands and

00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:04,310
using the same tools to get the code

00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:07,820
built compiled and ready to run for the

00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:10,040
consumer one of the things that I think

00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:12,830
everybody in the community everybody in

00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:15,560
open power needs to focus on and this

00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:18,170
should be a strong focus for 2018 is

00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:20,140
attracting the ISPs again it's all about

00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:23,090
the workloads that you need to run on

00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:25,280
the platform it's absolutely vital to

00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:27,770
the success of the open power foundation

00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:31,640
to align and grow the number of ISVs

00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:33,830
committed to the power architecture you

00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:36,110
know coming from Red Hat we have an

00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:40,960
office up in northern Massachusetts you

00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:43,940
know long history of Dec HPE employees

00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:46,520
that once all those got bought out and

00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:53,350
went out of business from Decca Compaq

00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:53,350
HPE they all ended that Red Hat

00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,779
so we get to hear a lot of stories from

00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:03,589
the people that have been around awhile

00:15:59,779 --> 00:16:06,709
around about alpha processing some say

00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:09,109
that architectural II it was the most

00:16:06,709 --> 00:16:10,369
advanced processor of its time could run

00:16:09,109 --> 00:16:13,399
circles around anything else out there

00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:17,299
had zero ecosystem outside of the

00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:19,339
compact deck ecosystem software partners

00:16:17,299 --> 00:16:21,709
weren't lining up to use it ultimately

00:16:19,339 --> 00:16:27,439
failed because you couldn't run anything

00:16:21,709 --> 00:16:29,329
on it outside of hp-ux the Itanium again

00:16:27,439 --> 00:16:31,069
it's a very similar story Intel built a

00:16:29,329 --> 00:16:33,139
very high performance architectural

00:16:31,069 --> 00:16:35,449
advanced chip if you weren't building

00:16:33,139 --> 00:16:36,829
your own custom applications there

00:16:35,449 --> 00:16:39,739
weren't lines of people outside of

00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:41,839
Microsoft that were running on the

00:16:39,739 --> 00:16:44,660
Itanium architecture it also helped

00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:46,579
cause that to ultimately dwindle in the

00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:49,160
market and not be as successful as Intel

00:16:46,579 --> 00:16:50,949
what of light we are seeing you know

00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:53,509
some great advancements with the power

00:16:50,949 --> 00:16:56,559
architecture with partners like sa P

00:16:53,509 --> 00:16:59,749
coming on board you know very large

00:16:56,559 --> 00:17:01,910
opportunities in the Big Data especially

00:16:59,749 --> 00:17:04,010
in the cognitive space as we have new

00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:06,769
companies new libraries new startups

00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:09,740
coming such as tensorflow cafe a torch

00:17:06,769 --> 00:17:11,779
all coming onboard with the mindset of

00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:13,010
open source from the start that we're

00:17:11,779 --> 00:17:15,470
already starting to build up an open

00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:17,029
source ecosystem around the power

00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:18,679
architecture and I think that we need to

00:17:17,029 --> 00:17:20,659
continue to maintain that and push that

00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:22,279
and use these opportunities for growth

00:17:20,659 --> 00:17:24,559
of where power is going to be successful

00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:26,899
to help us to continue to grow that is V

00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:28,549
ecosystem and that of course has to

00:17:26,899 --> 00:17:31,309
align with the enhancements that we see

00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:33,679
in the hardware capabilities making sure

00:17:31,309 --> 00:17:35,570
that we're taking advantage of Cappy NV

00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:37,580
link and V link to all the new

00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:39,350
capabilities coming onboard that has a

00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:41,299
combination of bringing in the right

00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:43,429
hardware partners aligning the right

00:17:41,299 --> 00:17:45,679
software partners that can leverage the

00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:47,659
hardware that ultimately is what builds

00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:50,090
up the ecosystem and I think that that's

00:17:47,659 --> 00:17:53,419
something that will be the critical

00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:57,260
success factor of open power and power

00:17:53,419 --> 00:17:59,630
as an architecture in general you know

00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:02,240
one quick slide just on you know red hat

00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:04,240
and your business what we try to do is

00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,590
you know red hat goes out of its way to

00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,389
drive stability flexibility and

00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:10,230
certainty in the mission critical

00:18:08,389 --> 00:18:12,390
application workloads that you

00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:14,070
that you provide so we continue to meet

00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:15,419
customer challenges with solutions such

00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:18,390
as container management container

00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:21,540
orchestration cloud management with

00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:23,880
OpenStack starting to get into the

00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:26,730
hybrid cloud mentality of running

00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:29,460
portions of your infrastructure on your

00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:31,410
local cloud as well as off in remote or

00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:33,780
public clouds and effectively managing

00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:36,450
that the same way as if everything we're

00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:38,490
on-site you know ability to have

00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:42,120
certainty that your mission-critical

00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:44,340
applications will continue to run that

00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:49,380
security fixes security patches are

00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:52,020
delivered in a timely manner and

00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:54,090
continue to push the boundaries of

00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:59,010
stability and performance for your

00:18:54,090 --> 00:19:00,360
customers and one of the key things to

00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:02,700
highlight as to why we're going to get

00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:06,840
why we feel we are going to see critical

00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:08,160
success in the HPC space is this is

00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:11,700
probably even higher now but going back

00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:13,980
to 2014 more than 97% of the top 500 in

00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:16,860
the supercomputing list are running some

00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:19,049
version of Linux and I think this is now

00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:23,309
up to all of the top 50 at this point

00:19:19,049 --> 00:19:26,100
are running Linux now definitely it's

00:19:23,309 --> 00:19:28,890
it's quickly becoming a linux only world

00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:30,450
in order to play in that space I could

00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:32,790
probably get a more recent source than

00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:34,919
something four years ago we know the the

00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:37,559
top 500 is coming up again and we have

00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:39,780
very big players that are coming in you

00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:42,540
know we see the new capabilities with

00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:44,520
what the coral labs are doing I think

00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:46,080
they have very very reasonable

00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:49,040
expectations to be number one on that

00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:52,350
list with what they're building with

00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:54,360
Sierra right isn't the new one summit

00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:58,350
yes I'm at in Sierra based on which lab

00:19:54,360 --> 00:20:00,049
you are and we you know had to mention

00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:02,820
of you know by one of the Oakridge

00:20:00,049 --> 00:20:04,650
presentations around the Titan which is

00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:08,160
their previous generation which is

00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:09,660
moving to the summit Oakridge Oakridge

00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:12,480
is moving to the summit supercomputing

00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:14,400
which is supposed to give I think double

00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,620
the performance at half or one-third of

00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,330
the total system capacity using the

00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:21,299
power nine architecture so great

00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:23,530
opportunities to drive forward and

00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:25,090
really take over the world of

00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:26,560
performance with a small number of

00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:29,040
systems that are incredibly high

00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,040
