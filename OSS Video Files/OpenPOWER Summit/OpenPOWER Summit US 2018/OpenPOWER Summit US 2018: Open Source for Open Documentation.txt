what we'll finish early you guys

00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:09,750
recording for what you care what you

00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:11,990
want what you do yeah no no yep all

00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,990
right

00:00:13,009 --> 00:00:21,270
so gentlemen welcome all three of you

00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:23,550
friendly faces one of the things about

00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:27,449
open power foundation not many people

00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:29,519
appreciate is the document

00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:31,529
infrastructure that we put in place and

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:35,550
that we continue to have in place out

00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:38,250
there and I'll give credit to actually

00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:40,320
the OpenStack foundation for where we

00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:43,680
discovered sort of the template for what

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,660
we're doing but this talk takes you

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,969
through what we're doing sort of from

00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:51,270
the high-level user interface aspects

00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:53,129
and dives down into at least how to go

00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:56,930
contribute and participate in the

00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:56,930
documentation development process the

00:00:57,109 --> 00:01:01,350
starting point for all documentation

00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:03,059
inside of the open power foundation is

00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:06,720
known as the resource catalog if you go

00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:08,430
up underneath technical resources off of

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,490
the open power foundation you'll

00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:16,280
literally in that pull down get a link

00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:19,890
to the resource catalog which gives you

00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:23,130
let's see if I can find the wrong way

00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:23,549
let's go back which ones the laser there

00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:26,610
we go

00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:29,340
gives you the ability to search on

00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:31,860
keywords on tags etc looking for just

00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:36,450
about any piece of documentation that's

00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:39,509
available multiple words in the search

00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:40,979
and it will cut sort of reminds me of

00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:43,229
Hadoop type searches it'll then real

00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:45,390
time start taking you and showing you

00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:47,340
results down below so when there's

00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:49,829
nothing that they throw in everything in

00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:52,049
some some order you can also do it via

00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:53,850
categorization a resource type of main

00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:55,500
category or subcategory across the top

00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:55,740
but if you don't know what those would

00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,100
be

00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:01,649
I typically just go to the to the search

00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:03,060
bar and start typing the documentation

00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:06,060
that are the name of the document or

00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:08,789
some something about it and that's where

00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:11,039
I start when you do find something for

00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:13,080
example the documentation development

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:15,090
guide turns out we've written a document

00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,160
for how to do documentation development

00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:20,550
inside of the open power foundation now

00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,870
the heritage for this guide was really

00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:24,360
it started out as sort of a template

00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:26,250
document you're inventing a group you're

00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,780
inventing a foundation you need a look

00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,940
and feel for how all of the

00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,349
documentation is going to look and so

00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:33,030
you start working on prettiest like

00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:34,860
what's the title page can look like

00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:38,250
what's the format of the various page is

00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:39,780
going to look like and so you may

00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:42,239
intermittently see this referred to as

00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:45,090
the template document as well it's also

00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,620
a great place to base a new document if

00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:49,099
you're going to build a new document

00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:51,510
from scratch it's a great place to start

00:02:49,099 --> 00:02:53,129
with this documentation development

00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:54,390
guide as it's rather short and has some

00:02:53,129 --> 00:02:56,519
great examples as I'll show you later

00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:58,260
it's a great place to get started as a

00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:00,450
document but if we are looking for that

00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:02,909
you could start by typing documentation

00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:05,280
development guide here up top you'll

00:03:02,909 --> 00:03:09,209
find it down here in the second item

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:12,060
when you click on that you get a summary

00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:13,920
sort of landing page we stick this

00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:17,430
intermediate landing page such that as

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:21,239
we Rev new versions of the document it

00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:23,430
always has a unique URL a unique landing

00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:25,260
place for all versions of that document

00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:28,890
so now we can publish things like where

00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:30,720
can I find my elf ABI v2 document you

00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:33,450
can publish that link and it will always

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:37,860
be the same independent of what versions

00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:40,049
roll off of that and then along with a

00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:42,540
description there is always a link to

00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:44,580
the document and I'll show you more

00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:46,019
directly this happens to link just to

00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:48,000
the in this instance I'm showing you

00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:50,519
just a PDF it actually takes you into

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,989
the HTML version from the HTML you can

00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:54,900
find the PDF I'll show you that a little

00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:58,459
bit later but that's the general way one

00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,459
finds documents decorous

00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:05,209
on the back no I don't believe so I

00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:08,510
don't know enough about what the search

00:04:05,209 --> 00:04:10,040
facility is behind it I'm gonna have to

00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:11,420
dig a little bit on that one but you

00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,940
know I'm making friends with the people

00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:16,579
doing this because Jeff and his training

00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:18,200
to me of how to be the new TSE chair ask

00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:21,079
me to go do something and of course I

00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:22,580
screwed it up and so I've been making

00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:24,280
friends with the people that implemented

00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:28,970
this so yeah it's an innocent question

00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:34,850
what am I gonna let Jeff retire I don't

00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:37,340
think it's my choice but correct answer

00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:39,320
right all right so that's how it works

00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:41,870
at a high level as I said what actually

00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:43,220
happens once you get into and click on

00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:44,990
let's go back one more time once you

00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:48,470
click on this link you really don't go

00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:51,650
directly to the PDF you go to the online

00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:53,630
version which is the HTML documentation

00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:56,900
so basically out of our documentation

00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:59,870
framework we're generating online HTML

00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:03,290
files you can go look stuff up in and a

00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:06,669
PDF off of it and so the PDF then

00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:09,410
basically comes off of the little

00:05:06,669 --> 00:05:12,410
Acrobat Reader little symbol up there

00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:14,360
takes you in your browser embedded to a

00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:17,419
PDF or you can of course download and

00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:20,240
see that as well this is a great example

00:05:17,419 --> 00:05:23,540
of the difference between the PDF on the

00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,610
page and what you would see in the HTML

00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:27,680
again this is all part of the framework

00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:30,350
that we had to generate in creating this

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:33,169
from scratch or porting it from the

00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:38,180
OpenStack environment all the CMS to

00:05:33,169 --> 00:05:39,950
build your CSS to build your indexes and

00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:41,660
your table of contents along the left

00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:42,800
and all the formatting is one of the

00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:44,930
things you get to go through as a

00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:48,680
foundation in a new environment being

00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:50,180
created from scratch so this is why pipe

00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,700
cleaner process the template document

00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:54,530
now has become the documentation

00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:57,080
development guide was very key to us in

00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:58,880
that process behind this is all

00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:01,550
open-source tooling if you're familiar

00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:05,510
with maven as a build environment if you

00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:08,210
love maven great this is a maven build

00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:11,150
environment it's all jha that's all java

00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:12,289
based the way maven basically works is

00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:14,119
they're our pom

00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:17,629
files think sort of the equivalent in a

00:06:14,119 --> 00:06:20,240
programming model of make files that can

00:06:17,629 --> 00:06:22,659
cascade and tear and ultimately maven

00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,949
builds are driven off of jar files

00:06:22,659 --> 00:06:26,839
described out on the Internet

00:06:24,949 --> 00:06:28,249
and so at some point you say this is

00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:30,020
this type of project and there's this

00:06:28,249 --> 00:06:32,539
jar file over there that describes how

00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:34,699
to build this and maven pulls all of

00:06:32,539 --> 00:06:36,889
that down for you if it's not on your

00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:38,419
system and then handles the build off of

00:06:36,889 --> 00:06:41,539
that I'll show you how to do that here a

00:06:38,419 --> 00:06:43,309
little bit later but I think you know

00:06:41,539 --> 00:06:45,979
one of the key parts again is look and

00:06:43,309 --> 00:06:49,639
feel good consistent environment across

00:06:45,979 --> 00:06:51,589
all the documents get HTML and PDF off

00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:55,849
of that in an accessible form all off of

00:06:51,589 --> 00:07:00,589
the resource catalog behind maven though

00:06:55,849 --> 00:07:03,770
maven is driving a doc buck build so we

00:07:00,589 --> 00:07:06,830
are actually doing documentation work in

00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:08,869
doc book think of it as like HTML

00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:13,099
basically right it's a it's it's an XML

00:07:08,869 --> 00:07:15,469
markup that means then if we're doing

00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:19,370
truly open source sort of documentation

00:07:15,469 --> 00:07:21,080
work we can create as we have done for

00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:26,300
the documentation development guide

00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:28,699
github repositories of source code for

00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:30,889
the document and so the github

00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:32,659
repository for the documentation

00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:35,749
development guide is out here at the

00:07:32,659 --> 00:07:37,759
open power foundation community the

00:07:35,749 --> 00:07:39,800
docks - template there's that template

00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:44,119
term I told you which appear from time

00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:46,279
to time is the actual project and there

00:07:44,119 --> 00:07:48,019
are now two sub directories but the

00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:49,819
actual documentation development guide

00:07:48,019 --> 00:07:52,969
is there in the template directory and

00:07:49,819 --> 00:07:56,689
you'll see the pom file sort of as that

00:07:52,969 --> 00:07:59,860
make file here that controls the build

00:07:56,689 --> 00:08:03,080
environment again publicly accessible

00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:04,490
repositories people can go work in you

00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,869
could you know if Lance wanted to go

00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:09,559
clone it while he's sitting here he

00:08:05,869 --> 00:08:12,740
could go pull it down and clone it we

00:08:09,559 --> 00:08:15,680
describe of course ways to interact with

00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:18,979
the community out in in the in the

00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:21,019
readme file and try to adopt such nice

00:08:18,979 --> 00:08:22,999
things as the Apache be to license where

00:08:21,019 --> 00:08:25,570
at all possible for sharing of this

00:08:22,999 --> 00:08:27,860
source and moving things around

00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:30,080
the other key aspect that gets

00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:31,520
introduced here is to build in any of

00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,349
this environment you have the project

00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,419
you're working on but you also need some

00:08:33,349 --> 00:08:37,550
common pieces and so you'll hear us talk

00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:40,430
about the dockmaster

00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:43,940
project that is where some of the key

00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:46,490
common pages like the common preface the

00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:48,529
common appendix and some of the key

00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:51,589
common things that you want in all

00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:52,910
documents reside so what you'll see as I

00:08:51,589 --> 00:08:55,430
take you to the steps of how to build

00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:58,490
this you actually the first time have to

00:08:55,430 --> 00:09:01,100
create or pull down or clone the docs

00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:02,600
master beside wherever your project is

00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:04,460
because these have to be in known places

00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,680
relate with respect to each other

00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:08,600
because these pom files start pointing

00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:10,550
at each other and the assumption is that

00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:14,390
the documents in Doc's template are

00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:17,180
looking up one and over a level to find

00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:22,700
their master pom file for the whole

00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:25,460
project so what does one do if if I were

00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:28,070
and and when I give the demo to people

00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:31,430
live to go build something it's really a

00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:33,200
simple five sets of steps and it's a

00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:36,560
little small out there but the slides

00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:38,600
are posted so you can go take a look at

00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41,209
them in detail the first thing you

00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:43,610
always do as I said when getting started

00:09:41,209 --> 00:09:47,180
in any of this environment is go clone

00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:52,190
the master directory that's simply a git

00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:55,490
clone right off of the common HTTP URL

00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:58,730
there no password necessary its public

00:09:55,490 --> 00:10:00,800
tree follow that up in this case get to

00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:02,270
build the documentation development

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:06,680
guide then you turn around and you clone

00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:08,420
that guide again very quick you see the

00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:12,380
two examples as I've done it over here

00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:14,120
on the right hand side step 3 albeit

00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:15,770
trivial is to go into the directory

00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,930
you're working on in this case it's

00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:21,890
Doc's template into the actual template

00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:24,290
subdirectory and then the last piece of

00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:28,610
this is predominantly kicking off the

00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:30,830
maven build now maven is a rather noisy

00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:33,320
build environment because you're layered

00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:37,130
upon layer of jars and pieces and so

00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:38,930
I've cut out a lot of the sort of noise

00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:40,880
that occurs here but you see

00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:43,790
that to kick-off the Maven build you

00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,830
simply do a maven generate sources and

00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:49,399
it goes out and that's how you build the

00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:52,610
world and get both h HTML and PDF out of

00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:54,470
that you'll notice as I said some some

00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:56,360
noise some information right up here at

00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:59,029
the top you start to get some warnings I

00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:00,860
snipped out some things this is a key

00:10:59,029 --> 00:11:02,720
transition point here with the info

00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:04,279
applying custom parameter is a shion's

00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,990
that's where it transitions from

00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:08,720
building the PDF which it builds first

00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:10,610
to then building the HTML files and you

00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:14,000
start seeing a whole bunch of parsing

00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:16,520
into various HTML files that reads out

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,970
after that a bigger your document the

00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:22,279
more HTML files it produces and so if

00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:24,740
you really want a PDF build simplest way

00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:26,330
is to just ctrl C after the info telling

00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:29,000
you it's transitioning or applying the

00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:30,770
custom parameterizations but it runs now

00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,870
the first time it runs I will warn you

00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:34,910
it goes out and pulls down a whole bunch

00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:36,470
of jar files I've had people complain

00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:38,300
about it taking depending upon your

00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:39,709
laptop and your bandwidth sometimes

00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:45,410
overnight that was Steve Monroe's

00:11:39,709 --> 00:11:47,120
experience somebody this past week said

00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:49,400
it took him 20 30 minutes to do the

00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,589
first build of the document they had a

00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:53,480
little bit better access but it does

00:11:51,589 --> 00:11:55,490
pull down bunches and bunches of stuff

00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,990
right up here early as it's starting to

00:11:55,490 --> 00:12:00,680
build things that first time you build

00:11:56,990 --> 00:12:03,500
it after that this particular document

00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:06,050
when it did complete took 31 seconds to

00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:08,270
build the PDF and HTML right here on my

00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:11,660
carbon x1 that's a couple generations

00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:13,520
old so relatively straightforward and

00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:15,680
simple some of our bigger Doc's might

00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:16,700
take a minute or two when I'm thinking

00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,180
of things that are a couple hundred

00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:23,350
pages long and it just depends upon how

00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:23,350
many pieces yeah Jeff

00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:37,620
yeah yeah thousand pages yeah yeah and

00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:40,260
most of that time is actually spent in

00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:42,540
the HTML creation on the back end the

00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:44,280
PDF generates very quickly but when you

00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:46,050
get to lots of pages it starts splitting

00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:48,660
that stuff out into individual HTML

00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:50,340
files and I'm sure you start to using

00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:52,290
some tools Paul could probably help us

00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:54,840
with start to see it back up on Io

00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:58,500
riding and and and waiting for for i/o

00:12:54,840 --> 00:13:00,510
action so yeah and then the last piece

00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:02,460
is really quite simply where do I find

00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:03,660
those nice generated files I created and

00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:06,060
it turns out you have to go down a

00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:07,440
couple levels you go into the target

00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:09,960
directory which is sort of where all

00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:12,900
pieces get created when you do the maven

00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:15,060
build and then you have to look into the

00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:18,030
doc book web help directory and whatever

00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:20,790
your project name in this case it's doc

00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:23,010
devel guide it's the only directory in

00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:26,670
there and when you go into that

00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:29,790
directory you will see the two key

00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:32,220
pieces there's your PDF the doctor valid

00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:35,930
with a date stamp on it

00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:39,120
and there's the index.html right there

00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:44,640
for the entry web page for where this

00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:50,420
begins so that's the simple environment

00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:54,750
that we're building documentation in for

00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:56,400
4.4 open power foundation now that's how

00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:58,050
easy it is to build the next question

00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:00,960
becomes how easy is it to do development

00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:04,020
in it well if I were to go in to the

00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:05,760
docs template directory or the the

00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:07,880
documentation development guide and

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:10,140
start looking at the various files

00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:12,720
chapter two of the documentation

00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:16,320
development guide was created by mr.

00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,790
Broun our retiring TSC chair as let me

00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,100
show you how to do a few things while I

00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:21,570
was playing around one day and turns out

00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:25,380
to be the most valuable director or

00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:29,070
valuable file in this whole project

00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:32,700
because he very nicely goes through all

00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:35,340
right let's create a a chapter let's

00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:37,830
create a section title let's do an

00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:38,640
itemized list let's go look at an

00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:42,300
ordered list

00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:44,190
well you you and I both know you always

00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:45,570
go to what something looks like in the

00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:48,300
end when you're doing these sorts of

00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:51,750
things and then go grep for the common

00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:54,240
piece of text such as example of

00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:55,800
itemized list and we can come over we

00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,570
can find the example of the itemized

00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:00,329
list and start to look at what the tags

00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:04,920
look like for an itemized list in

00:15:00,329 --> 00:15:07,560
docbook again very much like what HTML

00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:11,670
looks like yes it's in itemized lists

00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:16,290
versus an unordered list or a ul tag but

00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:18,630
very friendly tag language with closing

00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:21,600
out in the XML form with the slash to

00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:23,820
close out the tags and and syntax that

00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:29,310
you can readily go find for how to do

00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:30,959
such things so that's what we typically

00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:34,079
write in when we go create a new

00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:37,170
document we will take as an example

00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:39,269
perhaps this chapter example dot XML

00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:40,709
file and start hacking at it with your

00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:43,949
favorite editor I'm sure Chris uses

00:15:40,709 --> 00:15:48,360
Emacs because only real man use VI to do

00:15:43,949 --> 00:15:50,010
development with and there are all sorts

00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:53,899
of other ways you could do it Jeff he

00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:53,899
was kind of a GUI sort of guy so he'd uh

00:15:55,010 --> 00:16:02,880
but you know the net-net is you can look

00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:04,529
at this XML in any environment you want

00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,810
to it's just like writing code quite

00:16:04,529 --> 00:16:10,050
honestly and the compiler warning

00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:13,290
sometimes are just about as esoteric but

00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:14,850
it's very easy to find examples of what

00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:17,310
you need to do and that's what we try to

00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:23,519
set out in the documentation development

00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:25,829
guide in this example chapter there are

00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:28,620
numerous examples so what I've shown you

00:16:25,829 --> 00:16:31,019
is just the documentation development

00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:33,089
guide probably our greatest victory of

00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:37,320
this past year was getting the elf ABI

00:16:33,089 --> 00:16:39,779
v2 document over and running it is now

00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:41,880
up in the same form it actually is no

00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:46,589
longer private it is public so anybody

00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:48,060
again just like the docs template or the

00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:49,770
development document there the

00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:51,760
documentation development guide can go

00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:55,360
out pull the source and

00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:57,850
the elf v2 a bi document it's also out

00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,740
in the resource catalog as we're working

00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:02,410
on new updates and new generations of

00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:04,540
that then it will occur in git it'll be

00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:06,100
developed in an open-source way when we

00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:07,660
get ready to publish then we can start

00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:10,480
doing builds and posting them more

00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:12,220
formally as necessary and now we have

00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,770
documentation that can be managed by a

00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:17,709
community for the benefit of all people

00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:19,449
in the environment so that's that's

00:17:17,709 --> 00:17:21,880
probably our greatest success of this

00:17:19,449 --> 00:17:25,660
past year we are in the process of

00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:27,790
bringing over what was called the the

00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:30,970
papper specification for those of you

00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:32,410
that know deep development stuff or as

00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:35,040
we contribute it to the open power

00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:37,480
foundation the Linux on power

00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:39,160
architecture reference or low papper I

00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:40,840
don't remember exactly what what we

00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,760
ended up calling it we're in the process

00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,870
again of converting that splitting it

00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:46,000
out we're gonna break it into some

00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:48,010
pieces and turn them all into

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,710
open-source projects by the time we get

00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:51,760
done done with docbook and xml and you'd

00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:54,340
say well that's not very impressive

00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,929
except that this was the thousand page

00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:58,210
document that was in framemaker

00:17:55,929 --> 00:17:59,650
before we got started inside of IBM and

00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:01,510
this is what Jeff and I do in our free

00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:05,169
time is free these documents from

00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:08,799
framemaker to get them into doc book and

00:18:05,169 --> 00:18:10,090
and that's that's on the horizon of

00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:12,280
pieces that are going to be coming out

00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:14,350
here and be able to be managed again by

00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:17,890
a community and grow and develop from

00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:19,950
there Chris you can ask a question no go

00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:28,670
ahead

00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:28,670
yeah absolutely so stuff yeah

00:18:35,120 --> 00:19:01,790
well you can so you would so you want it

00:18:48,680 --> 00:19:04,760
without tags basically okay do you know

00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:06,680
Java do you know Java okay

00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:08,450
well I'm always looking for volunteers

00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:10,460
for how to extend this maven build

00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:14,500
project so this might be something we

00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:19,010
could we could take on you know they're

00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:20,480
there I could see some value in this it

00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:22,400
might very well be trivial

00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,290
you know the formatting of how do you

00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,120
get it to you know when do you wrap the

00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:29,090
line and said I'm sure somebody's done

00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:31,910
it and we could certainly hang it if I

00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:33,590
go back to one of the directories we

00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:36,620
could absolutely hang it you know out

00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:38,180
here in raw text form off of there just

00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:44,180
as easily as well would you envision one

00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:46,310
big text file okay yeah and somebody's

00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:48,320
probably already done this in the maven

00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:50,330
environment because you know maven is it

00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,310
can do everything including you know

00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:56,480
solve world hunger and create world

00:19:52,310 --> 00:20:00,290
peace at the same time so yo unsure it's

00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:03,200
just a matter of finding the time to hit

00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:03,860
it right so but no that's that that's a

00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:08,570
good point

00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:11,870
good point there's always something no

00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:15,050
it's good so so a few other additional

00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:17,320
thoughts and comments here particularly

00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:20,720
in the documentation development guide

00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:22,640
we walk you through how to install the

00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:26,210
tools that you need to do this right

00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:28,190
maven what else that's on there we take

00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:30,260
you through the little bit deeper dive

00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:31,850
into the document project structure

00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:33,830
right I told you Doc's master needed to

00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:35,660
be beside Docs template we walk you

00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:37,940
through sort of why that is and the

00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:39,530
palme files and those things we walk you

00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:41,150
through step by step how if I'm going to

00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:45,440
create a new document from scratch I

00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:47,810
could copy something and do that I also

00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,740
have a whole section that comes from you

00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:51,780
know weeks

00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:54,090
years of therapy trying to debug things

00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:55,380
so I've tried to put hints and tips when

00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:57,200
you get this error what it's really

00:20:55,380 --> 00:21:01,020
trying to tell you where you look

00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:03,060
etcetera and we walk through from an

00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:04,530
open power foundation what are the steps

00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:07,500
to get a document published through the

00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:09,480
open power foundation the steps the

00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:12,060
reviews the approvals those sorts of

00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:15,870
things and then as I mentioned chapter 2

00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:18,360
is the set of examples that Jeff has

00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:20,010
Jeff started and every time we find a

00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:22,080
new example we stick it in there

00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:23,880
somebody says hey how do you do this if

00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:26,160
it isn't in chapter 2 I make sure it

00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:29,550
ends up there but the time gets answered

00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:32,850
so and then let's see is it here oh so

00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:34,530
so final thoughts on this you know we

00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:36,330
really are as a foundation committed to

00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:39,000
open and that goes to the documentation

00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:40,530
as well being able to build this but you

00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,450
can build it on your Mac you can build

00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:43,920
it even on Windows although it's a

00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:46,850
little bit more painful it's certainly

00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:50,640
an environment tune to working in a

00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:52,290
Linux type environment the document that

00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,910
I took you through how to pull how to

00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:55,500
build this documentation development

00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:56,460
guide its goal in life is to answer all

00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:59,580
those questions as to how you

00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:01,830
participate and what we've been able to

00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:03,780
create out of that looks great right I

00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:05,370
mean it gives us a good foot forward

00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:07,500
from the open power foundation these

00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:09,840
documents look almost professionally

00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:11,280
done they're available off the web yes

00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,750
it would be nice to have it in raw text

00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:16,770
form thank you for volunteering to help

00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:18,960
us with that Chris and and the key part

00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:20,490
is remember the resource catalog you'd

00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,200
be surprised at how many people don't

00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:24,570
know where the resource catalog is off

00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:27,030
of the open power foundation and we're

00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:28,530
always looking for volunteers and just

00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:30,480
so you feel like we're really thinking

00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:32,460
about other things that that the piece

00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:36,330
that I didn't write down here that it

00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:38,520
actually is the next side effect of this

00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:42,390
sort of environment is the minute you

00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:44,040
can do open source documentation the

00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:46,050
next thing you want to do of course is

00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:47,280
build two versions of the documents from

00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:49,320
two different tags or two different

00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:52,980
directories and mark it up and be able

00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:56,160
to tell the difference and Jeff and I

00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:57,480
mostly have that problem solved we have

00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:00,570
a set of tooling that we've been working

00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:02,040
on to do that so that you don't have to

00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:05,010
stick tags

00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:07,020
trees as you build it and that's where

00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:08,610
we're headed and as we get those tools a

00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:10,140
little bit better state will make those

00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:12,120
tools available for people to use in the

00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:13,350
foundation right now they're just we use

00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:15,000
it because we're working with all of the

00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,810
documentation people but that's the goal

00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,510
of where we're headed

00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:20,460
version X version y be able to create

00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:22,230
version Z that's the diff between the to

00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:24,630
see what was added see what was removed

00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:28,560
and never once have to touch the tree

00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:30,510
for anything more than maybe a tag or

00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:32,100
you know maybe if you want to make some

00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:34,620
changes after you're done but never have

00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:36,330
to go turn on tags and enable and

00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:38,280
disable tags like we used to have to do

00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:41,690
in the in the old days so this

00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:45,150
ultimately ends up in a very nice

00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:47,370
environment that models code in the end

00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:49,320
you could put it into CI CD sorts of

00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:51,060
environments and do a lot of automated

00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:53,190
things off of this when we get done so

00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:54,870
we're not done thinking here I like the

00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:58,320
text file idea we're working on the

00:23:54,870 --> 00:24:00,470
change change idea that's mostly done so

00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:03,270
you know we'll get read on your project

00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:06,170
as soon as you show up in the TSC will

00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:06,170
yeah

00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:12,940
yeah

00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:16,720
I don't know where I put the main pages

00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:25,870
but I would take that I would take the

00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:28,420
raw text I could see that yeah so what I

00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:31,480
do with images what do I do with images

00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:39,750
in the raw text law just link to the

00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:39,750
thing okay

00:24:58,059 --> 00:25:06,690
hmm okay cool okay all right yelling

00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:06,690
sure

00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:17,590
yep yeah and and actually that's yet

00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:19,360
another project we have underway turns

00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:25,090
out if you follow OpenStack I think they

00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:27,160
went to rst relax structure text one of

00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:31,030
the markdown languages the real answer

00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:33,120
to that question is a lot of the I was

00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:35,650
in say crap is that allowed to put in a

00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:38,680
lot of the stuff were bringing in in the

00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:43,950
documents that come in come in with

00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:48,220
tables and things that don't do well in

00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:49,840
markdown and I've had a guy internally

00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:51,430
want to take the document that we were

00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,900
talking about that was thousands of

00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:55,840
pages and said he was going to take it

00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:57,070
to rst and I laughed at him and said you

00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:59,440
wouldn't believe all the problems we've

00:25:57,070 --> 00:26:01,420
had with tables even in doc book and doc

00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:03,640
book you can do just about everything

00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:06,970
right and wrong associated with tables

00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:09,040
in the language and so doc book works

00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:13,090
very well and gives us a lot of control

00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:14,740
it is not the it's better for ID writers

00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:18,580
more seeing if people have done a little

00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:21,490
more writing than developers now what we

00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:23,050
have done if you go out to open - power

00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:24,640
the firmware communities that Stewart

00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:27,730
and others playing they're working in

00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:30,280
rst I am working on the ability to go

00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:33,310
from rst to doc book and publish this

00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:35,020
way I had one attempt using a set of

00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:38,140
tools that just had too many assumptions

00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:41,050
in it and I have a second attempt that's

00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:42,700
been created and so my goal would be to

00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:45,910
support two environments right for the

00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:47,830
basic things support rst and support doc

00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:50,370
book by the time we get done so it's a

00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:50,370
good question

00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:59,100
okay

00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:08,599
yeah my problem was that like I said

00:27:04,729 --> 00:27:10,519
these tables weren't even in CSV form so

00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:13,429
they were they were pretty ugly and we

00:27:10,519 --> 00:27:15,049
said Jeff will concur we spent a lot of

00:27:13,429 --> 00:27:17,779
time with tables in this environment so

00:27:15,049 --> 00:27:20,409
and if you really want to get engaged

00:27:17,779 --> 00:27:23,389
think about change bars inside of tables

00:27:20,409 --> 00:27:26,509
all that hurts some point doesn't it

00:27:23,389 --> 00:27:28,239
Jeff that's what we're up to but thank

00:27:26,509 --> 00:27:30,829
you for the questions good dialogue

00:27:28,239 --> 00:27:34,329
appreciate that and hopefully enjoy the

00:27:30,829 --> 00:27:34,329
rest of your summit okay

00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:39,529
