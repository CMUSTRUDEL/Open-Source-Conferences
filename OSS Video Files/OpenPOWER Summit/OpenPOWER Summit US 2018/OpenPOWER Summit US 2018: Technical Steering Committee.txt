	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,680
a good morning my name is Jeff Brown

00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:06,930
I've been the chair of the technical

00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:11,250
steering committee now just a little

00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:14,580
over four years and it is my distinct

00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:17,490
pleasure to announce that our newly

00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:23,090
introduced our newly elected TSC chair

00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:23,090
Jeff she'll congratulate thank you see

00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:27,869
Jeff is gonna give us a he's gonna spend

00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:30,599
some time and talk a little bad bad a

00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:32,279
little bit about himself introduce

00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:34,610
himself a little better he's going to

00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:37,680
talk about what we've done in the TSC

00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:39,809
and where we hope to be going so again

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,360
congratulations Jeff thank you sir

00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:45,629
before you go mister talaq do you have

00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:51,480
something you'd like to say to Jeff you

00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:52,980
have gotta be kidding me yeah I figured

00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,110
did we just want to tell me you're fired

00:00:52,980 --> 00:01:09,299
and don't let the door hit you on the

00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:12,810
way out and guess which one I want to

00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:15,600
take a few minutes really to recognize

00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:18,150
Jeff Jeff has been a fixture in the open

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,740
power foundation since his charter in

00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:23,909
fact he's helped create the Charter

00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:30,360
we're talking 2012 in the closet with

00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:32,790
Brad and others in others and in working

00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:35,369
with our founding members to put

00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:36,689
together the open power foundation in

00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:38,479
addition to that he defined the

00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:40,950
technical steering committee

00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:43,320
responsibilities he scoped it to find it

00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:46,890
was elected as the technical steering

00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:49,530
committee chairman he served that since

00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:53,250
August of 2013 until today so four and a

00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:55,290
half years remarkable impact and

00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:58,969
leadership he served admirably on the

00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:02,399
board of directors during that time so

00:01:58,969 --> 00:02:05,009
Jeff so on behalf Ardley the opening

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:08,550
Power Board of Directors we created a

00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:10,750
first ever award we're gonna call the

00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:17,650
open power all-stars award Oh

00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:23,470
and that's for you thank you now you get

00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:24,180
up all right I'm too bad Jeff I gave it

00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:30,040
away

00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:32,560
thank you box so Jeff's no stranger

00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:34,270
either Jeff Jeff was also a part of the

00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,160
the chartering of the OPA power

00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:38,950
foundation so it's really going into

00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,320
really good hands when Brad talked about

00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:43,360
the opens software stack broken firmware

00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:46,120
stack open BMC Hugh mentioned it as well

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,700
Jeff was the lead strategist of that and

00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:50,500
not only that he's also our workgroup

00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:52,510
chairman for the system software route

00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:55,030
group so he's been with us along the way

00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:57,550
from the beginning so with that I'd like

00:02:55,030 --> 00:03:00,790
to present to you the title of open

00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:03,850
powered TSC chairman present you my hand

00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:10,450
of good luck in graduations I know you

00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:14,950
do fine job all right I feel a little

00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:16,600
bit like Leno following Carson I think

00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:20,050
the bar has been set a little high here

00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:21,670
but certainly let me say it's it's a

00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:23,170
wonderful opportunity I'm looking

00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:25,690
forward to what we're going to do here I

00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:28,150
think Bryan's covered mostly my

00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:29,950
background here I would simplify it to

00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:32,440
one additional thought beyond helping

00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:34,810
with early open power foundation work

00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:37,540
I was probably the crazy guy inside IBM

00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:39,370
doing Linux on power that really enabled

00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:41,560
where we are today so while Brad's

00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:43,690
excited about the hardware ecosystem and

00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:46,030
what we've created here I get excited

00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:47,500
and get the chills over the software

00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:53,410
ecosystem that we've built on top of

00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:54,970
open power as well little bit of review

00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:57,010
and a little bit of history where does

00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:59,050
the TSC fit in here not nearly as cool

00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:00,370
as Moira's discussion of all the great

00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:02,470
things they're doing with open power

00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:03,519
here but just a little bit of history

00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:05,350
where does the technical steering

00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,260
committee fit of course the foundation

00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:10,870
is about open collaboration performance

00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:13,810
all of those good things but the TSC is

00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:16,720
really about blending that vision from

00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:18,669
the board of directors into all of the

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,489
working groups and making sure that

00:04:18,669 --> 00:04:22,720
we're executing and accomplishing really

00:04:21,489 --> 00:04:25,000
good

00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,470
so we are the glue the technical

00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,199
steering committee is the glue that

00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:31,479
holds together all of the workgroups and

00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:35,729
all of the good deliverables that we've

00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:39,280
had so if we look at how 2017 went

00:04:35,729 --> 00:04:42,849
pretty incredible year of work products

00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:46,840
that came out of all of our various work

00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:49,270
groups I would be remiss if I didn't

00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:51,970
call out a few of these probably most

00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:55,870
exciting is we developed version two of

00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:58,599
the open power ready criteria which says

00:04:55,870 --> 00:05:02,979
now vendors partners folks like yourself

00:04:58,599 --> 00:05:06,039
can qualify open power ready components

00:05:02,979 --> 00:05:08,650
and take those forward recently approved

00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:11,319
at the workgroup level went through the

00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:13,690
review headed off in final form to the

00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:15,129
TSC and board so I mean you even see

00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:18,340
that it's footnoted there at the bottom

00:05:15,129 --> 00:05:21,190
on the left-hand side of the slide also

00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:23,770
in there a lot of good compliance work

00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:26,699
we've had a focus out of our work groups

00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:29,199
of putting together specifications and

00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:31,389
test Suites to be able to prove

00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:35,080
compliance so we're starting to go from

00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:38,440
talking are you ready to are you headed

00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:40,060
towards compliance at various levels so

00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:43,029
that's been a focus for us from the TSC

00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:46,000
and inside of the workgroups also

00:05:43,029 --> 00:05:48,729
associated with power 9 we have the 20

00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,340
feet 25 gig i/o as Brad was talking

00:05:48,729 --> 00:05:54,250
about all of that great memory bus and

00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:55,930
i/o bus performance coming out that's

00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:59,259
fundamentally comes out of the work

00:05:55,930 --> 00:06:02,379
that's done in the 25 25 gig IO

00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:04,300
workgroup and will be the foundation for

00:06:02,379 --> 00:06:06,969
the open capi work in the protocol

00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:10,270
sitting on top of it so wonderful

00:06:06,969 --> 00:06:13,529
wonderful work on the left-hand side and

00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:15,879
plenty of good work in progress more

00:06:13,529 --> 00:06:19,180
specifications more workgroup notes

00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:22,060
coming out of all of our environments

00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:24,819
and my job as the TSC chair is to keep

00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:29,169
them moving forward and keep them making

00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:32,020
good progress so we've been working over

00:06:29,169 --> 00:06:34,540
the last couple working meetings of the

00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:36,670
TSC on what are our goals

00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:38,620
looking forward where we headed there

00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:41,770
marked draft goals if I were to

00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:44,740
summarize them it's about two aspects we

00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:48,610
want a driving excitement and we'll want

00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:50,110
to drive participation we tried to put

00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:53,010
those into two buckets we're thinking

00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:55,450
about them in two ways

00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:57,580
obviously aspirational those those

00:06:55,450 --> 00:07:00,130
motivational things we want to do we're

00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:03,190
feeling like we need this concept of a

00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:05,830
moonshot be nice to use that to try and

00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:07,810
boost and energize our ecosystem both

00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:09,850
hardware and software ecosystem so our

00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:12,190
ideas are coming together watch us for

00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:13,630
that hopefully we'll come up with

00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:16,150
something really good there that'll get

00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:18,550
people enthused to a new level to go

00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:21,400
with our product announce and continue

00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:25,180
to grow our ecosystem also want to

00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:27,130
encourage the work and the work group

00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:29,410
products continue the workgroups to

00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:31,120
create more work product and do more

00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:33,120
with the work products we've created as

00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:37,930
well so that's sort of a second

00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:40,270
aspiration for us operationally like to

00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:41,680
challenge each of the work groups to

00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:44,230
start thinking about what they could do

00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,870
at a workgroup level as well to get

00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:49,120
energized identify one sort of exciting

00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:50,620
project you know Brad mentioned open BMC

00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,350
is one of our probably greatest

00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:55,710
successes I would certainly say that

00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:58,390
started as an idea

00:07:55,710 --> 00:08:01,540
early on in open power somebody said

00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:04,240
maybe we should go work on open BMC type

00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:05,800
firmware and next thing we know two

00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,140
three years down the road everybody's

00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,580
gathered around it it's growing and it's

00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:11,290
a wonderful and vibrant community

00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:13,420
hopefully each of these workgroups can

00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:15,820
find such an activity be it a

00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:19,470
specification be it a work group

00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:24,340
activity that will enthuse and energize

00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:26,470
their activities and we want to

00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:29,080
contemplate possibly some new things

00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:32,140
about how we can engage and get credit

00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:34,090
for all of our activity inside of the

00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:36,640
the ecosystem and these these become

00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:38,290
great discussions between the TSC

00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:41,020
between the board between all of our

00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:42,370
workgroups so interesting new thoughts

00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:45,340
on where we're headed with our goals not

00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:47,350
yet approved but hey what a draft goals

00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,839
for but to discuss and see where we can

00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:52,139
go

00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:54,300
fire to wrap up and summarize what we'd

00:08:52,139 --> 00:08:57,690
like to do I guess that's it I thought

00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:59,310
it was one more slide in it oh well with

00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:01,260
that thank you very much

00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:06,930
enjoy the rest of your summit and the

00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:10,889
rest of our speakers this is the cutting

00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:13,440
edge this is the IBM power system AC 922

00:09:10,889 --> 00:09:15,209
this is not your ordinary server this is

00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,589
faster than a cheetah strapped to a race

00:09:15,209 --> 00:09:19,019
car that strapped to a rocket that

00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:20,699
strapped in an even bigger rocket the

00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:22,920
cutting edge has a built-in accelerator

00:09:20,699 --> 00:09:25,110
that uses GPUs to crush the heaviest

00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:27,660
data loads and with the NVIDIA env Lang

00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:29,250
PCIe gen 4 and open Caffey it could

00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:30,930
deliver six and nine point five times

power AC 9:22 that has AI processing

00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:39,449
speeds of 300 petaflop and on the way to

00:09:37,949 --> 00:09:41,760
exascale that's about three hundred

00:09:39,449 --> 00:09:43,500
quadrillion calculations per second the

00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,240
cutting edge is taking your AI to the

00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,790
world's largest buffet of data and

00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:49,740
challenging it to an eating contest it

00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:51,029
boots AI deep learning framework

00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:53,699
performance three point eight times

00:09:51,029 --> 00:09:55,860
faster than x86 which makes enterprise

00:09:53,699 --> 00:09:56,730
AI smarter and more powerful than the

00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,870
competition

00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:00,060
the cutting edge
