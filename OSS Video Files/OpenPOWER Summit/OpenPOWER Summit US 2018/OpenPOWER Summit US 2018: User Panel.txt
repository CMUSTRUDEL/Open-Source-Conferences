[Music]

00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:13,230
all right good morning good morning so

00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:16,519
this this is the last agenda item you

00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,519
guys can turn the music off if you want

00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:20,430
[Music]

00:00:18,439 --> 00:00:25,230
they can turn the music off

00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:27,840
one second Alex so thank you oh so this

00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:29,429
is the last panel or the last agenda

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,019
item before lunch but this is a really

00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:33,120
important agenda item just like the rest

00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:35,040
because you've heard from end users like

00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,899
Google and Oregon State and and the

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,760
coral labs like Oak Ridge we're gonna

00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:40,260
take you through a panel of end users

00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,610
here so I'm going to invite up Alex is

00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:44,160
already decided to come up on stage

00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:49,260
we've got Brian from Allegiant Air and

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:51,390
then we've got Leo from NIM Vic's if you

00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,520
guys want to sit well what we're doing

00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:55,770
that you notice is only three panelists

00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,329
you know whenever you do a demo usually

00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:59,730
there's always almost always a technical

00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:01,680
glitch okay so this is like a demo we

00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:04,199
had technical glitch which is cancelled

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,369
air travel so we're gonna try to do

00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:07,260
something we've got three of them that

00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:09,750
I'll talk about myself some of the

00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,250
things going on and then we've got one

00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:16,020
other then we're gonna try to do a Skype

00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:18,330
audio with limelight with Kevin from

00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:20,100
limelight and see how that works as one

00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:21,450
of our panelists here so since you guys

00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,280
all sat down there

00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:26,189
I guess I'll come over here so I'm not

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,750
sitting far from you all right good

00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:29,549
so and by the way you're gonna have to

00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:31,920
help me on when we're ready to do the

00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:36,540
Skype thing how that's gonna work so

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:39,960
I'll start with with you Alex from an

00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:41,790
uber perspective we heard just hurt and

00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,850
Jack about all the exciting things going

00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:45,840
on at Oakridge and the fact that you

00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:47,850
know basically they're going to be

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,729
delivering in this summer one of the

00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:53,909
largest supercomputers in the world

00:01:49,729 --> 00:01:55,320
4,600 servers over 27,000 GPUs this is

00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:57,210
going to be a major event in the

00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,520
industry I know that you guys are

00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:00,869
working closely with Oakridge and with

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,790
the summit computer doing a lot of

00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:04,140
interesting things on open power you've

00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,909
got an initiative and a program and

00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,869
going on there tell us a little bit more

00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:09,690
about what's going on with the hore

00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:12,569
Avadh initiative sure so we've been

00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:14,939
introduced to a team at Oakridge doing

00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:19,170
blurting and applying it to fundamental

00:02:14,939 --> 00:02:20,969
research and physics in that case this

00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:23,549
team has infinite amount of data which

00:02:20,969 --> 00:02:25,590
they can generate on the fly so it makes

00:02:23,549 --> 00:02:27,659
total sense for them to scale their

00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:30,269
training to unprecedented amount of

00:02:27,659 --> 00:02:32,969
compute resources at uber we build

00:02:30,269 --> 00:02:35,700
horrible a library for distributing deep

00:02:32,969 --> 00:02:37,620
learning frameworks what makes it

00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:40,500
super-easy for researchers to go from

00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:43,680
single GPU training to training using

00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:46,709
large cluster or a large supercomputer

00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,689
in this case before tools like hora what

00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:52,290
what would happen is your researchers

00:02:48,689 --> 00:02:53,760
would run multiple experiments oh and

00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:56,370
using small amount of compute devices

00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:59,430
each and they would just wait for them

00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:01,620
to complete maybe for a few days but

00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:03,239
it's much more efficient to actually run

00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:05,069
them to run those experiments

00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:06,900
sequentially using more computer

00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:09,060
resources but faster because then you

00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:11,099
can take into account what happened

00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:13,250
during all the prior experiments and

00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:16,469
pose your next experiment in more

00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:19,590
knowledgeable way so because of that

00:03:16,469 --> 00:03:23,099
we're very excited to see team at

00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:24,750
Oakridge apply our technique to their

00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:27,479
problem and use our open source software

00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:31,049
to scale their deep learning to the

00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:33,959
scale of summit where belief it will

00:03:31,049 --> 00:03:36,299
help to utilize the computer resources

00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:38,909
more efficiently and get scientific

00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:41,729
results faster very good thank you

00:03:38,909 --> 00:03:44,189
so why then is in your mind summit and

00:03:41,729 --> 00:03:47,090
power nine a good combination for her

00:03:44,189 --> 00:03:49,530
about surely it's excellent combination

00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:51,650
when summit is fully commissioned it

00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:55,259
will have as was mentioned more than

00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:57,090
27,000 GPUs as that will be latest

00:03:55,259 --> 00:04:00,269
generation GP from Nvidia in latest

00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:02,819
generation power processors in FP 16

00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:06,269
mode they will actually have each trip

00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:08,370
you will have 120 teraflops or as they

00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:10,680
call tensor teraflops so if you do the

00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:15,599
math the system has peak performance of

00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:17,250
3 exaflop as such this training has the

00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:19,440
chance of becoming one of the first

00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:22,409
exascale deep learning we're close if

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,880
not the first good good and look forward

00:04:22,409 --> 00:04:25,710
to hearing more about what Hooper's

00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,400
gonna do with this and how hopefully in

00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:30,060
the future there's

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:31,620
or use of the capabilities to add and

00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:33,060
improve productivity at over this is

00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:36,780
really exciting what you guys are doing

00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:37,889
definitely thank you before we move on

00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:39,240
to one of the other panelists I do want

00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:40,620
to make another comment about another

00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,650
hyperscale are out there if you guys

00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:45,630
want to throw up the ten cent chart and

00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:48,090
they made a lot of comments about this

00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:50,639
at the open power summit in China in

00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:52,410
December where they have deployed is

00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,840
another major hyper scale data center

00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:56,789
they've deployed a lot of open power

00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,910
capability they deployed another set of

00:04:56,789 --> 00:05:02,340
adoption of open power technology last

00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:04,229
late last year and they've stated

00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:06,090
publicly you know the the fact that it's

00:05:04,229 --> 00:05:08,160
driving efficiency improvements of more

00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:10,919
than 30 percent on performance with

00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,470
third at the same time with 30% less

00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:15,030
rack and server resources so very

00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:18,630
significant of the benefits they've

00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:20,010
achieved from open power also you guys

00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:23,580
may have heard in the past that there

00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:26,250
was a major contest the $0.10 one where

00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:29,099
they set for world records on big data

00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:30,900
analysis is pterosaur contest in using

00:05:29,099 --> 00:05:33,199
open power servers so a very big

00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:36,389
initiative and we look forward as a

00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:39,810
organization open power IBM in all of

00:05:36,389 --> 00:05:42,240
our partners to continue to drive more

00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:44,190
benefits to $0.10 and also to that the

00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,960
broader hyper scale community so I

00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:47,849
wanted a add that isn't in the comment I

00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,930
think Stu to you Alex for joining us as

00:05:47,849 --> 00:05:51,960
well

00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:54,300
the other thing I wanted to do was talk

00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:58,260
about how this transitions into the

00:05:54,300 --> 00:06:01,650
cloud so we've got Leo here from NIMH

00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:03,960
bik's doing a lot of stuff with open

00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:06,060
power in the cloud we spoke earlier

00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:09,300
about it you know you're starting to see

00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:11,340
some high demand tell us a little bit

00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:13,110
and elaborate on the types of use cases

00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:14,789
you're seeing in Nimbus around

00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:18,150
leveraging the open power capabilities

00:06:14,789 --> 00:06:19,460
sure so first and foremost is going to

00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:21,870
be deep learning machine learning

00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:24,630
obviously you know we've we've talked

00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:26,310
about the NV link and the the InfiniBand

00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:29,280
capabilities of these boxes of these

00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:31,470
systems being just a tremendous

00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,810
advantage to being able to get data into

00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:35,490
the GPUs so obviously that brings you

00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:37,529
know so that's on the hardware so I'm a

00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:38,789
software side the power AI that was

00:06:37,529 --> 00:06:40,000
actually mentioned in the last panel as

00:06:38,789 --> 00:06:43,060
well

00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,650
that was a you know a huge reason why we

00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:45,940
were able to not just deploy these

00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:47,290
systems bring in the market but actually

00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:48,820
immediately had customers on them

00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:50,320
because they didn't have to figure out

00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:51,820
how to get the the frameworks ported

00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:54,280
that was already done by IBM which is

00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:55,600
fantastic second to that you know we're

00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,880
seeing things like accelerated analytics

00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:00,100
or GPU accelerated database use kind of

00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:03,100
like the map D the kinetic eyes of the

00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:04,840
world and and then finally you know we

00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:08,130
do see some bioinformatics and more

00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:10,630
traditional HPC type use cases very good

00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:14,230
we've heard from Brad earlier we heard

00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:18,190
from from Maura we heard from Oregon

00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:21,430
State we heard from even Oakridge a lot

00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:24,100
about how critical acceleration is right

00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:28,960
and you look at the capabilities of open

00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:31,420
copy of PCI gen4 of NV link to you know

00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,610
in your cloud delivery model how are you

00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:35,230
guys exploit exploiting and accelerating

00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:37,900
those kinds of things to enable

00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:39,760
differentiation and advantage that's a

00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:42,250
great question so first of all our

00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:43,870
customers so we differentiate in general

00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:46,570
in the market in the sense that we only

00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:48,820
do advanced computing use cases so we

00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:51,430
you know our cloud is purpose built from

00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:53,260
the ground up in the sense that you know

00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:56,320
it's native InfiniBand fabric throughout

00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:58,180
so most of the stuff that we run in our

00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,860
cloud is is going to be either highly

00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:01,300
parallel or it's going to require a lot

00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:03,070
of bandwidth to get you know if you're

00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:06,460
doing GPU type stuff to get stuff in and

00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:07,870
out GPUs so for us it was really not

00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:10,360
that interesting to just kind of take a

00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:12,850
box and put a bunch of PCI enabled you

00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:14,560
know p100 s and it the the the entire

00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:18,370
architecture was very key to being able

00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,900
to do the types of you know the types of

00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:21,340
machine learning that actually requires

00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:23,500
you know large amounts of data being

00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:25,540
moved in and out of the GPUs so that's

00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,890
we see that differently than what some

00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:28,570
of the other cloud providers actually do

00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:31,330
and then of course because we already

00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:33,190
had the InfiniBand fabric now when

00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:36,250
distributed deep learning came out in

00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:38,260
power a I it was actually really easy to

00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:39,850
scale that out with an HPC like

00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:42,190
architecture which is which we thought

00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:44,170
was you know both innovative and and

00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:45,520
simple because if you look at the way

00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:46,840
that you write these algorithms for

00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,490
example in tensorflow they're no

00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:52,090
different whether you're using a single

00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:54,490
GPU you're using say 200 GPUs so we felt

00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:56,650
that was a great at

00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:58,360
and and you know justjust that allows us

00:08:56,650 --> 00:09:00,430
to differentiate versus just kind of

00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:02,380
selling GPU capacity which we just don't

00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:03,850
think is is that's more of a commodity

00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:05,920
use case that we're just not as

00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:07,120
interested in yeah that sounds great

00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,850
we love what you're really doing there

00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,350
and it's the fact that your model your

00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:12,700
cloud delivery models bring it in so

00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:14,410
many different customers from so many

00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:16,360
different industries including hyper

00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:18,490
scalars that are actively leveraging

00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,600
that in your cloud environment to to get

00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:22,210
those those advantages in that

00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,560
differentiation in a different model

00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:25,330
than your traditional on-prem mean

00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:27,910
that's a really good opportunity there

00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:30,090
in fact iBM is doing some things here to

00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:32,650
to try to help with that we've put a

00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:34,000
Developer Program in place we were

00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:35,860
investing in making it easy for

00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,860
developers to go and access an on-ramp

00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:40,150
timox and we've you guys will hear more

00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:41,290
about that as you go through this

00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:44,050
afternoon you look at the technical

00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:45,610
stuff going on upstairs and a lot more

00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:47,380
about that coming but we're real excited

00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:48,820
about that from that perspective as well

00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:50,050
so thank you for joining us we really do

00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:52,570
appreciate it and for everything you

00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:55,120
doing with open power thank you so and

00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:57,250
since we're on the cloud theme I want to

00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:00,430
also get you guys to put the next slide

00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:04,630
up another provider this it's not here

00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:06,850
today but Ally cloud the cloud arm of

00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:09,100
Alibaba is also doing some stuff with

00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:11,500
open power they're making open power

00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:14,500
servers available in there Ali X dragon

00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:17,350
cloud platform and they announced at the

00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:19,090
December summit in China that they've

00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:21,070
made that available for pilot programs

00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:23,920
and they're they're asking customers to

00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:24,960
go on to the cloud and and really you

00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,190
know

00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:28,960
you know really hit the hit-the hit-the

00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:30,910
hit-the keyboard on it and really test

00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,920
it out and they're gonna use that to

00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:34,540
help them figure out the best way to

00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:36,700
move that from pilot into a more

00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:38,290
production deployment model so we're

00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,220
really excited about what ally cloud is

00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:41,050
doing there and they've they've made

00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:42,820
statements about how quick and efficient

00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:45,310
it was to put that particular

00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:47,410
environment together another example of

00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:49,600
the ease of moving into the open power

00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:52,090
environment so another another guy that

00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,010
can't be here but was blessed us it gave

00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:55,950
us the blessing of being able to talk

00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:59,830
about what they're doing there as well

00:10:55,950 --> 00:11:02,800
so let's let's move my next my next one

00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:04,600
was supposed to be limelight you maybe I

00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,330
should just go to Allegiant first and

00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:09,420
then see just you want to do limelight

00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:11,980
all right let's see if this works so

00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:15,610
let's move from cloud to the global

00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:18,070
private network limelight is one of the

00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:20,019
world's largest fastest content delivery

00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:22,209
network solution providers for all

00:11:20,019 --> 00:11:27,779
content delivery providers guys that do

00:11:22,209 --> 00:11:30,430
a lot of streaming is is Kevin there

00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:32,200
yeah I can't thanks Kevin sorry about

00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:37,810
your technical difficulties with your

00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:39,940
flight great great thanks for joining us

00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:41,290
and so if you could take us through a

00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:43,390
little bit of why open power

00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:47,279
technologies are a better solution for

00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:51,339
your CDN clients sure so we have a

00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:53,440
scale-out workload and what we found is

00:11:51,339 --> 00:11:56,800
we bump it up against the limits of

00:11:53,440 --> 00:12:00,700
other architectures in terms of memory

00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:03,640
bandwidth and i/o bandwidth and what we

00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:06,370
looked at the power tip we saw these

00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:07,899
things work you know 2x or more or

00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:11,800
greater than we could get another

00:12:07,899 --> 00:12:15,930
platform so we're interested in that

00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:15,930
from an efficiency perspective and

00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:20,560
basically it allows us to provide a

00:12:18,339 --> 00:12:26,920
better quality of experience and expand

00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:29,770
our network faster this system very good

00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:32,250
and now obviously you know TCO is

00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:34,480
critical to our ability to demonstrate

00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:37,589
differentiation and and in the in

00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:40,029
penetration deployment success but also

00:12:37,589 --> 00:12:42,250
Kevin open is in Krita is critical

00:12:40,029 --> 00:12:43,899
having an open ecosystem and being able

00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:45,310
to leverage open technologies could you

00:12:43,899 --> 00:12:47,680
take us through a little bit more of why

00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:50,010
that's something that is is advantageous

00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:52,390
and beneficial for you in your company

00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:55,270
sure there's some interesting challenges

00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:59,079
we have we're in 138 data centers around

00:12:55,270 --> 00:13:01,089
the world and basically that's a big

00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:04,360
logistics puzzle to where we need to get

00:13:01,089 --> 00:13:06,550
machines into you different geopolitical

00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:10,839
regions with taxes and things like that

00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:15,100
so we like to excuse Modi gems that have

00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:16,130
the ability to do to these things and we

00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:19,340
found

00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:29,560
guts are already addressing some of the

00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:32,120
speeds with beer would you still there

00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:35,490
yes I'm okay I know if you pause there

00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:36,730
if we had technical difficulty sorry

00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:44,870
[Music]

00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:48,250
okay we done just that we're able to use

00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:51,230
our different ODMs on the hardware side

00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:55,160
on the ecosystem side I guess I would

00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:57,170
expand that we like the open BMC and

00:13:55,160 --> 00:14:00,080
things like that we're obviously having

00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:04,250
users of remote management with all

00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:05,660
these sites it costs a bundle of money

00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:08,930
to have somebody go

00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:11,180
you know reroute the machine or have to

00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:12,860
go recover a machine so whenever we can

00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:16,190
do two things remotely it helps our

00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:19,130
operations group out and we're all so

00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:21,640
impressed by IBM's depth of talent on

00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:24,950
the firmware teams on the girl teams

00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:28,040
what challenge and where we're providing

00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:32,450
some community leadership is we run a

00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:35,360
free SD kernel and having to kind of

00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:36,830
navigate through the or we've got power

00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,440
up and running and right now we're

00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:42,680
trying to digest we can get power and

00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,810
line up and running on that forum very

00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:47,360
good yeah we're really excited about the

00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:49,070
types of content delivery networks and

00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:52,730
those particular types of clients that

00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:55,280
you guys can bring to the to to the open

00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:57,650
power community here anything you can

00:14:55,280 --> 00:15:02,980
say about the types of clients that that

00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:06,530
you guys are engaged with our website

00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:10,100
that people could go reference on the

00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:12,230
backside on software development we're

00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:14,690
technology partners with Netflix and

00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:19,520
we're working on the network stack and

00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:22,700
tcp/ip stack with them and I can say

00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:25,130
that we're both interested in moving

00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:26,480
open power forward and seeing if it is

00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:31,279
the long term it

00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:33,139
we desire okay very good all right thank

00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:35,739
you Kevin and thank you for joining us

00:15:33,139 --> 00:15:37,519
sorry about the flight difficulties but

00:15:35,739 --> 00:15:41,359
appreciate you being able to do this

00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:43,759
over the phone yeah thanks a lot okay so

00:15:41,359 --> 00:15:48,709
let's go back to the room so Brian

00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:50,809
Allegiant Air so you guys are using open

00:15:48,709 --> 00:15:53,629
power capabilities for data serving and

00:15:50,809 --> 00:15:55,669
working it out with things like db2 and

00:15:53,629 --> 00:15:57,559
Redis can you take us through a little

00:15:55,669 --> 00:15:59,449
bit more around the workloads and and

00:15:57,559 --> 00:16:00,799
why this is this is benef why do you see

00:15:59,449 --> 00:16:02,869
that the benefits of open power with

00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:05,329
those workloads yeah for sure thanks for

00:16:02,869 --> 00:16:07,100
having us a few years ago we were kind

00:16:05,329 --> 00:16:08,739
of at an inflection point when it came

00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:10,819
to the technology where we were using

00:16:08,739 --> 00:16:13,790
both on the hardware side and the

00:16:10,819 --> 00:16:15,379
software side we were actually

00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:18,079
considering moving away from power

00:16:15,379 --> 00:16:19,579
systems and from db2 in general but we

00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,720
were fortunate enough to get aligned

00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:24,889
with some of the folks who are working

00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:27,529
on the early power 8 systems after a

00:16:24,889 --> 00:16:29,209
pretty lengthy let's say shootout if you

00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:31,459
will we found that the price to

00:16:29,209 --> 00:16:34,189
performance ratio was great for our

00:16:31,459 --> 00:16:36,429
systems we ended up going with power

00:16:34,189 --> 00:16:39,169
eight backed with flash storage

00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:43,819
initially and I think we ended up seeing

00:16:39,169 --> 00:16:45,529
basically a game or lack of loss in

00:16:43,819 --> 00:16:50,209
revenue close to 700 thousand dollars

00:16:45,529 --> 00:16:52,910
over an x86 solution since then we have

00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:55,279
been able to really expand our data

00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:57,949
collection if you will a lot of cloud

00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:59,600
and API based solutions and we found

00:16:57,949 --> 00:17:01,789
that the power systems have just been

00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,610
really great and actually pushing this

00:17:01,789 --> 00:17:07,639
data in particular as we move forward to

00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:08,959
no sequel solutions like Redis we're

00:17:07,639 --> 00:17:11,240
doing a bunch of stuff with Cloudant as

00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,799
well and we just find that these systems

00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:15,649
have really stood up to the workloads

00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:17,269
very good in that context what do you

00:17:15,649 --> 00:17:19,789
what do you see is the next exciting

00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:21,620
things doing between Alli Legion and

00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:22,339
open power as far as where you see this

00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:24,049
going for you

00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:26,089
yeah it's machine learning and AI I

00:17:24,049 --> 00:17:27,529
think that's the buzz that is going to

00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:30,470
be going around think and this

00:17:27,529 --> 00:17:32,020
conference this week so we're pretty

00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:34,660
heavily

00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:37,780
putting our investments words working on

00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:38,800
conversational AI and basically the idea

00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:41,590
of being able to solve some

00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:43,750
human-computer interaction problems so

00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:45,910
that our customers can sort of buy more

00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:49,060
stuff and and have more successful

00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:50,470
travel and we see power nine with the

00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,880
GPU acceleration and some of the

00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:53,560
technology we've been talking about as

00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,280
something that will help us get there

00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,750
for sure

00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:57,670
excellent thank you you guys have been a

00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:59,560
great partner of the open power

00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:01,360
community and we very much appreciate it

00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:06,520
thanks very good

00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:10,450
so there we go all of them we're not

00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:11,830
done yet though so you know there's

00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:14,080
another partner who couldn't be here

00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:15,160
that was was gave us the blessing to

00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,860
talk about what they're doing a little

00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:20,500
bit so if you guys already put that up

00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:22,540
PayPal so they're another player that's

00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:25,600
actually actively out there leveraging

00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:27,970
open power and the IBM power systems in

00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,500
the deep learning research space and

00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:31,690
they're focused on using it for fraud

00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:34,330
detection problems and they see the

00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:35,920
value as a you heard Brad first thing

00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:38,140
this morning of unlocking the

00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:41,590
computation power in this case with

00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:44,050
extra large data sets and the ability we

00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:46,270
have with coherency the the memory

00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:48,190
bandwidth the i/o bandwidth to be able

00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:50,260
to do that in the power architecture in

00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:52,210
a way that is accelerated significantly

00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:53,650
accelerated they're seeing the value of

00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:55,150
that and they're taking that fraud

00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:56,800
detection or that fraud prevention

00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:58,960
capability and incorporating it

00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:01,900
themselves so we're excited about them

00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:05,440
as another end user leveraging the the

00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:06,760
competencies of open power so I think I

00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:10,420
think we're running out of time and I

00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:14,320
think everybody's getting hungry here so

00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:18,640
first of all my thanks to Kevin Brian

00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:21,010
Leo Alex for joining us here my thanks

00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:23,050
to all the key know ders all the

00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:24,880
panelists that we've had today and my

00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:26,290
thanks to even the the guys that

00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,750
couldn't be here ten cent Alibaba

00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:30,340
PayPal for providing us the the

00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:33,190
capability to be able to talk about what

00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:35,380
they're doing as well and I think the

00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:37,990
audience for joining us for this part of

00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:39,580
the event you know if anybody's

00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:40,990
interested in joining open power there

00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:43,840
are many different ways to do it for

00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:45,789
those that are here you know evaluating

00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,350
there's the enterprise there's AI is

00:19:45,789 --> 00:19:50,139
these there's there's academic there's

00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:51,970
individual membership etc and we ask you

00:19:50,139 --> 00:19:54,960
to go this afternoon take a look at what

00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:56,679
we've got the 30 or so technical

00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,840
sessions that are there this afternoon

00:19:56,679 --> 00:20:00,789
the tradeshow capabilities we've got the

00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:02,590
reveals that you saw previously and

00:20:00,789 --> 00:20:03,970
everything else the birds of a feather

00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:06,279
and so forth that are going to be this

00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:08,919
afternoon so with that again my thanks

00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:10,029
to all of our partners here and I think

00:20:08,919 --> 00:20:12,390
we're gonna break for lunch

00:20:10,029 --> 00:20:14,150
correct okay thanks everybody

00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:18,119
