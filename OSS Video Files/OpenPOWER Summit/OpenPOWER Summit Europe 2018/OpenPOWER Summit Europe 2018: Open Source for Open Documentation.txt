	00:00:01,429 --> 00:00:06,870
today's topic is actually one that

00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,910
sometimes I think gets undervalued a

00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:11,610
little bit in the open power foundation

00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:12,870
right I mean we hear comments about all

00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:14,610
we need more documentation we need more

00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:19,920
documentation and and one of the

00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:23,279
initiatives as new TSC chair that i've

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,109
been concerned about since when i got

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,539
involved even as the system software

00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:30,029
workgroup chair was how do we present

00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:32,940
our documentation how do we work on our

00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:37,680
documentation and and what does it look

00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:40,469
like and so that is really the focus of

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,480
today's is giving you a feel for where

00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:44,480
it is what is it and then how does one

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,800
begin developing in this world because

00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,500
with the open power foundation being

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,300
committed to open source and open source

00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,250
activities it only makes sense if you're

00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:55,079
going to do documentation that you have

00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:56,579
control over that documentation and do

00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:58,680
it in an open source fashion so

00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:00,120
sometimes the documentation gets

00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,370
forgotten about is anything more than a

00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,780
PDF hopefully will show you that there's

00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:05,760
more to that than this story and

00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,320
certainly then it's a way of recruiting

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,869
people when they say oh we don't have

00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:12,780
the right documentation or we don't have

00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:14,850
good documentation give me a patch it

00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:17,790
becomes the answer to for documentation

00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:18,990
so I am Jeff she'll chair the technical

00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:22,080
steering committee and we'll be talking

00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:23,729
about open source documentation and how

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:28,020
do we do that inside of the foundation

00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:30,060
just out of curiosity and you guys

00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:32,670
familiar with the resource catalog if I

00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,079
if I describe if I use that phrase does

00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:37,439
that mean anything to you from an open

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:39,360
power foundation perspective I see if I

00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,680
see one head going sideways well I'm

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,460
going one going up and down that's

00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:47,299
that's one more than I usually get the

00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:50,850
answer to all documentation questions

00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:53,939
begins in the resource catalog off of

00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:55,640
the open power foundation website and

00:01:53,939 --> 00:02:00,540
I'm gonna stop here real quickly just

00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:03,360
flip over and show you where that is on

00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:04,950
the open power foundation page and how

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,819
you get there so this is what it looks

00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:12,050
like today the way you find the resource

00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:13,840
catalog is you go over to technical and

00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:18,150
in that

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:20,440
you resource catalog is down there now

00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:22,870
someday hopefully that'll simply be a

00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:24,519
list of documentation I've clicked on

00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:26,140
the resource I have a tab of the

00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:28,239
resource catalog and I'll walk you

00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:32,319
through this it's a little bit more

00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:33,549
difficult to find the documentation than

00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,250
we were like this is a little more

00:02:33,549 --> 00:02:38,019
search engine I would really like in the

00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:40,239
in the long-range vision to simply have

00:02:38,019 --> 00:02:41,560
a list of documents you go down and say

00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,450
that's the one I want

00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:47,200
but the resource catalog is our

00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:52,420
mechanism for generally managing these

00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:55,000
things today so let's go back here go

00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:57,459
page down one so so the resource catalog

00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,970
link mentioned up there takes you to

00:02:57,459 --> 00:03:03,069
that page where as I've sort of cut out

00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:08,410
you have this ability to search all

00:03:03,069 --> 00:03:11,739
documents the key document that we work

00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:13,269
with here out of the resource catalog is

00:03:11,739 --> 00:03:15,459
what we call the documentation

00:03:13,269 --> 00:03:17,940
development guide it is a document

00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:22,329
telling you how to develop documents

00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:25,720
inside of the foundation and so to get

00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:28,180
there you go to that search window that

00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:29,980
we had you type in documentation

00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:32,410
development guide you get a list that

00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:34,870
gets dynamically built at the bottom for

00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:36,790
you think a dupe search underneath the

00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:41,109
covers you know as you're typing in your

00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:42,940
information you click on that you get a

00:03:41,109 --> 00:03:46,060
landing page for the document that

00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:48,459
describes really what's going on in it

00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:50,560
it categorizes it for you and gives you

00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:53,169
a link then essentially to the

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:56,230
documentation environment whatever

00:03:53,169 --> 00:04:02,010
document is in general our documentation

00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:05,560
development guide title page looks like

00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:08,260
the right-hand side there ironically

00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:10,989
that's one of the things creating your

00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:12,819
own foundation requires you to do is

00:04:10,989 --> 00:04:14,859
what is your documentation going to look

00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:18,250
like and the heritage of this

00:04:14,859 --> 00:04:20,889
documentation development guide is it is

00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:23,200
both how to develop documentation and

00:04:20,889 --> 00:04:25,000
the first document we did to decide how

00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:27,490
we wanted this stuff to look and behave

00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,380
and so it is the

00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:34,080
starting point for all good things

00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:36,550
associated with doing documentation so

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,020
it turns out if you actually click on

00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:40,180
the link I'll go back one more time you

00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:42,759
click on this link here that says hey

00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:45,400
here's the link to the guide you don't

00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:47,229
get directly to the PDF to begin with we

00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:51,009
generate documentation in two different

00:04:47,229 --> 00:04:54,280
forms an HTML online form and the PDF as

00:04:51,009 --> 00:04:57,190
well we tie those two together by

00:04:54,280 --> 00:05:00,099
basically sending you to the online

00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:03,130
document and then giving you a nice

00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:07,289
little Adobe Acrobat icon there that

00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:12,159
then takes you into the actual document

00:05:07,289 --> 00:05:14,280
now that's the output what most people

00:05:12,159 --> 00:05:18,690
don't understand is what's behind that

00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:23,669
what's behind that is really doc book

00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:25,690
doc book is an XML language DTD

00:05:23,669 --> 00:05:28,930
specification whatever you want to call

00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:33,430
it for defining how to generate

00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:35,740
documentation looks very much like HTML

00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:38,560
so that means it's tagged looks like

00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:40,750
html5 starting tag ending tag with the

00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,690
slap backslash we'll show you some of

00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:47,020
that

00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:50,710
so it's XML based all the source code

00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:54,550
for all of our documentation that is

00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:59,620
both HTML and PDF is available in git

00:05:54,550 --> 00:06:02,620
repositories therefore one can go in do

00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:04,539
the typical geek thing hacker thing I'm

00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:06,310
grepping for a phrase look it's in this

00:06:04,539 --> 00:06:08,889
file that's wrong let's make the

00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:11,110
correction let's submit the patch get it

00:06:08,889 --> 00:06:14,409
in and it's done so it gets treated like

00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:16,569
most code development projects the way

00:06:14,409 --> 00:06:18,789
we do the builds and manage the builds

00:06:16,569 --> 00:06:22,900
is by a maven open source tooling

00:06:18,789 --> 00:06:27,190
associated with generating HTML and PDFs

00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:29,139
and a variety of other things with can't

00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:32,469
think of the right it's like XSL style

00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:34,960
sheets that sit on top of the build

00:06:32,469 --> 00:06:37,599
environment to style how you want the

00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:40,150
doc book done which basically says

00:06:37,599 --> 00:06:40,960
you're using all open-source tooling to

00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:43,449
work on open so

00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:47,560
code to generate the output for what we

00:06:43,449 --> 00:06:50,860
are doing so that's the overview you see

00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:52,539
that for example out of chapter one here

00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:55,120
in the documentation development guide

00:06:52,539 --> 00:06:57,759
you will get formatting that looks like

00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:00,009
this whereby you can go next in previous

00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:02,199
like one would expect to interact and

00:07:00,009 --> 00:07:05,289
yet you also then end up with the

00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:07,960
equivalent sort of capability in a PDF

00:07:05,289 --> 00:07:10,120
form very nice way in a doc book

00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:12,240
environment to control what your outputs

00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:14,320
are going to look like in either

00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,150
environments and keep it consistent

00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:18,580
right the real benefit is the more

00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:21,220
documents you have the greater

00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:23,110
probability they're going to diverge and

00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:26,020
how they get styled if you're not using

00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:28,479
careful tooling and you don't want that

00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:32,110
diverging because in some sense this is

00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:34,419
your brand this is how people perceive

00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:38,110
the documentation and perceive your

00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:40,090
foundation so so that's the overview

00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:42,699
that's what the documentation

00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:45,400
development guide sort of as is an

00:07:42,699 --> 00:07:48,789
example of at this point but let's dive

00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:52,599
a little bit deeper into how does this

00:07:48,789 --> 00:07:55,659
work so if you go out to github to the

00:07:52,599 --> 00:08:01,960
open power foundation family or

00:07:55,659 --> 00:08:05,949
community most of what I show you falls

00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:08,169
out of this Docs template directory but

00:08:05,949 --> 00:08:10,030
there really are two projects you need

00:08:08,169 --> 00:08:13,180
to care about for about 30 seconds

00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:15,190
before you get going and that is it

00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:17,710
turns out if you're gonna provide a

00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:20,139
common look and feel and common

00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:23,169
frontmatter and manner in a document you

00:08:20,139 --> 00:08:26,080
probably need some master information

00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:27,669
lying around and so when you get started

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,759
the first time you will need to

00:08:27,669 --> 00:08:33,450
replicate that look and feel and then

00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:37,450
for the sake of all other environments

00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:39,669
you can jump into your project in this

00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:42,729
case I'll show it to you out of Doc's

00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:44,560
template and show you how that works

00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:46,390
both are great examples because they're

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,029
also public repositories they're they're

00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:50,470
out there anybody can go look at them

00:08:48,029 --> 00:08:53,050
and so when you get the PDF you can you

00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:55,950
can take a look go see and if you

00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:58,089
find something misspelled go ahead

00:08:55,950 --> 00:09:00,430
submit the patch to spell it correctly

00:08:58,089 --> 00:09:02,019
and then you know I'll sit on it do what

00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:03,730
a typical community maintainer would do

00:09:02,019 --> 00:09:06,640
I'll sit on it ignore it and let you

00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:11,529
ping me about five times and then maybe

00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:14,740
maybe tip well we'll see let's see well

00:09:11,529 --> 00:09:17,980
try it we'll make trades Chris so then

00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:19,660
if one looks into sort of what's in

00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:22,829
github here's a couple pictures of it

00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:25,750
right it looks like any other github

00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:28,089
with good license files and of course a

00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:30,130
good readme and we've tried to for most

00:09:28,089 --> 00:09:32,529
of our open power foundation communities

00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:34,779
give you clear sort of description of

00:09:32,529 --> 00:09:36,610
what we're doing what licenses you're

00:09:34,779 --> 00:09:39,670
working under how we want you to behave

00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:42,670
what contributions process looks like

00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:45,010
etcetera and on this particular one it's

00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:47,620
not been updated here we've also built a

00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:49,269
video that describes how you go through

00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:51,760
and build a source as well so largely

00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:53,560
what this talk is about we've recorded a

00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,899
video linked it off the website as to

00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:57,430
how does one actually work in this

00:09:55,899 --> 00:09:58,870
environment and it includes all the

00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:01,120
details we're going to sort of step

00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:03,459
through here in the few remaining slides

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,529
so at the top level surface it looks

00:10:03,459 --> 00:10:10,560
like really any other good open source

00:10:05,529 --> 00:10:13,630
project how do we actually do a build I

00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,520
mentioned there were two projects you

00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:18,190
needed to care about for any given build

00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:20,350
the first is the master document that

00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:21,910
common look and feel you simply have to

00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:26,079
clone that in your working directory

00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:28,390
once as you get started then you clone

00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:33,820
whatever project you want to build

00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:35,320
that's over here in the next one in this

00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:37,149
case we're using the documentation

00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:39,339
development guide a very good way to get

00:10:37,149 --> 00:10:43,630
started it's there it's public you can

00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:45,730
clone both as this shows you then go

00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:46,870
into the working directory where you

00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:48,699
want to do the build of the

00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:51,399
documentation that's in our Doc's

00:10:48,699 --> 00:10:53,829
template the template directory and you

00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:57,100
kick off the maven build which is

00:10:53,829 --> 00:11:00,640
essentially maven plus generate sources

00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:02,860
as your one command as you redo things

00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,510
there's another sort of parameter you

00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:05,980
intermittently will put on there a clean

00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:07,330
a maven clean

00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:10,480
hell I can make clean before you

00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:12,490
actually make something may even has the

00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,930
same concept so often times if I made a

00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:16,300
rating through things I'll do a maven

00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:18,850
clean generate sources all in the same

00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:21,010
command line clean it up rebuild it go

00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:22,300
take a look at what happens and then the

00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:24,240
interesting question becomes where do I

00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:26,380
go to get information

00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,180
maven builds everything in this

00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:31,510
environment into a target directory

00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:34,300
sticks it always independent of which

00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:37,090
projects in the docbook slash web help

00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:40,660
and then however your project has been

00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:43,060
named in all the configuration files you

00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:45,090
will go into that file and I'll show you

00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:48,160
what that looks like but essentially

00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:51,730
cutting out some verbose messages you

00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:54,400
can do all of that the first time maybe

00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:57,550
20 minutes that sounds like wow that's a

00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:59,590
long time to build for a document that's

00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:01,480
probably on the order 20 25 minutes

00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:06,220
second build is on the order of a minute

00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:10,770
or two off my laptop so it's all open

00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:14,140
source code builds can build on your own

00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:16,810
and that's how this world works so

00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:21,100
that's how we build let me take you one

00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:23,410
more step deeper and this is a little

00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:25,900
small so I think I may flip over I'll

00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:28,180
just give you a real summary so a real

00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:33,160
quick summary when one gets into a

00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:36,400
project directory the main book file we

00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:39,400
try to always sub prefix with book

00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:42,040
underscore main it then includes

00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:45,250
generally references or include type

00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:47,730
statements for each of the chapters and

00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:50,980
it can be a hierarchy that continues so

00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:52,840
if we go to chapter 2 in the

00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:54,670
documentation development guide the

00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:57,160
first chapter is all about how do I work

00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:58,840
in this environment chapter 2 is can I

00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:02,410
give you a bunch of examples of things

00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:04,410
in doc book that I might want to do so I

00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:07,300
can go in and look at the source and

00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:09,360
copy and tweak to get to where I really

00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:11,980
want my document to do so

00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:14,800
chapter 2 is a whole bunch of

00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:17,590
documentation examples that is in the

00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,970
chapter example dot XML file and you

00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:22,329
begin to see for the first

00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:23,769
time--what source code looks like we see

00:13:22,329 --> 00:13:26,110
for the chat you know we have a chapter

00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:28,839
tag if we go to the end of that file

00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:31,120
you'd see the closing chapter tag we

00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:32,319
have a title documentation examples

00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,360
we'll look what that you know that

00:13:32,319 --> 00:13:36,399
matches what you're gonna going to title

00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:39,550
the document we open up a section

00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:41,829
section has a title tag section title

00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:44,560
goes here that's what it looks like on

00:13:41,829 --> 00:13:46,360
the output side I'm gonna start a

00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,470
paragraph here's an example of an

00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:50,439
itemized list

00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:53,040
I'll see section covers something of

00:13:50,439 --> 00:13:55,959
interest blah blah blah blah blah

00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:59,560
subsection again with the title example

00:13:55,959 --> 00:14:01,720
itemized list we start to see tags that

00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:03,759
start to look at look like things we'd

00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:05,829
expect and if you've ever worked or

00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:08,139
looked at an HTML web page some of these

00:14:05,829 --> 00:14:12,550
things start to look quite similar it

00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:15,959
might be Oh L in HTML it's ordered lists

00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:19,779
in doc book so you you will start to see

00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:21,819
those sorts of examples so let's go in

00:14:19,779 --> 00:14:26,290
and just blow it up a little bit here

00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:30,100
and show you a few things in a little

00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:32,819
more detail okay so here again is the

00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:37,180
main landing page for these documents

00:14:32,819 --> 00:14:39,480
this when you click on the link to the

00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:45,040
document brings you in

00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:51,269
if we go up sorry come back if we go to

00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:51,269
chapter 1.1 here where we were looking

00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:56,860
get it sorry we are in chapter 2 with

00:14:54,459 --> 00:14:59,829
the documentation examples we see that

00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:01,569
we also have and and these look a little

00:14:59,829 --> 00:15:06,759
odd because they really don't have much

00:15:01,569 --> 00:15:09,730
content on the HTML side but you start

00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:13,959
to see how you can get the HTML

00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:17,910
equivalent of what we had in the PDF

00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:22,029
side over here documentation examples

00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:24,430
it's just chunked into into small web

00:15:22,029 --> 00:15:28,389
pages so here are the examples if we

00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:31,029
come back to the source code then here

00:15:28,389 --> 00:15:32,079
is that same source code so just as I

00:15:31,029 --> 00:15:35,679
said

00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:37,420
the chapter tags at the top if we jump

00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:42,449
to the bottom of this we see that

00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:47,019
there's a mart an ending chapter tag and

00:15:42,449 --> 00:15:51,040
this document then contains all of these

00:15:47,019 --> 00:15:54,089
tags help the Maven and the Apache foe

00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:56,879
project generate the right output here

00:15:54,089 --> 00:16:01,299
so the sorts of examples we give you

00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:05,860
itemized list ordered list a variable

00:16:01,299 --> 00:16:09,429
list how do i embed a graphic how do I

00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:11,980
build a table how do I do special things

00:16:09,429 --> 00:16:17,999
like merging cells in a table

00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:17,999
horizontally how do I do that vertically

00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:23,739
how do I do cross references in

00:16:21,429 --> 00:16:26,019
footnotes citations I mean it just gets

00:16:23,739 --> 00:16:30,129
more and more specialized in things we

00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:35,799
want to do again the nice thing about

00:16:30,129 --> 00:16:39,399
that is if you have the example document

00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:42,279
and say oh wow I want to embed a graphic

00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:44,649
I don't know how to do that you have the

00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:48,670
documentation development guide here you

00:16:44,649 --> 00:16:50,860
also have the source what was the the

00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:53,139
title of the graphic is example figure

00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:58,379
let's go into the source here in this

00:16:53,139 --> 00:17:05,279
chapter file and let's look for example

00:16:58,379 --> 00:17:08,020
figure so we see here at the beginning

00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:09,220
so here's how you embed a graphic let's

00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:11,770
just make sure it's the right thing

00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:14,829
here's how you embed the graphic so we

00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:17,409
see we have our paragraph tag we end the

00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:19,899
paragraph we start into our figure and

00:17:17,409 --> 00:17:23,049
these are the sorts of objects we need

00:17:19,899 --> 00:17:25,779
to fill in to do a figure of course it

00:17:23,049 --> 00:17:29,889
has a title as a couple other things

00:17:25,779 --> 00:17:32,350
that ultimately resolve down to where is

00:17:29,889 --> 00:17:34,659
the item we want to include and how do

00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:36,460
we want to format it and the rest of it

00:17:34,659 --> 00:17:39,880
is just tags around it to make sure it's

00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:41,590
going to appear the right way so again

00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:44,650
the documentation development guide

00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:48,809
shows you how to do common things

00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:52,480
and a little more complex things and

00:17:48,809 --> 00:17:54,970
this is all generating what we would

00:17:52,480 --> 00:18:03,490
consider pretty good-looking output in

00:17:54,970 --> 00:18:11,860
both HTML in PDF form so that's how you

00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:13,540
build that's what you get that's where

00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:17,020
you get help is the documentation

00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:19,240
development guide and then the question

00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:23,860
becomes so what else is out there what

00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:28,679
else are we building this way well other

00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:31,090
examples that come out of particular

00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:32,980
workgroups I'm familiar with like the

00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:36,340
system software workgroup is the elf ABI

00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:39,840
documentation now is all owned by the

00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:42,700
foundation and managed in this fashion

00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:45,720
the accelerator workgroup has several

00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:49,990
documents anybody familiar with papper

00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:52,570
the big monster IBM document 4 how do

00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:54,400
you describe the interfaces we have a

00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:56,410
Linux subset a papper that we've

00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,210
contributed to the open power foundation

00:18:56,410 --> 00:19:00,640
and we're on the verge of contributing

00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:04,179
in pieces to do this that's up to date

00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:07,210
and so we've been taking control of all

00:19:04,179 --> 00:19:08,980
the documents we get contributed to the

00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:11,980
foundation and getting them into the

00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:15,370
form not always easy when documentation

00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:17,470
comes out IBM get them into a form where

00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:21,429
just like I've shown you it's doc book

00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:24,429
tags generates HTML and PDF out managed

00:19:21,429 --> 00:19:26,710
through github built with maven to give

00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:28,510
the foundation key look and feel

00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:32,679
associated with the documentation around

00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:34,990
it just several examples so that's what

00:19:32,679 --> 00:19:36,490
we've been up to if you want to

00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:38,950
contribute to any of the project you

00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:40,179
certainly start by working on the public

00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:43,510
ones that are out in the open power

00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:45,130
foundation the elf ABI says it's private

00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:47,020
there it has now been approved it is

00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:49,600
public you can go see the source code

00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:52,059
for the elf ABI tells you right up front

00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,590
in the abstract area there's a mailing

00:19:52,059 --> 00:19:55,450
list behind it if you want to make

00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:57,550
changes you want to propose things send

00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:58,360
it to that mailing list start

00:19:57,550 --> 00:20:00,520
interacting with

00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:02,950
folks behind it they're always looking

00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:05,050
for clean up etc clean up ideas

00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:07,800
questions that come out of this sections

00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:10,300
a little ambiguous relative to something

00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:11,920
so that's how you can find the public

00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:14,050
stuff you don't need my help to get

00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:15,580
involved in the public activities but

00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:17,350
there is a whole set of private

00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:18,850
activities especially for the closed

00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:20,350
work groups where there aren't public

00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:22,960
work groups their foundation only work

00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:24,760
groups a lot of those communities like I

00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,460
was saying accelerator work groups one

00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:30,370
of those they have documentation same

00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:32,650
environment just not public trees you

00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:34,870
know so so the goal here is to be very

00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:38,070
collaborative treat documentation as

00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:42,400
source code allow developers to

00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:44,260
basically contribute to this and in the

00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,210
broader vision the final question that

00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:49,480
might come out of out of people that

00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:51,790
work like with the open - power opal ski

00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:53,920
boot those sorts of people if you've

00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:59,470
looked at any of their documentation it

00:20:53,920 --> 00:21:05,470
is all what's what's the project it's

00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:07,960
built out of it's not rst it it's it's

00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:12,550
one of the you know the new markdown

00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:15,100
language is a lot simpler language they

00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:17,290
have their own format and and we've

00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:20,020
wanted them to create documentation as

00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:23,620
they go we are going I'm working on a

00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:26,710
way to take their output their build

00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:29,830
tools format it to get it into a doc

00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:31,960
book format and just basically extend

00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:34,090
their process so we can make it have

00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:37,710
this look and feel and doc book but

00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:40,000
allow them to maintain it in their

00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:42,310
markdown language I can't remember which

00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,290
one it is again on my apologies but

00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:46,120
that's ultimately the goal as well so

00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:49,180
you get ski boot documentation to look

00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:50,470
like it came through the foundation but

00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:53,170
I didn't want to you know I didn't want

00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:54,610
that community to change how they were

00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:56,620
doing things I didn't want to complicate

00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:58,420
their life and I certainly don't want to

00:21:56,620 --> 00:22:01,030
maintain two different templates of look

00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:02,470
and feel try to keep them together do it

00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:04,840
the way you're doing it Stewart and

00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:06,370
Jeremy and everybody will figure out how

00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,870
to put it in a better format later I'll

00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:10,000
take that responsibility

00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:12,039
so that's where we're headed is one of

00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,620
the things I have a patch of how to do

00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:16,690
that it needed to age because the first

00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:18,429
round of anything like that you discover

00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:20,470
the assumptions you made we're either

00:22:18,429 --> 00:22:22,090
good or bad and I let the first round

00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:23,679
age about six months and discovered how

00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:25,600
bad the idea was so I had to throw it

00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:27,130
away and find a different route so I'm

00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:30,400
getting ready to go back make sure it

00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:33,460
still works the way they're developing

00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:36,580
their documentation so so that's what

00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:38,350
we're up to again last reminder if you

00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:40,210
want to get involved the documentation

00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:42,010
development guide is it we walk you

00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:43,870
through several different scenarios how

00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:46,000
do I get tools on there how do I

00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:48,600
understand the project structure how do

00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:52,179
I create a new document from scratch

00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:56,919
net-net go copy a template start hacking

00:22:52,179 --> 00:22:58,240
on it how do i how do I create we've

00:22:56,919 --> 00:23:00,010
added a new section in there how do I

00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:03,279
start working on an existing document

00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:06,549
how do i D bug build failures maven is

00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:08,770
very esoteric and it's build fair I mean

00:23:06,549 --> 00:23:11,919
it makes GCC look like a verbose and

00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:14,559
concise compiler you can have really odd

00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:18,190
failures in this maven Apache foe

00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:20,140
environment and so as we've had common

00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:21,190
theme dares we'll post text that says

00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:24,279
alright if you get an error like this

00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:26,679
look here do this sort of thing to help

00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:28,299
you walk through errors we walk we walk

00:23:26,679 --> 00:23:31,059
through the process of how to publish

00:23:28,299 --> 00:23:33,010
them in the open power documentation

00:23:31,059 --> 00:23:34,480
world and then of course as we mentioned

00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:37,029
section two is all about all these

00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,679
examples I need an order list so I need

00:23:37,029 --> 00:23:41,440
an unordered list I want an F Swiss

00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:46,570
etcetera etcetera etcetera so that is

00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:48,340
where the guide is and so we're trying

00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:52,149
to use open tools we're trying to do

00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:54,250
documentation just like code but at the

00:23:52,149 --> 00:23:57,070
same time make sure we maintain a brand

00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:59,620
a good look and feel a good clean look

00:23:57,070 --> 00:24:01,160
and feel and we're always looking for

00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:04,969
help

00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:04,969
