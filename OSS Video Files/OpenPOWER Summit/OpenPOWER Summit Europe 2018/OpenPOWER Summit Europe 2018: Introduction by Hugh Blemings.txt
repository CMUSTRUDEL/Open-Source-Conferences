00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:11,860
good morning my name is Tia blemings I'm

00:00:10,209 --> 00:00:15,549
the executive director of the open power

00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:17,320
foundation and it's my pleasure to on

00:00:15,549 --> 00:00:19,150
behalf of the board and the membership

00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:22,290
of the organization of the foundation to

00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:26,380
welcome you to our summit this morning

00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:27,850
the event like event of this scale runs

00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:29,500
on the back of the efforts of many

00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:32,289
people and it would be a foolhardy to

00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:33,489
try and identify everyone but I do want

00:00:32,289 --> 00:00:35,859
to call out a couple of people in

00:00:33,489 --> 00:00:37,960
particular who have had really gone

00:00:35,859 --> 00:00:40,390
above and beyond in the process of

00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:43,210
getting us getting this event together a

00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:46,300
gana sin' who is our one of the co-chair

00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:47,890
of the academic discussion group for

00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:50,440
open power there's possibly

00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,239
single-handedly invited a measurable

00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,969
proportion of everyone who's shown up so

00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:56,469
very grateful for gangshim's efforts

00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:59,319
journey from IST oh who is the

00:00:56,469 --> 00:01:01,089
secretariat organization for for the

00:00:59,319 --> 00:01:02,409
foundation has been the person who's

00:01:01,089 --> 00:01:03,579
been doing a lot of the behind the

00:01:02,409 --> 00:01:06,070
scenes logistics I'm particularly

00:01:03,579 --> 00:01:08,259
grateful for for her efforts and of

00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:10,270
course the speakers who put a lot of

00:01:08,259 --> 00:01:12,759
time and effort into preparing their

00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:14,140
sessions the events yesterday and the

00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:17,590
ones that you'll enjoy during the course

00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:20,020
of of today so thanks to all of them and

00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:23,590
of course to all of you for for for

00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:26,140
attending today we had a theme for the

00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:29,109
for the summit and thinking about as we

00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:30,609
still led up to this the whole concept

00:01:29,109 --> 00:01:32,530
of open the future and where does open

00:01:30,609 --> 00:01:34,960
power open power see it and we think

00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:36,969
really an important point in the

00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,950
evolution of the industry generally that

00:01:36,969 --> 00:01:41,530
particularly for open power where open

00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:43,990
power currently represents the most open

00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:44,890
high-performance commodity computing

00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:47,890
platform out there

00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:49,509
we literally have in open power a unique

00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:52,659
system where everything from the

00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:54,250
hardware the firmware the the BMC the

00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:55,929
operating systems although out all the

00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:58,899
way up to a very rich software ecosystem

00:01:55,929 --> 00:02:01,570
are entirely open and that is currently

00:01:58,899 --> 00:02:03,820
unique in the in the industry in the

00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:06,159
context of systems that have sort of a

00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:10,330
good high performance processor as as

00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:11,890
power 9 certainly certainly is the

00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:13,960
foundation itself we are currently at

00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:16,240
around 350 members some

00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:18,640
34 countries represented in that

00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:20,740
membership base and about half of that

00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,780
1718 or so actually here in Europe so

00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:25,930
it's particularly fitting that we are in

00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:27,160
Europe today for for this event one of

00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:28,450
the things we did in the foundation

00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:31,360
earlier in the year was ran a membership

00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:32,590
survey to just to solicit feedback from

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,780
membership as how we could best

00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:36,880
facilitate their work and that and their

00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:38,110
their business wins and one of the bits

00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:40,240
of feedback we particularly got from

00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:41,980
that was that to address the

00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,630
geographical diversity and we've very

00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:46,420
much been able to do that this year with

00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:48,970
the event in March in the US the event

00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:50,350
here of course in in Amsterdam and then

00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:52,450
will be in Beijing on the 12th of

00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:54,400
December for a summit in China so we're

00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:56,920
trying to improve that geographical

00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,480
reach but also in broadening our focus

00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,760
in terms of the various work groups and

00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:03,370
work products will be produced to have a

00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:04,990
greater focus on software and system

00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:06,340
integration opportunities that's

00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:07,660
traditionally been perhaps a little bit

00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:09,430
of a hardware focus which we will

00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:11,620
continue to maintain and there's some

00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:12,970
exciting things coming down the track on

00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,470
that front but just to make sure we

00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:17,230
broaden that base for for software and

00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:18,250
system integrators as well we encourage

00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,840
you all to consider if you're not

00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:21,370
already joining the foundation we do

00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,930
have individual memberships as well as

00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:23,950
corporate memberships are various

00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:26,980
different levels and we'd certainly

00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:28,390
welcome your membership but perhaps more

00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:30,700
importantly consider how you might get

00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:32,560
involved in the overall ecosystem if

00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:34,930
you're not already in our Jeff she'll

00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,700
who is the chair of our technical

00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:38,740
steering committee that oversees our

00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:40,660
workgroups has a booth out there and

00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:42,040
he'll be happy to give you some swag and

00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:43,480
give you a bit of a rundown on the

00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:48,040
various different workgroups we have and

00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:49,060
how you might get get involved thank you

00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,500
again for coming I'm going to keep it

00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,850
quite brief because as a and I'm very

00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,670
capable speakers who have much more

00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:58,620
interesting things to say than I

00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:58,620
