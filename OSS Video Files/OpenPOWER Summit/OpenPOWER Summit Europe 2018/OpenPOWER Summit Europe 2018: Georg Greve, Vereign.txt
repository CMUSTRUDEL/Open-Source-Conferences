[Music]

00:00:07,809 --> 00:00:12,950
good morning everyone so my name is ava

00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:17,120
I've been in the open community for

00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:19,400
about 25 years give or take and I've

00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:23,230
always tried to find the most

00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:28,370
interesting and biggest and most useful

00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:30,040
project to tackle which is why I thought

00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:32,480
why not go for the four billion people

00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:34,190
you will never heard have heard of the

00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,870
rain so far because we're just coming

00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:37,850
out of hiding so you're one of the first

00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:39,620
audience to actually hear what it is

00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:41,810
we've been working on and I'm very

00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:44,270
excited to tell you about it the

00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:47,900
alternative title for this presentation

00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:50,450
would have been how I wasted years of my

00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:52,610
life by signing an encrypted email and

00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:55,000
then losing the key for it and what

00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:55,000
happened next

00:00:55,239 --> 00:01:01,100
you see I'm I mean so ultimately I am

00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:05,319
actually passionate about emails email

00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:09,079
is fascinating it is the world's largest

00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:11,060
communication protocol I mean it has 3.7

00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:13,159
billion users virtually everyone has an

00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:16,249
email address that makes it far larger

00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:18,200
than facebook or any you know of the

00:01:16,249 --> 00:01:21,020
social media messenger platforms and

00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,659
it's the only of these protocols that is

00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:25,039
actually working in a decentralized

00:01:22,659 --> 00:01:27,799
federated way that is not single vendor

00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:29,719
dependent to me that make that makes

00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:33,259
email incredibly valuable

00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:35,749
I mean email drives business every day

00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:39,950
and it's what really is the lifeblood

00:01:35,749 --> 00:01:42,909
for quite a few people however we all

00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:46,069
know that email also has certain

00:01:42,909 --> 00:01:49,340
challenges primarily because things like

00:01:46,069 --> 00:01:52,069
privacy identity security they were not

00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:53,599
top priorities when email was first

00:01:52,069 --> 00:01:55,219
designed right people were happy that it

00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:57,169
worked in the first place and and many

00:01:55,219 --> 00:01:59,959
of the challenges that we have today

00:01:57,169 --> 00:02:01,310
people didn't think of them back then it

00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:04,279
wasn't their fault they just couldn't

00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:06,020
see that far because frankly who could

00:02:04,279 --> 00:02:09,019
see that the world would change like

00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:11,709
this so email isn't also now today the

00:02:09,019 --> 00:02:13,400
number one channel for cyber attacks

00:02:11,709 --> 00:02:15,709
malware

00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:17,569
and scam we all know this right identity

00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:22,189
impersonation business email compromised

00:02:17,569 --> 00:02:25,239
all these things exist and our real

00:02:22,189 --> 00:02:27,500
challenge which is actually why I

00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:30,769
started signing and encrypting my emails

00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:33,799
way back when my once held one of the

00:02:30,769 --> 00:02:37,819
top 50 new PG keys in the world so I'm

00:02:33,799 --> 00:02:41,150
an early adopter for these reasons but

00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:44,180
then I also as an early adopter found

00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:47,269
out what are the challenges because

00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:49,940
apparently such a system was not good

00:02:47,269 --> 00:02:51,680
enough to use even for myself with a

00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:54,139
background as a software developer and

00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,579
physicist I mean if I can't use this

00:02:54,139 --> 00:03:01,220
right how can I expect four billion

00:02:55,579 --> 00:03:03,849
people to use it so I was thinking and

00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:07,220
this is really what drove me like why

00:03:03,849 --> 00:03:09,650
can't we have a way to protect our

00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:12,950
privacy or identity you right can't we

00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:16,280
own our identity online and control our

00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:21,109
user data um and you know how why can't

00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:22,699
we have that and you know how hard could

00:03:21,109 --> 00:03:24,410
it be to get something that would be

00:03:22,699 --> 00:03:28,989
seamless and easy to use and well

00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:32,209
integrated and and ultimately give us

00:03:28,989 --> 00:03:35,900
exactly what we want in a way that is

00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:38,989
usable for those 4 billion people and of

00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:41,419
course the problem is that when you are

00:03:38,989 --> 00:03:45,290
technologists the question how hard can

00:03:41,419 --> 00:03:47,150
it be is dangerous because you actually

00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:50,510
start thinking about the solution now

00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:54,079
when you want authenticity for something

00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:57,370
like email and online you need identity

00:03:54,079 --> 00:04:00,829
and the hardest problem to solve in

00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:04,669
encryptions actually key management that

00:04:00,829 --> 00:04:06,379
is really the hardest one to crack so we

00:04:04,669 --> 00:04:07,909
were looking at what is out there and

00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:09,500
found that most systems are very

00:04:07,909 --> 00:04:11,449
centralized able for corporate

00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:13,280
infrastructures centrally managed

00:04:11,449 --> 00:04:17,989
they're not really made for

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:19,820
decentralized federated world which is

00:04:17,989 --> 00:04:21,109
you know why we said alright how do we

00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:22,550
solve this and we found that actually

00:04:21,109 --> 00:04:24,139
this is one of the cases where we

00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:26,659
believe blockchain can actually make a

00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:27,020
difference that's one of the actual use

00:04:26,659 --> 00:04:31,009
case

00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:34,310
we solve for it so well we started

00:04:31,009 --> 00:04:36,680
building it in fact by now we have a

00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:39,319
prototype that we're about to introduce

00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:43,250
to the world where we can show how to

00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:47,389
build self govern democratically run

00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:50,659
user control networks where people own

00:04:47,389 --> 00:04:54,680
their data own their identity in a way

00:04:50,659 --> 00:04:57,379
that seamlessly integrates with email as

00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:59,030
an application layer and because we want

00:04:57,379 --> 00:05:01,280
to make this available to the largest

00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:03,020
number of people we started with the

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,819
largest email provider in the world

00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:06,979
which is Gmail so the first thing we do

00:05:04,819 --> 00:05:08,300
is provide this in a Gmail plugin which

00:05:06,979 --> 00:05:11,240
makes it seamless to use for people

00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:13,099
using Gmail we also integrate this right

00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,960
now with the help of kelabra one of our

00:05:13,099 --> 00:05:16,520
partners into libreoffice so it'll ship

00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,710
with Libre Office in one of the next

00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:21,289
releases then probably actually the next

00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:24,080
one and we're doing this for roundcube

00:05:21,289 --> 00:05:26,599
because Ron Cube is the world's most

00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:29,210
popular open-source webmail platform and

00:05:26,599 --> 00:05:31,639
it is used by many privacy aware sites

00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:34,460
and in fact my previous company wrote it

00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:37,250
so I have a I have a thing for it

00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:42,080
but really what we have built as a

00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:44,690
result in the end is like a service

00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:48,550
layer um a service that allows us to

00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:52,069
seamlessly add verified user control

00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:54,860
identity to virtually any application in

00:05:52,069 --> 00:05:56,810
any service out there which is why we're

00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:59,060
calling it to the rain from verified and

00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:02,150
sovereign and it protects our purpose it

00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:04,729
allows us as a kind of decentralized PKI

00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:06,919
to add those capabilities anywhere and

00:06:04,729 --> 00:06:08,719
I'll be very happy to to everyone who

00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:10,580
wants to know how we're doing this to

00:06:08,719 --> 00:06:12,500
give you an idea that I don't have the

00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:14,810
time now but pick me up later I'm here

00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:18,289
I'd behind there's nothing that I'd

00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:20,240
rather be talking about to be honest so

00:06:18,289 --> 00:06:22,759
what we're doing now and why we're here

00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,990
is a very simple I mean I wanted this

00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:26,659
from the beginning to be a hundred

00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:30,319
percent OpenStack only what is open is

00:06:26,659 --> 00:06:32,060
trustworthy for me and therefore I said

00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,590
all right we need to have this on on an

00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:35,690
open hardware platform open software

00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:37,460
platform in our entire solution spec as

00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:39,080
well there's a hundred percent open

00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:40,729
everything is open-source according to

00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,779
the open source definition

00:06:40,729 --> 00:06:45,229
for software according to the free

00:06:41,779 --> 00:06:46,909
software foundation definition and what

00:06:45,229 --> 00:06:49,639
we want to achieve is we want to build

00:06:46,909 --> 00:06:51,050
an ecosystem a standard that people can

00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:53,870
build upon where they can integrate

00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:56,509
things that actually work with this make

00:06:53,870 --> 00:07:00,169
use of this because the more people are

00:06:56,509 --> 00:07:02,479
participating in this the more value the

00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:04,189
ecosystem has but also the more users

00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,610
will have control of their data and

00:07:04,189 --> 00:07:11,059
identity which is ultimately what I want

00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:15,399
therefore we are here to start building

00:07:11,059 --> 00:07:18,919
an ecosystem and we use open power

00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:21,680
because we need for a trustworthy

00:07:18,919 --> 00:07:24,589
identity a trustworthy platform and to

00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:27,529
us open power is by far the best fit of

00:07:24,589 --> 00:07:29,029
all the platforms out there and so

00:07:27,529 --> 00:07:32,479
you'll you'll see the demonstrator

00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:34,639
coming out now and in q4 and we are

00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:36,740
right now actually securing that they

00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:41,180
get the funds to go live for q1 next

00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:42,259
year so by the end of q1 I would say you

00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:45,860
should be able to use this in production

00:07:42,259 --> 00:07:48,680
that's the plan give or take but you

00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:51,080
know let's keep fingers crossed but it

00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:54,189
looks good and thank you very much pick

00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,189
me up if you have questions

00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:58,080
