00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:19,070
my if well the first speaker said times

00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:26,390
are a-changing Bob Dylan 1964 Nobel

00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:31,519
Prize 2016 maybe Bob didn't know but he

00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:37,999
was prophetic times are changing in this

00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:41,739
moment global warming our earth is

00:00:37,999 --> 00:00:47,959
getting hotter and hotter our

00:00:41,739 --> 00:00:48,819
agriculture is impacted pollution a lot

00:00:47,959 --> 00:00:51,699
of it

00:00:48,819 --> 00:00:55,309
not in Amsterdam but in other places

00:00:51,699 --> 00:00:58,399
earthquakes hurricanes not in Amsterdam

00:00:55,309 --> 00:01:01,190
by lack so times are a-changing is a

00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:07,030
fact we see it on a daily basis we leave

00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:11,539
it on our skin for worse and for good

00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:15,500
but we have a tool we have simulation

00:01:11,539 --> 00:01:18,969
modeling we have our knowledge we know

00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:22,700
or we are trying to model everything

00:01:18,969 --> 00:01:28,299
which is happening you know very heavy

00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:31,070
model very detailed from the

00:01:28,299 --> 00:01:34,700
computational point of view very heavy a

00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:39,070
lot of teraflops megaflops

00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:42,859
whatever it are required to model our

00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:46,700
environment to model the weather to

00:01:42,859 --> 00:01:52,999
model whatever so while we are impacting

00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:57,560
our world in some unpredictable way we

00:01:52,999 --> 00:02:00,170
have our knowledge our skills that will

00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:04,329
enable us to model what's going on and

00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:07,340
how to prevent any further damage and

00:02:04,329 --> 00:02:10,039
this is if you want something extremely

00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:11,870
good which was not envisioned at that at

00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:12,230
that time but Bob Dylan but it's

00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:15,140
happening

00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:18,500
right now because because we have

00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:20,959
technology technology is the name of the

00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:23,780
game that will help you in achieving

00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:27,650
those computational performances

00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:31,459
required to model what hey what's going

00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:35,360
on to model with more details with more

00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:39,290
physical models multi physics model and

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:42,099
so on but but there is another side of

00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:50,239
this picture the fact that more and more

00:02:42,099 --> 00:02:53,750
we need power to the data center multi

00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:55,940
megawatt that's you know it's secure but

00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:57,950
is also closed in the problem because

00:02:55,940 --> 00:03:00,799
the more power we put in the data center

00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:04,700
the more energy we have to invest in it

00:03:00,799 --> 00:03:07,640
the more co2 we have to put in the in

00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:12,319
the world so we have to change this

00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:18,200
paradigm we have to say no to any vendor

00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:22,190
lock-in we have to say no to any factor

00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:26,870
that will block the development or the

00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:29,989
evolution of technology so we have these

00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:33,609
four key words openness we need that we

00:03:29,989 --> 00:03:37,730
have an open platform not which multiple

00:03:33,609 --> 00:03:40,370
stakeholders will use to make sure that

00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:43,639
there is innovation and nobody will be

00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:47,269
la cadena we need to implement the

00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:50,030
co.design with whoever may help to model

00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:53,299
to design the solution we have to say no

00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:54,579
to any multi megawatt systems and we

00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:57,919
have to have a synergistic approach

00:03:54,579 --> 00:04:00,730
inside the data center and among data

00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:06,019
center which will which will enable to

00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:08,180
have a consistent set of resources and

00:04:06,019 --> 00:04:11,810
application available to the scientific

00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:15,440
community before has taken the first

00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:21,799
step in designing an open power basic

00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:25,460
cluster with components enabling the

00:04:21,799 --> 00:04:28,100
control of the monitoring of the power

00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:30,979
sumption that's something smart which

00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:33,259
has been co.design head with academic

00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:37,430
environment Emily the University of

00:04:33,259 --> 00:04:41,870
Bologna and I encourage you in attending

00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:46,240
in the talk today at 11:10 of professor

00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:49,460
andry Bertolini and my talk at 1:30 p.m.

00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:51,890
where we were going to detail about

00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:57,470
these solution

00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:57,470
