	00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,910
yeah I'm Alan cantle i'm CTO and founder

00:00:02,909 --> 00:00:08,250
of nanotech but we're now part of a

00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:12,360
molex companies of the molex and I'll

00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:15,839
give a bit more detail there I've titled

00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:18,020
mine open kappa enable deaf PJs the

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,520
perfect bridge to a data centric world

00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:25,320
so that that's just really a bit of a

00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:26,970
backdrop of my presentation is I've got

00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,099
a lot to talk about on on the hardware

00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:31,769
front maybe a little bit of a sales talk

00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:34,500
in that sense but I would like give you

00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:36,480
some frameworks or around the thinking

00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:42,180
of these architectures they were bring

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:43,739
into the market so just a brief overview

00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,510
on our tech for those who they don't

00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:48,539
know us we've been in the fpga compute

00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:52,620
acceleration arena for about 25 years

00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:54,539
and we've been qualified in just about

00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:56,460
all of the cert big server companies in

00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:59,309
their platforms and we've been deployed

00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:05,240
in many thousands of nodes over over the

00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:07,260
last decade or so we were acquired

00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:10,979
we've been acquired a couple of times

00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:14,250
the latest the acquisition was by molex

00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:16,020
but molex are a six billion dollar

00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:18,390
connector in cable company as I'm sure

00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:19,650
everybody knows they're on the connector

00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:21,150
in cables over the world but they were

00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:25,860
actually taken private by coke

00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:27,659
industries back in 2013 and that coke is

00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:29,460
in the oiling gas field and they wanted

00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:32,369
to get into the technology sector so

00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:34,770
molex was their entree into into a world

00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:36,659
of technology and the vision of the of

00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:39,299
that was to be a leading global provider

00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:41,100
of innovative electronic solutions that

00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:43,680
create value for our customers and

00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:45,299
society and really now latech is at the

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,990
forefront forefront of that on the

00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:51,570
systems in solutions so it as a business

00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:54,299
building on top of a on top of Alexa's

00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:57,229
capabilities we were acquisition number

00:01:54,299 --> 00:02:00,960
eight and there's several more synthesis

00:01:57,229 --> 00:02:03,450
but as well as well as that were we were

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,780
initially acquired by the ISI group back

00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:09,030
in 2008 is are you specializes in

00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:11,430
miniaturization in packaging

00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:13,770
we then laterally in 2010 acquired

00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:16,530
another FPGA company

00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,670
focused on some more data acquisition

00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:19,830
sort of things called innovative

00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:21,930
integration and just about three months

00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:25,590
ago some of you are familiar with the

00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:27,690
FPGA acceleration suppliers bit where

00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:30,210
was a was a competitor we we acquired

00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:32,280
bit we're just just three months ago so

00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:34,860
you can see where we're investing quite

00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:41,550
a lot in this in in this area and and

00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:44,940
and growing quite aggressively so just

00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:47,490
on that front I I will I will bring some

00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:49,940
of the presentation material does come

00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:53,130
from our colleagues at be aware as well

00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:55,110
so the way I really wants to start this

00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:57,090
is why open power so Brad McCready

00:02:55,110 --> 00:03:01,020
kicked this off is that his moment so I

00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:03,870
think was 2013 2014 and the vision then

00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:06,720
was was saying you know Moore's laws

00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:09,530
more of Moore's laws broken we the

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:12,990
computer architectures need to evolve

00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:17,100
into more of a data centric world and we

00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:19,230
need we need a we need we need a whole

00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:22,080
community a whole ecosystem to actually

00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:24,140
really innovate and and change this

00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,370
world of computing so that was you know

00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:28,590
IBM we're a little bit ahead of the game

00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:30,510
may there may be we've had certainly

00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:33,390
data centric enhancements over the last

00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:35,130
decade but arguably they've been they've

00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:37,530
been relatively sticking-plaster over

00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:39,090
those over the last decade but we really

00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:41,250
need to start to get tuck in our teeth

00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:45,510
into into making some more radical and

00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:47,760
more bold architectural enhancements so

00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:49,560
I'm I'm pleased to say this is this is

00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,860
very new data the gods of computing

00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,870
architecture have spoken so how many

00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:56,870
people are aware of the book computing

00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:59,640
architecture and Hennessy and Patterson

00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:03,630
so we're good a good proportion maybe

00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:05,640
50/50 so so yeah these two chaps John

00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:08,570
Hennessy and Dave Patterson John

00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:11,610
Hennessy was a was a chairman of

00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:13,740
Stanford I think and Ann burka and and

00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:15,750
Dave Patterson was on the Berkeley side

00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:17,040
they got together to write this book

00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:19,280
computing architecture and there's been

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:23,160
like a a to dish seven or eight editions

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:26,130
and the FPGAs have historically just got

00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,360
a little paragraph GPUs were added

00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:29,250
recently hope

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:33,479
we will see a big sectional FPGAs and

00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:35,810
the next release but a couple of things

00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:38,729
hot chips it's just happened in August

00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:41,729
Hennessey introduced Victor pang who's a

00:04:38,729 --> 00:04:43,650
CEO and the new CEO of czar Lynx and in

00:04:41,729 --> 00:04:45,689
his introduction he said this the main

00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:49,020
specific architectures have to be the

00:04:45,689 --> 00:04:50,909
future of computing and then domain

00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:52,800
that's rapidly changing and it's why I

00:04:50,909 --> 00:04:55,199
think F PJ's have a particularly

00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,479
critical role to play as we begin to

00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,009
change those architectures so this is

00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:02,729
from the like I said this is from the

00:04:59,009 --> 00:05:05,490
gods of computer architecture and then

00:05:02,729 --> 00:05:09,240
just literally last week or a week or

00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:11,490
two ago Patterson said it's time for new

00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,590
computer architectures and software

00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:16,409
languages and there was a there was a I

00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:18,479
trouble II article on that and that was

00:05:16,409 --> 00:05:20,939
just a couple of weeks ago and and I

00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:24,090
think you know we've been doing a lot of

00:05:20,939 --> 00:05:27,360
changes we've had our DMA we've had in a

00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:28,949
DP d KS p DK all of these circumvention

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,449
strategies to get around some of the

00:05:28,949 --> 00:05:32,310
inefficiencies of cpu centric

00:05:30,449 --> 00:05:34,979
architectures but they've been a bit of

00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:37,110
a sticking plaster while keeping things

00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:38,699
going so we need to make more radical

00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:41,009
changes and that's that's that's that

00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:42,089
that's these these guys are saying it

00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:46,710
next so maybe we should pay attention

00:05:42,089 --> 00:05:48,620
see in there they are saying it so if we

00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:51,659
look at the main specific architectures

00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:54,629
flat floor platform flexibility is

00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:56,460
essential today's processor is you know

00:05:54,629 --> 00:06:00,060
we don't deal with homogeneous we've got

00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:02,909
GPU CPUs large and small FPGAs and TP

00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:05,039
uses my own saying memory and storage is

00:06:02,909 --> 00:06:08,849
beginning to converge and become become

00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:10,500
one disaggregation is become popular

00:06:08,849 --> 00:06:13,349
because you want different mixes of

00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:15,990
pieces but really it's gonna put a major

00:06:13,349 --> 00:06:17,279
strain on the network especially if you

00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:19,589
just use the top of rack network

00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:21,870
approach so react aggression really

00:06:19,589 --> 00:06:23,580
isn't that scalable and hence I think

00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:25,349
where the domain specifics coming along

00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:28,139
you will wire the architecture of your

00:06:25,349 --> 00:06:31,439
computing platform to be more friendly

00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:32,939
to your application an FPGA is really

00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:34,589
early only processor today there are

00:06:32,939 --> 00:06:36,020
truly data centric and they were when

00:06:34,589 --> 00:06:37,529
they were born

00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:40,500
fundamentally they're a streaming

00:06:37,529 --> 00:06:41,110
processor the where you build the

00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:44,560
computer

00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:46,840
the flow in data its ioann can talk any

00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,180
fabric protocol I think this is critical

00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:52,229
we heard the question earlier was about

00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:55,870
the open Cappy fabric versus others

00:06:52,229 --> 00:06:57,580
certainly the fpga the beauty of fpga is

00:06:55,870 --> 00:07:00,430
it can talk all that all of those

00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:01,050
different competing fabrics and oddly

00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:03,460
enough

00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:05,680
everybody gets those fabrics up and

00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:09,099
running on FPGAs particularly zerlings

00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:11,020
ft js that's a huge we can architects

00:07:09,099 --> 00:07:12,430
some solutions and say you want Gen Z

00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:13,719
you we can have Gen Z today you want to

00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:15,460
open cap you tomorrow you can have open

00:07:13,719 --> 00:07:17,650
cap you tomorrow that's the beauty of of

00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:19,960
the FPGA there and and that's part of

00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:21,610
what Hennis is really saying and the

00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:23,199
other thing I think which is in this in

00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:25,240
a world of switching if you look at top

00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,340
of rack the switching has become the

00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,900
power Hawk it's not the computing is the

00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:30,250
moving of the data and now the actual

00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:31,599
switches themselves and now we're

00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:35,169
disaggregating we're just going to make

00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:36,969
it worse so so sometimes you don't need

00:07:35,169 --> 00:07:40,060
a full-blown switch sometimes you move

00:07:36,969 --> 00:07:43,300
terabytes from A to B and you don't need

00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:46,719
to switch it air 64 byte packet level so

00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:48,819
so the FPGA not a very good switch but

00:07:46,719 --> 00:07:51,190
if you if you do a direct connection for

00:07:48,819 --> 00:07:53,349
an application it's very efficient so

00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:55,629
the FPGA can be a good circuit switch

00:07:53,349 --> 00:07:59,259
and or it can be a packet switch as

00:07:55,629 --> 00:08:01,330
required by the application so really

00:07:59,259 --> 00:08:03,460
FPGA is provide both acceleration and

00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:06,699
they provide the glue for

00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:08,349
domain-specific architectures and so so

00:08:06,699 --> 00:08:10,120
this is this is a direction this is a

00:08:08,349 --> 00:08:11,949
system level part of the equation

00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:14,409
everyone called thinks about silicon but

00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:18,129
there are some serious system challenges

00:08:14,409 --> 00:08:19,839
when you go when you go data centric so

00:08:18,129 --> 00:08:22,089
I've talked about this particular

00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:23,680
architecture this is a base architecture

00:08:22,089 --> 00:08:25,870
if those if you didn't know Microsoft

00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,250
one it's similar what Microsoft using

00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:28,930
being it's similar to that there are

00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:31,300
some there are some subtle differences I

00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:35,440
won't get into but this is just a just a

00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:38,709
really of more of a recap is is the open

00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:41,349
copy bus is giving us a beautiful bridge

00:08:38,709 --> 00:08:43,959
to go from the CPU centric world to the

00:08:41,349 --> 00:08:46,750
data centric world whilst you know if

00:08:43,959 --> 00:08:47,920
you want to stay CPU its CPU centric and

00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:50,500
you want to use acceleracers

00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,569
purely as coprocessors to that cpu

00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:54,220
centric world the open copy bus gives

00:08:52,569 --> 00:08:54,430
you great bandwidth in an ultra-low

00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:58,720
layer

00:08:54,430 --> 00:09:01,060
see whereas whereas if you want to

00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,180
really flip the switch and go pure into

00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:06,070
the data center you can do that and so

00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:08,350
but we can we can and we don't want to

00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:11,770
what throw away those 40 50 years worth

00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:15,220
of software so the you know IBM have

00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:17,560
provided this this platform and it

00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:19,360
opened it up for everybody to use so we

00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,920
have this that we have this great bridge

00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,190
that can take us from one to the other

00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:29,589
without breaking without breaking that

00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:34,300
the historical architecture so in in in

00:09:29,589 --> 00:09:36,190
in faith to that we now nanotech came up

00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:38,709
with this basically did this

00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:40,330
architecture based around the open open

00:09:38,709 --> 00:09:43,649
cap he has that bridge as I was saying

00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:48,540
earlier and this was the first our first

00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:51,450
entry entry into into into open cafe and

00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:54,190
it was it was more of a proof of concept

00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:55,870
getting so you've got the really high

00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:58,300
bandwidth for the open cap into the

00:09:55,870 --> 00:10:00,279
processors we have the same match

00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:02,230
bandwidth to the to the storage and the

00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:07,270
same match bandwidth out to the egg to

00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:09,970
the data plane and this was the physical

00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:11,589
product so it leverages so this is an

00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:13,600
OCP platform for those of you that came

00:10:11,589 --> 00:10:17,290
from OCP yeah the last couple of days

00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:20,320
this is a Rackspace barrel iocp platform

00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:22,630
with a Google Zayas OCP motherboard and

00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,390
and at twin power nines and it's got

00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:28,029
four open copy ports but the on the

00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:31,089
right there of the picture you see free

00:10:28,029 --> 00:10:34,900
red cards basically that used to be 24

00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:38,110
SSDs we ejected we modified the platform

00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:42,130
and replaced it with an FPGA blade with

00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:44,020
eight MDOT to an nvme SSDs that provided

00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:45,940
enough bandwidth to saturate one open

00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:48,370
copy port so you've got 200 gigabytes

00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:51,190
per second of storage bandwidth that can

00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:53,320
be fed into a food before through the

00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:56,260
port for ports and by the way when I say

00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:59,110
200 gigabytes I add transmit and receive

00:10:56,260 --> 00:11:01,839
I think we're moving from the fabric

00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:06,700
world to the compute world fabric talks

00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:08,020
bits per bits in duplex and computing

00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:10,630
talks bytes in simpler

00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:11,860
so I think we need to agree what is the

00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:15,730
language because whenever I have this

00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:17,620
conversation is there so so this this

00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:18,820
was really a like to say a proof of

00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:21,040
concept this is caught a lot of

00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:23,980
attention at the various various shows

00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,959
and it does begin to get people thinking

00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:31,899
about looking at the the architectures

00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:33,100
in a different way it's downstairs yes

00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:38,290
if you wanna go and it's on the open

00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:40,600
copy booth downstairs so that this this

00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:43,270
was our first foray but really maybe

00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:45,610
it's ahead of its time it's it's also in

00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:47,470
only in this particular platform so it's

00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:50,140
not everybody still wants to see PCI

00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:52,089
cards that's it so you know this is part

00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:54,970
of we need to start breaking the mold in

00:11:52,089 --> 00:11:57,550
moving away and this is one little idea

00:11:54,970 --> 00:12:00,670
in that direction but what we did is is

00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:02,740
we actually said well okay that that

00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:05,380
form factor is a little bit odd it's got

00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:08,050
the fpga acceleration the interfacing to

00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:10,690
the to the open copy and it's got the

00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:12,430
switch pci switch in the nvme storage so

00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:15,100
we said let's go a bit more back to

00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:16,959
normal chop off the the fpga in the

00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:19,029
storage we'll connect them separately

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:22,120
sorry chop off did the switch in the

00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:24,220
storage will connect them separately and

00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:28,000
and we came up with this card called the

00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:31,270
250 SOC so fundamentally it's a it's an

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,920
nvme over a fabric storage controller so

00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:36,640
you can put you can plug this card into

00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:38,290
a jabe off we support a number of a

00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:40,690
number of different configuration j

00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:44,440
buffs and we work with our links in

00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:47,579
there nvme over over fabric IP to bring

00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:50,709
this product to market but but equally

00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:53,410
on the right hand side these four are

00:12:50,709 --> 00:12:56,380
killing cables give you 32 lanes of PCIe

00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:59,589
to connect out to the storage but we

00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:01,839
also support up to to open copy channels

00:12:59,589 --> 00:13:04,630
on there as well so again today up to

00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:07,029
the to the fit to the flexibility fpga

00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:10,600
we can switch from a PCI attach to a to

00:13:07,029 --> 00:13:12,550
an open can be attached and the cabling

00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:14,680
really does give us this this this

00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:19,110
flexibility of hardwiring

00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:19,110
these for a particular application need

00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:26,050
just I wanted to show this partly

00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:29,300
because this is my Lexus

00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:32,089
but-but-but-but-but pci-sig this is

00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:35,060
actually a pci-sig drawing but it's

00:13:32,089 --> 00:13:37,720
showing in inside the server now you're

00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:41,810
beginning to see more and more cabling

00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:44,390
of connecting the different elements

00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:48,200
together and this is a PCI based cable

00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:50,149
in the oculi is an internal an internal

00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:53,890
cable in but it's designed specifically

00:13:50,149 --> 00:13:56,570
for carrying PCI and various types of

00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:58,730
interconnect there from from the cards

00:13:56,570 --> 00:14:02,360
from the adapter cards to the storage or

00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:04,160
on the motherboard and a now for data

00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:07,329
you saw that they had a something

00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:10,459
similar so you know this has become

00:14:07,329 --> 00:14:12,649
becoming more and more popular and more

00:14:10,459 --> 00:14:14,600
and more popular in it and I think as we

00:14:12,649 --> 00:14:17,630
go more modular and we have more

00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:19,160
specific applications hardwiring to your

00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:22,880
needs rather than going through a switch

00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:24,829
and burnin powering it may may be the

00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:28,070
way may be the way to go obviously not

00:14:24,829 --> 00:14:31,790
not not not it's more application

00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:33,320
specific error when you do this so the

00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:34,760
card this is just a photograph of the

00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:38,329
card it's a low profile card

00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:39,620
fundamentally so in a large picture on

00:14:38,329 --> 00:14:41,899
the right you can see the four are

00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:44,570
killing connectors so really quite small

00:14:41,899 --> 00:14:46,250
connectors on the left hand side you've

00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:49,970
got the 200 gig for it's going out to

00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:51,950
the outside so the oculi is internal

00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:54,170
facing just like I said

00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:56,029
you can take it into a full-height card

00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:58,279
another Gigabit Ethernet this is a this

00:14:56,029 --> 00:15:00,890
is the SOC the Zink version of dzurlic's

00:14:58,279 --> 00:15:03,230
FPGA so you can run a full Linux stack

00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:05,660
in there it's part of your storage

00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:09,290
controller the photographs on the right

00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:11,240
the top one is is just showing you the

00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:13,850
cables plugged in and flowing off to the

00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:15,410
right-hand side and the bottom one is is

00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:19,070
just showing the literally low-profile

00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:20,839
one without the giegi attached so it's a

00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:23,149
really is a Swiss Army knife of a card

00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:25,490
and we do have people people sometimes

00:15:23,149 --> 00:15:30,829
that they very very very rarely use all

00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:32,760
of the ports so but this this diagram

00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:34,709
really is it's a bit of an eye chart

00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:37,399
but it does really give you an idea of

00:15:34,709 --> 00:15:39,660
the various segments the very many

00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:41,880
configurations you can do with this card

00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:44,430
all I really want to highlight if I can

00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:48,750
get the mouse up maybe I can get a nice

00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:51,600
suit never mind the ones so that the red

00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:55,230
arrows there's a is base are basically

00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,850
the open Cappy arrows so in the very

00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:58,320
middle one you can see there's an open

00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:01,500
Cappy channel going back to the CPU

00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:04,050
alongside a a PCI Channel and you've got

00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:06,690
four direct-attached nvme drives and

00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:09,089
then to the right of that there is an

00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:11,519
example with using an open Cappy channel

00:16:09,089 --> 00:16:14,040
to each of the CPUs and then go and for

00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:17,250
a PC I switch to motorboating to maybe

00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:21,029
24 nvm you drives so and there's a bunch

00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:22,860
of other connections here the the

00:16:21,029 --> 00:16:26,190
opulent caios can also turn into

00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:29,970
additional network iOS so lot lots of

00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:32,040
configurations which and and we have we

00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:36,480
have many examples of customers using

00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:40,139
the different configurations I also just

00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:42,600
wanted to show from the Cappy to dotto

00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:46,100
this is an open Cappy enabled card it's

00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:48,569
a copy to doll though it's the 250s plus

00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:53,069
and basically it's got on-board storage

00:16:48,569 --> 00:16:56,069
it's got up to four m2 nvme SSDs and a

00:16:53,069 --> 00:16:58,860
pci by eight gen for to the host and it

00:16:56,069 --> 00:17:01,019
was providing a Cappy Bridge as for a

00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:07,110
Cappy flash attached between the the

00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:08,370
FPGA and the power and I'm happy bus now

00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:10,980
so Oliver in T really wants to say on

00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:13,020
that one there is also a cabled version

00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:15,270
of this but really the SOC version

00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:25,110
replaces and need to have this cable

00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:26,610
version yeah that's just it does just

00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:29,520
feel a block diagram of that card so you

00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:31,350
can see the different ones attached so

00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,830
what the reason why I wants to show you

00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:37,049
both of those is if you take the 250s

00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:39,990
SOC and on the flash GT with the four

00:17:37,049 --> 00:17:42,659
memory sticks we've actually were in the

00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:45,900
process of developing a an open copy

00:17:42,659 --> 00:17:48,120
hybrid memory subsystem architecture

00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:52,140
and effectively it's a blend of the two

00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:54,450
so we've added four on board a four four

00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:57,450
sticks of on board MDOT to storage to

00:17:54,450 --> 00:18:02,730
the 250 SOC cards so it's actually local

00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:04,890
but we're also making our own nvme MDOT

00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:08,310
- we're not talking that Mme MDOT tune

00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:09,960
and stick with us all except each year

00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:13,170
the kayuu free piece that's the ones on

00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:14,820
the right so so what we're going what

00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:18,150
we're doing there and we've got a we've

00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:21,180
got 32 gigabytes of vram over free

00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:24,330
channels free by 72 memory channels so

00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:27,000
the the combination of the nand and the

00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:30,390
and the dram allows you to potentially

00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:34,050
build some hybrid memory solutions where

00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:36,360
and and I'm not sure if if Ken's

00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:38,880
presenting today at all you are tomorrow

00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:41,580
so go to Ken's presentation on the on

00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,530
the hybrid memory IP from Ram bus but

00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:45,720
you will see that there are some tricks

00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:51,210
you can play to actually make the

00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:53,490
combination of NAND flash and and and

00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:55,950
and DRAM to actually be almost be as

00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:59,790
performant is D Ram by itself Ken will

00:18:55,950 --> 00:19:01,530
give you a lot more detail on that just

00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:04,290
just just a little bit more on the

00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:07,650
individual pieces that's the that's the

00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:09,690
MDOT tune and end or to stick the other

00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:11,820
thing here is that there's a lot of

00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:14,310
innovation going on unbundling the flash

00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:16,860
controller it with open channel thanks

00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:19,080
so so so that that's that that's a

00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:23,310
that's an interesting one there I will

00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:26,070
I'm shorter times or race on and and

00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:27,780
that's just a space model of the card so

00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:33,200
it's a it's a high profile card with the

00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:36,240
the sticks and the FPGA on on the card

00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:39,540
just touching on our friends at bit

00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:42,290
where they have a vu 47p so the HBM

00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:45,660
we've been talking about this morning

00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:49,710
card and that supports open copy as well

00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:51,540
with two connectors on the back that's

00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:56,310
that's the basic architecture they've

00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:59,210
got two dims also I know that typically

00:19:56,310 --> 00:20:03,740
IBM in Xilinx for going together

00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:06,620
but we but the the intel strat exten has

00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:08,210
a couple of interest in differences if

00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:10,310
you want to do floating-point on the

00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:12,770
FPGA they natively support it in the

00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:15,440
statics 10 and also there's this other

00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:17,710
low latency or at this have storage

00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:20,570
class memory called 3d xpoint from from

00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:21,950
intel and you can only really support

00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:23,480
that if you're going to buy Intel's

00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:26,660
chips sir

00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:31,250
so this one has two DIMM slots it can

00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:33,350
take in Intel's 3d xpoint obtain and and

00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:37,070
we have the open Cappy enabled on this

00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:39,410
card as well so potentially this one's

00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:42,500
more of a we need to get a little bit of

00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:44,240
a customer pull on this to get IBM to

00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:47,540
help on some of the porting of the of

00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:49,550
the IP to the open Cappy IP to the to

00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:52,460
the Intel FPGA so I just thought I'd

00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:56,180
throw that one in there that's that's

00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:57,950
the architecture it's in it's in

00:20:56,180 --> 00:21:02,210
development right now so not not right

00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:07,370
now it shouldn't be too long and finally

00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:12,560
this is this one is so those of you that

00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:14,960
know the AC 922 platform from IBM it's a

00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:17,000
dual power 9 and it's got four vaulters

00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:20,240
sxm two modules that you can plug in

00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,460
this one but but there's the bud yet but

00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:25,930
that module is also supports open Cappy

00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:28,010
mezzanine modules so so this this is a

00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:31,130
product that where they were beginning

00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:34,070
to kick off right now where we actually

00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:36,980
can plug the vu 47p into the into that

00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:39,320
socket but we also provide a lot of i/o

00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:41,300
that cabled i/o so that you can you can

00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:44,800
build some interest in the architectural

00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:47,930
tweaks for you for your requirement

00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:49,580
there's the basic layout so we've got

00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:51,620
four these are called nearest at

00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:52,340
connector zeke these can go out to cue

00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:54,890
SFPs

00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:58,550
to go into the wider that what the wider

00:21:54,890 --> 00:22:00,560
network and there's four ocula quartz

00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:03,230
just like you saw on a 250 SOC for

00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:05,720
connecting to storage or doing torus

00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:07,640
interconnects etc and finally you've got

00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:09,470
the connectors on the bottom that they

00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:12,100
are already hardwired on the on on the

00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:15,130
AC 922 motherboard

00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:19,030
just a couple of space shots there this

00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:20,830
is the server the AC 922 server that you

00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:22,210
is showing the four sockets for the

00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:23,679
air-cooled version if you have the

00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:29,760
water-cooled version you can have an

00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:33,490
additional two open capping sockets and

00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:35,230
here is just one quick example of a

00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:37,450
potential configuration remember a lot

00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:41,289
of this is cabled so that the blue ones

00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:44,159
are blue and green or cables so so you

00:22:41,289 --> 00:22:46,630
can you can change these configurations

00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:48,190
but basically I've just put the speeds

00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:49,690
and feeds around you've got 400

00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:53,169
gigabytes for a second from the power

00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:54,880
lines to the 4vu 47 PS and you've got

00:22:53,169 --> 00:22:56,169
matching bandwidth coming out the

00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,419
networks that you could potentially

00:22:56,169 --> 00:23:01,380
connect to nvme over fabrics so you've

00:22:58,419 --> 00:23:03,610
got a storage just Keeping Up with the

00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:06,429
Keeping Up with the data rate of the

00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:10,120
open copy ports and you can be doing a

00:23:06,429 --> 00:23:11,679
lot of AI work etc in the FPGAs and then

00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:13,150
you've got the interconnect between the

00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,770
four FPGA if you want direct

00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:16,480
communications this is just an example

00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:17,980
there's there's many other of

00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,500
configurations you can potentially do

00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:22,510
with this really interested this is

00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:25,179
definitely more in the HPC world so I'm

00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:27,909
really interested in in anybody that's

00:23:25,179 --> 00:23:30,190
got an interest in this area please come

00:23:27,909 --> 00:23:33,970
and talk to me after and we we can and

00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:35,620
and maybe Peter as well and and we'd be

00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:37,770
delighted to go into more detail on what

00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:37,770
