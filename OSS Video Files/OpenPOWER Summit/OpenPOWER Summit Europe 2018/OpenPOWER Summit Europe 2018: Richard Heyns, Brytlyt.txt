[Music]

00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:11,980
good morning everyone

00:00:08,889 --> 00:00:15,940
so I'm the founder and CEO of bright

00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:18,010
light and what we are doing is using

00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:21,520
graphics processing units to massively

00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:25,180
accelerate data processing and deliver

00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,680
speed of thought at scale but I'm just

00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:28,510
going to take a step back first before

00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:32,609
dive and see exactly what we're doing

00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:36,010
and talk a little bit about bob dylan

00:00:32,609 --> 00:00:39,519
times they are a-changin is a song that

00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:41,589
Bob Dylan wrote a while back and I think

00:00:39,519 --> 00:00:44,079
the purpose of that song was really you

00:00:41,589 --> 00:00:47,260
know about political commentary but

00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:50,859
times are changing and they're changing

00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:52,269
more and more rapidly in today's world

00:00:50,859 --> 00:00:56,829
you know with the access that we have to

00:00:52,269 --> 00:00:58,929
technologies information data and a raft

00:00:56,829 --> 00:01:01,539
of new innovations that are driving how

00:00:58,929 --> 00:01:05,710
we interact with the world everything is

00:01:01,539 --> 00:01:07,540
changing and very very rapidly and one

00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:10,740
of those innovations that we are seeing

00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:15,219
is in hardware so this is a falcon

00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:20,039
heavy-lift rocket it's the biggest most

00:01:15,219 --> 00:01:21,939
powerful rocket available to us today

00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:23,560
fantastic innovation and what's

00:01:21,939 --> 00:01:26,229
interesting about this is it's all

00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:28,539
driven by private enterprise not so long

00:01:26,229 --> 00:01:32,530
ago it cost a lot of money and a lot of

00:01:28,539 --> 00:01:34,149
resources to get payloads into space and

00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:35,590
only the two biggest governments in the

00:01:34,149 --> 00:01:38,950
world can actually fund those kinds of

00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:42,780
projects today private enterprise is

00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:42,780
able to take on those kinds of endeavors

00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:52,899
Einstein said he could see further

00:01:49,679 --> 00:01:55,149
because of standing on the shoulders of

00:01:52,899 --> 00:01:57,700
giants and I think this is a great

00:01:55,149 --> 00:01:59,320
analogy or a great way to look at the

00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:01,749
open source world or the open source

00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:05,399
community and what's happening there all

00:02:01,749 --> 00:02:11,260
of our software stack users open source

00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:12,730
components and we really get a lot of

00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:13,400
value from that because we take those

00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:15,200
components

00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:17,120
just put them together that we actually

00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,769
because of the way the open-source model

00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,659
works were able to extend those and

00:02:18,769 --> 00:02:23,090
enhance those so it goes all the way

00:02:20,659 --> 00:02:25,939
from the operating system which is Linux

00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:28,970
and all that the bul-bul tools and the

00:02:25,939 --> 00:02:32,269
tool chain related to Linux but also

00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:35,900
Postgres so bright light is a post grids

00:02:32,269 --> 00:02:37,700
clone we've taken a lot of basically the

00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:39,560
entire post grades source code and and

00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:42,430
rewritten that to run on graphics

00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:46,220
processing units we use the PI torch

00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:50,840
memory management module to manage the

00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:53,690
GPU power and with doing that we can

00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:57,620
bring together the post res world of

00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:59,659
sequel tight workloads and the machine

00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:03,250
learning and AI world with PI torch

00:02:59,659 --> 00:03:07,810
workloads everything happening on GPU

00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:10,760
which brings me back to bright light and

00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:13,069
how we are using graphics processor

00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:15,769
units to deliver speed of thought at

00:03:13,069 --> 00:03:18,410
scale using open source tools and

00:03:15,769 --> 00:03:20,449
technologies brought together to really

00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:24,769
deliver a very compelling user

00:03:20,449 --> 00:03:27,180
experience and that is that is pretty

00:03:24,769 --> 00:03:34,039
much what we are all about

00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:34,039
