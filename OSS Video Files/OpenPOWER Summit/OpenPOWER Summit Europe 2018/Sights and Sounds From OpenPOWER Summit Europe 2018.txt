I'm very excited to be here. We had some great announcements today with Blackbird

00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:27,960
and the developer workstation SQream technologies, Verain and a number of

00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,130
others so it's a very exciting summit. We're happy to be here in Amsterdam and

00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:39,289
loving all the energy of the conference.

00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:48,410
We have representatives from the industry - over 15 vendors who are

00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:52,430
building open power, power9 servers for showing the capabilities of being

00:00:52,430 --> 00:01:00,020
able to run all of our buses an industry standard NVLink, OpenCAPI, take

00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:04,460
advantage of the high-performance interfaces that power9 offers. Just seeing

00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:08,450
people that are networking and talking to each other and just having a

00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:12,110
talking about what they're doing at open power where we take it in the future and

00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:16,009
I think one of the things that's really resonated particularly here in Europe is

00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:20,030
just the whole openness of the software stack, the high performance processor, open

00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:24,350
software stack and open hardware stack pretty hard to beat. In this open power

00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:29,660
conference we discovered there is a huge interest in the high-performance

00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:36,200
computing for the Trinity of SQream , Invidia and Power9. At the very moment

00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,040
our company was created we became a member of OpenPOWER Foundation

00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:47,119
because we see the highest potential on the market for this platform. Yeah I had

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,950
a great day today - announced our new Blackbird platform that brings power to

00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:56,720
the desktop for the first time since basically for a decade or more. This time

00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:03,500
we bring all our OpenPOWER products to OpenPOWER Foundation Summit Europe.

00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:09,470
I got to see hybrid memory experimentations and speak to a ton of

00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:15,319
people about coming and actually coding and so it's been a great experience and

00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:20,450
yeah I still have six more hours so what else is gonna happen?

00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:25,459
We had a lot of great ideas, we talked a lot about software stack and the

00:02:25,459 --> 00:02:29,540
hardware stack and hardware and being open is a very relatively new topic so

00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:33,230
we had a lot of great ideas and we're gonna form at the next summit you know

00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:38,700
