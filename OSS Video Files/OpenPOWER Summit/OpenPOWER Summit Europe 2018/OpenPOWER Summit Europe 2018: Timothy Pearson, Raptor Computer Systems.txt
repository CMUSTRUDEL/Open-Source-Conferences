[Music]

00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:13,570
good morning all so I didn't start this

00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,360
the session here with a question and

00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:18,460
that is why open computing why is this

00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:21,460
actually important and why we should

00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:24,310
invest in it and it really comes down to

00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:26,890
one keyword developers if you pick out

00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:28,720
for instance Linux has arguably the most

00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:31,499
successful one of the largest open

00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:34,059
source projects in the world it has a

00:00:31,499 --> 00:00:35,829
massive amount of variation innovation

00:00:34,059 --> 00:00:38,620
but more importantly in today's society

00:00:35,829 --> 00:00:41,320
it's still auditable and secure if it

00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:42,760
isn't secure to be made secure there are

00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:45,519
a lot of eyes looking at the source code

00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:49,780
and making sure they add vulnerabilities

00:00:45,519 --> 00:00:52,089
bugs etc get patched very rapidly but

00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:55,839
what really powered the rise of Linux

00:00:52,089 --> 00:00:57,429
and related systems I've really if you

00:00:55,839 --> 00:00:58,929
look at the history it's the fact that

00:00:57,429 --> 00:01:01,059
there were actually open hardware

00:00:58,929 --> 00:01:02,979
platforms on which this work could could

00:01:01,059 --> 00:01:04,360
actually happen

00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:06,820
he had unfettered access to

00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:08,320
documentation in many cases massive

00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:11,310
collaboration especially with the rise

00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:14,649
of the Internet and but this is enabled

00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:16,299
something relatively new we'll call

00:01:14,649 --> 00:01:19,329
needs based development literally

00:01:16,299 --> 00:01:21,759
creating software from the pieces that

00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:24,310
exist to actually fulfill a specific

00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,649
need instead of trying to shoehorn an

00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:30,939
existing application into a world may or

00:01:26,649 --> 00:01:33,210
may not be suited for so you know coming

00:01:30,939 --> 00:01:36,189
back to the concept of open platforms

00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:38,320
those open platforms owner control

00:01:36,189 --> 00:01:40,869
hardware they actually enable innovation

00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:44,320
and ovation on a scale that we really

00:01:40,869 --> 00:01:46,450
haven't seen recently when open hardware

00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:49,060
becomes unavailable for whatever reason

00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:51,909
you actually see new players come in try

00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:54,939
to create new open platforms to fill the

00:01:51,909 --> 00:01:58,179
void you look at arm to a certain extent

00:01:54,939 --> 00:02:01,990
I mean Armus Armus older but it really

00:01:58,179 --> 00:02:03,460
came back out of the shadows and and and

00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:06,640
is now a dominant player in the world

00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:09,310
you look at something new risk v and now

00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:12,040
especially and this would not have been

00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:13,370
predicted you know five ten years ago we

00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:16,180
have open power

00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:18,890
and it's really coming and filling a

00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:20,349
void that is that has existed over the

00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:21,980
past few years

00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:25,489
fundamentally working at the choice

00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:27,680
between local control or central control

00:02:25,489 --> 00:02:30,470
now history you know repeatedly has

00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,239
shown that some degree of local control

00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:35,780
is still required central control

00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:38,480
stifles innovation over time now with

00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:41,569
the with computing systems the way they

00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:45,380
are local control is currently perceived

00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:47,420
as too complex for users and really I

00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:50,959
would challenge that is is local control

00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:53,180
really that complex is that something

00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:56,180
that the average user can't use an

00:02:53,180 --> 00:03:00,080
existing open source port program

00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:02,060
platform cloud provider to to really

00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,730
retain control of the computing but at

00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:06,080
the same time offload a lot of the the

00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:10,000
drudgery that a they work the

00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:13,130
development to the larger community and

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,360
cloud cloud these days it's really a new

00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:17,420
paradigm

00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:19,250
it's a recycling of the older concept of

00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:22,220
a central system but with a number of

00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:25,190
changes you really see a shift to open

00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:26,420
source for the the infrastructure and

00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:28,790
the actual applications in the cloud

00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:30,829
sphere you see the cloud providers

00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:33,140
really relying more on their platform

00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:35,030
their hardware whatever unique back-end

00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:37,220
advantages they have and really

00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:41,060
embracing the concept of open source for

00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:42,680
the application stack and you have this

00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:45,109
interesting idea of being able to

00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,489
develop locally on a platform that's

00:03:45,109 --> 00:03:48,950
actually compatible with your remote

00:03:46,489 --> 00:03:51,170
cloud system or even vice versa

00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:52,459
if you need more compute resources of

00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:53,989
the cloud to do the development you can

00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:56,989
deploy a locally to the two other

00:03:53,989 --> 00:03:59,569
systems however this all this power

00:03:56,989 --> 00:04:01,940
comes with a certain risk it brings new

00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:03,500
challenges one of the major ones is

00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:06,380
actually the trustworthiness of cloud

00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:09,290
systems how do you actually guarantee

00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:11,180
that your application running on someone

00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:13,010
else's computer that you've never met

00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:14,840
and you have no service level agreement

00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:16,459
or anything on those lines with how do

00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,840
you guarantee that your application is

00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:19,639
actually executing at a secure

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,190
environment it hasn't been tampered with

00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:25,190
and it isn't being controlled

00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:27,200
essentially outside of your your wishes

00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:29,270
and this is an area where

00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:31,400
open harbor becomes incredibly important

00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:33,020
how do you sell the bi-directional trust

00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,940
problem how do you trust the cloud

00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:37,910
provider and the cloud provider trust

00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:40,310
you so one of the easiest ways to do to

00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:42,350
accomplish that is to have hardware and

00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:44,480
software and firmware that is open for

00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:47,810
all parties to inspect all parties to

00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:50,270
look at for vulnerabilities and to to

00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:52,580
collaborate to seal them off and agree

00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:54,560
on the actual hardware being trustworthy

00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:56,420
firmware being trustworthy and software

00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,010
being trustworthy yeah this is actually

00:04:56,420 --> 00:05:00,490
something where Raptors been working on

00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:03,350
technology now for a couple of years

00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:06,290
literally distributed client interactive

00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:07,900
trust at the station system it's built

00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:10,520
on something we call the flexor module

00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:13,450
and this is actually live right now on

00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:17,090
one of our demonstration cloud platforms

00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:18,740
we call it flexor and it's something

00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:22,640
I'll be coming probably for the open

00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:24,350
power systems next year so you know

00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,640
record was nothing back for a bit Raptor

00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:27,830
and IBM have been I've been working

00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:31,010
together for some time we've been

00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:32,210
enabling the development community in

00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:34,340
ways they haven't been seen very good

00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:36,200
really for many years

00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:39,200
IBM obviously brought the first

00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:41,450
competitive performance competitive and

00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:44,810
power competitive open owner control

00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:46,940
will CPU since about 2013 that's be the

00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:50,300
power eight and now obviously the power

00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:53,330
9 in really an industry-first

00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:55,010
we have at least for the past decade we

00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:57,620
have full source we have full

00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:59,900
documentation for the processor and this

00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:02,510
is all the way down to the code that's

00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:05,510
running literally on the onboard

00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:07,660
management processors if you have

00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:10,430
anything you want to change

00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:12,140
configuration wise on that processor you

00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:14,630
have the ability to do so with open

00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:17,000
power systems Raptor brought the first

00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:19,370
widely available low-cost power 9

00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,100
Hardware to market that's our Telus two

00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:24,560
systems right now that's up to 44 core

00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:27,440
system or we can go all the way down to

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,570
four cores four system and more

00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,340
importantly we're building this all on

00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:33,140
the standard hardware platform we don't

00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:34,670
want to get into proprietary modules

00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:37,610
proprietary add-ons wherever where

00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:40,130
there's already an existing system that

00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:40,840
existing standard that fulfills the need

00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:42,880
so you

00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:46,449
the Oliver products are talking ATX

00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:49,090
e-atx things along those lines - and

00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:51,280
using standard memory modules to make it

00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:54,000
as easy to use a power system as it

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,290
would be to use an equivalent x86 box

00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,669
and and one of the other really

00:06:56,290 --> 00:07:00,220
important things here that it would

00:06:57,669 --> 00:07:03,639
power does that that hasn't really been

00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:06,040
seen in other competing architectures is

00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:08,710
that there's actually a certification

00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:12,190
process to make sure that the hardware

00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:13,900
is compliant what that means is that you

00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:15,639
don't have the same ecosystem fracturing

00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:17,770
that we've seen before where you build

00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:19,210
one binary here you build one here and

00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:21,729
they don't run on the system for

00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:23,229
whatever reason so we're literally at

00:07:21,729 --> 00:07:25,780
the point here where the same kernels

00:07:23,229 --> 00:07:27,460
can run on power8 that run on power 9

00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:29,530
there's some backward compatibility

00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:32,320
they're the same software applications

00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:35,560
will run so so literal if you have a

00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:38,169
Power 8 or higher executable it will

00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:40,720
likely run and not only power and I have

00:07:38,169 --> 00:07:42,850
a future power platforms compare and

00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,370
contrast that with a couple of the the

00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:46,990
current competing options and you can

00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:49,690
see that there's a significant advantage

00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:51,700
there so what's next

00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:54,580
obviously we need further fuel system

00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:56,289
expansion right now everyone's offering

00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:58,720
is primarily focused on supercomputing

00:07:56,289 --> 00:08:00,310
we focus on professional developers

00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,320
people with essentially a lot of

00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:04,150
resources of the disposal there are

00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:06,610
obviously exceptions but that it has

00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:09,310
been the general trend they are

00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:10,810
obviously existing community power 9

00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:13,260
servers or stations but again these are

00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:16,120
these are for higher-end applications

00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:18,400
there's really a need for what we call

00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:20,470
target machines or deployment machines

00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:24,340
these are the systems that the average

00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:25,870
person would be able to use and and use

00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:27,490
the open power applications they even do

00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:30,370
some basic development on depending on

00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:32,650
the size of the project so we've able to

00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:35,849
empower smaller developers and bring

00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:38,020
open systems back to the desktop sphere

00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:41,860
looking to bring open systems back to

00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:43,659
the desktop and we did so this is our

00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:45,940
brand new platform the blackboard system

00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:49,810
it's the world's first open power

00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:51,760
desktop / network appliance system it's

00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:53,110
built on the micro ATX form factor so

00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,280
you're not talking a gigantic server

00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:54,690
board we'll talk to you something as

00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:57,029
much

00:08:54,690 --> 00:09:00,089
and much more suited for actual deaths

00:08:57,029 --> 00:09:02,040
I'd use its lower power lower-cost

00:09:00,089 --> 00:09:04,139
and basically a perfect companion of the

00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,940
telus too and then ideal world you would

00:09:04,139 --> 00:09:08,029
do your development of something like a

00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:10,350
tells to someone's remote cloud system

00:09:08,029 --> 00:09:10,829
or small project even on something like

00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:14,339
this

00:09:10,829 --> 00:09:17,430
and and actually deploy that software to

00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:18,079
a machine or multiple machines that are

00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:20,430
desk-side

00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:24,329
to for people that want to use your

00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:26,790
application so what's next after this we

00:09:24,329 --> 00:09:28,529
actually have a long way to go there

00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:30,870
were a need to continue working toward

00:09:28,529 --> 00:09:32,819
additional open system components

00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:36,540
obviously as many of you know we've

00:09:32,819 --> 00:09:38,910
we've let a lot of the standards and on

00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:41,069
open platforms kind of slide we have

00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:43,230
GPUs we have safes controllers you have

00:09:41,069 --> 00:09:45,930
FPGAs we have almost every single

00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:48,269
peripheral USB controllers they add

00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:51,089
requires in many cases signed closed

00:09:48,269 --> 00:09:53,610
firmware in order to run and that

00:09:51,089 --> 00:09:55,439
doesn't direct conflict with the concept

00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:58,050
of an open auditable and securable

00:09:55,439 --> 00:10:00,269
system so over time we wanted to see

00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:02,100
these components open up we want to see

00:10:00,269 --> 00:10:04,050
the GPU to actually be able to be a

00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:06,149
trusted compute element like the CPU

00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:10,230
instead of what it is right now and that

00:10:06,149 --> 00:10:11,819
is a kind of a black box that probably

00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:14,610
should not be trusted for a highly

00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:16,199
sensitive computations we want to

00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:18,269
continue expanding the open power

00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:20,550
software ecosystem some of the things

00:10:18,269 --> 00:10:23,009
that both raptor and the general

00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:26,189
community have done over the past year

00:10:23,009 --> 00:10:28,470
as a couple years that freebsd was

00:10:26,189 --> 00:10:30,329
brought to be over the power platform we

00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:33,660
actually have the chromium browser from

00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:36,569
google that is operational and the power

00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:40,589
systems and trying to engage google to

00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:42,329
actually merge that of stream and and a

00:10:40,589 --> 00:10:44,519
different no we actually were able to

00:10:42,329 --> 00:10:47,279
bring over the the Unreal Engine 4 this

00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:49,860
is a triple a game engine from Epic

00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:51,660
Games and it actually runs very well on

00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:54,750
power power is an interesting

00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:56,189
development platform for such things so

00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:59,009
we actually have a demo of Unreal

00:10:56,189 --> 00:11:04,110
Tournament for running and this mattr

00:10:59,009 --> 00:11:05,880
booth so in conclusion we have what I

00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:08,100
would call a second open computing

00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:11,069
revolution underway first one obviously

00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:12,630
because the original pc the fact that

00:11:11,069 --> 00:11:15,060
there was a standard compliance system

00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:17,339
in which not only software developers

00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:19,800
but hardware manufacturers could build

00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:23,339
compatible systems and we saw massive

00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:24,839
growth and innovation from that right

00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:26,819
now what's going on this is driven by

00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:29,490
very similar forces the technology is

00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:31,829
vastly different but you can see the

00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:33,750
results we have rapid growth and the

00:11:31,829 --> 00:11:36,089
overall power sea ecosystem some of that

00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:37,649
is attributable to our machines you can

00:11:36,089 --> 00:11:40,440
actually see a bump if you're curious

00:11:37,649 --> 00:11:42,810
and the other baby and popularity

00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:45,000
contest literally from about the time

00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:48,329
that our machines were really shipping

00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,560
in earnest for the first time and really

00:11:48,329 --> 00:11:52,079
what we're seeing is developers

00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:54,360
relearning the idea that open systems

00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:56,100
are the best for elevation we have

00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,600
people literally dead to tell us that

00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:59,910
they have not had this much fun with a

00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,050
computer in years that they're actually

00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:02,310
able to sit down that they're actually

00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:04,620
able to do or work they're able to

00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:06,449
concentrate on what they want to see

00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:09,480
done instead of fighting with the

00:12:06,449 --> 00:12:11,689
technology and you know for all the

00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:14,040
developers out there your support is key

00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:16,160
we're the ones that fundamentally choose

00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:19,230
the platforms that the public will adapt

00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:21,870
so what kind of computing systems do you

00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:25,110
want to see in the world ten years from

00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:30,950
now 20 years from now thank you all

00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:30,950
