[Music]

00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:14,629
good morning everyone how we doing good

00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,030
excellent so me on Fisher and was Red

00:00:14,629 --> 00:00:20,060
Hat and I'm the Evangelist and our

00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:23,570
emerging technology team and I'm here to

00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:28,010
help you connect a few dots on the

00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:32,380
software side of the ecosystem so as you

00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:35,990
know this event is named or themed open

00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:39,770
the future implying that the future is

00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:42,050
open and the collaboration is open I

00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:47,030
think I would argue and I think some of

00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:51,140
you may agree that we already are open

00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:53,750
and we are if not fully there but making

00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:56,899
good progress this is the reality today

00:00:53,750 --> 00:01:00,530
open collaboration and it's definitely

00:00:56,899 --> 00:01:02,899
the case with Red Hat so open source

00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:05,630
obviously has been the fuelling a lot of

00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:09,130
innovation rate lately and going back

00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:12,439
starting 20 years 25 years ago when it

00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:14,329
was opening up breaking down the

00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:17,509
proprietary barriers in bringing

00:01:14,329 --> 00:01:20,679
innovation to the hands of the people

00:01:17,509 --> 00:01:23,649
developers folks who are interested in

00:01:20,679 --> 00:01:29,630
building something new something

00:01:23,649 --> 00:01:31,609
breakthrough definitely today the impact

00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:35,240
of open source can be felt everywhere

00:01:31,609 --> 00:01:39,039
most interesting and hottest

00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:41,630
technologies in the world like AI and

00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:44,240
you know distributed ledger is a built

00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:47,539
on top of the open source this is great

00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:50,749
stuff and with the millions and millions

00:01:47,539 --> 00:01:53,119
of upstream projects red hat feels

00:01:50,749 --> 00:01:55,009
really privileged to work with the

00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:59,029
community and maybe some of the

00:01:55,009 --> 00:02:03,109
brightest minds on the planet so how do

00:01:59,029 --> 00:02:06,649
we turn the upstream innovation and how

00:02:03,109 --> 00:02:10,759
do we create the commercial products on

00:02:06,649 --> 00:02:12,890
top of that there's been a saying in the

00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:14,150
industry that you know if you can be a

00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:18,019
Red Hat

00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:21,349
the specific area or specific software

00:02:18,019 --> 00:02:24,590
domain and that that represents success

00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:26,930
however the humble beginnings of Red Hat

00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:30,200
and the work that we continue to do with

00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:33,829
the community is relatively simple what

00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:36,980
we do is we select and nurture products

00:02:33,829 --> 00:02:39,200
I'm sorry technologies that can have a

00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:41,989
potential on the product ization side

00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:47,690
that our customers and our partners

00:02:41,989 --> 00:02:50,840
deemed to be interesting or valuable and

00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:52,930
we work with the community and we work

00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:56,030
to build and improve these technologies

00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:58,430
together with the community and turn

00:02:56,030 --> 00:03:00,829
them to the professional products that

00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:03,019
can help enterprises basically go about

00:03:00,829 --> 00:03:06,739
doing their business and sold their most

00:03:03,019 --> 00:03:09,230
critical problems so we leading design

00:03:06,739 --> 00:03:09,890
as you can see from the chart there we

00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,870
are

00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:15,769
leading design development on many of

00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:20,329
this broad projects upstream KVM and

00:03:15,769 --> 00:03:23,419
Sybil are do and OpenStack communities

00:03:20,329 --> 00:03:25,400
come to mind definitely one of the

00:03:23,419 --> 00:03:29,060
leading contributors in kubernetes which

00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:30,500
is the more the most the newest and

00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:34,340
hottest technology that folks are

00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:37,519
looking at right now we are fully behind

00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:40,780
the concept of deploying containers in

00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:43,040
the enterprises and certainly

00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:45,590
contributing to that besides just

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,720
contributing to core Linux so how does

00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:52,910
that benefit people in this room and

00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:56,239
open power in general at the foundation

00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:58,970
at the the very basic level Red Hat is

00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,769
building in providing a software

00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:03,379
infrastructure for the entire power

00:04:00,769 --> 00:04:05,269
ecosystem if you think about it we're

00:04:03,379 --> 00:04:07,280
not the only choice we don't want to be

00:04:05,269 --> 00:04:10,069
the only choice but we are effectively

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,919
doing that and rel Red Hat Enterprise

00:04:10,069 --> 00:04:15,620
Linux that you'll know or heard of

00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:18,849
may be used as some of us used it for

00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:22,219
many years as I was told

00:04:18,849 --> 00:04:24,370
essentially serving as a foundation for

00:04:22,219 --> 00:04:27,220
our entire software ages

00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:32,949
and so we're delivering proven software

00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:37,290
stacks on top of that as a here's a

00:04:32,949 --> 00:04:40,120
piece of trivia do you know that the

00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:42,610
operation system Red Hat Enterprise

00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:45,040
Linux was the first operating system to

00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:47,880
be used on the brand-new power 9

00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:51,040
hardware to actually boot and

00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:53,889
troubleshoot a during bring up so that's

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,330
true and we further down the road we

00:04:53,889 --> 00:04:58,000
launched it as a commercially supported

00:04:55,330 --> 00:05:02,770
product in November of last year

00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:05,639
and we have been delivering minor

00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:09,130
updates to it without standard cadence

00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:12,070
the Red Hat Enterprise virtualization

00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:15,280
which is a KVM based virtualization a

00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:17,740
software that we deliver has been

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:22,030
introduced in May of this year and it

00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:24,360
supports out-of-the-box both power and

00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:29,620
power 9 and that's a big thing for

00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:31,539
people trying to build their virtualized

00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:36,729
infrastructure in their data centers

00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:39,550
based on KVM and today I'm actually

00:05:36,729 --> 00:05:41,740
pleased to announce that the OpenStack

00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:43,840
platform is now available in power

00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:46,780
hardware and you can you can actually

00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:48,610
download and use it and you can start

00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:51,789
building your private clouds based on

00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:55,330
Red Hat Enterprise Linux that's a major

00:05:51,789 --> 00:05:58,360
step in enabling customers who are

00:05:55,330 --> 00:06:01,150
interested in OpenStack and it's it was

00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:05,860
a pretty fundamentally gargantuan task

00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:08,080
to bring open to bring OpenStack on top

00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:11,860
of a power and and bring that new

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:15,970
architecture to to the OpenStack

00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:18,039
community but there's no age for just

00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:20,020
for this very friendly crowd here for

00:06:18,039 --> 00:06:23,380
paying perfect attention to what I have

00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:25,260
to say I'm gonna bring another piece of

00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:28,000
news that hasn't been announced publicly

00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:29,889
but I'm sharing it with you because it's

00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,990
imminent in the next couple of weeks

00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:35,330
open shift for Power will be released

00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:37,160
and it's going to happen this month

00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:39,410
we're hoping that it will provide an

00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:43,250
ideal container platform to design and

00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:46,730
build our cloud ready applications on

00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:48,950
top of rel and that is also going to be

00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:52,390
available out of the box to run on both

00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:52,390
power aid and power 9

00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:58,220
so our enable meant work however

00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:01,010
continues we still working on

00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:04,580
implementing SEF and I know some of you

00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:07,250
are very much involved in propagating or

00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:10,130
advocating that in the community so that

00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:13,580
work continues and we are committed to

00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:17,660
delivering safe on top of Power

00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:19,970
Architecture from Red Hat so we can

00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:23,720
scale your storage across multiple

00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:26,300
clouds in across the data centers so I

00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:28,400
often get asked the question how do you

00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:31,010
engage with Red Hat this is a perfect

00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:34,000
example participate in the upstream

00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:37,400
community was us if you're a developer

00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,900
you not only going to benefit from the

00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:41,660
fact that you will be working with Red

00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:44,150
Hat in the upstream community you can

00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:45,710
also as a developer get access to all of

00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:49,370
these products commercially available

00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:52,520
products from Red Hat free of charge all

00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:55,640
you have to do is sign up with your

00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:58,370
email address as a developer and if you

00:07:55,640 --> 00:08:00,650
are working with a customer on proof of

00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:02,480
concept or a project you can actually

00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:05,300
download the trial versions of this

00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:07,490
software also free of charge and build

00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:10,190
your prototype and work and deliver on

00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:11,810
the project and then kind of deliver the

00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:14,630
proof-of-concept and then kind of see if

00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:18,290
customers likes it and they willing to

00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:21,140
take it and if nothing else while we

00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:23,270
here today please come and see us in the

00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:25,880
booth there are people also not just

00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:27,710
from Red Hat proper like myself or the

00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:30,260
people from the communities from our do

00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:32,300
in Fedora they here so come and talk to

00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:36,200
us you know we're always open for

00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:39,590
conversation so there is one parting

00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:42,440
thought that I want to leave you is and

00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:46,100
it's that so github today has over 18

00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:47,900
million repos I don't think there is any

00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,870
single entity in a single

00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:52,520
in the world that can deliver a

00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:55,520
commercially available products based on

00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:57,920
all of these repos and we're not

00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:00,320
striving to do that Red Hat is actually

00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:03,590
focused on platform technologies that

00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:06,920
our customers and partners need and we

00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:09,680
make the improvements and iterate on

00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:11,840
that software development and we build

00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:15,050
better solutions we build them together

00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:18,620
and we build we build them together with

00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:25,529
all of you thank you

00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:25,529
