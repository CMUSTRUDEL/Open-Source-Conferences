I hope that that from the talks that

00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:08,830
that you've seen so far and you know the

00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:10,480
talks that are yet to come you know the

00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:13,809
longer versions of the five that you had

00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,580
a quick fly through now and and and and

00:00:13,809 --> 00:00:17,650
another whole track that you haven't

00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:21,280
heard about yet but but that's that's

00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:24,820
going in paralleled and tomorrow you

00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:27,250
know I'm I'm certainly very enthused you

00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:30,280
know about everything that we have have

00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:33,700
going with open copy with this with

00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:36,370
Kathy 1.0 I felt we had a you know

00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:38,830
compelling architecture but you know as

00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:42,540
the the implementation was was you know

00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:45,850
I had some rough edges you know now with

00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:49,840
with Cappy and and and the system is

00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:51,670
open Cappy the systems downstairs you

00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,470
know all the the things that people are

00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:57,520
thinking of what they can do with this

00:00:53,470 --> 00:01:01,890
technology I think there is actually you

00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:08,200
know a very very tremendous opportunity

00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:10,390
but you know what as as and and and and

00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:13,630
you know I'm actually also optimistic

00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:16,360
about the community right the turnout

00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:20,260
here is you know it's one indication

00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:25,210
that you know there's there's reason for

00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:26,620
optimism but at but at the same time you

00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:30,280
know I think it's very important to have

00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:36,220
a discussion about how we how we serve

00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:38,140
the community how how you know what and

00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:39,729
and and and I hope that you will ask

00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:42,580
questions you know what are the kinds of

00:01:39,729 --> 00:01:44,650
things that that you need to happen you

00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:51,130
know in order to for you to be able to

00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:53,200
do your work you know what what what

00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:55,990
things have we done that maybe also have

00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,869
really helped you not only negative

00:01:55,990 --> 00:02:02,170
things but what positive things so

00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:05,200
that's that's kind of Eric like to go so

00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:08,019
so I'll start with you know a question

00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,299
or two just just to get started but but

00:02:08,019 --> 00:02:12,160
I hope you know you you will kind of

00:02:10,299 --> 00:02:16,870
take over and

00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:18,580
and ask questions so so so one question

00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:20,710
that came up in actually I think you

00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:23,950
asked it and and and I think that might

00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:26,890
be an interesting one too to start with

00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:29,800
and and I know already thought about it

00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:33,160
then it involves at least at least three

00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:38,380
of you lesson is welcome to comment on

00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:42,160
this one as well so we have four for

00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:44,800
good reasons right we have open copy and

00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,690
open power as as two different

00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,570
organizations and we have the

00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:55,710
accelerator workgroup right which is

00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:59,320
currently a part of open power so I

00:02:55,710 --> 00:03:02,380
guess I'll just ask each of you you know

00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:04,270
to kind of comment on where things are

00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:07,450
and where they might need to go and and

00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:09,630
how we you know how we should serve that

00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:17,140
accelerator community you know across

00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:18,520
open power and yeah yeah yeah yeah I'm

00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:21,340
assuming that this will be a friendly

00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:28,710
discussion but if you if you each want

00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:34,420
to you can all start with you you think

00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:36,160
thanks Peter um no pressure then so a

00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:37,600
brief introduction I'm he blaming see

00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,220
executive director right the open power

00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:42,190
foundation hints some of the giggling at

00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:44,440
the front I think from an open power

00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:45,580
foundation standpoint I think it makes a

00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,590
lot of sense they made a lot of sense

00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:49,209
for the open capi side of things to

00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:52,950
separate out because it's fair to say

00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:55,510
that to be a truly processor agnostic

00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:57,040
acceleration standard being part of the

00:03:55,510 --> 00:04:00,459
open power foundation may put some

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:03,910
people off so I think we we sort of beat

00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:05,890
them farewell fondly and Mara and I

00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:07,630
still talk quite regularly and as to how

00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:10,060
we can say hopefully you know help each

00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:11,500
other and certainly obviously from an

00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,220
open power standpoint and particularly

00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,990
power 9

00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:15,940
it's the preeminent platform at the

00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:17,890
moment and hopefully will remain so for

00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:20,049
for the process or architecture so

00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:23,080
anything we can do to help may be too

00:04:20,049 --> 00:04:24,750
happy to do press the politicians answer

00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:29,979
but you never know

00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:31,509
that was pre benign okay well you know

00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:33,070
it's funny I write when you ask that

00:04:31,509 --> 00:04:53,110
question that's a it is a good question

00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:54,970
actually well no no no it's right right

00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:57,520
so by the way we get the same question

00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:59,080
when it comes to Jen's ECC acts and open

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,539
copyright just take it up another level

00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:03,400
the same conversation but I could tell

00:05:01,539 --> 00:05:04,780
you where we're coming from right and

00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,030
it's pretty much the way we portrayed

00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:08,560
this is that open power we started that

00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:10,570
gosh it's been about six almost six

00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,330
years or more five years okay was yeah

00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:15,550
somewhere in that range and obviously

00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:17,440
this has taken root and a lot of the

00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:18,940
work groups that were started and that

00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,970
was a natural thing to do is to create

00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:23,889
an acceleration work group and a memory

00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:27,520
work group you know pertaining to open

00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:29,080
power but then eventually later on you

00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,160
know this open capi consortium was

00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:34,240
formed and like I said we're just

00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:36,460
getting near two years into being and so

00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,550
you know we've most recently had this

00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:40,810
conversation that says okay you know

00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:42,909
we're gonna run into something very

00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:44,919
similar because one thing is clear the

00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:47,979
way the structures are is that you know

00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:49,810
IP can't cross the boundary as it turns

00:05:47,979 --> 00:05:52,240
out it's a legal thing right you can't

00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:54,039
take IP that's that's confidential to

00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,599
one organization and give it to another

00:05:54,039 --> 00:05:57,699
organization it just doesn't work that

00:05:55,599 --> 00:05:59,770
way and if you think if you think it

00:05:57,699 --> 00:06:02,800
through it becomes obvious why that is

00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:04,710
the case so the truth is that you know

00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,970
we're complementary in one way today but

00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:08,500
we do have to work our way through that

00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:10,510
and when you don't have a concrete

00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:12,760
answer today and that's the truth right

00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:15,789
we started this dialogue because just

00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:17,949
most recently after we form our TL RDL

00:06:15,789 --> 00:06:19,479
and our enablement workgroup and open

00:06:17,949 --> 00:06:20,949
Cappy and all these others the

00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:22,479
conversation came up and says wait a

00:06:20,949 --> 00:06:24,490
minute how about the memory workgroup

00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:26,800
and accelerator workgroup and I said aha

00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:27,729
these guys have one too right so we're

00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,409
gonna have to work through those details

00:06:27,729 --> 00:06:31,930
to figure out where the line of

00:06:29,409 --> 00:06:34,479
demarcation is you know with respect to

00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:36,490
the to the two organizations and and

00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:38,290
maybe there's an obvious way where you

00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:39,700
put a nice little line between

00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:41,290
that says oh these guys when it comes to

00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,910
memory and acceleration over here when

00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:45,520
it comes to this this stuff that's over

00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:49,420
there but I also noticed that a lot of

00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:52,960
the open-open power members our members

00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:54,280
also have open Caffey and so the

00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,110
interesting thing is given the

00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,580
university climate here and I think

00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:59,980
Delta University is a lot of students

00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:01,900
here you guys I know our members of open

00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:04,450
Cappy for example you might be members

00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:06,430
of open power but you know you talk

00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:10,240
about how do you first off how does that

00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:12,310
how how do you contribute or whatever

00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:15,580
you know my answer is get involved right

00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:16,840
I mean it's okay right just just if open

00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:18,250
powers got something running get

00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:20,410
involved because you know you guys

00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:22,300
already signed up and and your members

00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:23,650
of these consortiums both of them so

00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:25,660
leverage that right so it'd be the

00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:27,490
that'd be the obvious answer whatever

00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:30,010
exists today go ahead and leverage it

00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:32,050
but there will be a point in time and in

00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:33,370
fact as we speak that we're working on a

00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:35,110
formal agreement between the two

00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:37,060
consortiums called they called my

00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:39,850
liaison agreement and you'll see this

00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:41,620
between organizations you know open

00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:43,930
Cappy has a liaison agreement now with

00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:47,170
JEDEC we have a liaison agreement with

00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:48,310
PCI your organization pci-sig and now

00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:50,290
the next one's gonna be with the open

00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:51,940
power foundation and that's just a nice

00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:53,830
formal way of saying how are we gonna

00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:55,360
play together and so we're actually

00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:58,090
working through that right now as we

00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,680
speak literally and so you know that

00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:01,660
would formalize how this will be

00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,700
structured eventually and and help us

00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:05,710
get in that direction but this is one of

00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:07,690
the few areas that we just haven't quite

00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:09,820
got enough time underneath our belt

00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:17,740
right now to give you a solid answer all

00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:18,640
right so just as no ambiguity but I

00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,560
think that's a good way to characterize

00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,070
there's there's no sense of it not

00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,600
happening

00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:26,100
there's no did no point of disagreement

00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:27,950
it's just merely a crunch-crunch-crunch

00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:30,360
yeah

00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:32,800
[Laughter]

00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:35,050
so you want the technical answer Alenia

00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:37,719
really see this is the problem with

00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:39,550
standards the business processes get in

00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:44,139
the way the lawyers get in the way of

00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:45,579
the practical problem so I for those you

00:08:44,139 --> 00:08:47,470
that don't know I'm the chairman of the

00:08:45,579 --> 00:08:48,339
accelerator where a group took it on I

00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:49,959
guess

00:08:48,339 --> 00:08:55,420
must be 2 or 4 years ago now it seems a

00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:57,130
long time and maybe it's a bit of a

00:08:55,420 --> 00:09:01,570
background accelerator workgroup was

00:08:57,130 --> 00:09:04,149
initially formed really to bring the PSL

00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:07,089
to AF you interface a capi interface a

00:09:04,149 --> 00:09:08,980
copy 1.0 to the community get it

00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:11,019
documented in and so that people could

00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:13,480
start working to it so it had some very

00:09:11,019 --> 00:09:16,149
basic fundamentals of the interface

00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:18,130
itself it wasn't it was so people could

00:09:16,149 --> 00:09:21,459
start doing acceleration with this

00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:23,050
interface so it was was which which was

00:09:21,459 --> 00:09:24,160
its remit any when we did a good job of

00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:25,990
that

00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:31,209
it that that then followed through with

00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:32,829
capi to do and and as well we had the

00:09:31,209 --> 00:09:33,940
hardware reference guide so if you're

00:09:32,829 --> 00:09:35,920
gonna if you want to build your own

00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:39,579
hardware accelerator now that second

00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:42,459
alpha data and an IBM and Germany Herald

00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:44,170
fuels we all got together and got a spec

00:09:42,459 --> 00:09:46,029
out for if you're going to build a cabby

00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:48,940
to dog card this is this is these are

00:09:46,029 --> 00:09:52,420
the features you need to comply with so

00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:54,010
the the the reason for the accelerator

00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:58,000
workgroup made a lot of sense then and

00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:59,620
then we progressed on with the coming up

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,269
with Cappy snap we needed some

00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:04,600
programming frameworks to make it a bit

00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:06,579
easier for for for you guys to be able

00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:09,010
to get it the accelerator and not start

00:10:06,579 --> 00:10:10,630
from start from the start from scratch

00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:12,940
so that's where Cappy snap came from

00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:16,209
lots of effort from IBM Germany

00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:20,410
delivering into that and and that was

00:10:16,209 --> 00:10:22,149
really where we got to when suddenly

00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:24,040
opened Cappy which was the next

00:10:22,149 --> 00:10:27,069
generation we will be working on exactly

00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:30,310
the same stuff again open Cathy got

00:10:27,069 --> 00:10:32,319
formed so I immediately raised the flag

00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:34,269
and said hey guys what's gonna happen

00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:38,649
here so that was provar a year ago now

00:10:34,269 --> 00:10:41,470
as well so um all i said i said all i

00:10:38,649 --> 00:10:42,310
care about is that we don't bifurcate

00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:44,560
energy

00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:46,720
or duplicate energies let's just make

00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,610
sure if you own that we're gonna do the

00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,980
same thing your and will will work with

00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:53,350
you so so it's you know I don't

00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:54,910
particularly care where it resides all I

00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:56,830
want to do is make sure that we don't

00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:59,980
have two separate bodies doing two

00:10:56,830 --> 00:11:02,260
separate things and just if I may and

00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:03,490
this is by the way this is a very active

00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:05,140
conversation I've already haven't

00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:10,120
probably four or five conversations of

00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:14,200
this in the last three days and five oh

00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:17,260
and I never just to add another nuance

00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:19,600
to this we've got the I know this Peters

00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:22,839
horror as well we've also got the memory

00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,880
side of open copy the 3.1 and we've got

00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:27,970
the traditional accelerator side which

00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:30,910
is 3.0 now I think we're here is just a

00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:34,450
result of pragmatism is why we are where

00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:38,440
we are but but again I work with Kevin

00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:40,060
McLean who run it does a lot as a

00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:42,010
technical contribution on on the memory

00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:43,300
work group so we've got to work group

00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:45,160
some memory we're a group and the

00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:47,440
accelerator we're a group but really

00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:49,390
that memory work group is God

00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:52,750
acceleration in it and it's looking at

00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:54,580
non-standard memories and and I just see

00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:58,120
it is the same and if we're looking at a

00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:59,530
data centric world then the data needs

00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,910
to be in the center which means the

00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:03,130
memory needs to me to be in the center

00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:05,380
and storage is now memory so the storage

00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:07,180
needs to be in the center and we've got

00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:09,700
to give up being a processor and

00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:11,080
therefore everything centered we're at

00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:15,640
the center which is a difficult thing

00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:18,010
for a processor company so so in my mind

00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:19,570
I'm I was I've been saying hey we need

00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:21,400
to bring the memory work group and the

00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:23,980
accelerator work group under one hood as

00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:28,600
well so I put all of these I roll all of

00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:29,980
these together open the open copy team

00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,900
and now are talking about an

00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:33,970
acceleration work group and a memory

00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:36,310
were a group we have one in open power

00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:40,510
and we do need to converge these that

00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:42,010
that's an absolute must and and yeah we

00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:46,600
need to conserve our energy and pull

00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:48,100
together and I you know again the the

00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,950
separation from the memory and the

00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:53,050
accelerator work group I think if

00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:56,140
clearly memory folk have a very good

00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:58,540
understanding of memory but

00:12:56,140 --> 00:13:00,700
all we need to do is be in the same room

00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:02,980
to understand each other as challenges

00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:05,050
to come up with solutions in fact one of

00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:06,820
the last presentations it the chat that

00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:09,550
was talking about the memory so the

00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:12,940
things he's hit on the button there you

00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:14,620
know so I really think that we this this

00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:18,130
is a one chance for us to get this right

00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:19,810
guys and sorry but but legals and all

00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:22,329
that I know I know we have to follow it

00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:26,920
but for the good of the technology we

00:13:22,329 --> 00:13:28,779
got sort of a I think we're actually

00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:30,850
we're in sync I agree with you and by

00:13:28,779 --> 00:13:32,950
the way this whole idea of the

00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:34,630
convergence convergence of those two

00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:36,130
work groups that happen to exist in open

00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:37,930
power today the memory and accelerator

00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:39,370
work group that doesn't make sense we

00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:41,320
will talk a little bit about that on the

00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:42,820
peripheral to that it says maybe this

00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,350
should be of a combine because exactly

00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:46,990
what you just said it's all becoming

00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:48,339
that data centric world so yeah so I

00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:50,380
think this is the stuff that we have to

00:13:48,339 --> 00:13:52,360
walk through and and and rationalize

00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:54,250
this and see how it plays out whatever

00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:55,990
it is but I totally agree on the

00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,940
redundancy or a duplicate efforts that

00:13:55,990 --> 00:14:01,050
that's that's an absolute no-no so we

00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:05,380
could totally avoid that one I agree

00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:07,990
before I pass it to Vanessa and I do

00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:10,000
want to comment one thing with which to

00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:14,290
me seems like we are getting it right so

00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:17,529
I'm very happy that that that's you know

00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:19,870
with snap we're giving people a smooth

00:14:17,529 --> 00:14:21,820
transition right not not just from Kathy

00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:25,180
one point over to Kathy 2.04 Tom caffee

00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:27,399
2.02 album Kathy so that that to me

00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:32,529
looks like one that we that we actually

00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:34,360
got right I would absolutely agree we

00:14:32,529 --> 00:14:35,740
actually haven't gone off in in

00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,899
different directions I don't think we

00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:40,420
have yet but we've been talking about

00:14:37,899 --> 00:14:42,279
what are we gonna do to pull this

00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:50,110
together and I think that that's you

00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:53,620
know we need to just so Denise um who

00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:56,199
you know actually introduced himself

00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:59,130
this morning already but so he's a

00:14:56,199 --> 00:15:01,870
co-chair of the academic work group so

00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:04,720
you're welcome to comment on the

00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:08,440
previous discussion but let me also kind

00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:11,590
of kick kick kick off another thread

00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:14,710
here you know with all the events that

00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:17,980
you organize around the world you know

00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:21,160
of course you more than most of us get

00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:23,860
get to see you know what is what is

00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:26,530
helping the academic community and what

00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:28,240
maybe they still need so you know maybe

00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:29,890
you can make some comments on that and

00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:34,390
then you know we'll pass the microphone

00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:37,110
down thanks Peter anyway I've been

00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:40,600
working with Peter especially on this

00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:42,840
open power academia related activities

00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:47,860
you know for the last four years and

00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:50,320
anyway so overall like you know people

00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:52,090
do you know get the point you know what

00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,100
what we are communicating to them like

00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:55,960
you know about you know the open pore

00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:58,030
system and you know the features and all

00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:59,560
the stuff but there are a couple of

00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:01,750
things you know people do want it like

00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:03,640
you know I'm talking about you know most

00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:08,740
of the places in the country I mean in

00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:11,350
the in the world India Singapore some

00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:13,870
places in South Africa and Europe and

00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:15,970
the US and even South America too

00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:18,520
recently you know I had a opportunity to

00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:22,120
talk to them and do a WebEx for them on

00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:24,310
open power-related things so they they

00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:26,140
are looking at you know like you know

00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:28,180
kind of you know a platform you know for

00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:31,240
them to collaborate I mean they wanted

00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:33,640
Hardware access the system access both

00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:37,090
you know the power line hardware as well

00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:39,250
as the capi adware and that is where you

00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:41,530
know we are we have been you know

00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:42,970
working out on a plan and seeing you

00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:43,630
know how we can make the systems

00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:46,060
available

00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:48,700
you know because you most of the

00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:51,220
developers know do want to get and so on

00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:53,740
you know to that and even today we are

00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:55,990
running a parallel session here a for

00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:57,940
good I know like a thorn for they're

00:16:55,990 --> 00:17:00,520
also getting hardware access is not an

00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:02,290
easy one within IBM and even you know

00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:06,100
with our partners - from our partners -

00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:08,740
but that's a number one you know a thing

00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:11,620
you know everyone wants it and we are

00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:13,510
working on a plan I do see you know some

00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:16,660
of the good people you know who are

00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:18,699
sharing even you know we there are some

00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:20,620
clients ready to share the hardware

00:17:18,699 --> 00:17:21,920
that's another thing you know which I

00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:24,560
got it done you know

00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:27,620
or this a cat on one of the clans in the

00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:30,680
US now sharing the hardware for the

00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:32,660
hackathon like that we we need more of

00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:35,300
more clients also you know sharing the

00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:37,760
hardware for their other developers to

00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:41,840
get on and you know making the platform

00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:43,850
more available for you know developing

00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,200
new applications and all and that's a

00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:48,590
one number one thing you know I'd like

00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:50,510
to mention about it and also there are

00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:53,150
countries you know where you know the

00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:54,920
students and Achra machines do want to

00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:56,810
look at you know curriculum like you

00:17:54,920 --> 00:18:00,560
know they want to do like you know they

00:17:56,810 --> 00:18:02,750
have as part of your degree you know

00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:05,270
that you must program or bachelor's

00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:07,700
program they have curriculums right they

00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:10,700
also wanted to see any of these features

00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:15,740
whatever you know as part of the power

00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:18,740
technology in their curriculum and as as

00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:20,450
a you know kind of a action to it you

00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:23,270
know I did work with you know couple of

00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:25,940
academics worldwide and you know put

00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:30,110
together a curriculum for AI as well as

00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:32,090
the the cap itself on power platform and

00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:34,730
you know maybe you know if you guys want

00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:38,510
to know more about it we can share those

00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:40,700
curriculum to even we need more people

00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:42,560
to collaborate on that platform you know

00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:44,570
on the curriculum platform it's not that

00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:47,150
you know one professors thought you know

00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:48,830
should get into the curriculum I'd like

00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:51,040
to invite you know all of you you know

00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:52,880
to contribute you know some of the good

00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,630
topics you know as part of the

00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,480
curriculum too

00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:58,640
these are the two things I really feel

00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:01,250
that you know will take to the next

00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:04,100
level like a curriculum plus the

00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:08,990
platform availability for them to go and

00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:10,700
do some kind of practical things that's

00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:12,650
you know that's the two points you know

00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:14,690
I just I'd like to mention yeah

00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:16,520
so I have something similar but in

00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:19,550
manner but I first off let me just say

00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:22,310
that academia is participation in these

00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:25,070
organizations I think is vital not only

00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:26,690
not only does it we all selfishly not

00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:28,490
only does it help the consortium's or

00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:30,200
the foundations but it also help you

00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:32,540
guys like as you get ready for industry

00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:34,460
you get you get a real sense a real

00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:35,480
touch and feel of the different issues

00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:37,909
that are facing

00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:39,830
industry in general and especially as we

00:19:37,909 --> 00:19:41,690
try to I'm gonna say improve our

00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:43,429
products and improve performances etc

00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:46,490
now you can see the real challenges that

00:19:43,429 --> 00:19:47,750
we run across right so so I think it

00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:50,720
goes both ways or it helps both

00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:52,789
organizations I think I think Ghassan

00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,529
you nailed it every time and this is

00:19:52,789 --> 00:19:56,240
this is unfortunately this is just the

00:19:54,529 --> 00:19:58,940
way it is when you introduce a brand new

00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:01,370
technology brand new machines brand new

00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:04,010
processors what have you there's always

00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:06,230
this front up pent up the demand right

00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:08,210
and so you could never make enough of

00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:10,570
these fast enough and get this deploy

00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:12,860
fast enough for multiple reasons right

00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:15,529
but this is this is another example

00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:17,480
where it's a little bit starved in the

00:20:15,529 --> 00:20:19,809
front end to try to get systems and

00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:22,690
availability out there I do know that

00:20:19,809 --> 00:20:25,880
there's one individual back in Austin

00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:28,429
that is working very hard to set up

00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:30,110
something up in a cloud environment so

00:20:28,429 --> 00:20:33,070
that universities for example will have

00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:35,899
access direct access to power systems

00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:37,850
with now the systems but you know with

00:20:35,899 --> 00:20:41,299
the capi Hardware in their accelerators

00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:43,309
that you could you know work on remotely

00:20:41,299 --> 00:20:46,519
but but that's okay it's a good start

00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:49,250
and so that's our front up plan right

00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:51,559
now is to do something like that and put

00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:53,240
this in a cloud environment so that all

00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:55,460
universities would have a generally an

00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:57,200
access to this thing so that's that's

00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:59,269
our our front approach but eventually

00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,789
when Hardware becomes a little more

00:20:59,269 --> 00:21:04,250
abundant then you know we could even you

00:21:01,789 --> 00:21:05,570
know give it to you know this widely

00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:09,789
spread a little bit further than beyond

00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:09,789
just a one cloud environment so yeah

00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:18,139
yeah so again my focus is on this

00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:21,639
accelerator workgroup and as we've grown

00:21:18,139 --> 00:21:24,860
we've been really the last six months

00:21:21,639 --> 00:21:26,630
we've been trying to get we've been

00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:28,940
we've been buried in the hardware in the

00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:31,100
interface and that then we got to the

00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:33,889
cat that the Cappy snap framework to

00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:36,110
give people a little bit more access to

00:21:33,889 --> 00:21:37,789
the programmability but there is still a

00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:40,370
lot more work to be done certainly on

00:21:37,789 --> 00:21:42,769
the software stack side of things and on

00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:45,110
and how do you bring libraries and

00:21:42,769 --> 00:21:46,370
third-party compilers properly supported

00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:47,929
in there is there are some frameworks

00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:49,030
and other interfaces that we need to

00:21:47,929 --> 00:21:52,120
have

00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:56,320
in in this overall stack to really make

00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:59,230
the FPGA more accessible as a software

00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:02,530
programmable processor in in in the

00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:06,100
grand scheme of things so our workgroup

00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:08,470
is is going through this process right

00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:10,480
now of trying to reinvent ourselves and

00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:11,710
we are at we are recruiting we've had

00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,030
some open meetings whether the

00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:17,020
universities some of you may have

00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:19,810
attended and and and we've managed to

00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:21,790
recruit a few more people but we want to

00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:24,070
start building on this and getting get

00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:26,560
getting the infrastructure of the

00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:28,150
accelerator Beit know we've opened Cappy

00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:30,280
that's can you know Cappy snap is

00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:33,850
already under development to support

00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:36,040
open Cappy but to build the overall

00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:38,410
framework so Bruno's gave you a good

00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:40,480
rundown of things they've been done

00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:43,900
heard a couple of papers here today

00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:46,330
where you guys are already adding extra

00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:48,100
tools potentially on top of this if we

00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:52,510
can maybe bring these into our workgroup

00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:55,060
and and you know you you'll all be off

00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:56,800
on slightly different tangents but if we

00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:59,410
can say what are the common elements and

00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:01,300
how do we build common interfaces so

00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:05,050
with sockets so we can easily plug you

00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:07,210
in without too much pain I think but we

00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:09,010
need better we need a new skill set we

00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:12,670
need software people we need firmware

00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:17,200
people we need a compiler people and a

00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:19,840
bit like you know between open copy and

00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,700
memory and an acceleration these lower

00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,830
levels we just need that same sort of

00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:25,810
collaboration and discussion it the

00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:28,300
higher levels the next layers above capi

00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:31,420
snap to really make this thing and make

00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:34,000
it easy for a falter to use and I really

00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:37,810
think an ecosystem approach to this you

00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,190
know we've had 30 years we raff of this

00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:41,560
is the way you do it the big guys

00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:44,110
telling us how to do it open power is

00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:45,580
here saying come on community we want

00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:47,560
you to do this it's been fantastic

00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:47,920
that's why I've put so much energy into

00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,780
it

00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:51,340
and we need by the way we need

00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:53,740
youngblood as I see a lot of young blood

00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:57,610
over there with enthusiasm to come and

00:23:53,740 --> 00:24:00,220
join us in there that that's really my

00:23:57,610 --> 00:24:02,350
my goal is is is build a real ecosystem

00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:04,779
around this where the best x

00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:06,100
in the world can play together and we

00:24:04,779 --> 00:24:09,779
can all make a bit of a profit rather

00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:09,779
than just one company making the profit

00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:18,460
so you you said about you know we need

00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:20,259
people on different areas right but when

00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:22,149
I when I reach out you know a lot of

00:24:20,259 --> 00:24:25,419
interns I mean a lot of students you

00:24:22,149 --> 00:24:31,179
know they do want internship like you

00:24:25,419 --> 00:24:33,669
know from IBM so is there a way we can

00:24:31,179 --> 00:24:35,200
think about you know providing some kind

00:24:33,669 --> 00:24:37,509
of internship for the people so that

00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:42,220
they can dedicatedly work on this

00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:48,669
platform I think that's a fantastic idea

00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:50,620
and just in my organization were now

00:24:48,669 --> 00:24:54,850
part of a much bigger company I'd like

00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:56,769
to think that I can but yeah no no I

00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:58,899
said well I think it takes us alright

00:24:56,769 --> 00:25:04,259
and and it can't be just IBM all the

00:24:58,899 --> 00:25:07,029
time so so but but but for sure I I

00:25:04,259 --> 00:25:08,919
truly believe in that myself and you

00:25:07,029 --> 00:25:11,649
know small companies is tough for them

00:25:08,919 --> 00:25:15,070
to contribute to to these open source

00:25:11,649 --> 00:25:17,769
and one of the problems we've run in a

00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:19,889
standards group is you know if there's a

00:25:17,769 --> 00:25:22,480
commercial opportunity it comes along

00:25:19,889 --> 00:25:24,580
the companies they're involved tend to

00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,990
huddle under NDA and they want to make

00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:27,509
money on that commercial and last thing

00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:31,179
they want to do is push it into the

00:25:27,509 --> 00:25:32,769
Infinity standards body and but what I'm

00:25:31,179 --> 00:25:35,230
trying to get people to understand is

00:25:32,769 --> 00:25:37,659
the interface is between we innovate

00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:40,840
we've all got our own specializations

00:25:37,659 --> 00:25:42,940
all of us and we make money out of our

00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:45,340
particular knowledge in depth in our

00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:48,159
particular piece but if we can't plug

00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:50,950
into our neighbors then we're then we're

00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:52,899
dead in the water and so what we need to

00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:54,220
do is is when you when you huddle off

00:25:52,899 --> 00:25:56,620
when you've got your multi-million

00:25:54,220 --> 00:26:00,009
dollar opportunity I want people to be

00:25:56,620 --> 00:26:01,809
thinking about well ok how do we fit

00:26:00,009 --> 00:26:04,389
what is that where is the value for us

00:26:01,809 --> 00:26:07,029
that we want to protect and what can we

00:26:04,389 --> 00:26:09,610
push back into the workgroup and back

00:26:07,029 --> 00:26:12,490
into the community to better to help

00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:15,039
others succeed and then guarantee our

00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:16,060
success and that's what on ecosystems

00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:19,530
really all

00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:22,690
though and that's and it's tough

00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:25,050
whispered but by the way we started I

00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:29,320
was one of the guys it started open fpga

00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:32,380
fifteen years ago and in this was all

00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:34,390
about computing and it was just 15 20

00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:36,640
small companies we didn't have a

00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:39,220
benevolent dictator as i'd like to call

00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:41,110
IBM because you know if if it isn't for

00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:44,860
these big companies IBM are plowing

00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:47,170
millions just capi snap alone you know

00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:51,010
that the end the amount of investment is

00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:52,570
unbelievable and you know and but it is

00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:55,210
tough when you're when you're a small

00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:56,920
commercial company it's is you know you

00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:59,020
you strike every day to make it patrol

00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:00,970
and make a profit and what what happened

00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:02,650
with open fpga we had infusing our

00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:04,990
competitors and everything I don't fusee

00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:07,030
acetic discussions but then we went home

00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:09,490
and did our day job and we we completely

00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:11,800
forgot about the the open FPGA you need

00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:14,200
that big pivot benevolent dictator to to

00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:16,780
help you get it going iBM has done that

00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:19,500
we need to start picking up the picking

00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:22,150
up the shovel and working together

00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:25,270
internships I think a great and I

00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:26,800
believe me enison I do my best

00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:28,780
and maybe I'm gonna make more progress

00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:30,730
as things develop because we are getting

00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:33,040
lots more investment coming in but it's

00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:35,560
a slow process there but I'll be the

00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:40,120
first to do it if I can if I can get the

00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:41,470
resources myself yeah not sure I can add

00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:43,780
much to this particular thread but I

00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:45,340
think one of the things in one thing one

00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:46,270
thread I would pick up on though is the

00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:48,550
general question and machine

00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:51,190
availability because we see that just in

00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:52,750
straightforward over open power but one

00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:55,540
of the things I certainly been trying to

00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:57,580
do within the foundation is encourage

00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:59,650
members to bring low low cost platforms

00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:02,230
to market as well now that doesn't solve

00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:04,240
every single problem but simply but I've

00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:05,770
been heartened this year I must saying

00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,080
that it's nearly twelve months have been

00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:09,550
in the role the number of members of

00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,050
what could be inquiries we get so where

00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:12,220
do I get a check platform or you know

00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:13,990
I'm interested in bringing one of these

00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:15,040
smack oh okay look you I need to talk

00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:16,600
you need to go and talk to this other

00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:18,790
member and that's that's about some

00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:20,230
useful conversations and there's some

00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:21,580
equipment down on the exhibition floor

00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:24,190
that sort of demonstrates that so I

00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:26,320
think that's true for power mainstream

00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:27,760
over power I think we need a similar

00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,200
thing I think for it to facilitate open

00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:36,399
can be kind of work

00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:37,179
as well maybe and I'll get to you in a

00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:42,639
second

00:28:37,179 --> 00:28:47,649
thank you for question I just just to

00:28:42,639 --> 00:28:50,500
follow up on what you said right so I do

00:28:47,649 --> 00:28:54,850
think we are making good progress

00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:59,470
actually right I think at the FPGAs

00:28:54,850 --> 00:29:01,990
and not not only snap but also like the

00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:04,779
PS LSE environment right the fact that

00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:07,120
you that you you can get started without

00:29:04,779 --> 00:29:10,809
any any access to to our special

00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:12,970
hardware it's the super vessel and NIMH

00:29:10,809 --> 00:29:15,159
bigs I think you have at least you know

00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:18,070
a couple of places to get going all the

00:29:15,159 --> 00:29:22,870
way down to to the FPGAs yes you know

00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:25,899
power nine Hardware access is something

00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:30,039
very actively working on but but

00:29:25,899 --> 00:29:33,059
hopefully that that will that that

00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:35,740
double grow as soon as well

00:29:33,059 --> 00:29:39,179
so so I don't want to give anybody the

00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:41,409
idea that there is stuff that you that

00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:43,029
that you need to get started every

00:29:41,409 --> 00:29:47,169
everything you need to get started is

00:29:43,029 --> 00:29:49,679
out there it's with power well it's even

00:29:47,169 --> 00:29:54,130
if you don't have a power box right with

00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:57,010
certain I'll pass to you there's a

00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:59,169
question about cost of entry you

00:29:57,010 --> 00:30:01,029
mentioned there it's great to see a war

00:29:59,169 --> 00:30:04,600
cost hardware and great seen the Eruptor

00:30:01,029 --> 00:30:06,220
system on display here today and come

00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:09,039
back to the first point about the open

00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:11,559
copy consortium and open power no for

00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:13,740
academics there's no cost of entry but

00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:15,970
because the two separate organizations

00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:17,470
companies have to pay two sets of

00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:20,320
memberships and that is an additional

00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:22,450
and I think unnecessary barrier to entry

00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:25,419
is there anything can be done there

00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:26,649
perhaps where as a partial fee paid when

00:30:25,419 --> 00:30:29,309
you join the second of the two

00:30:26,649 --> 00:30:29,309
organizations

00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:37,640
these questions are so easy I tell you

00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:44,460
yeah you're right actually yes there is

00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:47,520
an annual fee but at least on the open

00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:49,410
cabbie side we were we were very I would

00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,880
say sensitive to this when we

00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:52,440
benchmarked actually the other

00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,880
organizations we wanted to make sure

00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:56,130
that we weren't something that was way

00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:58,200
off the off the mark right so that's why

00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:59,370
our lowest level which still gives you

00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:01,200
all the enablement the workgroup

00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:03,540
capability especially for academics like

00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,430
that but but but that's our lowest

00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:07,560
levels like 5k here right so we thought

00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:09,420
that that would not be outlandish but

00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:10,770
yet that's enough money to cover all the

00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:12,600
infrastructure costs of having a

00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:14,190
consortium and things like that so

00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:16,440
that's kind of where we ended up on the

00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:17,730
lower level tiers the 5k so we thought

00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,570
was reasonable and that's why we kind of

00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:20,220
went forward with that

00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:22,020
now these believe me when I tell you

00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:24,720
these consortiums don't exist for free

00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:27,330
they it does cost money to run these

00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:30,000
things it really really does by the time

00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:33,200
you pay everything from you know the

00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:36,540
services fees that you have to the oh

00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:38,010
yeah here you go right okay conference

00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:39,690
rooms are lights in them that run you

00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:41,760
know I mean things like that right I

00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:43,350
mean this stuff cost money right so you

00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:46,170
know you try to you don't want to go too

00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:48,690
high but yet it does take some money to

00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:51,630
do this right you know all the systems

00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:54,480
and all the data the data systems the

00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:56,430
systems where you the repositories where

00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:58,230
all these specs are and you know the

00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:58,890
real-time a changes on the specs and

00:31:58,230 --> 00:32:00,570
things like that

00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:02,490
like I said that's all infrastructure

00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:06,390
that you have to you have to cover that

00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:08,460
cost so there is some amount of that so

00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:09,810
we try to be somewhat cost-effective I

00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:12,360
guess is the right way I'm trying to say

00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:15,000
it so we thought was is reasonably fair

00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:17,610
to go in that response now to the degree

00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,070
that some day fit ever that they ever to

00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:22,050
for whatever reason right fit if it ends

00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:23,700
up changing or you know something

00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:25,680
changes with the with the other

00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:30,720
standards I mean you know it could be

00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:31,920
not just power power and open Cathy you

00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,330
could be open Cathy and one of those

00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:35,490
other standards out there that merges

00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:37,020
right so you never know where this is

00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:39,300
going to go in terms of that so

00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:42,000
unfortunately we have what it is today

00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:44,610
with the two the two organizations but I

00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,570
can't I can't believe our one if you

00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:49,330
want to comment on that here but

00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:51,520
I mean I guess we'd broadly similar

00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:52,840
situations I've cost costs money to run

00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:54,820
the organization we yet we have been

00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:56,890
looking at membership benefits and so

00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:58,990
doing some internal work on how we how

00:32:56,890 --> 00:33:00,160
we address that the specific idea of

00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:01,930
sort of if you're a member of an

00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:04,660
organization and getting a discount on

00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:05,830
the second in a sense is certainly

00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:08,140
something an interesting one to think

00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:09,670
about that might be one form are and I'd

00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:12,000
have a have a beer about later and see

00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:12,000
if we can

00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:41,590
yeah yeah yeah and that's that's the

00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:44,490
question is what we have this discussion

00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:47,560
if we would be making money off of this

00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:51,130
right I think the challenge right now is

00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:54,310
that to us it's it's an unclear business

00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:57,130
which doesn't provide a big stream of

00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:58,750
revenue to us at that moment us being

00:33:57,130 --> 00:34:01,270
small companies who are driving this

00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:03,040
technology into the market because if I

00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:06,550
would be making half a million dollars

00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:08,710
of my IBM open power business I would

00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:11,560
have no problem paying this fee right

00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:13,840
but right now it's unclear to me I can't

00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:15,400
report it to my board and then bugging

00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:17,710
me why you're paying these membership

00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:19,810
fees that's I think the question so the

00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:23,530
question really is what can we as a

00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:29,320
community do to grow this into wealthy

00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:32,830
business for all of us well said and

00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:34,480
Rick I mean if if we were if we were all

00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:36,310
getting a bucketload to return out of

00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:38,890
the investment then but but equally

00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:41,020
there's a catch-22 situation right and

00:34:38,890 --> 00:34:43,300
we all recognize that I mean you know

00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:44,620
for me you know you've just got a look

00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:46,990
at the power processor versus a

00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:49,090
competition there you know you can see

00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:52,600
the potential okay you've got this

00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:54,550
legacy of everything you know x86 almost

00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:58,240
stuff runs on x86 so it's very difficult

00:34:54,550 --> 00:35:00,370
every win is a hard fall win but when

00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:02,680
people start looking

00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:04,750
hopeful that number one in number of

00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:07,060
free in the top 500 is is at least

00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:09,790
waking people up say oh I should I

00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:11,200
shouldn't at least take a look because I

00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:17,050
think they'll be impressed with what

00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:19,990
they see and you know intel with the

00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:23,860
front we nanotech worked with Intel to

00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:26,620
put an FPGA into a Xeon socket in 2007

00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:28,000
we've got a decade and it was a

00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:30,550
nightmare in fact I gave a presentation

00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,670
at OCP in March this year just talking

00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:36,040
about socket filler accelerators and it

00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:37,990
was you know they've been a decade at

00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:40,960
doing it they then went to MCP

00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:43,030
and they've still not released a product

00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:45,430
on it and there's a there's a myriad of

00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:47,980
issues but we've got this open cap he is

00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:51,280
essentially completely open completely

00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:52,930
free bus and and and and and open power

00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:56,440
has executed this and we've got it to

00:35:52,930 --> 00:36:00,540
play with and it's a game changer i

00:35:56,440 --> 00:36:03,090
think is in moving the architect in so I

00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:07,150
fundamentally believe in the technology

00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:10,690
clearly clearly there is market momentum

00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:12,340
and issues and I think saying for you

00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:15,490
David I mean you you guys put a lot of

00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:19,300
effort into this as well so it's it's a

00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:20,830
case of wait for it wait for and but by

00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:22,680
the way you know and Rick and Frank you

00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:25,720
Emily fridge for joining our workgroup

00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:28,210
we need talent like yours and I noticed

00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:30,070
it's a tough one but please come in

00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:34,060
there and keep us going and the more

00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:36,460
people we get they have a desire to for

00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:38,470
this to be successful just give us a

00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:40,480
little bit of your time guys and and and

00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:42,490
and the universe is I think they're

00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:44,560
they're the best of being in it being

00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:46,000
independent and not you know they're

00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:49,330
they're there for research and they're

00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,400
there for development so I think that we

00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:53,740
were getting to a critical stage now

00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:56,020
there's the power nine is a beast it's

00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:57,880
rolling into full production and I think

00:36:56,020 --> 00:37:00,370
now is the time where we can begin to

00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:02,560
start to see some revenue traction but I

00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:04,150
get the impression it's probably still a

00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:06,160
little bit more of a 6 or a 12 month

00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:10,810
wait wait for it before we really start

00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:13,290
to see the traction comment about this

00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:16,440
and I think you already said it right

00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:18,990
that I mean there's a lot of product

00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:22,380
quality hardware available especially

00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:24,420
with it you know if you open copy FPGA

00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:28,860
cards is not just ones like you know

00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:32,670
half a dozen right and and certainly on

00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:36,330
you know only hibm side you know we see

00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:39,720
all kinds of opportunities but but but

00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:42,600
we are resource constrained in chasing

00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:45,480
all of them you know we so so so so if

00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:49,020
if somebody goes off you know and takes

00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:51,150
a system you know either one of the from

00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:53,700
from the other vendors or or an IBM

00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:56,100
system and add some of these open Cathy

00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:58,230
cards and forges a new market you know

00:37:56,100 --> 00:38:05,580
it will at least from our side we will

00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:10,530
be cheering you know so so III I do and

00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:15,810
and and and and you know I I do already

00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:18,510
see significant examples of customers

00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:21,720
that are saying okay the growth from and

00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:24,090
and that's goes back to this Hennessy

00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:27,180
Patterson comment right but but very

00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:30,390
concretely now you know the growth in

00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:32,190
performance from one generation of the

00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:34,470
server platform to the next right

00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:36,540
without acceleration just isn't cutting

00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:39,750
it for me I have problems you know I

00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:41,280
have to you know I have to give a

00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:42,810
response to somebody who is doing

00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:45,900
something on their cell phone you know

00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:47,430
within so many milliseconds and and and

00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:50,160
and and I just can't do it

00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:52,320
and and and people a lot of folks are

00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:55,170
beginning to look a lot more seriously

00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:59,610
at that acceleration and they have for

00:38:55,170 --> 00:39:02,300
some time okay other questions this was

00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:05,690
already quite a bit of good discussion

00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:05,690
ok Evo

00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:12,220
so you've all been talking about you

00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:14,200
know that the community the community

00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:15,640
need that needs to help us I'm more or

00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:19,480
less talking about the open Cappy

00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:20,920
consortium and we've seen our a couple

00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:22,960
of projects here today at least they

00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:26,140
will talk more tomorrow how can these

00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:28,060
people really contribute I mean there's

00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:29,650
not like on the open Cappy website the

00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:31,210
list of here are some github

00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:35,890
repositories of examples of people

00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:38,820
already using open Cappy with something

00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:42,520
how do you done really plan on

00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:47,770
showcasing open Cappy or or integrating

00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:49,510
the community more more tightly so I'll

00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:53,460
give one very easy answer and that is

00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:53,460
that we're recording the talks here

00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:05,110
actually again going back to my earlier

00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:08,920
comment about academia being free

00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:11,500
membership right you you could actually

00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:13,570
get on a website and get access to in

00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:16,210
visibility to all the work groups that

00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:17,920
are progressing today so it takes a

00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:19,240
little bit energy on your side right no

00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,560
one's gonna hand this to you right you

00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:22,840
got to go on our website you have to

00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:24,970
register underneath the university guys

00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:27,670
are already members of the consortium

00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:30,040
and when you go once you're once you're

00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:32,080
in that website and you now have access

00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:34,420
to the full database you could see all

00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:36,460
the active work groups that are underway

00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:38,710
right now and and you could join you

00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:39,940
just simply join the work group and you

00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:41,530
can see what activities are playing in

00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:43,240
those different areas the other thing is

00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:45,550
that if you go to the website actually

00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:48,070
there's banners right in the front of

00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:50,440
the website and all the products that

00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:53,800
are released today with open cafe a

00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:55,900
flash buy on the very front page ok so

00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:57,070
that's another way you know finding out

00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:59,980
what what projects are actually being

00:40:57,070 --> 00:41:01,720
released out there today so but anyway

00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:03,280
that the obvious one is just jump into

00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:04,810
the website and just join a work group

00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:06,490
if there's something in particular of

00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:07,900
interest and you'd say you know how do

00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:10,830
you contribute that would be the obvious

00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:10,830
step to take they

00:41:18,989 --> 00:41:24,880
yeah so you are specifically open Cappy

00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:26,799
and so from an accelerator perspective

00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:29,019
there's like there's the accelerator one

00:41:26,799 --> 00:41:30,910
in open copy and the memory one an

00:41:29,019 --> 00:41:33,670
accelerator and memory one in the open

00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:34,959
power so I'd say you know I'm the only

00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:37,269
game in town right now

00:41:34,959 --> 00:41:39,219
well no not no and Kevin is with the

00:41:37,269 --> 00:41:40,859
memory one as well so Kevin and me but

00:41:39,219 --> 00:41:43,349
we talk regularly and we're trying to

00:41:40,859 --> 00:41:47,499
well maybe we'll have a discussion later

00:41:43,349 --> 00:41:51,549
but but feel free to join our workgroup

00:41:47,499 --> 00:41:53,880
and but I think the biggest thing is you

00:41:51,549 --> 00:41:56,979
know in everything you've been doing

00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:59,589
you clearly I'm sure you had challenges

00:41:56,979 --> 00:42:02,349
I'm sure you said why isn't that there

00:41:59,589 --> 00:42:03,999
for me to to make my life more easy you

00:42:02,349 --> 00:42:05,619
know at the interface of where you so

00:42:03,999 --> 00:42:09,400
you're focused on what you're trying to

00:42:05,619 --> 00:42:11,739
do and understanding what you're trying

00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:15,999
to do and what your challenges are will

00:42:11,739 --> 00:42:18,489
help us as a workgroup say ok we see

00:42:15,999 --> 00:42:20,229
other people and if other people similar

00:42:18,489 --> 00:42:20,920
to yourself come in and say yeah that's

00:42:20,229 --> 00:42:22,509
my problem

00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:25,809
and we have had some of those going on

00:42:22,509 --> 00:42:28,599
in fact just when with MLE alpha data

00:42:25,809 --> 00:42:30,249
and they were talking about the N in

00:42:28,599 --> 00:42:32,680
snap the network that they're working on

00:42:30,249 --> 00:42:34,809
together and then reconfigure i/o that

00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:37,539
does a go compiler to the FPGA jumped up

00:42:34,809 --> 00:42:39,219
and said oh can I get and suddenly he

00:42:37,539 --> 00:42:42,279
was interested now that this is a guy

00:42:39,219 --> 00:42:43,660
that dropped us for Amazon f1 and I

00:42:42,279 --> 00:42:46,390
don't think he's making any money I have

00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:50,140
animals in f1 over but it looks at the

00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:52,539
carrot looked bigger so so so we just by

00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:54,819
the fact of of Emily and alpha data

00:42:52,539 --> 00:42:56,709
working together call this compiler

00:42:54,819 --> 00:42:58,930
going to get excited because he wants to

00:42:56,709 --> 00:43:00,489
add that into his compiler so and he

00:42:58,930 --> 00:43:02,440
sees that as he's getting value because

00:43:00,489 --> 00:43:04,150
he's getting that for free if these guys

00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:05,529
are prepared to donate that piece of it

00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:07,599
the interface piece to the consortium

00:43:05,529 --> 00:43:09,670
right so you're clearly doing something

00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:11,739
you've got problems and so the rest of

00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:14,079
the people here and I think if we can

00:43:11,739 --> 00:43:16,660
just all get in a room together and hear

00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:18,789
each other we all get the direction and

00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:20,769
we all know what pieces we because I

00:43:18,789 --> 00:43:23,469
don't know I don't have the answers but

00:43:20,769 --> 00:43:25,509
a we all find out what what the problem

00:43:23,469 --> 00:43:25,930
areas are and what the interface areas

00:43:25,509 --> 00:43:28,420
are

00:43:25,930 --> 00:43:30,760
and maybe we can all agree let's make

00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:31,900
this piece open and I want it to look

00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:34,210
like this and you want it to look like

00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:37,090
that oh I see let's make it look like

00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:38,950
that you know so that's what the that's

00:43:37,090 --> 00:43:59,740
that would be a standard body operon on

00:43:38,950 --> 00:44:03,130
on four cylinders or so just a little

00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:06,880
comment on contribution from academia so

00:44:03,130 --> 00:44:08,410
we had had a situation where we got well

00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:10,240
I don't know if it's a correct

00:44:08,410 --> 00:44:12,730
expression to say we got slightly

00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:15,130
intimidated or irritated what would be

00:44:12,730 --> 00:44:19,060
the best way to contribute so we had

00:44:15,130 --> 00:44:21,700
this project running that we call metal

00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:24,490
FS which is basically a near storage

00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:26,320
abstraction built on top of copy snap so

00:44:24,490 --> 00:44:30,400
so there will be a talk tomorrow about

00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:33,910
that so we were wondering where should

00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:36,760
we house or we wanted to move the code

00:44:33,910 --> 00:44:38,970
into public domain and through the IBM

00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:42,580
Germany colleagues that we are

00:44:38,970 --> 00:44:44,830
collaborating with we were asking why

00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:47,410
should we put this code that it gains

00:44:44,830 --> 00:44:49,300
visibility not just for us as a

00:44:47,410 --> 00:44:51,340
university to shine but but we want to

00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:56,170
contribute to the now in this case open

00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:58,210
power consortium and the question was

00:44:56,170 --> 00:45:00,820
where to host it and there was a lot of

00:44:58,210 --> 00:45:02,260
forth and back if it should be hosted

00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:04,420
within the open power github

00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:05,980
organization or not and it turned out

00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:08,620
that in this case it wasn't a good idea

00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:10,630
but now we're really unsure how should

00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:16,530
we how should we contribute this to the

00:45:10,630 --> 00:45:16,530
open power community yeah yeah

00:45:20,069 --> 00:45:24,700
we don't necessarily have the answers to

00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:26,410
this because in fact capi snap being

00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:29,050
pushed out to github and actually being

00:45:26,410 --> 00:45:30,880
like a standalone full open sources it's

00:45:29,050 --> 00:45:32,859
not ready to be they in still needs to

00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:35,559
be nurse mated before it goes out but

00:45:32,859 --> 00:45:37,809
but these sorts of issues they're there

00:45:35,559 --> 00:45:39,940
and they'll be debated just like where

00:45:37,809 --> 00:45:42,250
does where does its work group does it

00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:46,119
we reside I think we can we can

00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:47,470
certainly you know get involved in I'm

00:45:46,119 --> 00:45:48,700
sure we can work it out I'm not

00:45:47,470 --> 00:45:52,420
necessarily the right person to work it

00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:54,339
out but but but that's the sort of thing

00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:59,200
we need to resolve and how do we get

00:45:54,339 --> 00:46:02,109
this and I think that the least we can

00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:04,030
do is and I actually really encouraged

00:46:02,109 --> 00:46:07,390
all the speakers here and I hope you do

00:46:04,030 --> 00:46:09,490
this thing same thing tomorrow you know

00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:15,010
if you have a github link you know put

00:46:09,490 --> 00:46:18,040
it up there and you know hopefully we

00:46:15,010 --> 00:46:20,559
can you know collect a collector maybe a

00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:23,440
link a page with a set of links that

00:46:20,559 --> 00:46:26,290
that I don't think runs into into

00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:33,000
barriers you know for for people to

00:46:26,290 --> 00:46:33,000
follow you and and you and then and then

00:46:36,270 --> 00:46:44,049
so so ten years ago I looked at GPUs I'm

00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:47,079
an FPGA guy so I looked at GPUs at that

00:46:44,049 --> 00:46:49,210
point of time in Nvidia drove this and

00:46:47,079 --> 00:46:51,190
openly communicated that they have about

00:46:49,210 --> 00:46:52,960
twenty to twenty-five thousand GPU

00:46:51,190 --> 00:46:56,049
programmers okay

00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:58,150
this year they basically mentioned they

00:46:56,049 --> 00:47:01,299
have half of a million up to eight

00:46:58,150 --> 00:47:03,250
hundred thousand of GPU programmers they

00:47:01,299 --> 00:47:06,369
did this by nurturing PhDs

00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:08,799
academia created forums for them to

00:47:06,369 --> 00:47:11,290
publish their work they actively

00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:13,420
solicited for work and help them

00:47:11,290 --> 00:47:16,510
contribute and and took some of the

00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:21,280
burden of publishing work away from them

00:47:16,510 --> 00:47:23,740
okay our situation here is worse not

00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:26,290
only do we have to work on a paradigm

00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:29,049
shift for heterogeneous computing but at

00:47:26,290 --> 00:47:31,810
the same time fpga czar much harder to

00:47:29,049 --> 00:47:35,050
program than GPUs ever will be

00:47:31,810 --> 00:47:38,560
okay so that's why any PhD is welcome

00:47:35,050 --> 00:47:40,900
and if open copy and an open power could

00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:43,390
support those PhDs could support

00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:45,250
academia in at least publishing this

00:47:43,390 --> 00:47:47,950
thing at a common website where you

00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:50,290
sniff around where you get inspiration

00:47:47,950 --> 00:47:51,580
maybe snippets that you could put into

00:47:50,290 --> 00:47:53,590
your projects that would be highly

00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:57,750
appreciated because guys like us

00:47:53,590 --> 00:47:57,750
we're probably sourcing from elsewhere

00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:09,370
too maybe the last question just one

00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:12,550
comment too to come back on the darlings

00:48:09,370 --> 00:48:15,040
feeder that is that can be a difficult

00:48:12,550 --> 00:48:18,550
for for small companies if you go to a

00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:20,710
partner using name leaks we can develop

00:48:18,550 --> 00:48:22,900
and make lots of experiments to discover

00:48:20,710 --> 00:48:25,000
the technology for a very low price and

00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:30,220
then you don't have to go through the

00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:32,530
Xilinx complete product fee it's a

00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:35,830
temporary solution because it just

00:48:32,530 --> 00:48:38,110
allows you to do tutorials and discover

00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:40,600
but I think it's a very good entry point

00:48:38,110 --> 00:48:42,550
which will allow you to discover the

00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:46,000
complete technology including simulation

00:48:42,550 --> 00:48:48,670
and even if boring to power is not

00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:51,130
always very easy because the resource is

00:48:48,670 --> 00:48:53,290
limited but at least for all the

00:48:51,130 --> 00:48:56,080
discovery phase I think we can forward

00:48:53,290 --> 00:48:58,360
people to this possibility because it's

00:48:56,080 --> 00:49:01,450
really a very low cost and I think we

00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:03,910
all have to gain making this limbic

00:49:01,450 --> 00:49:19,210
system working and being used more

00:49:03,910 --> 00:49:21,130
intensively readily available the

00:49:19,210 --> 00:49:24,430
hardware will be so the more that you

00:49:21,130 --> 00:49:26,560
bug them and say I want a power 9 with

00:49:24,430 --> 00:49:28,240
capi 2.0 with this card in this card in

00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:31,120
this card you're only helping yourself

00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:33,430
because then they'll come back to us to

00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:35,350
feed them with more hardware right so

00:49:33,430 --> 00:49:38,320
those requirements are definitely

00:49:35,350 --> 00:49:39,490
warranted for sure so I recommend if

00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:41,800
that's something that's of interest to

00:49:39,490 --> 00:49:44,290
you to start driving those requirements

00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:45,400
into them versus IBM being the lone

00:49:44,290 --> 00:49:50,490
voice

00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:50,490
into them so I would totally solicit

00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:55,780
again I think these are things we would

00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:58,840
all agree with so with that I would

00:49:55,780 --> 00:50:00,910
really like to thank the panel so that

00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:05,660
was wonderful and

00:50:00,910 --> 00:50:05,660
