00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:14,090
this is my first public speeches a

00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:16,640
chairman of open power and it's a great

00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:21,619
honor to make it here as a European

00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:25,369
summit and I will be unique and I will

00:00:21,619 --> 00:00:28,010
start with a very obvious statement well

00:00:25,369 --> 00:00:30,830
known that the world has changed and

00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:33,229
there today was a global technology

00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:37,819
collaboration enables the small emerging

00:00:33,229 --> 00:00:40,339
companies to be competitive on a on a

00:00:37,819 --> 00:00:44,659
market with a large traditional jion's

00:00:40,339 --> 00:00:46,309
and that become possible because the

00:00:44,659 --> 00:00:49,819
technology dramatically changed the

00:00:46,309 --> 00:00:53,389
world and the new open commercial

00:00:49,819 --> 00:00:55,339
approach allows us to make different

00:00:53,389 --> 00:00:57,109
things whether you have a leadership it

00:00:55,339 --> 00:01:00,709
can also leadership you can attract and

00:00:57,109 --> 00:01:05,390
might weigh 200 engineers you set the

00:01:00,709 --> 00:01:07,579
bright goals for you and me then here

00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:10,250
and the company I represent as a

00:01:07,579 --> 00:01:14,329
outstanding boost of that we started

00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:17,240
just four years ago and we have a

00:01:14,329 --> 00:01:20,000
certain ambitions and just the teams of

00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:23,060
talented engineers and four years later

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,579
we have a solid before over server and

00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:28,899
storage products quite innovative we

00:01:25,579 --> 00:01:30,920
have a great raving numbers we have

00:01:28,899 --> 00:01:33,350
thousands of happy customers and

00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:36,109
partners those imperatives we defined

00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:38,740
exactly the moment we founded the

00:01:36,109 --> 00:01:41,659
company was a global technological

00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:45,020
breakthrough line of our long term 200

00:01:41,659 --> 00:01:47,749
strategy at the time we had believes

00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:52,159
that open power is the open community

00:01:47,749 --> 00:01:55,969
with very promising and with a strong

00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:58,789
technology support from leaders and the

00:01:55,969 --> 00:02:02,749
great idea behind and finally I can

00:01:58,789 --> 00:02:05,409
prove yes it is and what we achieved is

00:02:02,749 --> 00:02:08,030
a proof of that the adoption of level

00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:12,140
adoption level of open source in

00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:17,080
enterprises has dramatically raised

00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:20,750
and the more businesses experienced

00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:21,950
advantages of adopting them it's a very

00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:23,930
number of reasons for that

00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:27,050
and I will focus just a few of them

00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:30,910
which are important in a in related to

00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:35,960
open power the industry standard term

00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:38,960
has become very important every custom

00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:41,780
meeting attend this question is raised

00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:44,030
how we products are industry standard

00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:48,770
how how we comply with the open

00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:53,560
standards the industry standards I think

00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:56,450
which is a define the technology future

00:02:53,560 --> 00:03:02,990
defines a vector where the technology

00:02:56,450 --> 00:03:05,120
will developed the industry standards

00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:08,420
are driven by the open communities and

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:17,390
it's very important to be aligned with

00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:19,640
all that and other things that the the

00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:21,740
source of innovation and disruption has

00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:24,740
moved from the corporations to open

00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:26,810
communities and innovation going there

00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:29,959
there is a strong demand for the

00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:33,670
attenuations everybody know that it's a

00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:37,360
new workloads unlike the traditional

00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:40,520
enterprise workloads like year PCRM

00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,800
transactional systems this new type of

00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:45,520
our quotes are very unpredictable and a

00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:47,780
very dynamic and that they already

00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:49,790
significantly shaped the infrastructure

00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:51,470
and with the modern computing storage

00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:56,090
infrastructure and very influences

00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:59,480
influenced by their this cognitive staff

00:03:56,090 --> 00:04:03,980
and memory computing I would see stream

00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:07,280
processing and as well there is a strong

00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:10,730
demand for better technology better but

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:14,330
better hardware products and sometimes

00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:16,910
it's be challenging because it's some of

00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:19,370
the technologies has already mature some

00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:24,730
of still emerging

00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:28,570
the challenge is opportunity and what

00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:32,440
what we see in what I see as a beacon

00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:34,120
right future for open power as to the

00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,950
main goal to become the leading

00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,650
compensation for the summation of all

00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:42,460
codes for this new workloads the open

00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:43,540
power architecture it offers great great

00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:45,580
performance

00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:49,210
outstanding io capabilities with

00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:52,410
acceleration faster memory bus and by

00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:55,270
leveraging this unique characteristics

00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:58,600
this next maturity face could be

00:04:55,270 --> 00:05:01,960
achieved as a bleed in open platform for

00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:04,870
new type of for codes but what is very

00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:07,840
important is to be consistent with a

00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:09,850
software ecosystem development some

00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:13,630
evaluation is required every piece of

00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:16,660
code which is enables the new workloads

00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:18,670
should be should be ported should be

00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:21,220
tested should be supported and a

00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:23,950
continuing basis so every new work code

00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:26,550
every new type of workload software

00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:30,750
stack is available in power platform and

00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:33,940
supported by the huge ecosystem of our

00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:36,910
members and that's the other important

00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:40,330
things to reach that goal according to

00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:42,420
our vision is it's time for deeper

00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:46,510
technology collaboration of the members

00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:51,120
we experience this and it's really a

00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:54,550
huge amount for that sometimes members

00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:57,520
do this you know technology problem

00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:59,560
solving outside of the scope is an open

00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:02,230
power it happens somewhere else in a

00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:05,500
linux communities or open compute

00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:08,230
communities but it's mean meanwhile the

00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:10,450
party for the members upon open power

00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:14,350
and should be some kind of technology

00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:18,370
fabric for rapid and efficient research

00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:21,160
and development and the marketing it's

00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:24,820
very important because every time I talk

00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:27,730
to customers who responding that I've

00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:29,800
never heard about open power you know I

00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:31,330
feel it's like my problem it's a

00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:35,710
foundation problem it's every memory

00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:37,010
problem that we should focus on a brand

00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:39,710
awareness of the

00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:42,380
of the open power and the technology

00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:47,060
behind and there is a number of things

00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:50,600
which we should take in mind like the

00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:55,100
use case which is most convincing proof

00:06:50,600 --> 00:07:00,680
of the technology and every member

00:06:55,100 --> 00:07:02,060
should be focused on delivering more and

00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:04,310
more information about how the

00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:08,660
technology is adopted how the products

00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:09,640
are being used by the customers thank

00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:14,320
you

00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:14,320
