Title: 2019: Introduction to OSM: How it's made and how it's used
Publication date: 2019-09-26
Playlist: SotM 2019, Day1, HÃ¶rsaal West
Description: 
	This session provides an entertaining yet informative introduction into everything you need to know about OpenStreetMap.

If you're new to OpenStreetMap, or maybe just know a little, then this session will fill you in on everything you need to know about OpenStreetMap. How did it start? How does it work? How can you contribute, and how can you use the data? What is this "Mapnik" think I keep hearing about and why do people always look at me funny when I say the license should be changed?

OpenStreetMap is not just a database or a web site; it is a living and breathing project with a huge community and a 15-year history. Rather than just showing a sequence of slides, this session will be a tour de force presented by many different individuals, where entertaining dialogue is interspersed with hands-on short demonstrations and explanations. Attendees will leave this session with a good idea of how OSM works, of how they can contribute to OSM, and of how to use its wealth of data for making their own maps or just counting post boxes in their home town. But they will also see that OSM is very much about human beings. They will learn how to become part of the community of map makers, code writers, and general activists that make OSM into the great success it is today.

the state of the map conference didn't

00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:13,860
use to have

00:00:15,019 --> 00:00:19,910
because in the early years we always

00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:23,960
assumed that everyone was coming was an

00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:25,580
OpenStreetMap geek anyway but we figured

00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:27,770
that this time with a conference that

00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:30,740
being we have a couple of people who are

00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:33,530
new to osm or who may be just coming

00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:37,510
from one very specific angle and who'd

00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:40,550
be interested in seeing a larger picture

00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:43,309
my name is Frederic ROM and I'm Thomas

00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:45,620
Kevon and we have 90 minutes together

00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:47,989
and we want to get you on a right

00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:51,559
through the OSM universe want to show

00:00:47,989 --> 00:00:55,159
you how it all started how it works how

00:00:51,559 --> 00:00:57,260
you can use it and we want to show you

00:00:55,159 --> 00:00:59,989
the idea and a couple of slides maybe

00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:08,240
yeah we we've prepared a few I would say

00:00:59,989 --> 00:01:09,760
yeah but maybe we won't put you to sleep

00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:15,350
just yet

00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:18,100
and instead on that tunnel slides and

00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:21,380
with Retton we have prepared a couple of

00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:25,719
invited a couple of guests people always

00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:30,560
say that OpenStreetMap is a map or

00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:33,109
OpenStreetMap is database but while all

00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,119
these things might be true most of all

00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:37,219
OpenStreetMap is the some of its people

00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:39,920
all the people who are building

00:01:37,219 --> 00:01:43,009
something who are doing something with

00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,359
OpenStreetMap all the mappers or people

00:01:43,009 --> 00:01:47,149
at the conference and so on and that's

00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:50,179
why we want to kind of stress the people

00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:52,609
aspect by having a couple of guests talk

00:01:50,179 --> 00:01:54,770
about what they are doing with

00:01:52,609 --> 00:01:57,140
OpenStreetMap or what they have done in

00:01:54,770 --> 00:02:00,139
the past so do we want to tell who's

00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:03,380
coming now this is yet okay okay then

00:02:00,139 --> 00:02:05,600
let's just start and we often hear this

00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:07,479
thing open stripped of their Wikimedia

00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,679
their Wikipedia of maps

00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:14,569
fortunately Wikimedia hasn't sued us for

00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:16,819
trademark yet we're on camera right so

00:02:14,569 --> 00:02:20,030
just like with Wikipedia everyone can

00:02:16,819 --> 00:02:22,430
contribute to OpenStreetMap and it's it

00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:25,070
has been an idea that has had to start

00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:27,290
and now it has to grow and spread and it

00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:31,250
evolves every year

00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:32,810
and our friends at talena they I think

00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:34,939
five years ago or something like that

00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:37,670
they made a small video about the

00:02:34,939 --> 00:02:45,319
development of OpenStreetMap across the

00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:47,329
world and you can see it and yeah this

00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:50,090
is London and now it spreads out through

00:02:47,329 --> 00:02:52,459
Central Europe now you see more of

00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:54,799
Europe and you see were like everywhere

00:02:52,459 --> 00:02:57,950
it's spreading around and there is some

00:02:54,799 --> 00:03:00,920
areas I brighter than the others and you

00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:05,359
see across the pond in the US a lot of

00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:07,340
stuff is happening and yeah we see 2010

00:03:05,359 --> 00:03:11,239
already a lot of data has been already

00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:15,439
contributed and yeah it volved every

00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:19,669
month and every day Hey and yeah as you

00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:21,859
might have seen the video has started in

00:03:19,669 --> 00:03:23,930
London because that's where open River

00:03:21,859 --> 00:03:26,620
has started everywhere on else on the

00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:30,220
planet the map was empty in 2004 and

00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:32,859
year 2004 that was when Steve Coast

00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:36,049
computer science student in London

00:03:32,859 --> 00:03:39,819
wanted to play around with geo data but

00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:43,970
really there has been any because yeah

00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:46,280
UK didn't have any open access geo data

00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:49,519
this story is a bit different in for

00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:51,919
example the US where taxpayer funded

00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,290
projects are under public domain and

00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:57,379
this hasn't really caught up in Europe's

00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:59,629
and maybe only just in the last few

00:03:57,379 --> 00:04:01,519
years and maybe that's a good thing

00:03:59,629 --> 00:04:04,040
because if they were also open data

00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:06,709
Steve Goss wouldn't have needed to do it

00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:11,959
on his own and yeah we wouldn't have

00:04:06,709 --> 00:04:14,659
some street map so feel like you're bit

00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:18,849
long around the me bit more gray hair

00:04:14,659 --> 00:04:21,919
also what what was it like back laughing

00:04:18,849 --> 00:04:26,870
well I wasn't around when the project

00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:29,860
started I joined in 2006 when when they

00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:35,500
had already done why debate in England

00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:35,500
in Council where I lived

00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:43,169
yeah that and actually Germany was

00:04:39,289 --> 00:04:45,479
relatively empty when I started so was

00:04:43,169 --> 00:04:47,849
there anything on the map yet or or

00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:50,610
didn't look like catalyst its colorful

00:04:47,849 --> 00:04:53,039
new cosmos specifically was an exception

00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:55,680
because there were a couple of active

00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:57,870
people there that had mapped quite a bit

00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,419
in console but there were many other

00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:03,539
places in Germany in 2006 where you had

00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:07,409
maybe maybe the Autobahn going past but

00:05:03,539 --> 00:05:12,300
no details whatsoever so you know in the

00:05:07,409 --> 00:05:13,889
early days we didn't it's not like today

00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:16,020
where you have aerial imagery and you

00:05:13,889 --> 00:05:17,300
can just draw everything off of the

00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:21,810
imagery and trace it

00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:24,030
it was GPS only so we had these maybe

00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:27,690
some of some of you know these old

00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:29,550
yellow garmin etrex things with arrival

00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:32,400
precision and that was the main data

00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:35,659
source so people actually walked around

00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:39,449
with the GPS devices took traces

00:05:35,659 --> 00:05:41,099
recorded them recorded waypoints

00:05:39,449 --> 00:05:44,219
whenever you were passing any

00:05:41,099 --> 00:05:46,229
interesting bit like postbox or

00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:48,719
something write everything down piece of

00:05:46,229 --> 00:05:53,219
pen and paper and then processes when

00:05:48,719 --> 00:05:56,159
you're back home of course with

00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:58,199
technology like that you you can't do

00:05:56,159 --> 00:06:00,840
any like tracing building footprints or

00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:04,349
something you can you can do streets and

00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,740
a couple of pies and that was basically

00:06:04,349 --> 00:06:08,060
it

00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:11,759
yeah so when did you start organizing

00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:17,240
with like conferences like these well I

00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:20,969
remember I remember going we had I

00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:24,210
wasn't a state of the map in 2007 that

00:06:20,969 --> 00:06:27,630
was the first set of map and I brought a

00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:29,130
huge printout from the of the castle map

00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:32,370
because we were so proud and we said

00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:36,029
yeah Council is now complete in 2007

00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:38,759
that was where we defined as complete

00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:42,509
yeah and I brought that printout to well

00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:44,430
the basically OSM I mean taking that to

00:06:42,509 --> 00:06:46,020
England where all ISM was started was of

00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:47,789
course like a bit like hey look

00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:51,270
here we in Germany did this nice thing

00:06:47,789 --> 00:06:52,190
and look look at us we're beating you at

00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:57,690
your own game

00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:59,340
but yeah it was cancer was exceptional

00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:02,039
in Germany in that they were relatively

00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:03,990
early so when cars who has been already

00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:08,340
complete since 2007 one have you done

00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:10,949
last 12 years as I said the we were a

00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:13,650
bit audacious when we said the map is

00:07:10,949 --> 00:07:18,270
complete is what basically we had all

00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:23,130
the streets we had no buildings we had

00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:26,550
only a limited number of PU eyes and I

00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:28,620
mean people start in inventing new stuff

00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:30,509
you know SM all the time lot lots of

00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:34,409
lots of the things that we met in our

00:07:30,509 --> 00:07:37,919
days like opening hours or so they

00:07:34,409 --> 00:07:40,050
weren't done and in in those days we had

00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:41,789
streets street type street names a

00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:44,340
couple of PU eyes and that was it

00:07:41,789 --> 00:07:46,830
nowadays I've for example I mean people

00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:48,569
map people map opening hours people map

00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:51,690
what kind of food you can get in

00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:53,460
restaurant I've been started in cod so

00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:57,569
I've recently started mapping individual

00:07:53,460 --> 00:08:00,870
trees lots of this it's never complete

00:07:57,569 --> 00:08:02,960
you can always find something so mapping

00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:07,409
parties are now very popular have you

00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:10,560
taken part in those two mapping parties

00:08:07,409 --> 00:08:14,190
are I think they were more popular in

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:18,150
the GPS times the very first mapping

00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:21,150
party was in 2006 on the Isle of Wight

00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:22,740
with Steve Coast and a couple of people

00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:25,110
in England I wasn't there I just read

00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:27,659
about this but as kind of that that was

00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:29,669
where they where they coined the term

00:08:27,659 --> 00:08:32,310
mapping party and they were about 30

00:08:29,669 --> 00:08:34,529
people setting themselves the goal of

00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:37,500
mapping the Isle of Wight in one weekend

00:08:34,529 --> 00:08:39,630
coming together dividing up the the

00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:41,039
island and some people on foot some with

00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:42,839
a car some with a bike you know

00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,940
depending on what mode of travel you

00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:46,740
have you map different things and they

00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:49,620
said okay let's divide this up and then

00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:51,149
they did these things we've copied that

00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:53,560
of course we've done lots of mapping

00:08:51,149 --> 00:08:55,550
parties in Germany as well

00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:57,470
especially when you do the GPS

00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:58,850
acquisition it's it's nice to meet in

00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:00,230
the morning and say okay you take this

00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:02,240
you take this you take things and then

00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:03,770
you swarm out and everyone does

00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,900
something and then we come back together

00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:08,720
and feel that feeling and stuff in the

00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:11,350
editor I have a feeling that it's not

00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:14,330
happening that much nowadays anymore but

00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:17,270
you're my judge Mayberry yeah so you've

00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:19,279
also been doing a lot of advocacy you

00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:21,020
have been holding a lot of talks and

00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:23,690
different conferences you gave a lot of

00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:26,240
interviews I think you've even written a

00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:30,290
book together on top I think it was the

00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:31,940
very first one and yeah but how are the

00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:35,510
reactions in the early days of

00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:40,160
OpenStreetMap of course I mean when we

00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:42,830
started big in Germany in 2006 or 2007

00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,900
we already had something to show because

00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:46,220
we could rely on what people had done in

00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:47,570
England we could pick some things and

00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:53,150
say look it's working

00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:55,520
of course it's if the the kudos kudos to

00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:56,990
them for for doing that because it must

00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:59,450
have been very hard in the early days

00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:01,490
for us it was a bit easier but still of

00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:03,440
course telling someone in how

00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:06,560
OpenStreetMap is working someone from

00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,360
the press or or someone people would

00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:11,330
always say this is never going to work

00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:13,460
and and you had to do a lot of you had a

00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:15,260
lot of talk to them a lot until they

00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:21,589
would understand that it could perhaps

00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:23,900
really work so yeah also we had people

00:10:21,589 --> 00:10:27,290
from the government or commercial people

00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:29,240
involved in in cartography who didn't

00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:30,500
like the competition but for every one

00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:32,600
who said that is never going to work

00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:34,250
there were always like a handful of

00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:38,600
nerds who say hey this is interesting

00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:41,990
show me how it goes so I mean it's an

00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:43,790
open project was the license like a big

00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:45,950
topic where this openness came from

00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:48,830
woman this is just the side thing I

00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:51,320
think what what people attracted to

00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:53,000
OpenStreetMap was was twofold some

00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:56,600
people came to it because it was just

00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,279
the first just the first way in which

00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:01,040
they could start making their own map

00:10:58,279 --> 00:11:02,880
like if you were a cyclist you could you

00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:06,060
could be using the standard

00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:08,730
that were made for motorists most likely

00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:10,529
and people came hey this is great we can

00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:14,370
finally make maps that are centered on

00:11:10,529 --> 00:11:16,589
cycling and not on motoring and we also

00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:18,209
had lots of people who said that they're

00:11:16,589 --> 00:11:20,430
coming from the open software open

00:11:18,209 --> 00:11:22,579
knowledge background saying this is

00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:24,899
great you have an open license

00:11:22,579 --> 00:11:29,870
share-alike license this is what we like

00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:34,170
it's the same license that wikipedia has

00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:38,519
we we support that so that's certainly a

00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:40,410
factor yeah and but I mean this the

00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:43,079
whole thing evolved obviously in the

00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:45,540
years and I remember the license switch

00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:48,029
discussions like I think was around the

00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:50,790
time I joined the project that was there

00:11:48,029 --> 00:11:52,350
was a long and an ugly discussion doing

00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:55,920
which we lost a couple of people and a

00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:57,089
couple bit of data also we changed we

00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,639
had the the creative commons share-alike

00:11:57,089 --> 00:12:02,940
license before that wikipedia is also

00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:04,649
using and then the license basically

00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:06,779
means well you commute you can do

00:12:04,649 --> 00:12:09,089
anything with the data as long as you

00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:11,220
attribute OSM and as long as anything

00:12:09,089 --> 00:12:14,009
you make from osm has the same license

00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:17,220
as a shell like component the new

00:12:14,009 --> 00:12:19,889
license it's more or less the same and

00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:21,990
with hindsight you you wonder why we

00:12:19,889 --> 00:12:25,529
could spend so much time and haggling

00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:27,420
over the details there are some minor

00:12:25,529 --> 00:12:28,920
details but yeah we switched the license

00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:31,139
and now we are relatively happy with the

00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:33,470
open database license which is still an

00:12:31,139 --> 00:12:36,630
attribution share-alike license right

00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:39,360
okay good thank you thank you for the

00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:43,980
insights of the early days I was just

00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:46,560
just for starters maybe we should be

00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:48,269
maybe should give a short kind of

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:52,620
technical introduction so that people

00:12:48,269 --> 00:13:01,199
know how things work yeah basically okay

00:12:52,620 --> 00:13:05,279
yeah sure so it's actually pretty simple

00:13:01,199 --> 00:13:08,160
if you think about it we have a central

00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:12,209
database that has as you see all of the

00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:14,550
things and it also stores not only the

00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:16,170
the things that are current but also all

00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:20,160
the history that

00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:22,170
has passed then there's the API around

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:28,200
this database so you can actually talk

00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:30,690
to to the database then we have some

00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:32,639
software out in the wild some editors

00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:36,800
that are able to communicate with this

00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:39,720
API and add data and retrieve data and

00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:41,370
but if you want all the data to have it

00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:43,230
for your own and don't want to go to the

00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:45,029
API every time you can also get the

00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:48,000
planet but that's how we call it and

00:13:45,029 --> 00:13:49,440
this is basically representation of

00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,370
everything he also can get it with all

00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:55,290
the history if you want and then there's

00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:58,110
the tipping mechanism so you can get

00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:59,970
minute lis updates without having to get

00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:05,699
all the planet data every time you want

00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:09,180
to have an update and yeah you can use

00:14:05,699 --> 00:14:11,370
this planet and those dips to operate

00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:13,589
your own services for example we as

00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:15,839
OpenStreetMap we have a map on open

00:14:13,589 --> 00:14:19,500
strip club org and this is using the

00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:24,029
exact mechanism to get the data and work

00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:27,510
it for with it and yeah consumer it for

00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:31,440
in your application that you want yeah

00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:33,390
and your you can insert your thing that

00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,339
you want to do with all the strip in

00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:38,850
there and you can imagine what you can

00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:42,690
do right yeah the data model that we

00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:46,050
have is also quite simple the most basic

00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:48,420
element is a node it's just a point that

00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:52,829
has certain coordinates with it

00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:57,839
a node can also mean something it can be

00:14:52,829 --> 00:15:00,779
a tree or a post box or the location of

00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:03,390
a city center or something but you can

00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:06,720
also take a couple of nodes and combine

00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:10,110
them into what we then call a way and

00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:14,970
way that's just a line we use that to

00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:17,970
model for example roads or canal or also

00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:21,329
power line or something like that if you

00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:24,660
have a way that is closed falls back

00:15:21,329 --> 00:15:26,130
onto itself then that's an area polygon

00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:31,079
that can be used

00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:35,600
for say a lake or a forest or a building

00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:38,009
and finally we have a slightly more

00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:41,190
complicated object that we call a

00:15:38,009 --> 00:15:43,050
relation relation is a part a

00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:45,269
combination of a couple of other

00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:47,880
elements like a couple of ways or even

00:15:45,269 --> 00:15:50,250
nodes and these relations are mostly

00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:53,819
used for example to model country

00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:57,990
boundaries or long distance hiking

00:15:53,819 --> 00:16:02,190
routes or even complicated things like

00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:06,740
turn restrictions or so that's the

00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:11,899
basics of the data model in order to

00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:14,940
describe what something is we use tags

00:16:11,899 --> 00:16:17,370
tags are just combinations of keys and

00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:19,620
values and for example if you have a

00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:23,040
tree the tag would be natural equals

00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:25,230
tree highway equals residential water y

00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:31,709
equals canal for a canal or boundary

00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:40,079
equals administrative for a for a an

00:16:31,709 --> 00:16:44,930
administrative boundary the the tags are

00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:49,980
not just these simple tags there's about

00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:54,630
75,000 different tags in use those

00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:57,420
spelling arrows yes but there's still

00:16:54,630 --> 00:17:01,139
several hundred tags that are used more

00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:03,180
than 100 thousand times and the way the

00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:06,089
tags that I've shown you here are the

00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:09,689
basic tags but we would also have tags

00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:11,370
that describe for example for a tree not

00:17:09,689 --> 00:17:13,260
only that it is a tree but how high it

00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:16,640
is and what species it is or something

00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:19,470
or for a street we would also map

00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:21,419
whether the parking or we can map

00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:25,199
whether the parking along the street is

00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:28,409
in parallel or diagonal or whatever so

00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:31,049
lots of detail like street road surfaces

00:17:28,409 --> 00:17:33,539
or speed limits and so on and so on but

00:17:31,049 --> 00:17:36,730
yeah this is tags you you can invent any

00:17:33,539 --> 00:17:38,890
tags you like but these are the the

00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:41,040
these are basic tags that that we use an

00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:44,650
open street map to model what is what

00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:48,790
yeah so maybe let's now do some mapping

00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:50,590
how about that let's let's look into it

00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:53,050
how you can do your very first

00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:56,860
contribution using the Open Street Map

00:17:53,050 --> 00:18:07,890
website so let's open some browser of

00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:07,890
your choice go to Open Street Map org

00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:16,600
and usually you can just go there and

00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:18,550
sign up for an account and you just

00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:21,190
specify user name and password you

00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:24,160
confirm the sign up using the link you

00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:27,520
get to Gaea email and yes that's it

00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:36,040
luckily I already have an account so

00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:42,280
I'll just log in with a terribly long

00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:44,950
password and I think I missed i know i

00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:47,770
typed it right perfect

00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:51,810
so once you have an account you can log

00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:53,560
in and you can now go and just someplace

00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:56,080
on planet Earth

00:18:53,560 --> 00:19:01,660
let's go to a heidelberg somewhere

00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:06,160
around here I think we're somewhere in

00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:09,580
this area I think right and now we can

00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:11,830
just push the edit button which doesn't

00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:14,620
work because not installed here but we

00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:16,810
can use ID which is the browser-based

00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:18,610
editor and you don't have to have

00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:21,340
anything installed you can just start

00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:25,960
here and normally ID presents you with

00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:28,450
an introduction dialog so you can have a

00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:33,220
walk through and learn but we don't need

00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:36,160
it for now because right here so you

00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:38,190
notice that the displaying of the the

00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:43,030
display of the map has changed it's not

00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:44,920
like this clean schematic representation

00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:46,870
there's much more detail you now see

00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:48,860
aerial imagery in the background and you

00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:50,990
see a lot of energy

00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:53,630
patience down here that are happening

00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:55,610
and you can point at them and think show

00:19:53,630 --> 00:20:01,520
up and they show you what's what tags

00:19:55,610 --> 00:20:04,160
are attached to it and so on and so you

00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:06,710
can click here for example let's click

00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:08,540
on the building and then you will see oh

00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:10,340
it's actually a bit more complicated

00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:12,290
than I thought maybe let's click another

00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:15,170
building they're all very complicated

00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:17,000
but you can just look here and then you

00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:18,770
see all the tags that are included there

00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,080
so you see the address you see a time

00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:28,100
you see if there is an elevator and so

00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:29,419
on and so on and we can we can also add

00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:31,580
something to the map it's pretty easy

00:20:29,419 --> 00:20:35,419
let's just imagine there was a tree

00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:37,280
somewhere so they already told she's

00:20:35,419 --> 00:20:39,260
mapping trees so maybe let's make a tree

00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:41,450
as well it doesn't really exist so

00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:46,360
please don't map tree spur and they they

00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:50,179
aren't any but you can just type in tree

00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:53,000
you could even select a leaf type for

00:20:50,179 --> 00:20:57,470
example is it's maybe a leafless tree is

00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:59,390
it evergreen you can even select the

00:20:57,470 --> 00:21:02,929
diameter or you can you can say okay

00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:03,500
maybe it's 300 millimeters or something

00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:05,809
like that

00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:07,730
yeah and that's basically it you now

00:21:05,809 --> 00:21:09,970
have mapped a tree

00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:12,590
we can even hit the upload button here

00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:14,110
and then you can specify what you did

00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:17,570
there or why you did it

00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:23,690
type in a few words at its imaginary

00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:25,429
tree and you can even ask for help so

00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:27,320
someone else shall review your your

00:21:25,429 --> 00:21:28,790
change but I won't do it because I'm

00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:32,480
totally sure this tree is right there

00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:35,570
and then I can hit the upload button and

00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:40,010
it just goes to to the database don't

00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:43,010
worry I will remove it afterwards right

00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:45,620
so what Thomas has showed shown you

00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:48,049
there is the idea deter that's the

00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:50,990
default editor that comes up when you

00:21:48,049 --> 00:21:52,640
press the edit button on the website but

00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:55,280
this isn't the only editor there is a

00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:57,669
couple of well when OpenStreetMap

00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:00,940
started the first thing that we

00:21:57,669 --> 00:22:03,039
was a Java applet that was the first

00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:06,579
area that was before my time and then we

00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:09,279
went through a couple of of flash-based

00:22:06,579 --> 00:22:12,700
browser editors finally have arrived at

00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:14,459
id which is done in JavaScript but in

00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:17,139
addition to the browser-based editors

00:22:14,459 --> 00:22:21,429
there's also standalone standalone

00:22:17,139 --> 00:22:23,769
editors like jozin and of course a

00:22:21,429 --> 00:22:27,309
number of mobile editors and also a

00:22:23,769 --> 00:22:30,339
couple of special use programs that will

00:22:27,309 --> 00:22:33,579
not allow you to edit anything but maybe

00:22:30,339 --> 00:22:35,229
just a very specific property like

00:22:33,579 --> 00:22:41,019
whether something as wheelchair access

00:22:35,229 --> 00:22:42,849
or something we have three guests about

00:22:41,019 --> 00:22:44,739
the editors and we are going to ask them

00:22:42,849 --> 00:22:51,779
some questions ladies and gentlemen

00:22:44,739 --> 00:22:55,109
please welcome Simon Poole vasilieva and

00:22:51,779 --> 00:22:55,109
Quincy Morgan

00:22:57,010 --> 00:23:03,360
[Applause]

00:22:59,809 --> 00:23:05,520
now we have we have to prepared

00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:12,770
something for them for them to wear so

00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:16,040
that so that you know who is who okay

00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:16,040
there you go

00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:21,780
right well we're gonna start with you

00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:23,340
and I'll see you a couple of questions

00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:26,910
about the idea

00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:32,610
did Thomas do everything all right no

00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:36,210
microphone for you look yeah take this

00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:39,150
that told us make any major mistakes

00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:46,620
right there well there wasn't any trees

00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:48,570
so that's one major mistake no with ID

00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:50,640
we try to make it really easy to use

00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:52,020
very hard to make mistakes so if you're

00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,170
making a lot of mistakes it's probably

00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:56,910
our fault so let us know so the ID

00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:59,610
editor has kind of the pole position

00:23:56,910 --> 00:24:01,920
among the OSM editors because it is the

00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:04,740
default editor that new people will be

00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:07,910
sent to when they hit the edit button on

00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:10,290
the website and it's basically you and

00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:12,750
your colleague Brian house who are the

00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:14,640
main editor the main contributors to ID

00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:16,740
how does it feel working on something

00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,480
where you know that every edit every new

00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:20,910
thing that you push out will be used by

00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,710
I know 30,000 people over the next

00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:25,140
couple of weeks

00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:27,450
yeah it's a big responsibility but

00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:29,730
there's also on the other stats page it

00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:32,040
says there are 200,000 unique user

00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:33,630
accounts that use the ID last year so a

00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:36,059
lot of people come to just make a few

00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:37,770
edits don't never been to a conference

00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:39,120
like this don't know a lot about open

00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:41,070
street men necessarily but they just

00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,630
want to map the community so we try to

00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:46,010
make it easy for those people as well as

00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:51,570
the 30,000 enthusiasts or whatnot right

00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:54,540
okay so unlike unlike the other editor

00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:56,910
writers you're actually getting paid for

00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:58,380
the job I I couldn't imagine that a

00:24:56,910 --> 00:25:00,660
couple of people might say hey that's

00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:02,610
that's really cool I would love to to

00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:08,370
get money for working on hours I'm

00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:09,990
software is it a dream job yeah you know

00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:12,720
young professional arity of my dream job

00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:15,970
nowhere to go but down

00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:19,809
so yeah it's such a joy to wake up every

00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:21,159
day and work on OpenStreetMap and be

00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:23,789
able to be part of this great community

00:25:21,159 --> 00:25:26,289
and try to make the map better

00:25:23,789 --> 00:25:29,889
can we ask who is footing the bill for

00:25:26,289 --> 00:25:32,080
the work yeah I work for Critias in LLC

00:25:29,889 --> 00:25:35,529
it's a us-based company they have

00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:36,399
offices in Seattle Denver and London I

00:25:35,529 --> 00:25:38,740
think

00:25:36,399 --> 00:25:40,269
so there are GIS focus consultancy so

00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:43,629
they use OpenStreetMap data for a lot of

00:25:40,269 --> 00:25:45,039
things so to have somebody there

00:25:43,629 --> 00:25:47,710
supporting the project making sure the

00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:50,049
data is going to be great for them and

00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:52,929
their clients is a benefit to them right

00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:55,779
what so since you've been contributing

00:25:52,929 --> 00:25:57,909
to 2id what's the coolest thing that

00:25:55,779 --> 00:26:01,000
your fat away said that was really the

00:25:57,909 --> 00:26:03,370
really great feature well I've only been

00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,169
working on ID less than a year I was

00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:07,059
volunteering before that though so

00:26:05,169 --> 00:26:09,450
sometimes your volunteer position can

00:26:07,059 --> 00:26:12,639
turn into a full-time job

00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:15,190
we built a validation tool last year so

00:26:12,639 --> 00:26:17,379
now if you make common mistakes that

00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:20,919
it'll let you know that and try to help

00:26:17,379 --> 00:26:22,840
you fix them easily so I think that sort

00:26:20,919 --> 00:26:26,500
of a game-changer in terms of data

00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:28,120
quality hopefully all right is there is

00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:32,169
there like would you say that your work

00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:33,730
in ID has some overarching goal or or

00:26:32,169 --> 00:26:38,919
general principle that you're working

00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:41,500
towards yeah well sort of our sort of

00:26:38,919 --> 00:26:44,799
our user in my mind that shadow work for

00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:46,990
is sort of the casual OpenStreetMap user

00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:49,750
who doesn't necessarily need to know all

00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:53,169
the the data types or the tags you can

00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:57,279
just go in you know at a point tag it as

00:26:53,169 --> 00:26:58,059
a tree and kind of make that an easy

00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:03,309
thing to do

00:26:58,059 --> 00:27:05,019
so usability is our big focus even for

00:27:03,309 --> 00:27:09,159
advanced features to make sure they're

00:27:05,019 --> 00:27:13,620
usable okay let's ask some questions

00:27:09,159 --> 00:27:17,710
about Joseph are you food in Rickett I

00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:19,269
thought it's a deer one of the most

00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:21,580
active developers of Chosen right now I

00:27:19,269 --> 00:27:23,920
think yeah it's

00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:27,309
that's the java-based OpenStreetMap

00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:29,680
editor and it's also the the oldest

00:27:27,309 --> 00:27:33,430
editor I think yeah it was created only

00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:38,290
what only when you have to always ham

00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:43,030
itself 14 years from now and it has also

00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:47,740
the largest we can see reading are the

00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:54,010
plugins but yeah other than that it

00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:57,010
sounds like a lot of work yeah with 14

00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:59,590
years of development and the tons of

00:27:57,010 --> 00:28:02,350
feature we have in the editor it

00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:04,840
requires a lot of work to understand all

00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:08,020
the codebase but it requires even more

00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:10,270
work as we have a lot of users a big

00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:11,350
community to under all the stuff

00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:15,360
happening around

00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:21,910
jozin yeah so how much time do you spend

00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:24,280
weekly on working well it varies we are

00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:27,760
a team of a few developers but we are

00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:30,280
all believers we are not paid so all the

00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:33,610
work we do on jism is taken from our

00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:35,970
free time like all everyone that

00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:38,290
contribute to OpenStreetMap so

00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:41,530
personally for me as I am the most

00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:44,350
active developer in the team I usually

00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:47,910
spend between five up to 20 hours per

00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:47,910
week to Jotham

00:28:53,070 --> 00:29:00,630
so we we already had that ID is the

00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:02,580
default editor on OpenStreetMap but who

00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:04,140
are the people who are using chosen what

00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:07,680
are the differences between those

00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:11,640
editors the target audience is not the

00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:13,350
same ID remains wishes to remain simple

00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:16,410
and accessible to everyone

00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:19,610
especially for beginners unlike Joe Sam

00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:22,620
who is more targeted to experienced user

00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:26,580
wishing to find more powerful but

00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:29,220
sometimes more complex features and we

00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:32,340
have different use cases Joe Sam is

00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:34,650
enough line editor you don't need an

00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:37,470
internet connection or a good internet

00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:40,860
connection so we have a lot of users in

00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:43,320
the humanitarian sector for example when

00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:46,980
they go to African countries where

00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:49,650
internet access is a spur resource Odom

00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:53,490
is very valuable because they can

00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:56,700
download a lot of things before and work

00:29:53,490 --> 00:30:01,080
without internet connection also a

00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:04,790
feature of a poem applause we like to do

00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:09,570
most powerful stuff like and Link

00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:15,420
massive amount of data or very complex

00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:17,580
features okay so Joe's on or is it just

00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:20,550
software architecture fixing bugs

00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:24,150
keeping up with updates not especially

00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:26,250
architecture that yeah all the stuff

00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:30,240
happening around Rossum require more

00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:35,100
time than coding itself new features for

00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:39,360
example where I spend a large amount of

00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:41,880
time is to create tickets created on the

00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:44,990
website answering questions from the

00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:47,250
community by email or social media

00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:50,040
monitoring the very date vary the

00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:51,090
validity of external resource and so on

00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:56,730
okay

00:30:51,090 --> 00:31:01,500
yeah thanks a lot thank you / - Simon

00:30:56,730 --> 00:31:03,570
Simon the Vespucci editor is not only on

00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:05,490
the smallest screen of the

00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:07,680
three but it's also the one with the

00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:10,890
smallest developer bays it's more or

00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:13,230
less just you is it well historically

00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:16,230
not really I mean one of the interesting

00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:19,020
things about this butchy is that is over

00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:22,200
ten years old this March it was got its

00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:25,980
hubs its first decade which is very very

00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:29,280
very old for an Android app and there's

00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:31,680
been a row of people that have

00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:34,140
maintained it I've been doing it for the

00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:35,940
last five years or so and it is mainly

00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:39,300
me but if you look back it's always been

00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:41,640
one person essentially the codebase has

00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:43,250
expanded substantially over the time

00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:46,680
that I've maintained it you could say

00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:51,660
Simon's working here and it's floating

00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:54,630
but yeah it's a fair amount of work the

00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:59,340
day only has 48 hours so it's a bit

00:31:54,630 --> 00:32:02,730
difficult but we do have contributions

00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:04,650
it's just that people think okay it's an

00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:07,850
Android app it's simple but actually

00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:10,200
it's a fairly complex bit of code and

00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:13,560
there's a lot of things which you have

00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:15,720
almost I mean it's not not much less

00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:18,570
lines of code and compared to to the

00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:20,580
idea itself and that doesn't include

00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:23,190
stuff that I've written which is not

00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:26,880
actually in the main repository so it's

00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:30,480
a bit more than that so there's another

00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:32,880
mobile editor for iOS called Gold map is

00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:36,930
that anything like similar to Vespucci

00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:40,560
or like totally different things yes and

00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:43,380
no I mean it's its targets the same kind

00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:46,560
of audience so it's people on the go

00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:49,380
which want to do more than just add a

00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:54,870
toy so there's a point of interest

00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:58,350
so there's a similar audience otherwise

00:32:54,870 --> 00:33:01,470
there's not really any similarities go

00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:03,750
map was closed-source up to about two

00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:05,370
years ago so there's also no cold

00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:08,160
sharing or anything like that but I do

00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:12,780
know the developer and we're on cordial

00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:13,840
terms and that's about it I think in

00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:15,910
general

00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:18,040
you will find that there's not that much

00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:20,410
interaction between the editor

00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:24,610
developers in general so we're all a

00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:27,010
become edited trying to out feature the

00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:31,270
others that's what's the main challenge

00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:34,800
I mean the doing an editor for the small

00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:37,900
screen or editing on the small screen

00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:41,290
compared to like Joe Simon ID who have

00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:45,130
available who have much more screen real

00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:47,200
estate available um I think the thing is

00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:48,880
from a pure functionality point of view

00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,980
you're not really limited by the small

00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:54,550
device because they're essentially as

00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:57,760
powerful as full-size computers were

00:33:54,550 --> 00:34:00,400
just a couple of years ago but cramming

00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:03,340
stuff into the user interface is a big

00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:06,280
issue and it's one which we continuously

00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:08,290
fight with and I think we've made a lot

00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:10,870
of improvements particularly in the last

00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:12,760
two years making it easier to use but we

00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:15,490
do have these you know you select the

00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:17,650
way and you get I don't know 20 menu

00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:22,270
items or something like that which is

00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:24,540
really not a good idea but currently we

00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:28,330
don't have another method of presenting

00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:30,790
the available options to the end-user

00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:32,590
but some ideas around so it's always

00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:34,870
getting simpler and simpler to use how

00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:36,490
long how long until I can just take a

00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:40,470
photo of something with my smartphone

00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:40,470
and then it Maps it automatically

00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:44,020
difficult to ask I mean I've

00:34:42,430 --> 00:34:46,360
experimented actually a couple of years

00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:49,680
back with taking photographs of street

00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:53,470
signs or streets and street name signs

00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:55,570
and that is surprisingly difficult to

00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:58,390
actually turn into something which you

00:34:55,570 --> 00:35:01,450
can use so you always it's very easy to

00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:03,790
get appropriate results but if you have

00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:06,310
to go back in and actually correct stuff

00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:09,910
it's more work than just typing it in

00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:12,610
directly yourself so that mmm and your

00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:15,520
name cool feature that you have

00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:17,680
implemented in the last year or so that

00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:19,450
way said that that's that really has

00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:23,880
improved respond to you a lot well as a

00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:27,119
rule I only add cool features seriously

00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:29,980
about a month ago

00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:34,569
have to say it as an explanation we just

00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:36,400
have a new beta release out so there's a

00:35:34,569 --> 00:35:38,650
lot of new stuff which is not available

00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:41,260
in the release version but you can go on

00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:43,240
google play store and sign up for the

00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:48,490
beta program and you will get to all the

00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:54,849
newest bugs and a month ago I was

00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:57,099
editing something nearby industrial area

00:35:54,849 --> 00:36:00,329
where I live now I realized all the land

00:35:57,099 --> 00:36:03,040
use was glued to the motorway there and

00:36:00,329 --> 00:36:04,750
for the newcomers that is not something

00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:07,329
that you should do it looks very neat

00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:09,790
but it's very impractical and I was on

00:36:07,329 --> 00:36:11,920
my iPhone at the time and I started on

00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:15,579
gluing it and this is not a typical use

00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:18,190
case for for ant for Vespucci on android

00:36:15,579 --> 00:36:20,319
because the screen is small and so I was

00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:23,530
on gluing these no since that this just

00:36:20,319 --> 00:36:25,720
doesn't work and so when I got back I

00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:29,619
added a further feature to this release

00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:31,390
where you can unglue two ways now you

00:36:29,619 --> 00:36:34,510
can do that in jostle and in the other

00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:36,520
editors but that week that I put in is

00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:38,950
that it actually only unglue stuff which

00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:40,900
is not the same as the way that your on

00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:43,299
glowing or if you're on glowing a street

00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:45,190
or the Street connections will be

00:36:43,299 --> 00:36:47,650
maintained and it works surprisingly

00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:49,569
well then I would probably use that now

00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:54,430
stuff using jaws ohm which I would

00:36:49,569 --> 00:36:57,750
normally so yeah and I think the Coralie

00:36:54,430 --> 00:37:01,960
from there is it you know if you want

00:36:57,750 --> 00:37:04,690
want something done in Vespucci you have

00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:07,839
better chances if it correlates with an

00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:12,069
itch that I have but I'll consider other

00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:15,730
stuff as well yeah thank you thanks a

00:37:12,069 --> 00:37:17,770
lot now we have round for we have

00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:20,079
questions for all three of you no no you

00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:22,510
you can't go just yet I'm sorry I'm

00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:30,430
sorry we we still have some topics left

00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:33,670
for you so yeah as as writers as

00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:35,520
developers of editors do you get a lot

00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:37,680
of feedback from

00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:39,750
do you get a lot of feedback for your

00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:45,560
work do you get praise critique feature

00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:47,880
requests and so on yes definitely

00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:51,120
pretty much every day people are posting

00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:53,820
on ID github page about features they

00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:56,700
want or bugs they find and it's a really

00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:58,560
exciting part of the project because my

00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:59,910
old job was also open source but we

00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:02,460
didn't have anybody showing up

00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:05,220
complaining so people are noticing you

00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:07,380
and definitely relying and being

00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:08,940
passionate about the projects when they

00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:15,600
show up and talk about it

00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:17,820
so um yes okay oh yeah of course we

00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:22,590
receive a lot of feature requests and

00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:25,070
bug reports but even if sometimes we can

00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:28,230
find it sorry

00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:30,990
okay even if you can't find it sometimes

00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:34,590
overwhelming the community is very

00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:37,320
welcoming and very polite and the often

00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:44,240
thank us for all the work we do so it's

00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:47,340
always a pleasure to do a feedback I

00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:49,770
have a problem that my two colleagues

00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:53,010
here don't have because I have Google

00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:58,020
Play Store which is a cesspool of

00:38:53,010 --> 00:39:04,410
atrocity and unluckily we have people

00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:06,390
which and install the app for whatever

00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:09,270
reason it doesn't work on their device

00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:13,260
or there's an issue and they will give

00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:15,420
you a one star review and just give you

00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:17,310
an example just got a complaint that

00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:21,080
somebody was complaining that the

00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:25,400
imagery that we display was out of date

00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:28,280
and it's nothing that we can change and

00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:31,020
the the problem is that there's no real

00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:33,180
method to give these people feedback and

00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:37,320
typically they will just go away and

00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:40,440
then that's a bit annoying thing people

00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:43,590
which ask for proper enhancements on our

00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:45,840
github repo a very welcome and as some

00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:48,089
of you probably know we are relatively

00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:51,709
good in actually doing these things

00:39:48,089 --> 00:39:55,769
so go to github Google Play Store okay

00:39:51,709 --> 00:39:57,059
so when you do some mapping I guess all

00:39:55,769 --> 00:40:00,809
of you do some mapping with

00:39:57,059 --> 00:40:03,390
OpenStreetMap do use only your own

00:40:00,809 --> 00:40:06,900
editor or you do you try out the others

00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:09,329
as well well I was I was interested in

00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:12,029
this I went on how did I contribute to

00:40:09,329 --> 00:40:14,549
OS mmm it's a cool tool you can kind of

00:40:12,029 --> 00:40:16,049
see a summary of a user and all my

00:40:14,549 --> 00:40:18,809
fifteen hundred change sets are an ID

00:40:16,049 --> 00:40:20,339
some a little embarrassed to say I have

00:40:18,809 --> 00:40:24,869
jaws some installed I don't have an

00:40:20,339 --> 00:40:26,880
Android phone unfortunately but we

00:40:24,869 --> 00:40:28,619
definitely like like I like looking at

00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,719
I've probably read the documentation for

00:40:28,619 --> 00:40:35,249
Jaws some more than of used trusts in

00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:38,849
itself I like looking at how other tools

00:40:35,249 --> 00:40:40,289
work when I'm working on an app so

00:40:38,849 --> 00:40:43,589
that's something I have to commit to to

00:40:40,289 --> 00:40:47,699
uh start a better diversity in my

00:40:43,589 --> 00:40:49,499
editing well it's quite the same for me

00:40:47,699 --> 00:40:55,469
I have one hundred percent contribution

00:40:49,499 --> 00:40:57,569
using Joseph's sorry but it's the same I

00:40:55,469 --> 00:41:00,709
have fun read the release notes of ID

00:40:57,569 --> 00:41:05,579
because you have a lot of good ideas

00:41:00,709 --> 00:41:07,279
which we can copy in Java and you're

00:41:05,579 --> 00:41:09,839
good you make a good job of

00:41:07,279 --> 00:41:13,410
communication to explain what what else

00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:24,329
a changes so I don't actually need to

00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:26,759
use it to to have good ideas I suppose I

00:41:24,329 --> 00:41:28,589
could do most of it but actually I'm

00:41:26,759 --> 00:41:30,900
completely different than my colleagues

00:41:28,589 --> 00:41:34,109
because I think I've actually used every

00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:36,599
single editor in OpenStreetMap space

00:41:34,109 --> 00:41:39,029
which is being a general-purpose editor

00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:44,809
outside of my cart or which nobody knows

00:41:39,029 --> 00:41:44,809
about anymore everyone zero yes okay I

00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:51,869
you know I think OOP day to day use I do

00:41:50,249 --> 00:41:53,069
a lot with first Butchie because I

00:41:51,869 --> 00:41:56,160
believe in dog fooding

00:41:53,069 --> 00:41:59,480
so you know what it is still the case

00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:02,870
that I find the most bugs myself

00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:05,660
but use Jotham and ID and last week I

00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:07,550
was using potlatch one swanee yeah

00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:10,780
nope most people don't know how to

00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:13,760
actually start that so right right

00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:16,160
okay one more closing question what is

00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:21,800
the next big feature you guys are

00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:23,270
working on yeah well with ID where I was

00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:25,730
just at the state of map us conference I

00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:27,440
did a big talk on ID 3 which is gonna be

00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:29,720
the next major version maybe within a

00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:31,580
year maybe not see when that actually

00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:33,260
gets out but that'll have some more

00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:34,990
advanced features like picking the

00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:37,880
feature type before you draw it a

00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:40,040
contextual toolbar so we can have

00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:41,750
advanced tools when you have specific

00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:44,450
things selected but still try to keep it

00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:46,850
fairly user friendly but do have more

00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:51,170
advanced features so check out that talk

00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:56,120
and keep an eye out for that for chosen

00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:59,990
the next big feature is not a visible

00:42:56,120 --> 00:43:01,820
feature for end users if you remember

00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:04,610
the number of lines of code we have for

00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:07,520
jism it's very high and all of these

00:43:04,610 --> 00:43:10,130
lines are basically a single piece of

00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:12,950
software so it's becoming more and more

00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:16,670
difficult to maintain and we would like

00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:19,400
to offer all the work we did in java

00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:21,770
programming language to available to

00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:24,560
other Java developers for different use

00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:27,140
case so the next big feature is to

00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:30,860
modularize Jotham into smaller

00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:35,210
components autonomous and this is a

00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:41,770
major effort that is going to take years

00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:44,090
before we reached to this goal it's not

00:43:41,770 --> 00:43:47,480
very much different with first pochi

00:43:44,090 --> 00:43:50,770
does a lot of work which doesn't

00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:53,960
actually result in user visible changes

00:43:50,770 --> 00:43:56,570
typically once per year I have to invest

00:43:53,960 --> 00:44:00,050
a couple of man weeks of not even

00:43:56,570 --> 00:44:03,260
perhaps a man month just to fulfill and

00:44:00,050 --> 00:44:08,570
fix changes that Google requires or

00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:11,940
stuff that Google has broken for 14.1

00:44:08,570 --> 00:44:13,560
14.0 is the version which is in beta now

00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:15,630
in point one will probably have

00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:19,710
mapillary support I've already prototype

00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:23,550
prototype that and depending on time

00:44:19,710 --> 00:44:25,230
there's a anybody who's useless but she

00:44:23,550 --> 00:44:29,610
knows that you select the element and

00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:32,640
then you can start a tag editor on that

00:44:29,610 --> 00:44:34,260
element and that is actually it's not

00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:36,870
quite a separate process which is

00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:39,240
running on your phone but a similar and

00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:40,710
the idea is to do away with that that

00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:42,720
goes actually that's an architectural

00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:46,680
decision that was made 10 years ago so

00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:48,870
from my fault and but they makes it a

00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:51,420
bit difficult to show the tags in any

00:44:48,870 --> 00:44:53,790
other context so if you have an Android

00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:56,670
tablet right now you either have the map

00:44:53,790 --> 00:44:58,500
or you have the tag display an idea is

00:44:56,670 --> 00:45:00,930
that you can have the map and the tag

00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:04,890
display at the same time and so that

00:45:00,930 --> 00:45:06,450
will be a user visible change if Android

00:45:04,890 --> 00:45:10,230
tablets are still the thing which I'm

00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:14,930
not quite sure ok thank you

00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:14,930
three guys quincy vincent silent

00:45:20,710 --> 00:45:26,540
okay okay what's what's the next big

00:45:24,230 --> 00:45:28,370
thing in level zero level zero is

00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:31,340
perfect there will be no big things

00:45:28,370 --> 00:45:50,090
because it's already big thing okay are

00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:52,010
you giving a talk about level zero so if

00:45:50,090 --> 00:45:54,320
you want to learn more about any of

00:45:52,010 --> 00:45:58,400
those editors well at least two of those

00:45:54,320 --> 00:46:01,640
have talks during the next days so

00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:05,120
there's the ID editor beginner tutorial

00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:06,950
tomorrow 11:30 and there will be also a

00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:08,380
talk about the Johnson project tomorrow

00:46:06,950 --> 00:46:11,300
at 2:00 p.m.

00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:13,640
yeah so what you've what you've heard

00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:16,580
about now are the various editors and

00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:18,530
OpenStreetMap that are of course a very

00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:20,240
important part of contributing to

00:46:18,530 --> 00:46:22,540
OpenStreetMap because you need to go

00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:26,900
through one of these editors to actually

00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:29,720
upload something however that technical

00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:33,170
side isn't all OpenStreetMap is very

00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:36,910
much a community project and we have

00:46:33,170 --> 00:46:40,010
lots of people not only sitting at home

00:46:36,910 --> 00:46:43,660
on their computers and adding stuff but

00:46:40,010 --> 00:46:46,700
also people meeting up and doing things

00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:52,600
together for OpenStreetMap people

00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:52,600
organizing community events and so on so

00:46:53,410 --> 00:47:01,990
sorry one second last my script please

00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:04,640
welcome Jonathan billion from the

00:47:01,990 --> 00:47:07,220
Belgium community who's going to tell

00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:09,530
you a few bits about what the Belgians

00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:11,590
do to organize their editing and to meet

00:47:09,530 --> 00:47:14,250
up and to do other things

00:47:11,590 --> 00:47:15,959
[Applause]

00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:20,769
[Music]

00:47:15,959 --> 00:47:23,499
- hello so you are one of the most

00:47:20,769 --> 00:47:27,640
active members of the orchestra

00:47:23,499 --> 00:47:32,109
propulsion group of user community right

00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:35,919
and so what kind of organ organizing

00:47:32,109 --> 00:47:40,059
activities do you do in well we do drink

00:47:35,919 --> 00:47:43,239
a lot of beers together that's obvious

00:47:40,059 --> 00:47:45,249
so we organize regular meetups

00:47:43,239 --> 00:47:47,289
so we can meet the people from the

00:47:45,249 --> 00:47:50,619
community but also newcomers that just

00:47:47,289 --> 00:47:53,109
heard about OpenStreetMap and can ya

00:47:50,619 --> 00:47:57,429
come to ask questions so that's that's

00:47:53,109 --> 00:48:00,880
really nice and we we do try to organize

00:47:57,429 --> 00:48:03,999
a lot of map atoms we have a close

00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:08,049
relation with MSF Doctors Without

00:48:03,999 --> 00:48:10,989
Borders in in Belgium and so yeah we try

00:48:08,049 --> 00:48:14,410
to support them for the humanitarian

00:48:10,989 --> 00:48:23,859
effort yeah that's basically the main

00:48:14,410 --> 00:48:28,119
things we do right now for the meetups

00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:30,819
we try to do once a month and in each

00:48:28,119 --> 00:48:33,249
part of the country so people can join

00:48:30,819 --> 00:48:35,739
more easily well we own small country so

00:48:33,249 --> 00:48:39,759
you can join easily everywhere basically

00:48:35,739 --> 00:48:41,890
what we try to do a bit everywhere and

00:48:39,759 --> 00:48:44,079
map attunes will start in back and I

00:48:41,890 --> 00:48:46,199
would say every three months or so

00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:49,380
something like that so we try to do

00:48:46,199 --> 00:48:52,630
we'll try now to do more often even

00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:53,999
relative to OpenStreetMap okay when did

00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:56,650
you start

00:48:53,999 --> 00:49:01,869
well I join later but the community

00:48:56,650 --> 00:49:06,039
started around 2013 I think okay so how

00:49:01,869 --> 00:49:08,079
many people do you attract it really

00:49:06,039 --> 00:49:11,499
depends on the evens the meet-up it's

00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:16,329
usually 10 15 people just a gathering if

00:49:11,499 --> 00:49:20,140
I can drink a nice evening together but

00:49:16,329 --> 00:49:23,409
the map atoms goes from 20 people to 200

00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:26,480
so it really depends on on the event and

00:49:23,409 --> 00:49:28,470
onion state of the map was its real

00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:30,790
[Music]

00:49:28,470 --> 00:49:32,770
so there are there any special

00:49:30,790 --> 00:49:35,790
challenges that you have compulsions so

00:49:32,770 --> 00:49:39,540
I think maybe language barrier yeah

00:49:35,790 --> 00:49:43,210
that's a big one so yeah we speak French

00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:45,520
Dutch and German in Belgium so that's

00:49:43,210 --> 00:49:48,940
English I guess and yeah we decided to

00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:51,820
do everything in English because because

00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:53,380
yeah it's easy for everyone but that's

00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:55,210
still an issue because some people do

00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:56,410
not draw in the community because it's

00:49:55,210 --> 00:49:59,020
in English and they don't feel

00:49:56,410 --> 00:50:01,180
comfortable enough speaking of her

00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:03,280
writing in English so we try we use

00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:05,620
English as default but we tried with

00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:07,780
trying to include every language so

00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:09,340
anyone can join and ask their question

00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:12,940
in their own language and we'll try

00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:15,130
probably someone else document is enough

00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:18,520
to be able to reply in every language

00:50:15,130 --> 00:50:20,680
okay so is there something you're

00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:22,600
particularly proud of that you achieve

00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:24,910
well you mention state of them up

00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:30,250
obviously in a big one step the mock

00:50:24,910 --> 00:50:33,100
2016 was in Brussels so yeah that's but

00:50:30,250 --> 00:50:36,100
we're really proud of having people with

00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:38,650
a lot of well a lot of backgrounds not

00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:41,400
only software developers or GS people in

00:50:38,650 --> 00:50:43,420
the community we have people from yeah

00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:46,030
every background so that's really nice

00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:53,290
even for the discussion to have people

00:50:46,030 --> 00:50:57,370
from that not developers of some

00:50:53,290 --> 00:51:00,340
upcoming events that yeah we try to so

00:50:57,370 --> 00:51:02,800
the Open Knowledge Belgium organizations

00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:05,650
organize open Belgium every every year

00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:08,550
and we use that as a small state of the

00:51:05,650 --> 00:51:12,010
map Belgium so we have a dedicated track

00:51:08,550 --> 00:51:14,350
about OpenStreetMap inside the open

00:51:12,010 --> 00:51:18,820
Belgium conference and as I said we try

00:51:14,350 --> 00:51:21,850
now to do more regular events but somos

00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:24,610
matones meetups but also more workshops

00:51:21,850 --> 00:51:26,980
I'd say about bility to OpenStreetMap

00:51:24,610 --> 00:51:31,080
okay very cool yeah thank you for

00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:31,080
joining thank you

00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:38,440
you know what's what Jonathan has

00:51:36,070 --> 00:51:42,450
outlined there is in many ways the

00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:46,680
original way of how OpenStreetMap was

00:51:42,450 --> 00:51:49,860
done by the community mostly hobbyists

00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:53,920
geeks often computer geeks meeting up

00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:57,130
doing things in their spare time often

00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:58,990
just to scratch an itch or generate a

00:51:57,130 --> 00:52:02,230
better alternative to existing

00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:05,260
commercial maps but there are also

00:52:02,230 --> 00:52:08,890
places on earth where commercial Maps

00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:11,080
don't even exist and we're creating them

00:52:08,890 --> 00:52:13,750
is perhaps not just a hobby activity but

00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:16,540
also can be a matter of public safety

00:52:13,750 --> 00:52:18,790
and for this humanitarian aspect of

00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:20,710
OpenStreetMap we have invited Janet

00:52:18,790 --> 00:52:23,200
Chapman from the Tanzania development

00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:24,140
trust and we're going to ask her a few

00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:29,110
questions

00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:32,750
[Applause]

00:52:29,110 --> 00:52:33,410
hello Janet hello thank you for inviting

00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:36,860
me

00:52:33,410 --> 00:52:38,240
have you come from Tanzania right now no

00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:40,070
I've come well I've come from

00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:43,760
humanitarian OpenStreetMap conference

00:52:40,070 --> 00:52:47,060
two days ago and before that I was in

00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:50,320
London but I I do spend usually about

00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:53,000
two months a year in rural Tanzania so

00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:55,400
Tanzania is probably not the kind of

00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:57,710
country where like bicycle geeks in

00:52:55,400 --> 00:53:00,350
OpenStreetMap try to improve the cycling

00:52:57,710 --> 00:53:01,970
network or something what kind of

00:53:00,350 --> 00:53:04,580
mapping do you do down there yeah I

00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:06,500
think cycling is quite challenging in a

00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:11,000
lot of Tanzania because the roads are

00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:12,740
really poor so I've been a volunteer

00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,450
with Tanzania Development Trust for the

00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:16,070
last six years and when I started

00:53:14,450 --> 00:53:18,290
visiting projects there in rural

00:53:16,070 --> 00:53:20,300
Tanzania I quickly realized that their

00:53:18,290 --> 00:53:22,850
Maps were almost non-existent so you

00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:26,380
could have settlements of 10,000 people

00:53:22,850 --> 00:53:30,790
that just didn't exist on it on

00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:33,920
OpenStreetMap and we work a lot with

00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:37,220
activists who are helping protect girls

00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:40,070
from female genital mutilation in rural

00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:41,810
Tanzania and so their lack of maps of

00:53:40,070 --> 00:53:44,359
the surrounding areas where the girls

00:53:41,810 --> 00:53:48,560
were at risk was really hampering their

00:53:44,359 --> 00:53:50,960
work so for the last four years I've

00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:53,210
we've been mapping rural Tanzania for

00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:55,280
Community Development but also to help

00:53:53,210 --> 00:53:59,720
protect girls from female genital

00:53:55,280 --> 00:54:01,490
mutilation FGM hmm many many of the

00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:04,130
projects in the humanitarian sector rely

00:54:01,490 --> 00:54:06,980
very heavily on people in Western

00:54:04,130 --> 00:54:08,390
countries doing lots of tracing of roads

00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:11,090
and building stuff from earlier imagery

00:54:08,390 --> 00:54:15,109
is that also a cornerstone of the work

00:54:11,090 --> 00:54:17,720
you're doing or yes absolutely because

00:54:15,109 --> 00:54:20,030
we are also training people on the

00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:22,070
ground in rural Tanzania to use very

00:54:20,030 --> 00:54:24,500
cheap smart phones to add points or

00:54:22,070 --> 00:54:29,060
points of information for example

00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:30,770
village names clinics schools etc but

00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:34,580
it's very very difficult to do that if

00:54:30,770 --> 00:54:36,740
the if the there's no base layer so

00:54:34,580 --> 00:54:38,150
you're relying on your phone's GPS and

00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:39,920
you're just looking at a completely

00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:42,650
blank screen without any row

00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:46,700
or buildings on it so we're relying on

00:54:42,650 --> 00:54:49,660
online volunteers to do the tracing of

00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:53,630
roads and buildings so we've got around

00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:55,630
13 13 thousand online volunteers from

00:54:53,630 --> 00:54:58,520
all around the world have helped hers

00:54:55,630 --> 00:55:02,150
over the last four years to create that

00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:04,310
base map we've added around 3.9 million

00:55:02,150 --> 00:55:06,530
buildings we've still got quite a long

00:55:04,310 --> 00:55:09,680
way to go though so if anyone's

00:55:06,530 --> 00:55:15,220
interested in helping us then please let

00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:18,130
me know so we get the majority of our on

00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:20,690
volunteers from un online volunteering

00:55:18,130 --> 00:55:22,670
most of them are completely new to

00:55:20,690 --> 00:55:26,150
OpenStreetMap they've never even heard

00:55:22,670 --> 00:55:29,080
of OpenStreetMap we have a slack channel

00:55:26,150 --> 00:55:32,780
that has over 3000 people in it where

00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:35,360
more and more advanced mappers give

00:55:32,780 --> 00:55:38,240
people individual advice and coaching on

00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:39,920
their first map edits so you know we've

00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:41,720
I think we've been quite successful in

00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:44,660
bringing a lot of new people into the

00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:47,320
community we also work really closely

00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:51,200
with missing maps in London who meet

00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:54,140
every fortnight and so they've also been

00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:57,980
a great source of for help we've also

00:55:54,140 --> 00:56:00,160
set up Youth mapper chapters in four

00:55:57,980 --> 00:56:02,720
different universities in Tanzania so

00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:05,150
we're really trying to build up local

00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:07,150
expertise so we've done a lot of

00:56:05,150 --> 00:56:12,190
training on the ground in Tanzania

00:56:07,150 --> 00:56:14,870
mostly with people using maps dot me on

00:56:12,190 --> 00:56:16,850
smartphones which is great because it

00:56:14,870 --> 00:56:20,270
also works offline so they can download

00:56:16,850 --> 00:56:22,970
the app download the map of Tanzania and

00:56:20,270 --> 00:56:25,850
then add points and then when they have

00:56:22,970 --> 00:56:28,040
connectivity they can upload them so

00:56:25,850 --> 00:56:30,590
that's been that's basically how we work

00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:32,780
do people sometimes also surprise you

00:56:30,590 --> 00:56:36,980
with mapping things that you didn't

00:56:32,780 --> 00:56:39,770
expect them to yes well I mean generally

00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:42,740
english is the language of the mappers

00:56:39,770 --> 00:56:46,190
that we're training in rural Tanzania

00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:48,770
and sometimes the I think things get

00:56:46,190 --> 00:56:50,560
lost in translation so for example I

00:56:48,770 --> 00:56:52,340
noticed in one area

00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:54,950
somebody was adding

00:56:52,340 --> 00:56:58,580
pet shops everywhere and that the wrong

00:56:54,950 --> 00:57:01,160
pet shops in rural Tanzania so I had a

00:56:58,580 --> 00:57:03,080
discussion with him and but basically

00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:04,940
what we would call a convenience store

00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:09,280
for some reason he thought it was a pet

00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:14,060
shop so right and then there were other

00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:17,090
random things so yeah do people do

00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:20,420
people all have or use the map with

00:57:17,090 --> 00:57:22,220
mobile phones locally or is that or do

00:57:20,420 --> 00:57:23,750
they often have like I don't know yeah I

00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:25,190
have never been to wrong turns of the

00:57:23,750 --> 00:57:27,380
years or is there anything like a

00:57:25,190 --> 00:57:31,580
village computer that people can share

00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:34,580
or do they use printed maps or generally

00:57:31,580 --> 00:57:37,700
they generally you don't see throated

00:57:34,580 --> 00:57:41,750
Maps very often at all so if you if you

00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:43,640
go for example to the district council

00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:45,050
you know the district medical officer

00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:46,700
that is through educational office that

00:57:45,050 --> 00:57:50,000
they would never have maps of their

00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:52,400
district we're so we're starting to try

00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:54,290
and produce printed maps but we're a

00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:56,840
network of volunteers and we're running

00:57:54,290 --> 00:58:00,020
on a shoestring so print printing Maps

00:57:56,840 --> 00:58:03,430
it you know has some expense to it and

00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:05,870
also distribution and so on so but

00:58:03,430 --> 00:58:09,260
generally people don't have access to

00:58:05,870 --> 00:58:12,920
laptops very much so the majority of

00:58:09,260 --> 00:58:15,860
people are using phones so we've done a

00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:20,120
lot of training with particularly police

00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:24,430
officers so to get them to install map

00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:27,230
stop me on their phones so because in

00:58:24,430 --> 00:58:29,720
the effort of how their protection

00:58:27,230 --> 00:58:32,390
against FGM works there's a cutting

00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:35,360
season in the long school holiday

00:58:32,390 --> 00:58:36,770
January December and the police and the

00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:38,390
activists will get a phone call in the

00:58:36,770 --> 00:58:40,390
middle of the night saying there's girls

00:58:38,390 --> 00:58:42,770
about to be cut in this village

00:58:40,390 --> 00:58:45,200
previously that village wasn't on in any

00:58:42,770 --> 00:58:48,290
map so we're trading them to use maps

00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:51,050
dot me to be able to route to that place

00:58:48,290 --> 00:58:53,540
so that they can protect those girls

00:58:51,050 --> 00:58:56,360
you mentioned the short string budget

00:58:53,540 --> 00:59:00,950
who funds the work that you do okay so

00:58:56,360 --> 00:59:04,190
we had a micro grant from humanitarian

00:59:00,950 --> 00:59:05,950
OpenStreetMap two years ago that was

00:59:04,190 --> 00:59:09,249
five thousand dollars

00:59:05,950 --> 00:59:11,289
and we're doing a bit of work with the

00:59:09,249 --> 00:59:13,059
women connect project but most of the

00:59:11,289 --> 00:59:16,420
most of the funding has come from

00:59:13,059 --> 00:59:19,269
individual donations all right thanks a

00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:21,400
lot for this small insight I think you

00:59:19,269 --> 00:59:23,170
have a lightning table today

00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:26,979
later today about the work that you do

00:59:23,170 --> 00:59:29,019
yes I do it two o'clock and if anyone if

00:59:26,979 --> 00:59:30,789
anyone's interested in helping in any

00:59:29,019 --> 00:59:34,900
way we're always particularly looking

00:59:30,789 --> 00:59:37,930
for validators then please get in touch

00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:42,519
website is crowd to map with a number

00:59:37,930 --> 00:59:44,469
two and my email is Jay dr. Chapman at

00:59:42,519 --> 00:59:48,069
tans dev trust

00:59:44,469 --> 00:59:49,420
so always really looking forward to

00:59:48,069 --> 00:59:59,979
talking to other people

00:59:49,420 --> 01:00:03,430
thank you now we already have

00:59:59,979 --> 01:00:07,269
demonstrated how easy it is to introduce

01:00:03,430 --> 01:00:09,160
new people to OS m and you might surely

01:00:07,269 --> 01:00:11,829
think okay all those new people they

01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:14,890
will probably generate some some

01:00:11,829 --> 01:00:18,130
mistakes also exactly true OpenStreetMap

01:00:14,890 --> 01:00:19,089
is full of bugs you know that non-square

01:00:18,130 --> 01:00:21,430
buildings

01:00:19,089 --> 01:00:23,859
pew eyes in the middle of the road

01:00:21,430 --> 01:00:25,630
high-rise going the one-way streets

01:00:23,859 --> 01:00:28,559
going the wrong way rivers flow flowing

01:00:25,630 --> 01:00:31,209
uphill all these things you know

01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:33,759
okay okay okay but sm is made by people

01:00:31,209 --> 01:00:37,239
so people make mistakes but we also take

01:00:33,759 --> 01:00:40,199
quality assurance very seriously and yet

01:00:37,239 --> 01:00:44,079
there's error detection everywhere and

01:00:40,199 --> 01:00:47,380
our next guest operates one of those

01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:48,759
quality assurance systems and lays in

01:00:47,380 --> 01:00:51,719
that one welcome

01:00:48,759 --> 01:00:51,719
very cool eagle

01:00:54,390 --> 01:01:02,730
[Applause]

01:00:56,570 --> 01:01:06,359
hi so you run a site called Osmos yeah

01:01:02,730 --> 01:01:09,109
and this shows test analyzes

01:01:06,359 --> 01:01:13,290
osm data for all kinds of issues and

01:01:09,109 --> 01:01:15,060
potential problems and so on what of

01:01:13,290 --> 01:01:18,359
what kind of issues do you find what

01:01:15,060 --> 01:01:22,260
what what do you show there there isn't

01:01:18,359 --> 01:01:28,070
as pretty tell many kind of issue like

01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:31,800
people like unconnected away like

01:01:28,070 --> 01:01:34,140
highway crossing a highway I were on a

01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:39,290
railway with connection on the same

01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:39,290
level there was something strange like

01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:47,339
by the direction on boot there is a lot

01:01:44,339 --> 01:01:50,520
lot of insight to a geometric mistake

01:01:47,339 --> 01:01:52,890
tag mistake there is a lot of

01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:56,690
possibilities okay maybe you can you can

01:01:52,890 --> 01:01:56,690
show us quickly how it looks like

01:02:21,670 --> 01:02:32,680
so so there is a map with a lot of pins

01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:37,130
each spins it's an issue an issue is a

01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:39,380
possible problem but only possible is

01:02:37,130 --> 01:02:49,820
not a bird is not sure there is

01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:54,680
something to do so as I'm a bit and on

01:02:49,820 --> 01:02:59,060
the left there is a lot of attempts each

01:02:54,680 --> 01:03:05,090
times is a kind of issue you can select

01:02:59,060 --> 01:03:08,390
issue by severity the severity is impact

01:03:05,090 --> 01:03:13,040
in the map so the best way is searching

01:03:08,390 --> 01:03:17,420
with a severity each pin have a

01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:23,050
description about what is suppose that

01:03:17,420 --> 01:03:30,500
wrong so I think a random issue is about

01:03:23,050 --> 01:03:34,640
combination of laser natural so it's not

01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:37,700
maybe is not a problem here so here

01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:43,210
another issue about the max max speed

01:03:37,700 --> 01:03:47,270
that not supa said to be 80 in the

01:03:43,210 --> 01:03:49,340
Germany rural area so each time there is

01:03:47,270 --> 01:03:54,890
a description the tags and the

01:03:49,340 --> 01:04:05,720
possibilities to open the object in OS m

01:03:54,890 --> 01:04:09,950
dot hog or editors okay so you can check

01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:14,090
to use you on the green or tells you

01:04:09,950 --> 01:04:16,760
there is not issuer and then when you on

01:04:14,090 --> 01:04:20,930
your side sends the data to the

01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:25,070
OpenStreetMap that daughter in the next

01:04:20,930 --> 01:04:29,060
day we recheck all the world and then

01:04:25,070 --> 01:04:31,990
it's updated even if you fix that I will

01:04:29,060 --> 01:04:36,550
close the P as though a day too

01:04:31,990 --> 01:04:41,070
we clean the map okay so how many issues

01:04:36,550 --> 01:04:48,730
do you have a lot a lot there is a

01:04:41,070 --> 01:04:51,820
sixteen sixty million of issue of all

01:04:48,730 --> 01:04:56,490
severity but badly there is a priority

01:04:51,820 --> 01:05:02,680
with sorority as is only four million of

01:04:56,490 --> 01:05:05,230
first priority okay is it is it

01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:09,480
frustrating to see so many arrows or do

01:05:05,230 --> 01:05:13,260
you think oh that's no no it's a chance

01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:16,750
more we have data nor we have use you

01:05:13,260 --> 01:05:21,970
and there is not always something

01:05:16,750 --> 01:05:24,460
important to fix more more we add tags

01:05:21,970 --> 01:05:28,600
more we at that time we are with you and

01:05:24,460 --> 01:05:31,780
also what we know about issue and what

01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:35,380
we want on the data what we want to be

01:05:31,780 --> 01:05:38,170
good we add words so more we are the

01:05:35,380 --> 01:05:41,980
words what we have issue to the good way

01:05:38,170 --> 01:05:43,330
is we know about the issue aware so that

01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:46,660
is good or not

01:05:43,330 --> 01:05:53,130
so having issue having pins it's a good

01:05:46,660 --> 01:05:56,800
way to focus okay but already their own

01:05:53,130 --> 01:05:59,590
validation is there more stuff that you

01:05:56,800 --> 01:06:01,660
do with that those editors don't do what

01:05:59,590 --> 01:06:02,950
do you think yeah in the future all the

01:06:01,660 --> 01:06:06,330
editors will do it on their own and

01:06:02,950 --> 01:06:06,330
there will be nothing to do for you

01:06:08,609 --> 01:06:18,310
first on say D term you show a issue on

01:06:13,990 --> 01:06:22,680
the data you are you are working on so

01:06:18,310 --> 01:06:25,980
you you wrote small area and you are you

01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:30,670
issue on this Mariah or issues that

01:06:25,980 --> 01:06:34,960
yourself changing here we are running

01:06:30,670 --> 01:06:36,010
words around the world every day so we

01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:39,340
show

01:06:36,010 --> 01:06:42,850
the issue well sir and the contributor

01:06:39,340 --> 01:06:46,780
can go to this hair to fix the issue of

01:06:42,850 --> 01:06:49,660
this on issue of the other issue done by

01:06:46,780 --> 01:06:52,480
other people or when we add new words

01:06:49,660 --> 01:06:58,440
there are not already here in the past

01:06:52,480 --> 01:07:06,160
fix issue of the past and so suppose way

01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:08,980
our interesting and needing ok right so

01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:14,530
it's stair any other tooling that you

01:07:08,980 --> 01:07:18,430
would suggest to find maybe problems

01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:20,230
with the yeah yeah there is a reserve

01:07:18,430 --> 01:07:23,650
tools with those are rules

01:07:20,230 --> 01:07:26,860
so was the issue so small number of

01:07:23,650 --> 01:07:30,700
issue mark for most most are not all the

01:07:26,860 --> 01:07:33,070
issues those are to salt tip right and

01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:37,650
what some inspectors there are a similar

01:07:33,070 --> 01:07:42,130
to as much but there is another kind of

01:07:37,650 --> 01:07:44,860
tools based on the changes air is only

01:07:42,130 --> 01:07:48,100
checking the data as I are in the

01:07:44,860 --> 01:07:54,480
OpenStreetMap database there is a osm

01:07:48,100 --> 01:07:58,470
check checking the changes so we can

01:07:54,480 --> 01:08:01,330
review the changes made by your author

01:07:58,470 --> 01:08:05,580
contributor and checking on these

01:08:01,330 --> 01:08:07,920
changes ok so thanks a lot for the

01:08:05,580 --> 01:08:09,840
answers thanks a lot for your work

01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:12,949
Thanks

01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:12,949
[Applause]

01:08:15,060 --> 01:08:25,210
right now for something completely

01:08:18,430 --> 01:08:27,069
different the map aren't we talking for

01:08:25,210 --> 01:08:29,109
like over an hour now for them about the

01:08:27,069 --> 01:08:32,500
map well we've talked about how data

01:08:29,109 --> 01:08:34,510
comes into OpenStreetMap and how the

01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:37,500
community makes it and how it gets fixed

01:08:34,510 --> 01:08:39,940
but now we're talking about how the map

01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:42,130
comes how the net data comes out of

01:08:39,940 --> 01:08:45,430
OpenStreetMap and how the map that you

01:08:42,130 --> 01:08:47,950
see on over 300 foot org is made from

01:08:45,430 --> 01:08:59,130
the data and for this we have invited

01:08:47,950 --> 01:09:02,069
and the Ellen or as our next guest hello

01:08:59,130 --> 01:09:05,560
would you say you're a photographer

01:09:02,069 --> 01:09:07,720
among other things so actually my degree

01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:09,400
is in chemistry so I feel really

01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:11,830
comfortable here with the chalkboards

01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:13,750
and the the sinks hidden behind here as

01:09:11,830 --> 01:09:16,420
well to wash away the chemicals so yeah

01:09:13,750 --> 01:09:19,350
but I do Katoch Rafi and also software

01:09:16,420 --> 01:09:22,060
development and other things right they

01:09:19,350 --> 01:09:24,400
when when I invited you here you said

01:09:22,060 --> 01:09:27,910
that others can probably say more about

01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:29,790
the current state of the map on

01:09:27,910 --> 01:09:32,140
OpenStreetMap but you were involved

01:09:29,790 --> 01:09:35,170
quite a lot in the beginnings can you

01:09:32,140 --> 01:09:39,280
tell us what the OpenStreetMap counter

01:09:35,170 --> 01:09:42,640
project is so the OpenStreetMap carter

01:09:39,280 --> 01:09:45,850
project is the current set of rules that

01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:49,060
convert the map data into the visual

01:09:45,850 --> 01:09:49,870
maps that you see so they the colors and

01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:53,020
so on

01:09:49,870 --> 01:09:56,890
ana i played a part in that project of

01:09:53,020 --> 01:09:59,740
creating it back in 2012 based on an

01:09:56,890 --> 01:10:01,930
existing map style so my work was partly

01:09:59,740 --> 01:10:03,790
technology and also partly cuz ography

01:10:01,930 --> 01:10:07,210
and but as you say there's a lot of

01:10:03,790 --> 01:10:09,580
other people involved now it's got six

01:10:07,210 --> 01:10:13,750
other main tenors and a whole bunch of

01:10:09,580 --> 01:10:18,580
people who create issues and work on the

01:10:13,750 --> 01:10:21,190
project so the project overall is this

01:10:18,580 --> 01:10:22,840
idea we've got the data in the database

01:10:21,190 --> 01:10:24,780
that we've talked about and we want to

01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:26,760
see that data on

01:10:24,780 --> 01:10:30,630
and so certain decisions need to be made

01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:33,090
like what color should things be how way

01:10:30,630 --> 01:10:36,060
to the roads look what the zoom levels

01:10:33,090 --> 01:10:38,700
should things appear on and these rules

01:10:36,060 --> 01:10:41,310
are collected together in the form and

01:10:38,700 --> 01:10:42,960
we call them style sheets or map style

01:10:41,310 --> 01:10:45,180
sheets and that's what will consume up

01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:48,090
car to is so open straight McCarter

01:10:45,180 --> 01:10:50,280
basically decides what gets on the map

01:10:48,090 --> 01:10:53,580
and but when I add something in an

01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:55,860
editor say like a shop a candlestick

01:10:53,580 --> 01:10:58,890
maker or something you know some

01:10:55,860 --> 01:11:02,220
specialist thing it doesn't necessarily

01:10:58,890 --> 01:11:04,050
appear on the map yeah that's right we

01:11:02,220 --> 01:11:06,450
can't show every piece of information

01:11:04,050 --> 01:11:11,160
that's in OpenStreetMap on the one map

01:11:06,450 --> 01:11:12,990
so I think there's some things like

01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:15,120
opening hours these are these are

01:11:12,990 --> 01:11:16,320
important and useful and you see them on

01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:18,300
an application when you click on

01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:20,130
something but if we wrote the opening

01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:22,440
hour of every restaurant across the map

01:11:20,130 --> 01:11:24,480
it would be a complete mess so whenever

01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:26,730
we're creating the map we need to choose

01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:28,560
not only what features we want to show

01:11:26,730 --> 01:11:30,780
on the map but what attributes we're

01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:32,730
going to look at which tags we're going

01:11:30,780 --> 01:11:36,510
to look at in order to show those

01:11:32,730 --> 01:11:38,490
features you were the creator of one of

01:11:36,510 --> 01:11:43,080
the first special-purpose OpenStreetMap

01:11:38,490 --> 01:11:45,270
Maps the open cycle map so apparently

01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:48,810
it's quite possible to take

01:11:45,270 --> 01:11:51,000
OpenStreetMap data and make special maps

01:11:48,810 --> 01:11:53,010
that are for one particular purpose sure

01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:55,860
of that show something particularly can

01:11:53,010 --> 01:11:59,250
you maybe show us on the browser a

01:11:55,860 --> 01:12:01,560
couple of examples in how something like

01:11:59,250 --> 01:12:05,250
the open cycle map differs from the

01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:07,620
standard map just open this thing up for

01:12:05,250 --> 01:12:09,570
you yeah let's let's have a look so you

01:12:07,620 --> 01:12:12,360
can change the map layers on Open Street

01:12:09,570 --> 01:12:15,020
Map and we have a few available and the

01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:20,280
cycle map is a project that I started

01:12:15,020 --> 01:12:24,060
back in 2007 and so changing to that

01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:26,360
layer we see we see a few changes we

01:12:24,060 --> 01:12:29,700
show bike parking we highlight where and

01:12:26,360 --> 01:12:31,860
you which paths you can cycle on and we

01:12:29,700 --> 01:12:33,810
sure where the cycle routes are and so

01:12:31,860 --> 01:12:35,550
you're kind of mental map of what

01:12:33,810 --> 01:12:37,350
Heidelberg looks like could be quite

01:12:35,550 --> 01:12:38,610
different depending on whether you're

01:12:37,350 --> 01:12:41,659
interested in cycling

01:12:38,610 --> 01:12:44,190
or you're driving through town where the

01:12:41,659 --> 01:12:46,199
motorways are more important or if

01:12:44,190 --> 01:12:47,670
you're taking public transport you want

01:12:46,199 --> 01:12:48,810
to see where the bus routes are or

01:12:47,670 --> 01:12:50,909
you're more interested in where the

01:12:48,810 --> 01:12:54,000
railways and the travelers go so all of

01:12:50,909 --> 01:12:56,369
these different map layers are all based

01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:58,590
on the same OpenStreetMap data it's just

01:12:56,369 --> 01:13:00,570
it's not possible to show all the

01:12:58,590 --> 01:13:03,900
features at the same time if you think

01:13:00,570 --> 01:13:08,100
of one road that has six bus routes and

01:13:03,900 --> 01:13:11,010
a bike route and a two long-distance

01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:13,409
road networks and a hiking path all

01:13:11,010 --> 01:13:15,330
doing the same street you can't show all

01:13:13,409 --> 01:13:16,889
of those at the same time so having

01:13:15,330 --> 01:13:18,659
different map layers allows us to

01:13:16,889 --> 01:13:21,330
highlight different features those

01:13:18,659 --> 01:13:23,760
former players the the only map layers

01:13:21,330 --> 01:13:25,770
that there are no I just talked about

01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:27,989
earlier the planet files are released so

01:13:25,770 --> 01:13:30,900
anybody can can make their own map

01:13:27,989 --> 01:13:34,110
players these are just four that I've

01:13:30,900 --> 01:13:35,969
been chosen to demonstrate the

01:13:34,110 --> 01:13:37,739
possibilities but there are hundreds and

01:13:35,969 --> 01:13:39,360
hundreds of different map styles for

01:13:37,739 --> 01:13:42,570
different people as well like for hiking

01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:45,210
or for whitewater rafting or for all

01:13:42,570 --> 01:13:47,489
kinds of different purposes if someone

01:13:45,210 --> 01:13:49,199
wanted to make their own map like if

01:13:47,489 --> 01:13:50,969
someone were to start today and wanted

01:13:49,199 --> 01:13:54,659
to make something like open cycle map or

01:13:50,969 --> 01:13:55,920
something with what kind of tools or

01:13:54,659 --> 01:13:58,040
what kind of software would you

01:13:55,920 --> 01:14:00,179
recommend that they start using for that

01:13:58,040 --> 01:14:03,389
that's a really hard question because

01:14:00,179 --> 01:14:06,810
yeah so this software that I would

01:14:03,389 --> 01:14:12,929
choose might not be everybody's cup of

01:14:06,810 --> 01:14:16,110
tea so for the projects I use where

01:14:12,929 --> 01:14:18,420
involves or sends PG SQL for converting

01:14:16,110 --> 01:14:20,639
the data ready for for rendering and

01:14:18,420 --> 01:14:24,119
then software like Matunuck which is a

01:14:20,639 --> 01:14:27,869
map rendering library they can can

01:14:24,119 --> 01:14:30,210
create these map images right thank you

01:14:27,869 --> 01:14:32,360
very much and yellow this few words

01:14:30,210 --> 01:14:32,360
about

01:14:36,590 --> 01:14:45,780
okay now um making maps is one way in in

01:14:43,290 --> 01:14:48,870
which the data can the data in

01:14:45,780 --> 01:14:51,780
OpenStreetMap is used another very

01:14:48,870 --> 01:14:53,730
important thing and you see that here

01:14:51,780 --> 01:14:58,050
while the browsers open another very

01:14:53,730 --> 01:15:00,390
important thing is searching you you

01:14:58,050 --> 01:15:03,210
have a an input box here and you can put

01:15:00,390 --> 01:15:06,770
in like cards rule curls rule and it'll

01:15:03,210 --> 01:15:12,030
go away from Heidelberg and go to cancel

01:15:06,770 --> 01:15:14,780
the the process of converting a search

01:15:12,030 --> 01:15:18,480
term like an address or a place name

01:15:14,780 --> 01:15:21,510
into geo coordinates or even maybe in

01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:25,860
this case a polygon is called geocoding

01:15:21,510 --> 01:15:28,590
and the geocoding software that is used

01:15:25,860 --> 01:15:30,540
on the OpenStreetMap website it's called

01:15:28,590 --> 01:15:33,720
nominate a man who better to ask

01:15:30,540 --> 01:15:37,050
questions about no not him then the

01:15:33,720 --> 01:15:44,750
maintainer of nominative Zara Hoffman

01:15:37,050 --> 01:15:46,140
[Applause]

01:15:44,750 --> 01:15:50,640
hello Sara

01:15:46,140 --> 01:15:52,470
yep not only the maintainer of the open

01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:54,870
door thing no mean item software but

01:15:52,470 --> 01:15:56,850
you're also the scissor men looking

01:15:54,870 --> 01:15:58,860
after the service how many how many

01:15:56,850 --> 01:16:03,210
searches does the OpenStreetMap website

01:15:58,860 --> 01:16:05,490
run every day also the website itself

01:16:03,210 --> 01:16:07,920
actually it's quite a small part at the

01:16:05,490 --> 01:16:09,780
server gets so we get about 25 million

01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:12,240
requests per day so at the peak time

01:16:09,780 --> 01:16:13,650
that's 500 requests per second but

01:16:12,240 --> 01:16:17,700
actually only a small part comes from

01:16:13,650 --> 01:16:21,180
the website itself so that's about one

01:16:17,700 --> 01:16:22,230
per second right and and of course

01:16:21,180 --> 01:16:24,900
because it's open source software

01:16:22,230 --> 01:16:26,940
everyone can install the software for

01:16:24,900 --> 01:16:30,120
themselves do you have any idea how many

01:16:26,940 --> 01:16:32,280
people run their own items well not too

01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:34,290
much because they don't tell but

01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:37,620
actually there is a little piece of data

01:16:34,290 --> 01:16:39,660
we are using wiki data data wiki pedia

01:16:37,620 --> 01:16:41,340
data which you have to download when you

01:16:39,660 --> 01:16:43,230
want to install your own installation

01:16:41,340 --> 01:16:46,590
and we're seeing that there are about a

01:16:43,230 --> 01:16:48,690
dozen downloads per day so probably some

01:16:46,590 --> 01:16:50,580
of them just trying them out but you can

01:16:48,690 --> 01:16:53,160
do the math even with just one of them

01:16:50,580 --> 01:16:55,080
actually installs there's probably a

01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:56,910
thousand of them around here the

01:16:55,080 --> 01:16:59,820
original developer of Illuminati was

01:16:56,910 --> 01:17:02,190
Brian Queen and then you took over from

01:16:59,820 --> 01:17:04,290
him as some at some point as the

01:17:02,190 --> 01:17:08,130
maintainer how did you become interested

01:17:04,290 --> 01:17:09,600
in hacking on nominative actually I

01:17:08,130 --> 01:17:12,690
started with the system administration

01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:14,340
so in I think 2011 the awesome

01:17:12,690 --> 01:17:18,060
foundation bought a new server for

01:17:14,340 --> 01:17:20,490
geocoding and it was sitting there

01:17:18,060 --> 01:17:21,930
because Brian didn't have the time and I

01:17:20,490 --> 01:17:23,820
had never done something with nominative

01:17:21,930 --> 01:17:25,890
but I thought well what the heck and I

01:17:23,820 --> 01:17:28,500
asked if I can help out and to my utter

01:17:25,890 --> 01:17:31,290
surprise actually Tom Hughes the main

01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:32,790
system administrator just told me here's

01:17:31,290 --> 01:17:35,220
the root password tell me when I can

01:17:32,790 --> 01:17:38,220
switch the main side to the new server

01:17:35,220 --> 01:17:40,650
and so basically that's how it started

01:17:38,220 --> 01:17:43,410
and then of course I started also

01:17:40,650 --> 01:17:46,110
improving the software and at some point

01:17:43,410 --> 01:17:49,140
Brian did other stuff and I basically

01:17:46,110 --> 01:17:49,890
became the main maintainer now geocoding

01:17:49,140 --> 01:17:51,780
doesn't sound too

01:17:49,890 --> 01:17:53,820
hard I mean there's just there's just a

01:17:51,780 --> 01:17:55,620
list of lots of addresses and I put them

01:17:53,820 --> 01:17:57,090
all in a database and then when someone

01:17:55,620 --> 01:18:00,750
searches for something I just pull out

01:17:57,090 --> 01:18:02,130
the right record and that's it it's the

01:18:00,750 --> 01:18:04,680
basic principle yes

01:18:02,130 --> 01:18:06,870
so the problem is a little bit of scale

01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:10,680
so we're having a planet-wide database

01:18:06,870 --> 01:18:12,840
and at the moment that's about 250

01:18:10,680 --> 01:18:15,750
million entries which your little table

01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:18,690
has the other problem is of course we're

01:18:15,750 --> 01:18:21,270
not having addresses directly in osm so

01:18:18,690 --> 01:18:23,970
some objects do have maybe have house

01:18:21,270 --> 01:18:25,560
numbers and address text but mostly you

01:18:23,970 --> 01:18:28,050
actually have to compute the address

01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:31,620
yourself and that's a large part of what

01:18:28,050 --> 01:18:33,390
the Manhattan is doing and even when you

01:18:31,620 --> 01:18:34,890
once have computed the data that's not

01:18:33,390 --> 01:18:37,110
enough because mappers want to have the

01:18:34,890 --> 01:18:38,700
data fresh if they map anything they

01:18:37,110 --> 01:18:40,920
want to have it immediately searchable

01:18:38,700 --> 01:18:45,060
so we have to do minute lis updates and

01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:47,630
all this adds up to a lot of a lot of

01:18:45,060 --> 01:18:50,400
work you have to do and a lot of

01:18:47,630 --> 01:18:52,260
optimizations you have to do a slide

01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:54,630
from the talk that you did a couple of

01:18:52,260 --> 01:18:56,850
years ago said I still remember that I

01:18:54,630 --> 01:18:59,910
said it is easy to write a geo coder

01:18:56,850 --> 01:19:02,310
that is right 80% of the time what are

01:18:59,910 --> 01:19:06,660
the other 20% what is what are the

01:19:02,310 --> 01:19:08,550
different difficult cases yeah so the

01:19:06,660 --> 01:19:12,270
stuff I didn't touch on now is actually

01:19:08,550 --> 01:19:13,830
finding the stuff and doing this for the

01:19:12,270 --> 01:19:16,260
planet is actually quite difficult so

01:19:13,830 --> 01:19:17,730
you can write like geo coder which for

01:19:16,260 --> 01:19:19,800
example for Germany just finds the

01:19:17,730 --> 01:19:21,840
addresses that's easy there is exactly

01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:25,470
one format you know about what people

01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:27,660
are going to do and it's relatively easy

01:19:25,470 --> 01:19:29,670
to write this so going the other 20%

01:19:27,660 --> 01:19:31,710
saying okay let's extend this to empty

01:19:29,670 --> 01:19:34,170
entire world that sweats gets difficult

01:19:31,710 --> 01:19:35,730
or another example is somebody wrote the

01:19:34,170 --> 01:19:38,040
Geo code and said left out the house

01:19:35,730 --> 01:19:40,500
numbers and said oh that's just an easy

01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:42,420
exercise but actually that's half of the

01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:46,130
data because house numbers is the stuff

01:19:42,420 --> 01:19:51,840
that's really really adds up to a lot

01:19:46,130 --> 01:19:53,460
they what's life like as I the

01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:57,260
maintainer of Naumann atom do you do

01:19:53,460 --> 01:20:00,060
develop new features all the time or

01:19:57,260 --> 01:20:02,030
unfortunately not so I'm also doing this

01:20:00,060 --> 01:20:05,120
basically in my spare time

01:20:02,030 --> 01:20:08,630
and nowadays it's a lot answering issues

01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:10,940
and just fixing smaller backs changing

01:20:08,630 --> 01:20:12,740
stuff under the hood I mean the OSM that

01:20:10,940 --> 01:20:14,990
has really grown a lot in the last

01:20:12,740 --> 01:20:17,390
year's and we're still running the mall

01:20:14,990 --> 01:20:19,730
staff on a single server so there's a

01:20:17,390 --> 01:20:21,740
lot of work going into optimizing the

01:20:19,730 --> 01:20:24,050
database optimizing to search and so on

01:20:21,740 --> 01:20:25,340
do you have something like a wish list

01:20:24,050 --> 01:20:27,290
where they say I would really love

01:20:25,340 --> 01:20:29,440
someone to develop this feature or

01:20:27,290 --> 01:20:32,030
submit a patch for this something or so

01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:35,510
of course there's a there's a couple of

01:20:32,030 --> 01:20:37,970
things on github one of the things I'd

01:20:35,510 --> 01:20:40,400
really really love to see finally is on

01:20:37,970 --> 01:20:40,790
the open street my websites such as your

01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:42,440
type

01:20:40,790 --> 01:20:44,960
so we get suggestions basically while

01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:46,760
you're typing your search we actually

01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:48,140
have two parts for this so there is

01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:50,450
photon which is another get to your

01:20:48,140 --> 01:20:52,850
quota which can do this and it's mostly

01:20:50,450 --> 01:20:54,830
a precision of integration but yeah

01:20:52,850 --> 01:20:58,310
that's something I'd like to see we

01:20:54,830 --> 01:21:00,380
actually did suggest this for the google

01:20:58,310 --> 01:21:02,060
Summer of Code is here unfortunately

01:21:00,380 --> 01:21:04,220
yeah we didn't find a student for it

01:21:02,060 --> 01:21:08,030
but that's one of the things which are

01:21:04,220 --> 01:21:11,870
nice any-any pro tips if I if I want to

01:21:08,030 --> 01:21:13,430
search an Open Street Map to maximize my

01:21:11,870 --> 01:21:17,480
chances of actually finding what I'm

01:21:13,430 --> 01:21:20,090
looking for well the one pro tip is use

01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:22,640
commas so if you are typing your address

01:21:20,090 --> 01:21:24,590
and it commas in between the different

01:21:22,640 --> 01:21:26,150
parts then the chances are a lot better

01:21:24,590 --> 01:21:29,750
that no me not and will do the right

01:21:26,150 --> 01:21:34,030
thing and find your what is searching

01:21:29,750 --> 01:21:34,030
for okay thank you very much Sarah

01:21:39,340 --> 01:21:45,560
yes so you have seen Illuminati which is

01:21:42,920 --> 01:21:47,870
a very specific kind of search so if you

01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:50,510
need some specific place he will get

01:21:47,870 --> 01:21:52,400
exactly this but that's not the only

01:21:50,510 --> 01:21:55,070
strength of our semaphore Sam you can

01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:57,080
actually do whatever you want you can do

01:21:55,070 --> 01:21:59,870
all kind of searches and you can

01:21:57,080 --> 01:22:01,580
actually get the raw data for example

01:21:59,870 --> 01:22:04,100
you can download the whole planet file

01:22:01,580 --> 01:22:06,860
that we describes beginning of the talk

01:22:04,100 --> 01:22:10,310
you can import it into a database and

01:22:06,860 --> 01:22:13,790
then do all sorts of SQL queries on on

01:22:10,310 --> 01:22:15,230
top of that you can you can search

01:22:13,790 --> 01:22:18,230
whatever you want basically

01:22:15,230 --> 01:22:21,640
but osm has a lot of data so it might

01:22:18,230 --> 01:22:25,310
actually be not that easy to do it and

01:22:21,640 --> 01:22:27,680
but there are other ways that are hosted

01:22:25,310 --> 01:22:31,330
by OpenStreetMap and a long time ago

01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:35,120
there has been X API and then in 2011

01:22:31,330 --> 01:22:37,730
Volant a list and built the overpass API

01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:41,450
which is a query language and query

01:22:37,730 --> 01:22:45,280
engine that gives you the opportunity to

01:22:41,450 --> 01:22:48,440
search for any data that you want and

01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:50,720
yet all paths riku but didn't have a

01:22:48,440 --> 01:22:54,490
user interface so adoption was really

01:22:50,720 --> 01:22:58,550
slow but luckily like two years later so

01:22:54,490 --> 01:23:00,880
martin either came along and built an

01:22:58,550 --> 01:23:03,290
interface for that overpass tool and

01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:05,730
that's what we want to go what's we

01:23:03,290 --> 01:23:08,980
gonna talk about now

01:23:05,730 --> 01:23:08,980
[Applause]

01:23:11,070 --> 01:23:17,920
hey Martin overpassed uber is basically

01:23:14,350 --> 01:23:21,460
just an interface to the backend query

01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:24,190
engine of the past yet most people use

01:23:21,460 --> 01:23:26,950
overpass turbo and few people use all

01:23:24,190 --> 01:23:29,170
the parts directly so you get all the

01:23:26,950 --> 01:23:32,020
praise do you and will on the inventor

01:23:29,170 --> 01:23:34,230
of the overpass still get along well or

01:23:32,020 --> 01:23:38,440
well I hope so

01:23:34,230 --> 01:23:40,750
so firstly it's also kind of good

01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:42,790
situation that we find each other that

01:23:40,750 --> 01:23:45,190
you can benefit from each other so I was

01:23:42,790 --> 01:23:48,310
I'm glad that I do not have to do while

01:23:45,190 --> 01:23:50,230
it's hard back-end stuff the database

01:23:48,310 --> 01:23:52,770
administration and keeping up with two

01:23:50,230 --> 01:23:57,010
silvers and the demand from the users

01:23:52,770 --> 01:23:59,320
and he's glad I think that he doesn't

01:23:57,010 --> 01:24:00,130
have to worry about creating the user

01:23:59,320 --> 01:24:03,610
interface for it

01:24:00,130 --> 01:24:05,890
now they overpass fearing overpass has a

01:24:03,610 --> 01:24:09,910
couple of query languages and they're

01:24:05,890 --> 01:24:11,980
all a bit difficult to learn has this

01:24:09,910 --> 01:24:15,460
overpass turbo mean I don't have to

01:24:11,980 --> 01:24:17,680
learn any of them well basically it

01:24:15,460 --> 01:24:19,380
gives you a starting point so there are

01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:21,370
it comes with a couple of examples

01:24:19,380 --> 01:24:25,270
pre-loaded that you can look at and

01:24:21,370 --> 01:24:26,620
learn from and there's also not since

01:24:25,270 --> 01:24:30,330
the beginning but at some point I

01:24:26,620 --> 01:24:33,340
thought it's we need some kind of

01:24:30,330 --> 01:24:36,700
healthy mechanism for people that are

01:24:33,340 --> 01:24:39,730
starting to do some some basic rights

01:24:36,700 --> 01:24:43,050
more easily so therefore I added a

01:24:39,730 --> 01:24:43,050
component called wizard

01:24:43,350 --> 01:24:50,710
I'll just put this up for you it's like

01:24:48,820 --> 01:24:53,590
to visit this a bit similar to a search

01:24:50,710 --> 01:24:57,000
box that you have on OpenStreetMap it

01:24:53,590 --> 01:24:57,000
allows it to yeah

01:24:58,390 --> 01:25:04,570
to just enter a short phrase a search

01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:07,140
phrase and can you do something like I

01:25:04,570 --> 01:25:10,360
don't know postboxes or something or

01:25:07,140 --> 01:25:13,090
yeah thanks

01:25:10,360 --> 01:25:16,300
so basically it already knows about the

01:25:13,090 --> 01:25:18,460
EM tanks and not all of them but the

01:25:16,300 --> 01:25:25,660
couple so important stuff like a postbox

01:25:18,460 --> 01:25:29,380
would already be found if you just press

01:25:25,660 --> 01:25:31,690
ENTER then it gives you the query for

01:25:29,380 --> 01:25:35,050
following all the post boxes from street

01:25:31,690 --> 01:25:39,610
map onto your map view here and then you

01:25:35,050 --> 01:25:41,890
can can click on the visual ones and get

01:25:39,610 --> 01:25:46,150
some additional details for example some

01:25:41,890 --> 01:25:51,880
names or whatever and yeah you can also

01:25:46,150 --> 01:25:54,220
go to a different location and run the

01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:57,040
query again to get the post boxes for

01:25:54,220 --> 01:25:59,650
the respective respective area can I

01:25:57,040 --> 01:26:01,480
also do something like so this is this

01:25:59,650 --> 01:26:02,980
now runs on the whole area that I see on

01:26:01,480 --> 01:26:05,260
the screen you can also do something

01:26:02,980 --> 01:26:07,000
like okay I only want within the city

01:26:05,260 --> 01:26:09,160
boundaries of heidelberg or something

01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:11,680
yeah that's also possible so even in the

01:26:09,160 --> 01:26:18,220
wizard you can tell them that

01:26:11,680 --> 01:26:21,850
give me the mailboxes in and then it

01:26:18,220 --> 01:26:24,090
fetches the area and afterwards or the

01:26:21,850 --> 01:26:27,130
post boxes in this area from overpass

01:26:24,090 --> 01:26:30,820
that's really cool can I can I also do

01:26:27,130 --> 01:26:32,530
something like all post boxes within two

01:26:30,820 --> 01:26:34,600
kilometers of the university or

01:26:32,530 --> 01:26:36,580
something like that yeah this is always

01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:39,760
stretching the power to do that that is

01:26:36,580 --> 01:26:44,140
still possible but you would right is

01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:45,960
not inhale back that around and right

01:26:44,140 --> 01:26:49,119
here

01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:49,119
[Music]

01:26:51,640 --> 01:27:04,910
and let it build my cramming and now you

01:27:01,100 --> 01:27:07,340
can specify here radius the default this

01:27:04,910 --> 01:27:10,160
one kilometer and can change it to two

01:27:07,340 --> 01:27:11,750
and this would be now all post boxes

01:27:10,160 --> 01:27:14,090
around here in the radius of two

01:27:11,750 --> 01:27:16,130
kilometers but if you want to go into

01:27:14,090 --> 01:27:19,940
more detail they're all passed query

01:27:16,130 --> 01:27:24,140
language can do much more you see on the

01:27:19,940 --> 01:27:29,570
Left it's the query and you're always

01:27:24,140 --> 01:27:31,490
free to still modify it and add most

01:27:29,570 --> 01:27:34,130
often learn about the query language and

01:27:31,490 --> 01:27:36,530
program your Assessor right so the

01:27:34,130 --> 01:27:39,350
examples that we have now seen or

01:27:36,530 --> 01:27:41,660
basically the extent that that you can

01:27:39,350 --> 01:27:43,460
go to with the wizard without knowing

01:27:41,660 --> 01:27:45,590
anything about the language and

01:27:43,460 --> 01:27:47,690
basically if you want you can do still

01:27:45,590 --> 01:27:49,610
more complex things but that's the point

01:27:47,690 --> 01:27:51,470
where then you you will have to read the

01:27:49,610 --> 01:27:56,180
docs at one point yeah exactly at some

01:27:51,470 --> 01:27:58,700
point the open API is also meant to be

01:27:56,180 --> 01:28:01,940
used for creating own applications and

01:27:58,700 --> 01:28:04,010
that's more meant for developers and

01:28:01,940 --> 01:28:05,450
it's also very strong point of the open

01:28:04,010 --> 01:28:08,120
API that you can use it in your own

01:28:05,450 --> 01:28:12,140
applications to create new apps for

01:28:08,120 --> 01:28:14,860
example web sites or Maps right thank

01:28:12,140 --> 01:28:14,860
you very much Martin

01:28:18,900 --> 01:28:26,709

01:28:26,709 --> 01:28:30,969
wasn't aiming I hope you learned

something I hope you engage now you now

01:28:30,969 --> 01:28:36,010
feel motivated to do something

01:28:34,229 --> 01:28:39,249
OpenStreetMap we hope you learn

01:28:36,010 --> 01:28:45,400
something and yeah thanks for joining us
