Title: 2019: Board + Working Groups meeting
Publication date: 2019-09-26
Playlist: SotM 2019, Day1, HÃ¶rsaal West
Description: 
	Get to know the Board and the Working Groups. Together, we run the OSMF. Let's use the SotM to have a real face to face meeting. The public is invited to join the conversation too.

SotM is about the community meeting the community. But we don't always seek out everyone we would like to talk to. So let's use this space to make sure as many members of the working groups and the board get to know each other as people and not just online text. All working group and board members are invited on the stage and can discuss anything. The public can also ask questions.

Feel free to suggest some agenda items to joost -at- osmfoundation.org

we don't really have a plan for this

00:00:10,389 --> 00:00:14,790
session

00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:20,619
and that's actually by design because we

00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:24,490
are here mostly to listen to you so as a

00:00:20,619 --> 00:00:26,830
board we've been trying to get a better

00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:30,009
and closer relation with our working

00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:34,989
groups and this is one of the occasions

00:00:30,009 --> 00:00:39,190
to do that so we asked for topics and

00:00:34,989 --> 00:00:41,829
for people and we didn't really get a

00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:46,000
facial response so I'm hoping that we

00:00:41,829 --> 00:00:48,460
will just wing it and see if we can have

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,620
an interesting discussion about what the

00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:53,050
board is doing right and wrong about

00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:55,750
what the working groups are doing how

00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:57,600
they could do better how we could do

00:00:55,750 --> 00:01:01,690
better for them

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:05,650
so that's kind of the the point today

00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:08,410
it's also like to show to each other

00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:11,409
that we are humans and that we talk to

00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:14,740
each other and not just online persona

00:01:11,409 --> 00:01:16,210
that's what state of the map is for and

00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:19,870
we thought like make it a little

00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:22,300
official so that we can do it with a bit

00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:31,540
more people and that everyone can be

00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:35,590
involved in this conversation so yeah so

00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:38,290
yeah when I explained the concept to to

00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:40,330
Mikkel it was basically like yeah the

00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:54,390
OpenStreetMap foundation is here in its

00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:54,390
naked form so yeah who here is only yeah

00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:09,280
thank you

00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:11,980
I just wanted to maybe suggest an

00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,920
icebreaker for the board and working

00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:19,390
group members if all of you could do a

00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:22,390
quick intro of your name your osm handle

00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:24,550
and which group or groups or in I'm just

00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:27,850
so kind of like paint the picture for

00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:30,100
those of us who are not involved in

00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:33,340
those groups because I think obviously

00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:35,650
we've seen your names and what you write

00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:39,269
etc but just to kind of set the stage

00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:39,269
there if that would be possible

00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:54,730
yeah that makes sense yeah who's going

00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:57,640
just a note you do not have to be a no

00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:00,519
SMF member to join a working groups or

00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:02,380
if anyone's in here who is not yet an OS

00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:04,810
math member please become a noise math

00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:14,019
member but that's not an excuse not to

00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:15,820
help out in a working group you know

00:10:14,019 --> 00:10:17,829
we've had a lot of discussions about

00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:19,660
working groups and I think that you guys

00:10:17,829 --> 00:10:21,940
each are part of them what do you need

00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:25,500
from the board that would be my question

00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:25,500
and what do you need from the community

00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:58,240
like that one okay I would say one of

00:10:56,589 --> 00:11:00,730
the things about the working groups is I

00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,920
think that they lack visibility so as a

00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:04,089
person new to a working group I didn't

00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:06,220
know how to join and didn't know what

00:11:04,089 --> 00:11:08,079
the process was and I know there on the

00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:09,250
wiki or whatever but as a new person it

00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:11,079
could be very difficult to figure out

00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:16,420
how to get involved if you want to so

00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:19,470
some more marketing your visibility are

00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:19,470
we missing working groups

00:11:23,769 --> 00:11:43,790
Engineering other comments about the

00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:45,769
working groups and said lost I know

00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:47,240
maybe were being caught because I'm sure

00:11:45,769 --> 00:11:50,839
there's lots of things all our working

00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:52,910
groups could have more help with you

00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:57,319
know if you get in touch we can normally

00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:59,899
help find your job but last year at

00:11:57,319 --> 00:12:04,009
state of the map in Milan we had a

00:11:59,899 --> 00:12:05,959
session where people came and they could

00:12:04,009 --> 00:12:08,029
come and meet people from each of the

00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:10,910
working groups and I kind of tried to

00:12:08,029 --> 00:12:13,850
send people off and I just wondered did

00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:15,290
anyone maybe some of you were here and

00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:18,350
you said you're working great because

00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:21,350
she joined last year and he started

00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:24,709
helping then or maybe did anyone see any

00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:26,389
members come and it's because they met

00:12:24,709 --> 00:12:28,850
you at the conference last time or they

00:12:26,389 --> 00:12:31,069
met someone have we had anything from

00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:32,959
that or do you think we could do

00:12:31,069 --> 00:12:34,850
anything better at state of the map to

00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:41,449
make us more visible make the working

00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:45,220
groups more visible for me well my first

00:12:41,449 --> 00:12:48,889
thought was like is a map of how to see

00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:51,980
where are these working group members

00:12:48,889 --> 00:12:55,160
are based like where can I talk to them

00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:57,019
that person because from it's kind of

00:12:55,160 --> 00:13:00,920
important to talk to him personally not

00:12:57,019 --> 00:13:04,970
via chat or message sometimes so I don't

00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:08,089
know where they are like like do they

00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:10,220
meet in a OpenStreetMap meeting or just

00:13:08,089 --> 00:13:14,089
these conferences I don't know

00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:16,160
so form it would be like important to

00:13:14,089 --> 00:13:19,339
know at which conference they are going

00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:23,809
and because I have different scientific

00:13:19,339 --> 00:13:25,309
fields or I don't know like I'm going

00:13:23,809 --> 00:13:26,660
for example to the International

00:13:25,309 --> 00:13:29,720
cartographic conference

00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:31,610
it's was in Tokyo this year there's also

00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:33,230
OpenStreetMap track about it

00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:37,160
so I get to in touch

00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:38,810
as a scientific field and I meet also

00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:41,360
people there from OpenStreetMap

00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:44,000
sometimes I meet here people from the

00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:47,990
this kind of conference so I can talk

00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:51,200
and I'm sure it's not so much about the

00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:55,400
consumer but yeah from it would be an

00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:58,030
interesting to have like this or to view

00:13:55,400 --> 00:14:04,540
at which spots in the world you are

00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:04,540
active like like basically active yeah

00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:14,210
to answer your question I think I saw

00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:17,210
increase in communications working group

00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:19,280
members because we have a few new

00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:21,080
translators that translate the official

00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:23,360
blog and stuff like that

00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:27,410
I think the Dorotea maybe has more

00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:31,310
information about that but I think I saw

00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:33,230
a few new people on the answering the

00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:37,100
mails and stuff like that so that's the

00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:39,410
only sorry that's the only group I know

00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:42,370
that has grown in members since last

00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:45,500
year maybe there are other groups so

00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:47,600
please say if there are new members in

00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:49,700
other groups is that right Authority

00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:54,260
there are new members in communications

00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:56,480
here I can say from a licensed working

00:14:54,260 --> 00:15:01,240
group point of view there were no new

00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:01,240
members I didn't really expect it I

00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:08,090
think personally that that our community

00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:10,940
sees the topics as bit as difficult and

00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:13,820
they feel they don't have the specialist

00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:16,730
knowledge required even though I would

00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:20,000
say we don't perhaps we don't have

00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:22,850
enough lawyers on the lwg but we do have

00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:28,100
lawyers on the LWT and what we're

00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:31,910
missing a bit is legal experts from the

00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:36,830
EU all these people with profound legal

00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:39,650
knowledge in in the EU and but no

00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:41,900
community members bring in a different

00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:44,320
point of view as well and just as

00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,320
welcome

00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:52,090
yeah do use the mic we don't have a

00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:53,980
global diversity at the moment we have

00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:56,830
members from the EU anyhow we have

00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:59,650
members from the US but you know the

00:15:56,830 --> 00:16:04,390
rest of the world is not represented you

00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:06,490
know whether they're lawyers or not the

00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:09,040
Alpha more general thing that I have to

00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:11,790
say I always feel that one of the

00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:13,930
reasons we have difficulties in general

00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:18,100
attracting people to the working groups

00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:21,370
is that osm is a volunteer organization

00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:23,560
so people are already contributing their

00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:26,650
time for something which I find

00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:28,600
interesting and asking them to

00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:31,420
participate in a working group means

00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:34,300
okay you have to on top of that or

00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:36,580
instead of that spend more time doing

00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:39,580
stuff which they perhaps don't quite

00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:42,370
find so enjoyable and so we're not you

00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:44,320
know it's not an association of medical

00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:47,380
doctors where everybody is working

00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:49,890
professionally in in their field and

00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:52,960
then they volunteer a bit of time for

00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:56,380
the Association or something like that

00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:58,570
it's actually we where were added we're

00:16:56,380 --> 00:17:00,490
asking for more volunteer time and I

00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:06,280
think that is perhaps a bit the

00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:09,970
difficult point yeah following up on

00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:12,670
what Simon said one of the main

00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:15,750
motivations for people to volunteer in a

00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:18,280
volunteer environment is they take and

00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:21,430
accomplish something I mean every one of

00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:24,670
us who has started volunteering for a

00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:27,370
ZEM did so because in effect they could

00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:29,620
have accomplished something so maybe one

00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:31,450
thing that what we have for this if

00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:35,530
people who are on the working groups

00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:36,850
could give examples on how in the

00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:39,460
working group works they could

00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:42,250
accomplish something in that time there

00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:47,050
I think that might be something that

00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:49,920
could give a concrete motivation to

00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:49,920
people to participate

00:17:54,730 --> 00:18:02,390
I thought about because I'm I'm studying

00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:05,240
now geo-informatics now and next to my

00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:07,640
working time and I have a marketing

00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:09,799
lesson now and they told me something

00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:12,049
about yeah if you didn't need like a

00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:14,140
strategy first to have structure and

00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:17,530
then have a culture at the end and to

00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:22,010
have like open community OpenStreetMap

00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:24,230
culture at the end you need structures

00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:26,750
or to have structure you need strategy

00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:31,090
so I said for me it's like I need like a

00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:34,820
plan what's a really strategy of of

00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:37,669
OpenStreetMap or as a community work on

00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:42,100
so you have to start with this mum and

00:18:37,669 --> 00:18:44,600
Mike in my opinion to know what's what's

00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:47,840
yeah what's what are the points what's

00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:50,030
what's important first and to start with

00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:53,270
said to take make a sprint like these

00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:55,040
hackathons to use this time to solve

00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:57,770
this problem and then continue with the

00:18:55,040 --> 00:19:00,710
next one and so on but for me it's like

00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:03,890
they are several problems I'll but I

00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:06,410
don't really see it as a as a editor i I

00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:09,590
am because I'm mapping all the time but

00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:14,330
I'm it's not useful to map like like I

00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:17,000
met Satoshi this year and in Japan first

00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:19,130
and he told me he is he's doing so much

00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,970
maps at the beginning but now he needs

00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:24,590
like help and doing tours or and I want

00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:28,700
to do the same I don't want to map

00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:32,080
anymore because I did so much edits it's

00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:35,870
more important to solve the problems I

00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:37,790
don't know it's my thought about this it

00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:39,740
was yeah

00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:43,409
[Music]

00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:45,090
so I'm quite new to osm and one thing

00:19:43,409 --> 00:19:46,980
that I would maybe find quite

00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:49,679
interesting is if you would get like

00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:52,140
maybe a weekly I was M sometimes

00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:55,710
progress reports about what the working

00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:58,650
groups are doing because you only really

00:19:55,710 --> 00:20:00,270
see really examples of what is happening

00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:02,610
it's more like it's in the background

00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:06,570
but you don't really see what is being

00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:12,659
done we don't know what they need either

00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:16,140
right go ahead I'm I confirm weekly osm

00:20:12,659 --> 00:20:18,179
team and we linked to minutes of working

00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:20,240
group meetings if they are published it

00:20:18,179 --> 00:20:24,770
was M foundation.org

00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,770
so it might be a communication issue

00:20:28,669 --> 00:20:33,809
yeah I was gonna say maybe we need to

00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:37,530
more prominently link the minutes

00:20:33,809 --> 00:20:40,440
because they do exist I have a

00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:43,020
suggestion for the state of a map

00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:45,600
working group for next year which is

00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:48,150
maybe to have like stickers or something

00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:50,250
that say like asking me about the

00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:53,460
communications working group or the ask

00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:55,890
me about the you know the licensing

00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:57,419
working group and then we could like the

00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:59,850
members of the working groups could put

00:20:57,419 --> 00:21:01,860
them on our name badges as like to

00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:03,150
identify ourselves to people as members

00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,890
of the working groups and when they see

00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:15,059
us around the conference they can ask us

00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:16,860
about those working groups just wanted

00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:19,200
to say about the thing with two minutes

00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:21,360
being linked in their weekly osm that I

00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:26,090
have also sometimes looked at it but

00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:26,090
it's honestly quite a dry format

00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:33,560
reaching new people that's a really good

00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:38,030
comment I just wanted to comment on on

00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:39,620
the issue of strategy and so on I the

00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:44,390
board members know that I keep on going

00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:48,380
on about this so bear with me I think a

00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:51,290
lack of a visible new strategy or a

00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:54,980
reaffirmation of what the strategy of

00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:56,540
the OSM F is something which is a bit

00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:59,390
missing because we don't really have

00:21:56,540 --> 00:22:01,070
this guiding document the the last time

00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:05,330
there was a statement like that goes

00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:09,940
back to Mikael that face-to-face meeting

00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:15,920
which I think you had in 2011 or

00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:19,040
something before my I mean it's it's a

00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:21,140
real long time ago and and things have

00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:23,390
massively changed that was even prior to

00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:30,350
the license change being completed I

00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:32,030
think yeah and it just I see it all over

00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:34,070
the place with the operations working

00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:39,260
group we've with our working groups that

00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:42,350
you know this this clear not clear but

00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:48,080
some direction where we're going is

00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:49,730
missing just just to pick up on that one

00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:53,360
Simon because I was actually at that

00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:54,860
session in Seattle and one of the things

00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,990
that's probably worth calling out

00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:59,090
because it was a factor then and you

00:22:56,990 --> 00:23:00,590
know board let board structure has

00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:03,820
changed but I think you know there's

00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:06,200
often a degree to which the fact that

00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:07,670
there can be often differences of

00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,740
opinion within the community about

00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:11,660
certain directions versus certain other

00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:13,310
ones and sometimes that makes it

00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:15,650
difficult to have a conversation like

00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:18,140
that I still agree that it's necessary

00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:19,490
to break through and have it anyway but

00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:21,020
I think that's one of the things that

00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:22,850
probably inhibits us from doing it as

00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:25,010
much as we should as a community and as

00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:30,200
a foundation or a board or whatever

00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:31,760
level that conversation takes place I'm

00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,860
just going to go back to more general

00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:37,190
points starting with something more

00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:40,300
specific in the operations working group

00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:43,340
hard to get through the year without a

00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:45,980
monthly budget expenditure reports

00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:48,260
because we have a huge budget and by the

00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:50,450
same it gets to by August or September

00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:52,280
you're not really sure how much money

00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:54,770
we've spent how much money's still in

00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:56,420
the budget and gang all the working

00:23:54,770 --> 00:24:00,920
groups to duplicate the job of the

00:23:56,420 --> 00:24:02,210
treasurer is a lot of work so in my

00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:04,670
experience it would be great for the

00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:06,440
working groups to have their budgets how

00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:08,570
much they've spent how much is left in

00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:10,510
the budget coming out during each year

00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:14,990
instead of it being an annual exercise

00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:18,910
but there's also second point kind of

00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:21,560
wait ins that slightly there's a lot of

00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:23,570
lack of clarity as to how much

00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:25,670
decision-making powers the working

00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:27,110
groups have and at what point things

00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:28,790
need to go from the working groups to

00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:32,530
the board so if we just talk about

00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:35,330
budgets when we put in a budget for

00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:37,190
4,000 pounds of consulting on this topic

00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:39,260
in it and it gets approved

00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:42,200
it's then not clear whether or not the

00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:44,210
working group can do consulting for

00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:46,340
something else without having to go back

00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:48,550
to the boards to get it reproved if we

00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:51,200
to say that we don't want a post-grad

00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:54,170
replication database consultant but we

00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,880
want something else consulting do we

00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:59,240
have the authority to make that decision

00:24:55,880 --> 00:25:02,840
and in most aspects of things like

00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:04,790
writing official or SMF policies do they

00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:06,080
need to be approved by the board or to

00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:08,420
the working group can we just make

00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:10,070
changes can we make a new policy or does

00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:15,050
that need to go to the board there's a

00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:18,500
big lack of clarity on those issues and

00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:21,560
even this is going back in time now but

00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:24,500
I pushed a previous version of this

00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:26,120
meeting for the responsibilities of each

00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:29,330
of the working groups to be written down

00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:31,730
for the first time because up until now

00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:33,980
in German it was maybe 2011 or 2012

00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:36,530
sometime around then the working groups

00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:38,060
just had a title and then everybody knew

00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:40,460
what each of the working groups was in

00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:42,890
charge of but it was a useful exercise

00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:44,540
to go through and say the operations

00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:47,380
working group is responsible for this

00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:50,260
this and this and is not responsible for

00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:52,690
and that and those decisions haven't

00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:54,130
been revisited or reviewed since then

00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:56,410
they what's written on the wiki is

00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:59,470
pretty much what we wrote that day at

00:25:56,410 --> 00:26:01,750
the board meeting in London and then

00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:03,490
unrelated to those two points I would

00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:06,250
say the best thing that the board can do

00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:08,770
is to be relentlessly monitoring the

00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:10,180
membership of the working groups both

00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:11,620
for how many people are in each working

00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:13,570
group and for how long

00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:15,730
each person has been in that working

00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:18,220
group because there are definitely stale

00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:20,140
working groups where it's great that

00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:23,260
somebody wants to be in that working

00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:25,570
group for the tenth year in a row but if

00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:28,660
we it doesn't matter if there's three

00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:30,160
people or four people if it's four

00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:32,770
people who have only been there for a

00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:34,720
year or there has been no new people in

00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:37,030
that working group for a decade those

00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,800
are different signs of health in the

00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:41,170
working groups and the working groups

00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:43,050
themselves are not very good at

00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:45,790
reflecting on their own membership and

00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:49,000
are often in a situation where they're

00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:52,600
not the best people to recruit or to

00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:54,220
analyze or to to break out of a

00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:56,350
situation if they find themselves stuck

00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:58,600
in that situation so I think it's a key

00:26:56,350 --> 00:27:01,480
responsibility for the board to not

00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:03,760
assume that things are okay and to not

00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:05,590
assume that the guys have been there for

00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,570
you guys and ladies who have been there

00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:11,860
for years will continue to be there but

00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:14,380
to be much more proactive and looking

00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:16,540
after the membership of the working

00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:19,870
groups so I'm sorry that was that was a

00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:21,280
bit long but I feel like him but now

00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:23,020
that I've stepped away from being in a

00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:26,430
working groups it's easier for me to

00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:26,430
reflect on some of these things

00:27:33,539 --> 00:27:42,029
now it's working so so you want me to

00:27:36,519 --> 00:27:45,399
talk about the membership yes

00:27:42,029 --> 00:27:48,940
so one big topic was the fee waiver

00:27:45,399 --> 00:27:54,820
which was kicked off shortly before the

00:27:48,940 --> 00:28:02,710
elections that was for us a huge amount

00:27:54,820 --> 00:28:05,919
of work and we really how should they

00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:10,659
put it we were in the process of

00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:14,019
defining some workflow and we just were

00:28:10,659 --> 00:28:18,490
stuck with the details and nobody wanted

00:28:14,019 --> 00:28:22,539
to pick this this details up like what

00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:28,360
specifically does a member need to do to

00:28:22,539 --> 00:28:34,350
contribute something of value and there

00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:37,929
well I we were in I don't know if he

00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:41,679
communicated with board very well where

00:28:37,929 --> 00:28:45,309
we were stuck but that was kind of

00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:47,259
difficult and then we have the elections

00:28:45,309 --> 00:28:54,899
and you want me to talk about this

00:28:47,259 --> 00:28:54,899
global logic incident as well yeah so

00:28:55,049 --> 00:28:59,860
right before the election there was also

00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:03,370
this huge sign up we I just had talked

00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:06,940
about it and behind the scenes there was

00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:09,429
some friction between the membership

00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:14,649
working group and the board because it

00:29:09,429 --> 00:29:17,860
was we were investigating and the board

00:29:14,649 --> 00:29:22,710
says well no no everything is okay don't

00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:27,610
do anything and was kind of an issue of

00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:30,220
independence we just went ahead and it

00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:34,179
was was of course a lot of work that we

00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:40,470
had to do to get this to get this right

00:29:34,179 --> 00:29:44,139
and we are pretty slow a lot of time and

00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:46,509
then this one time we were faster and we

00:29:44,139 --> 00:29:51,460
were kind of really frustrated with then

00:29:46,509 --> 00:29:58,090
the board being slower than we were so

00:29:51,460 --> 00:30:00,460
yeah I'm just gonna add one sentence

00:29:58,090 --> 00:30:02,500
that you guys had a problem there was a

00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:05,259
risky thing that happened you resolved

00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:06,610
it and then you documented and so Andy

00:30:05,259 --> 00:30:08,669
was talking about why we need to

00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:11,649
document in advance sorry

00:30:08,669 --> 00:30:13,509
that's great I have a question followed

00:30:11,649 --> 00:30:15,879
by a suggestion based on the answer to

00:30:13,509 --> 00:30:17,230
the question do the different working

00:30:15,879 --> 00:30:18,970
groups how often do the different

00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:23,289
working groups talk to each other or the

00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:29,139
board is that my assumption correct that

00:30:23,289 --> 00:30:30,580
this doesn't happen very often a second

00:30:29,139 --> 00:30:32,409
backup follow-up to that would be is

00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:34,299
there's a chairman on each of these

00:30:32,409 --> 00:30:37,029
working groups who represent the working

00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:39,039
group should there be a conversation

00:30:37,029 --> 00:30:41,169
with the other working groups or the

00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:44,049
board so my suggestion is that maybe

00:30:41,169 --> 00:30:45,399
there's a chairperson that stands up for

00:30:44,049 --> 00:30:49,149
each of the working groups and maybe

00:30:45,399 --> 00:30:50,500
there's a all-hands kind of conversation

00:30:49,149 --> 00:30:53,500
every couple months with the board

00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:54,519
members and the membership working or

00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:59,320
the working group leads

00:30:54,519 --> 00:31:03,460
I think they sometimes talk to each

00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:05,889
other anyway the same people well on the

00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:07,899
one hand naturally community is small so

00:31:05,889 --> 00:31:11,019
there's there's informal talks not she

00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:12,279
the whole time but you actually touch

00:31:11,019 --> 00:31:16,119
himself on something which is quite

00:31:12,279 --> 00:31:19,809
important which has sometimes feel is

00:31:16,119 --> 00:31:24,159
missing a bit that you know stuff

00:31:19,809 --> 00:31:26,049
happens in the working group where other

00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:31,320
working groups might have should have

00:31:26,049 --> 00:31:34,480
been perhaps involved earlier and

00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:36,309
there's no formal communication channels

00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:39,559
for that

00:31:36,309 --> 00:31:42,049
so you know sometimes things just get

00:31:39,559 --> 00:31:45,109
forgotten there's not a monthly meeting

00:31:42,049 --> 00:31:47,299
of the of the working group chair people

00:31:45,109 --> 00:31:50,210
I have to point out that we have

00:31:47,299 --> 00:31:54,009
actually tried that there was the

00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:56,899
infamous management team which

00:31:54,009 --> 00:32:00,039
essentially was a body with some board

00:31:56,899 --> 00:32:02,679
members and the chair people from the

00:32:00,039 --> 00:32:08,779
chair persons from the working groups

00:32:02,679 --> 00:32:17,809
and it didn't really work it was an

00:32:08,779 --> 00:32:19,940
attempt um but it didn't work and and I

00:32:17,809 --> 00:32:22,279
was going to point out that that it was

00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:24,279
a bit of a step for in my eyes

00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:26,720
I wasn't actively involved at that time

00:32:24,279 --> 00:32:31,460
that the board tried to have a more

00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:33,529
strategic role and the executive part of

00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:37,340
the board was moved to this management

00:32:33,529 --> 00:32:38,869
team and he just in the end didn't work

00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:40,970
I don't think we have enough map how to

00:32:38,869 --> 00:32:51,139
go around for that kind of division of

00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:53,869
labor just briefly on the management

00:32:51,139 --> 00:32:58,669
team I was on the management team from

00:32:53,869 --> 00:33:00,259
the start until the end I would say the

00:32:58,669 --> 00:33:03,649
main reason it never worked was because

00:33:00,259 --> 00:33:05,570
back then they as now the division of

00:33:03,649 --> 00:33:07,249
responsibilities was unclear the

00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:09,230
division of responsibilities between the

00:33:07,249 --> 00:33:12,139
board and the management team was as

00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:14,149
clear as mud so that there was there was

00:33:12,139 --> 00:33:15,710
absolutely nothing to go on so in the

00:33:14,149 --> 00:33:17,299
management team we had absolutely no

00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:19,129
idea what we had the authority to make a

00:33:17,299 --> 00:33:24,710
decision on and so we just talked about

00:33:19,129 --> 00:33:26,179
stuff it could be possible to do this do

00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:28,070
something like that again to have the

00:33:26,179 --> 00:33:29,989
heads of the working or chair people of

00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:31,429
working groups meeting together but it

00:33:29,989 --> 00:33:34,039
would need to have a clear purpose and

00:33:31,429 --> 00:33:35,539
clear responsibilities otherwise you

00:33:34,039 --> 00:33:39,919
just have meetings for the fun of it and

00:33:35,539 --> 00:33:41,389
nothing gets done and documenting roles

00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:43,340
and responsibilities you said it three

00:33:41,389 --> 00:33:45,310
times I'm gonna say it the fourth no

00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:49,200
it's important who's next

00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:49,200
because over there with the mic to

00:33:56,830 --> 00:34:00,979
somebody else has to ask questions or

00:33:59,239 --> 00:34:02,509
make comments so I mean I always

00:34:00,979 --> 00:34:03,769
appreciate I appreciate you speaking up

00:34:02,509 --> 00:34:07,580
I'm totally gonna hand you the mic I

00:34:03,769 --> 00:34:10,549
just I just wanted to throw another hat

00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:16,089
into the discussion commenting quickly

00:34:10,549 --> 00:34:18,379
on what Andy said before with respect to

00:34:16,089 --> 00:34:21,349
decision powers of the working groups

00:34:18,379 --> 00:34:23,030
and so on my understanding and saying

00:34:21,349 --> 00:34:25,490
this as the chairperson of the reisen's

00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:28,700
working group is that we develop the

00:34:25,490 --> 00:34:32,389
policies that put them in force we do

00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:34,700
need the or to vote on them after we've

00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:41,000
established some kind of community

00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:44,359
consensus but that is something which

00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,710
I've only really seen in that form from

00:34:44,359 --> 00:34:48,379
the licensed working group and I'm

00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:53,809
talking about over a period of 10 years

00:34:48,379 --> 00:34:55,819
or so and I was discussing this

00:34:53,809 --> 00:35:00,339
yesterday with Andy a classical example

00:34:55,819 --> 00:35:03,770
is we know our tile servers are stressed

00:35:00,339 --> 00:35:06,710
there's always discussion should they

00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:11,109
block more people using the service with

00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:14,089
the access be restricted and so on and I

00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:16,069
and you know there are some people in

00:35:14,089 --> 00:35:17,809
the working group in the operation

00:35:16,069 --> 00:35:20,619
working group assess yes and after say

00:35:17,809 --> 00:35:23,119
no and that's not really a community

00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:27,349
consensus on what that should happen so

00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:29,900
but we don't actually know why we are

00:35:27,349 --> 00:35:32,930
providing tiles in the first place and

00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:35,630
what the intended audience is and that's

00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:41,990
why these discussions just never lead

00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:47,569
anywhere there are possible discussions

00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:50,290
because we there's closed maybe okay

00:35:47,569 --> 00:35:50,290
I'll take this one

00:35:50,619 --> 00:35:54,460
there goes my train of thought

00:35:55,450 --> 00:36:02,569
yeah we have very clear opinions about

00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:05,900
that it's just that they are very

00:36:02,569 --> 00:36:08,150
different how do you make a policy when

00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:08,930
you completely disagree about where you

00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:10,609
want to go

00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:14,630
I think for tiles baby there is a

00:36:10,609 --> 00:36:20,660
solution but still there is a white

00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:22,490
continuum over there so we have for

00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:24,440
board members leaving we have a bunch of

00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:25,220
working groups with different terms of

00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:27,770
references and roles and

00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:30,859
responsibilities not documented and then

00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:32,300
we have maybe some need to have more

00:36:30,859 --> 00:36:34,010
people in working groups that's the

00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:37,940
summary I got so far go ahead Chris

00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:40,640
mmm if he pick up on that topic for a

00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:43,730
moment that is some work apart from the

00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:48,109
work or smoked out education of the

00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:51,170
board and what I'm often missing from

00:36:48,109 --> 00:36:55,430
the board is as an outsider for moms

00:36:51,170 --> 00:37:00,770
always at most e the admission of being

00:36:55,430 --> 00:37:02,359
unable to come to a decision that's my

00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:03,920
perception from the outside of course I

00:37:02,359 --> 00:37:09,290
don't know if you perceive this from the

00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:12,260
inside as well but I think that might be

00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:14,420
something where you can improve on

00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:17,329
because if there's need for a decision

00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:19,160
and you can't make one it doesn't

00:37:17,329 --> 00:37:22,460
necessarily mean there can't be a

00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:24,619
decision because Joe Smith is that in

00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:25,970
the end an organization of its members

00:37:24,619 --> 00:37:30,680
and if the board can't make a decision

00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:32,859
the members might be able to so that as

00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:35,839
a suggestion to the board on that topic

00:37:32,859 --> 00:37:37,670
that that might be at some point where

00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:39,410
you could vote on you have the board

00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:43,190
that represents the community that you

00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:44,630
vote for and we are as different and we

00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:46,369
worked really hard to negotiate but I

00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:48,410
think figuring out how to negotiate as a

00:37:46,369 --> 00:37:50,329
board is a responsibility figuring out

00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:51,799
how to negotiate as a working group as a

00:37:50,329 --> 00:37:53,869
responsibility and I think you're right

00:37:51,799 --> 00:37:56,630
Chris job it's really hard to find that

00:37:53,869 --> 00:37:57,559
middle ground and that's that's

00:37:56,630 --> 00:38:00,200
something as you're thinking through

00:37:57,559 --> 00:38:01,250
what who are the next people how are you

00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,720
gonna have that middle ground that

00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:09,109
represents this beautiful thing that's

00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:12,500
so huge I'm I was gonna jump back to and

00:38:09,109 --> 00:38:15,710
quite an early comment about people

00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:17,420
wanting to be involved or how you do

00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:19,440
that I really like that someone in this

00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:25,049
area said

00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:27,180
that said we're used to we get involved

00:38:25,049 --> 00:38:29,970
in OpenStreetMap and volunteer because

00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:31,730
we can see we do something can you see

00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:34,200
what you've done in the effect of that

00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:37,319
so I think we can be really positive and

00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:40,109
just chef small things there so it got

00:38:37,319 --> 00:38:42,660
me thinking all those being destructed

00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:46,049
I'm as I said I'm on the state of the

00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:48,030
map working group so obviously we're all

00:38:46,049 --> 00:38:51,390
here in this room so obviously I did

00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:53,039
something but there or the working group

00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:55,230
did same but there's small things in

00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:57,539
that so I picked out just thinking for

00:38:55,230 --> 00:39:01,020
five minutes I was like well there was

00:38:57,539 --> 00:39:03,150
the time when our tickets sold out a few

00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:07,230
weeks ago and there's a group we were

00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:09,660
able to discuss and go and talk and we

00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:12,059
were able to go right well the insurance

00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:13,589
would need to change if we need more

00:39:12,059 --> 00:39:15,960
people and what are the building

00:39:13,589 --> 00:39:18,150
regulations and actually we released 50

00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:19,589
tickets which they went so fast you

00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:22,619
might not have noticed so were fifty

00:39:19,589 --> 00:39:26,400
more tickets after we sold out but to me

00:39:22,619 --> 00:39:28,619
that's a big it's big small win and then

00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,960
another one that I mean that wasn't just

00:39:28,619 --> 00:39:35,609
me that was discussions and us his team

00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:39,539
another one was today realizing that we

00:39:35,609 --> 00:39:41,369
hadn't done the the slides to put in the

00:39:39,539 --> 00:39:43,950
brakes and I didn't have all the content

00:39:41,369 --> 00:39:45,539
from the sponsors so today you may see

00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:48,150
me run up and down these stairs a few

00:39:45,539 --> 00:39:49,829
times and find sponsors and you probably

00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:51,869
won't noticed because I'm not even on

00:39:49,829 --> 00:39:53,339
now but tomorrow take a look at this

00:39:51,869 --> 00:39:56,130
light because that's person one you know

00:39:53,339 --> 00:39:58,319
it was saying that maybe night might not

00:39:56,130 --> 00:40:00,240
have happened maybe it wasn't important

00:39:58,319 --> 00:40:05,190
but it was like I could personally

00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:08,359
contribute in my time so if anyone wants

00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:08,359
to do that next year join

00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:18,020
yeah just wanna say something about the

00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:21,470
decision-making Christopher Christopher

00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:23,750
saying I mean is it not is it working -

00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:27,530
like let's a community have a vote and

00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:31,460
have working group members have a vote

00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:35,540
and board to find a decision because you

00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:41,030
need to cut at half a decision to close

00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:43,400
it to go on I know I don't know this in

00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:45,830
Michael Michaels membership meeting

00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:48,320
membership working group presentation if

00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:49,850
you want this to change the membership

00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,980
working group is the place to do it if

00:40:49,850 --> 00:40:53,810
you want different kinds of members

00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:55,310
right there's an opportunity there in

00:40:53,810 --> 00:41:00,110
terms of voting and stuff that's not our

00:40:55,310 --> 00:41:03,530
structure yet I have almost the same

00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:05,840
comment if a decision is needed and the

00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:07,760
board cannot come to a decision but also

00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:12,020
recognizes that the decision is needed

00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:14,120
can it call on the community to vote on

00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:17,300
it and maybe provide some options what

00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:23,770
can be voted for and then make the

00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:23,770
decision that way Thanks

00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:27,849
[Music]

00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:44,660
look I a renters been around and asked

00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:46,460
the board especially the departing board

00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:53,780
members wish they'd had from the working

00:41:46,460 --> 00:42:09,980
groups I've already talked

00:41:53,780 --> 00:42:12,710
oh wait Frederick so as the treasurer I

00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:14,840
usually send round an email to all

00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:16,340
working groups towards the end of here

00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:19,280
asking how much money they want to spend

00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:23,330
in the next year and I hardly ever get a

00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:25,400
response expect except from often I get

00:42:23,330 --> 00:42:27,200
a response from the operations working

00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:29,450
group and mostly I get a response from

00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:33,170
the legal working group because those

00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:35,330
two groups spent the most money so they

00:42:33,170 --> 00:42:38,840
are interested in in having that secured

00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:43,610
other than that most working groups do

00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:45,850
not respond that's because most of the

00:42:43,610 --> 00:42:50,320
working groups don't spend any money and

00:42:45,850 --> 00:42:53,690
the board would actually like them to

00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:56,510
just start slow just say you know well

00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:58,880
what what could if we if we had like a

00:42:56,510 --> 00:43:01,040
thousand or two thousand euros this year

00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:02,600
what what useful what use could we make

00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:05,000
of that money for our working group and

00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:08,480
be that only printing something that

00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:10,280
gets distributed or paying someone a

00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:12,950
little money for a task that no one else

00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:15,580
want to do wants to do or so our hope

00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:20,769
was years ago when we started doing this

00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:25,309
our hope was that we would somehow

00:43:20,769 --> 00:43:26,779
set in motion a process of learning in

00:43:25,309 --> 00:43:27,950
the working because spending money is

00:43:26,779 --> 00:43:29,630
also something that you have to learn

00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:31,369
you have to think about what you want

00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:33,470
and how much it costs and how to get it

00:43:31,369 --> 00:43:34,970
and so on and most of the working groups

00:43:33,470 --> 00:43:36,680
just don't want to spend any money

00:43:34,970 --> 00:43:39,140
because they say we are just volunteers

00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:41,299
and we're doing this as a volunteer job

00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:43,990
doesn't cost any money but that also

00:43:41,299 --> 00:43:46,819
ties their hands occasionally and they

00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:48,680
they there there might be small things

00:43:46,819 --> 00:43:51,589
that could actually help them and they

00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:55,220
don't even think of asking for money for

00:43:51,589 --> 00:43:58,250
that so yeah that hasn't hasn't really

00:43:55,220 --> 00:44:01,279
worked and I must admit I haven't put in

00:43:58,250 --> 00:44:03,710
more work than just asking people every

00:44:01,279 --> 00:44:08,569
year if they want to put in a budget for

00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:11,119
next year another thing of course and I

00:44:08,569 --> 00:44:13,760
mean Andy has already said that he would

00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:17,260
expect the board to keep track of who

00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:19,670
the members are in a working group I

00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:21,619
always thought that as long as no one

00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:22,970
says something it's probably gonna be

00:44:21,619 --> 00:44:26,210
fine

00:44:22,970 --> 00:44:27,049
turns out that this is not necessarily

00:44:26,210 --> 00:44:29,240
the case

00:44:27,049 --> 00:44:31,640
it would of course be super great if

00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:33,319
working groups came to the board when

00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:37,009
they reach a point where they are not

00:44:33,319 --> 00:44:38,420
really functional anymore but the danger

00:44:37,009 --> 00:44:39,680
is that at that point they are so

00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:42,650
dysfunctional that they cannot even

00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:44,509
reach out to the board so and he's

00:44:42,650 --> 00:44:46,309
probably right in saying that the board

00:44:44,509 --> 00:44:50,269
should take a slightly more active role

00:44:46,309 --> 00:44:54,049
on the other hand a well working working

00:44:50,269 --> 00:44:56,299
group will probably be perhaps slightly

00:44:54,049 --> 00:44:59,450
unhappy about the board coming to them

00:44:56,299 --> 00:45:01,670
every regularly and saying hey how are

00:44:59,450 --> 00:45:03,380
you members how do you have regular

00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:06,259
meetings please check which of these

00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:08,750
boxes can you check give us give us a

00:45:06,259 --> 00:45:09,680
life sign I don't know yeah those those

00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:11,839
two things

00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:14,630
tell us what tell us how much money you

00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:18,819
want to spend and tell us what you need

00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:18,819
if you need any help those will be great

00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:27,430
it's not here so I'll go next so we you

00:45:26,350 --> 00:45:29,170
know I've only been on your board for

00:45:27,430 --> 00:45:31,150
two years and before that I was in the

00:45:29,170 --> 00:45:33,550
humanitarian OpenStreetMap board and it

00:45:31,150 --> 00:45:37,390
strikes me that this is a beautiful

00:45:33,550 --> 00:45:40,480
project but our governance needs a real

00:45:37,390 --> 00:45:43,030
think in terms of what do you want from

00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:45,250
your board what our working groups do

00:45:43,030 --> 00:45:47,560
but my bigger question is if there's no

00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:50,860
strategy behind both of those and no

00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:53,110
plan is that okay if that's how you want

00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:56,140
it that's fine but what's the

00:45:53,110 --> 00:45:58,300
ramifications of that right you have

00:45:56,140 --> 00:46:00,040
working groups maybe have not had a lot

00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:02,500
of new people come in there's a lot of

00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:04,450
things that you could do a lot of clear

00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:07,000
ask that we could do that might be

00:46:04,450 --> 00:46:08,770
possible but because there's a split

00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:12,280
between what is the board do working

00:46:08,770 --> 00:46:13,720
groups to you know we maybe have an

00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:15,520
opportunity to ask ourselves some pretty

00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:16,600
hard questions about what do we really

00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:18,820
want to do now that we've been around

00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:20,410
this long and so I'm not asking you to

00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:22,900
tear out the spinal cord of

00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:24,850
OpenStreetMap foundation but maybe it's

00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:27,430
time to be introspective on some of what

00:46:24,850 --> 00:46:29,050
we're doing and go forward so I'm not

00:46:27,430 --> 00:46:31,480
gonna be on the board next year to help

00:46:29,050 --> 00:46:33,190
do that if you guys decide you want to

00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:35,920
do that or the membership decides to do

00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:37,300
that but that's my one reflection and

00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:39,220
it's always been an honor even the

00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:41,110
hardest things I'm be on this board has

00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:43,920
always been an honor because we all kind

00:46:41,110 --> 00:46:43,920
of believe in this community

00:46:50,369 --> 00:46:56,380
you both those are nice responses I I

00:46:53,799 --> 00:46:57,639
would say okay say we want to do that

00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:58,659
what if we want to help build a

00:46:57,639 --> 00:47:01,689
structure what do we even do to

00:46:58,659 --> 00:47:04,029
communicate that to all of you say it

00:47:01,689 --> 00:47:06,039
right now but I don't feel like how do

00:47:04,029 --> 00:47:08,589
you get a collective voice within the

00:47:06,039 --> 00:47:09,789
community to speak up and say to take

00:47:08,589 --> 00:47:22,749
that temperature to see where everybody

00:47:09,789 --> 00:47:27,249
wants to go Oh answer the question which

00:47:22,749 --> 00:47:28,989
is about board members feel that they

00:47:27,249 --> 00:47:31,449
could do or working groups could do it's

00:47:28,989 --> 00:47:34,089
really simple for me if things get

00:47:31,449 --> 00:47:36,219
confusing or complicated somewhere

00:47:34,089 --> 00:47:38,619
between the board in the working groups

00:47:36,219 --> 00:47:41,229
I would like more opportunity to break

00:47:38,619 --> 00:47:44,979
out of the structures of how we

00:47:41,229 --> 00:47:46,509
communicate or how we process and just

00:47:44,979 --> 00:47:49,179
talk to each other and sort it out

00:47:46,509 --> 00:47:51,909
because it usually can get to the get to

00:47:49,179 --> 00:47:54,009
the point of things and resolve much

00:47:51,909 --> 00:47:55,539
quicker that way I don't quite know how

00:47:54,009 --> 00:47:57,189
to create that space but I think it's

00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:59,019
something I would like to see more oh I

00:47:57,189 --> 00:48:00,429
don't think it needs to be a complicated

00:47:59,019 --> 00:48:03,549
governance structure it's a cultural

00:48:00,429 --> 00:48:06,969
practice if we're confused when we're

00:48:03,549 --> 00:48:09,159
communicating online let's figure out a

00:48:06,969 --> 00:48:16,359
time we can talk to each other and see

00:48:09,159 --> 00:48:18,299
if that helps I just quickly want to

00:48:16,359 --> 00:48:22,239
touch on something that Fredrik

00:48:18,299 --> 00:48:24,759
mentioned and Andy mentioned the working

00:48:22,239 --> 00:48:29,619
groups in general do you have a roommate

00:48:24,759 --> 00:48:30,849
document and I have to say in the case

00:48:29,619 --> 00:48:32,619
of the licensed working group you

00:48:30,849 --> 00:48:35,409
probably haven't looked at it for two

00:48:32,619 --> 00:48:38,919
three years but things haven't really

00:48:35,409 --> 00:48:42,489
changed and I would definitely have no

00:48:38,919 --> 00:48:44,319
problem with the board asking once per

00:48:42,489 --> 00:48:47,499
year yeah how many members do you have

00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:49,509
is everything still working and I think

00:48:47,499 --> 00:48:54,159
there's a certain aversion against

00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:58,529
generating a lot of paperwork a couple

00:48:54,159 --> 00:48:58,529
of questions no problem

00:48:59,030 --> 00:49:06,390
that reminds me of the working group

00:49:01,590 --> 00:49:08,040
survey we sent out maybe I should have

00:49:06,390 --> 00:49:10,350
sent some reminders about that because

00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:13,050
when we're talking about the health of

00:49:10,350 --> 00:49:17,670
the working groups I think you guys are

00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:20,640
doing well but we had two and a half

00:49:17,670 --> 00:49:22,320
responses when we finally reached out to

00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:24,480
the working groups with a really open

00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:26,850
and it's series of questions by

00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:28,770
basically asking how are you doing how

00:49:26,850 --> 00:49:33,720
have we messed up your life how can we

00:49:28,770 --> 00:49:36,020
mess it up a bit a bit less and yeah if

00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:38,700
you don't get anything back it's really

00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:41,490
hard to know what that means it might

00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:43,170
mean they're overstressed they might

00:49:41,490 --> 00:49:45,750
mean they have completely lost faith in

00:49:43,170 --> 00:49:47,490
you it might mean they are doing well

00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:50,640
and they don't know why you're even

00:49:47,490 --> 00:49:53,970
asking so it's really hard to to work

00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:58,950
with that and it's it's really nice to

00:49:53,970 --> 00:50:03,470
see so many of you here but yeah and

00:49:58,950 --> 00:50:06,930
yeah we can do better writing about

00:50:03,470 --> 00:50:10,650
reporting I've been involved in support

00:50:06,930 --> 00:50:13,320
Federation's and every year we had

00:50:10,650 --> 00:50:16,110
general assembly and for the general

00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:19,070
assembly each working group we had

00:50:16,110 --> 00:50:22,560
Commission's it's more or less the same

00:50:19,070 --> 00:50:24,900
was preparing a report for not for the

00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:30,360
board but for the general assembly for

00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:38,210
the members I I miss a little bit

00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:41,190
general assembly the online process is

00:50:38,210 --> 00:50:44,740
completely different compared to what we

00:50:41,190 --> 00:50:48,670
had it was a place to discuss

00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:51,369
little bit more than what we have right

00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:56,680
now which is just closed thought some

00:50:51,369 --> 00:51:00,609
few things sing some of not democracy

00:50:56,680 --> 00:51:04,720
but in terms of exchange and human

00:51:00,609 --> 00:51:09,010
relation it's something that we created

00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:11,710
something with live virtual we I really

00:51:09,010 --> 00:51:25,180
miss something at that point I don't

00:51:11,710 --> 00:51:29,380
know if I'm the only one but the subtle

00:51:25,180 --> 00:51:33,460
working group is didn't answer directly

00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:37,539
it takes some time because we don't have

00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:40,029
any issues with pot and so we don't no

00:51:37,539 --> 00:51:43,960
need to complain we are very happy about

00:51:40,029 --> 00:51:49,690
the work of Dorothea and thank you so

00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:52,270
much for their work for us and we it's

00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:54,990
necessary always to have a good

00:51:52,270 --> 00:51:58,359
communication with the treasurer for

00:51:54,990 --> 00:52:00,789
asking maybe budget questions for this

00:51:58,359 --> 00:52:04,089
autumn when we don't know how many

00:52:00,789 --> 00:52:08,170
budget we will have because sponsors are

00:52:04,089 --> 00:52:16,809
not so quick and that's all for my

00:52:08,170 --> 00:52:19,299
perspective I just gonna ask Dorothea if

00:52:16,809 --> 00:52:22,329
you need help right that's the point too

00:52:19,299 --> 00:52:23,770
with the negotiation because if you need

00:52:22,329 --> 00:52:25,630
help on things that's a good early

00:52:23,770 --> 00:52:26,890
warning that maybe we need to find other

00:52:25,630 --> 00:52:29,039
things and so Dorothy is always

00:52:26,890 --> 00:52:32,799
available too and we can talk about that

00:52:29,039 --> 00:52:34,869
and so my why some I love you maybe

00:52:32,799 --> 00:52:36,849
don't know all that his everything

00:52:34,869 --> 00:52:39,670
that's behind some of these comments and

00:52:36,849 --> 00:52:42,430
I think there's also maybe some of the

00:52:39,670 --> 00:52:45,099
more explained by fear I think sometimes

00:52:42,430 --> 00:52:47,020
we can get fear too we don't want to

00:52:45,099 --> 00:52:48,970
make decisions obviously it depends on

00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:51,430
the decision because we might make the

00:52:48,970 --> 00:52:53,260
wrong one we don't want to respond to a

00:52:51,430 --> 00:52:55,990
survey because I don't represent

00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:57,820
everyone in my working group you know we

00:52:55,990 --> 00:53:00,040
don't want

00:52:57,820 --> 00:53:02,680
tell you how we would spend some money

00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:05,260
because what if we spend it wrong or

00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:07,120
don't get good value out of it so it's

00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:09,400
it's not that we don't want to do things

00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:14,040
I think we've started to get a cultural

00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:17,710
we built a culture about kind of fear

00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:19,660
let's just I'll just I'll run things

00:53:17,710 --> 00:53:22,240
I'll do this but let's not do it too

00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:24,730
much and if you knew if you're

00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:28,620
interested in joining it it may take a

00:53:24,730 --> 00:53:31,030
while to get to know people but yeah it

00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:32,740
go ahead to know them if you want to do

00:53:31,030 --> 00:53:34,120
something maybe don't run in there

00:53:32,740 --> 00:53:35,800
saying I want to change your working

00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:37,390
group I want to do all this I want to

00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:40,270
sort out your problem because if people

00:53:37,390 --> 00:53:42,190
who have feared that you might do things

00:53:40,270 --> 00:53:44,080
wrong again or you know or not again but

00:53:42,190 --> 00:53:46,870
you know you might upset people or

00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:48,910
people might question what you do but do

00:53:46,870 --> 00:53:51,700
approach them and say all what can I do

00:53:48,910 --> 00:53:54,010
can you help me you know and things like

00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:59,290
that and and it takes time and talking

00:53:54,010 --> 00:54:05,890
to people okay yeah thank you however as

00:53:59,290 --> 00:54:09,070
a question of for example for this state

00:54:05,890 --> 00:54:11,680
of the map conference it for me it feels

00:54:09,070 --> 00:54:14,320
like they're really nice talks about

00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:17,290
really new things and it's really

00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:19,930
changing kind of which topics are

00:54:17,290 --> 00:54:23,590
increased to this conference but for me

00:54:19,930 --> 00:54:25,570
it's like I want to come back to like

00:54:23,590 --> 00:54:28,030
like what's important for for the

00:54:25,570 --> 00:54:30,870
community and then turn to need like

00:54:28,030 --> 00:54:34,990
more space to discuss also not only have

00:54:30,870 --> 00:54:36,640
to listen to talk just like to show what

00:54:34,990 --> 00:54:39,730
what's the four examples of working

00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:41,500
group are do is doing and which kind of

00:54:39,730 --> 00:54:44,050
job offers for example kind of

00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:46,210
volunteering job offers they have to

00:54:44,050 --> 00:54:47,800
show what you what you can do in the

00:54:46,210 --> 00:54:50,200
working group but you have to show it

00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:55,720
and I saw it like this conference is the

00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:58,840
same this is a right place to show what

00:54:55,720 --> 00:55:02,410
what you are doing in your volunteering

00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:04,750
time and which kind of people you need

00:55:02,410 --> 00:55:07,780
which skills do you need and just show

00:55:04,750 --> 00:55:09,380
also on in the small group like I show

00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:13,670
what you are doing and

00:55:09,380 --> 00:55:16,819
and to invite also the community members

00:55:13,670 --> 00:55:19,369
are also new car new editors to join

00:55:16,819 --> 00:55:23,209
kind of but I think it's also important

00:55:19,369 --> 00:55:25,489
to show what you are doing and because

00:55:23,209 --> 00:55:27,319
many people don't know really what the

00:55:25,489 --> 00:55:30,680
working groups are doing because they

00:55:27,319 --> 00:55:34,339
only wait and see what they can use but

00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:51,829
they then don't really see it I don't

00:55:34,339 --> 00:55:54,979
know yeah it's for moment I just wanted

00:55:51,829 --> 00:55:57,890
to pick up on the working group survey

00:55:54,979 --> 00:56:00,199
that you sent round and it's just one

00:55:57,890 --> 00:56:03,650
very small change to but I would suggest

00:56:00,199 --> 00:56:05,089
serving the members as individual

00:56:03,650 --> 00:56:06,890
respondents rather than asking the

00:56:05,089 --> 00:56:08,900
working groups for a response because

00:56:06,890 --> 00:56:10,279
although I'm not on the operations

00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:13,489
working group anymore when I saw that

00:56:10,279 --> 00:56:15,709
coming in I thought if they're somebody

00:56:13,489 --> 00:56:17,299
and the working group no needs to

00:56:15,709 --> 00:56:19,999
coordinate surveying all the members

00:56:17,299 --> 00:56:22,549
before they you've produced an official

00:56:19,999 --> 00:56:24,019
response so it would just be one small

00:56:22,549 --> 00:56:25,910
tweak and I think you'd get more

00:56:24,019 --> 00:56:27,769
responses to if you were just asking the

00:56:25,910 --> 00:56:29,329
individual members what they thought of

00:56:27,769 --> 00:56:31,759
the working group what they thought of

00:56:29,329 --> 00:56:33,140
the board rather than trying to get each

00:56:31,759 --> 00:56:46,309
working group to make a collective

00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:51,079
answer so I would practice

00:56:46,309 --> 00:56:55,099
so if possible so so feedback is a very

00:56:51,079 --> 00:56:59,239
important I think but I do not remember

00:56:55,099 --> 00:57:04,519
the official survey after the SOT m2

00:56:59,239 --> 00:57:07,819
participants and so for example what is

00:57:04,519 --> 00:57:10,130
the feeling and the word is your

00:57:07,819 --> 00:57:13,549
contribution to open Sweetman and open

00:57:10,130 --> 00:57:15,789
treatment foundation so we have a booth

00:57:13,549 --> 00:57:15,789
on

00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:26,170
around here the sir some rom may very

00:57:21,580 --> 00:57:30,490
hesitate to talk what we what he can do

00:57:26,170 --> 00:57:34,349
directory but surveying yes having is

00:57:30,490 --> 00:57:47,200
very difficult but the possibility to

00:57:34,349 --> 00:57:51,880
take a feedback officially I guess you

00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:53,470
heard about the survey so I didn't write

00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:55,930
anything because I didn't really know

00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:58,780
what to say based on the way that the

00:57:55,930 --> 00:58:00,790
question was phrased I think there are

00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:01,869
like a couple of objective things that

00:58:00,790 --> 00:58:03,369
you probably want to know about the

00:58:01,869 --> 00:58:04,599
working groups that you probably don't

00:58:03,369 --> 00:58:06,580
even need to ask the working groups

00:58:04,599 --> 00:58:08,770
because dorothea takes the minutes so

00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:11,770
she knows how many members there are and

00:58:08,770 --> 00:58:13,359
how often the working group meets and

00:58:11,770 --> 00:58:14,950
how many people show up it shows up to

00:58:13,359 --> 00:58:16,900
meeting so she can like probably compile

00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:20,140
those statistics and warn you if the

00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:21,460
working group is not meeting before you

00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:24,190
know anybody in the working group Warren

00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:26,200
where's you but I think what would be

00:58:24,190 --> 00:58:28,540
useful in terms of communication between

00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:30,190
the working groups and the board is for

00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:32,320
the board to tell the working group if

00:58:30,190 --> 00:58:33,849
their board is expecting any work

00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:37,000
product from the working group that it

00:58:33,849 --> 00:58:40,750
has not received and also for the board

00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:42,130
for you know like you know maybe like

00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:43,270
the board and the working people say

00:58:42,130 --> 00:58:44,770
what does the board

00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:46,960
oh the working group in terms of

00:58:44,770 --> 00:58:48,339
specific projects in terms of like the

00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:50,770
board like still needs to give the

00:58:48,339 --> 00:58:52,450
working group feedback on X and like

00:58:50,770 --> 00:58:54,070
it's something that the board is still

00:58:52,450 --> 00:58:57,760
meeting on and they just haven't made a

00:58:54,070 --> 00:59:01,830
decision or if the board is expecting

00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:01,830
something from the working group

00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:15,770
I just hear like process problems all

00:59:13,430 --> 00:59:17,480
the time and that's all so it's my

00:59:15,770 --> 00:59:19,369
biggest personal frustration with being

00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:22,130
on the board that it's so hard to know

00:59:19,369 --> 00:59:24,140
what you're allowed to do and not and if

00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:26,720
it's it's okay to just send this me a

00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:29,780
mail out or you have to ask first or so

00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:31,730
that's really I think a huge priority

00:59:29,780 --> 00:59:33,470
it's also an extremely boring task so I

00:59:31,730 --> 00:59:39,980
hope there's a lot of candidates who

00:59:33,470 --> 00:59:41,720
want to work on that when they apply so

00:59:39,980 --> 00:59:43,490
I have a question about the recent

00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:44,420
survey it sounds like I don't know a lot

00:59:43,490 --> 00:59:46,069
of the history I don't know what

00:59:44,420 --> 00:59:47,780
decisions are being held up and what

00:59:46,069 --> 00:59:50,089
everyone's disagreeing on in particular

00:59:47,780 --> 00:59:51,799
on the board but what decisions are

00:59:50,089 --> 00:59:58,339
going to be informed by the recent

00:59:51,799 --> 01:00:00,980
survey results on the board the the

00:59:58,339 --> 01:00:05,329
survey on community in advance of Sodom

01:00:00,980 --> 01:00:07,099
I mean I think our thinking was that it

01:00:05,329 --> 01:00:10,309
would actually be useful input for this

01:00:07,099 --> 01:00:12,380
event and for discussions here rather

01:00:10,309 --> 01:00:14,359
than something very specific for the

01:00:12,380 --> 01:00:16,880
board I don't know just if you have

01:00:14,359 --> 01:00:21,109
other thoughts but we thought this was

01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:23,000
more useful for discussion within the

01:00:21,109 --> 01:00:24,890
community especially here rather than

01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:29,119
some particular action that we need

01:00:24,890 --> 01:00:31,400
input on it's an outside of our own

01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:32,990
curiosity about the answers to those

01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:35,329
questions we thought that there would be

01:00:32,990 --> 01:00:40,790
a lot of interest as well from other

01:00:35,329 --> 01:00:44,530
folks yeah yeah I guess it's not

01:00:40,790 --> 01:00:49,790
straight to a decision it's more like we

01:00:44,530 --> 01:00:51,980
have a sense that a lot of what we think

01:00:49,790 --> 01:00:55,220
and the context within which we make our

01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:59,510
decisions are based too much on how we

01:00:55,220 --> 01:01:01,670
think things work and not really I mean

01:00:59,510 --> 01:01:03,799
and that is based on what you read the

01:01:01,670 --> 01:01:06,440
channels that you follow the people you

01:01:03,799 --> 01:01:08,090
talk to so

01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:10,160
yeah you know what happens for the

01:01:08,090 --> 01:01:12,530
country when everyone does that so we

01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:17,090
wanted to like try to be a little more

01:01:12,530 --> 01:01:19,970
fact-based and if you have like a the

01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:22,250
voices of people from a lot of different

01:01:19,970 --> 01:01:25,400
backgrounds which are well they're not

01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:27,890
random of course but and I think we had

01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:30,890
a really nice selection of people from

01:01:27,890 --> 01:01:35,750
around the world with that so it makes

01:01:30,890 --> 01:01:38,030
you like reconsider assumptions like for

01:01:35,750 --> 01:01:40,640
me for example the biggest takeaway was

01:01:38,030 --> 01:01:43,010
that everyone uses mailing lists that's

01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:45,350
why it says I thought what a European

01:01:43,010 --> 01:01:47,530
thing but it's all over the place and

01:01:45,350 --> 01:01:50,390
then you have a telegram people and the

01:01:47,530 --> 01:01:52,550
Facebook people and and there I mean

01:01:50,390 --> 01:01:55,910
that kind of thing it's it's it's just

01:01:52,550 --> 01:02:00,620
like interesting to know what the

01:01:55,910 --> 01:02:03,050
context is and and like if you think

01:02:00,620 --> 01:02:04,580
that this one place is the only place

01:02:03,050 --> 01:02:06,740
where you should listen then you're

01:02:04,580 --> 01:02:09,410
probably missing out on too much so then

01:02:06,740 --> 01:02:22,460
it didn't forms you in a wider sense

01:02:09,410 --> 01:02:25,970
it's not yep everybody else I just

01:02:22,460 --> 01:02:27,950
wanted to quickly touch back on the the

01:02:25,970 --> 01:02:32,530
questionnaire which you sent around and

01:02:27,950 --> 01:02:38,690
I I take the blame for not answering but

01:02:32,530 --> 01:02:40,760
my response was bit and I mean if it

01:02:38,690 --> 01:02:43,970
depend if stuff that I'm simply being

01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:46,160
able to take off it would be okay but

01:02:43,970 --> 01:02:47,660
you know you have to build consensus

01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:53,540
around what are you gonna answer and so

01:02:47,660 --> 01:02:55,190
on but outside of that I do want to say

01:02:53,540 --> 01:02:56,120
and I think I can say that on behalf of

01:02:55,190 --> 01:03:01,040
the lwg

01:02:56,120 --> 01:03:05,990
and that when it's when we've put

01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:10,610
concrete topics or subjects to the board

01:03:05,990 --> 01:03:12,950
for decision I think we're quite happy

01:03:10,610 --> 01:03:16,839
with the timeframe said that happened in

01:03:12,950 --> 01:03:21,050
and that decisions were made

01:03:16,839 --> 01:03:24,109
where it gets a bit dicey is you know

01:03:21,050 --> 01:03:29,020
when we say okay this is a subject that

01:03:24,109 --> 01:03:32,810
should be looked at in famous one brexit

01:03:29,020 --> 01:03:35,450
where we we can't make the decision

01:03:32,810 --> 01:03:37,910
we're just raising the point and then

01:03:35,450 --> 01:03:40,599
the feedback seems to be very very

01:03:37,910 --> 01:03:43,550
little and so you know we don't get

01:03:40,599 --> 01:03:45,890
something like I said okay we're on this

01:03:43,550 --> 01:03:48,320
and we're handling this and that always

01:03:45,890 --> 01:03:51,740
leaves this feeling well yes did it

01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:54,890
register or didn't it register and

01:03:51,740 --> 01:03:58,010
that's but you know outside of that I

01:03:54,890 --> 01:04:01,070
think we were quite quite happy and we

01:03:58,010 --> 01:04:03,230
have a lot of leeway I have to say we so

01:04:01,070 --> 01:04:05,770
we're not we don't feel restricted or

01:04:03,230 --> 01:04:05,770
anything like that

01:04:06,940 --> 01:04:17,119
Thanks we're past time but I'm happy to

01:04:11,450 --> 01:04:18,230
stay trust out of curiosity and to get

01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:21,470
the big picture

01:04:18,230 --> 01:04:24,200
how does communication currently happen

01:04:21,470 --> 01:04:25,970
within the working groups within the

01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:29,510
board and between the working groups and

01:04:25,970 --> 01:04:35,930
the board is that face to face by email

01:04:29,510 --> 01:04:37,300
snail mail also online race so Sarah

01:04:35,930 --> 01:04:39,500
gave a great presentation

01:04:37,300 --> 01:04:40,760
Hannah sorry gave a great presentation

01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:43,490
sorry I'm tired

01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:46,040
I apologize Anna about who we are and

01:04:43,490 --> 01:04:48,410
how we communicate we are exactly a

01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:50,260
reflection of the network and how we

01:04:48,410 --> 01:04:53,510
communicate and how we don't communicate

01:04:50,260 --> 01:04:55,940
that would be and that's not necessarily

01:04:53,510 --> 01:04:57,970
a good answer but it is a reflection

01:04:55,940 --> 01:05:00,530
that the complexities are there and

01:04:57,970 --> 01:05:03,319
regarding what do you want from your

01:05:00,530 --> 01:05:06,140
board about decisions it seems to me

01:05:03,319 --> 01:05:08,540
that when I joined the board I thought I

01:05:06,140 --> 01:05:12,500
would work on strategy and decisions and

01:05:08,540 --> 01:05:13,910
when I what I learned was the definition

01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:16,430
of what a board member is an

01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:18,319
OpenStreetMap foundation is different

01:05:16,430 --> 01:05:19,700
for each person the definition of

01:05:18,319 --> 01:05:23,540
responsibilities is different for each

01:05:19,700 --> 01:05:25,579
person and I felt like I couldn't move

01:05:23,540 --> 01:05:26,940
forward without understanding what their

01:05:25,579 --> 01:05:28,170
working groups wanted and so

01:05:26,940 --> 01:05:30,599
that we just kind of ended up in a

01:05:28,170 --> 01:05:34,920
situation where I was confused and they

01:05:30,599 --> 01:05:37,020
were confused I can go have to answer

01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:39,060
alphas question how the king coups

01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:41,540
communicate I can answer this for a

01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:44,099
certain working group we use a couple of

01:05:41,540 --> 01:05:46,200
communication channels we have an

01:05:44,099 --> 01:05:47,940
internal mailing list but this is

01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:51,960
usually used for communication with

01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:53,910
external people we have private github

01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:57,030
repository of issues and lots of

01:05:53,910 --> 01:05:58,800
discussions in it in the last days

01:05:57,030 --> 01:06:01,079
before the event we usually use

01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:05,160
real-time communication channels like

01:06:01,079 --> 01:06:08,579
telegram and we use email if we want to

01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:10,290
get in touch with the board yeah I can

01:06:08,579 --> 01:06:12,420
speak for the board we have a board

01:06:10,290 --> 01:06:14,940
mailing list which we receive external

01:06:12,420 --> 01:06:17,609
emails to and talk to each other

01:06:14,940 --> 01:06:21,630
sometimes not very much sometimes an

01:06:17,609 --> 01:06:24,150
awful lot we also have a real-time chat

01:06:21,630 --> 01:06:27,180
channel which is based on IRC but

01:06:24,150 --> 01:06:30,240
there's a bridge to to slack

01:06:27,180 --> 01:06:32,609
we have gate lab - the foundation has a

01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:34,920
gait lab account which is open source

01:06:32,609 --> 01:06:36,780
and so for issue tracking that's

01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:38,190
actually available to other working

01:06:36,780 --> 01:06:40,319
groups we could set up other other

01:06:38,190 --> 01:06:42,089
places there if issue tracking is useful

01:06:40,319 --> 01:06:43,319
for the working groups especially if

01:06:42,089 --> 01:06:45,150
there's something you are expecting from

01:06:43,319 --> 01:06:48,000
the board you could put an issue in your

01:06:45,150 --> 01:06:50,220
your repository and we could track that

01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:54,869
as well to make sure that we're we're on

01:06:50,220 --> 01:06:57,780
task and we have a monthly meeting on

01:06:54,869 --> 01:07:05,339
mumble which you all are welcome to

01:06:57,780 --> 01:07:09,750
attend and listen in on on a few working

01:07:05,339 --> 01:07:14,180
groups and the communicative variety of

01:07:09,750 --> 01:07:16,920
ways they communicate a variety of ways

01:07:14,180 --> 01:07:22,560
for communication between working groups

01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:24,750
that all of them use email basically but

01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:29,400
there's github tickets there's get lab

01:07:24,750 --> 01:07:33,560
tickets there's specialized tools like

01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:41,460
OTRS with where some stuff ends up

01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:52,950
IRC I think that's pretty much covering

01:07:41,460 --> 01:07:56,190
everything really don't you have

01:07:52,950 --> 01:08:02,370
meetings and in video conferences on the

01:07:56,190 --> 01:08:05,790
board now because my vision is the

01:08:02,370 --> 01:08:09,120
following and I must say that I I'm

01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:10,740
quite new to the community and I but it

01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:15,030
seems to me that sometimes when people

01:08:10,740 --> 01:08:17,940
communicate writing writing in writing

01:08:15,030 --> 01:08:20,400
this can be very harsh I've got a

01:08:17,940 --> 01:08:22,620
principle that I've learned about 24

01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:25,560
year 20 years ago with with a boss he

01:08:22,620 --> 01:08:29,700
was saying bad things you never write

01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:32,070
and good things we can write I mean you

01:08:29,700 --> 01:08:34,350
go in any meeting with a colleague and

01:08:32,070 --> 01:08:37,890
just after the meeting you've write and

01:08:34,350 --> 01:08:40,640
say hey thank you for being with us

01:08:37,890 --> 01:08:43,440
during the meeting but at that point

01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:46,140
your intervention was not that good and

01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:48,750
that was not that productive that is

01:08:46,140 --> 01:08:51,120
very bad I mean this is perceived very

01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:52,530
badly when you've write to a colleague

01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:54,030
and say hey thank you very much for

01:08:52,530 --> 01:08:55,830
coming to the meeting your intervention

01:08:54,030 --> 01:08:57,900
was very good and helped a lot we closed

01:08:55,830 --> 01:09:01,020
the big deal or we managed to do this

01:08:57,900 --> 01:09:03,840
thanks to you then you can write so I

01:09:01,020 --> 01:09:07,140
think it's very very very very important

01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:09,930
when you have you work on something to

01:09:07,140 --> 01:09:11,500
work speaking and today it's easy to

01:09:09,930 --> 01:09:14,590
speak

01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:14,590
[Music]

01:09:16,770 --> 01:09:20,069
[Music]

01:09:22,220 --> 01:09:26,700
okay no I think it's very important to I

01:09:25,050 --> 01:09:28,830
mean because there is nothing there are

01:09:26,700 --> 01:09:31,290
some things you cannot explain in

01:09:28,830 --> 01:09:34,830
writing or if writing it's it's two

01:09:31,290 --> 01:09:36,750
pages in two hours and in fact a good

01:09:34,830 --> 01:09:39,980
shot with someone you want to shout out

01:09:36,750 --> 01:09:42,180
is on the phone and it's fine because

01:09:39,980 --> 01:09:44,880
normally when you are we and we are all

01:09:42,180 --> 01:09:47,130
willing to do something positive in one

01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:49,170
direction you'd shout out your brother

01:09:47,130 --> 01:09:52,290
your brother shuts back and then it's

01:09:49,170 --> 01:09:54,900
all fine but when you've right it's it

01:09:52,290 --> 01:09:57,750
is very harsh so it's very important to

01:09:54,900 --> 01:10:03,750
speak that's what we are doing today

01:09:57,750 --> 01:10:05,640
today we learned some lessons on state

01:10:03,750 --> 01:10:08,670
of the map over the years and it's

01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:11,070
changed I think doing it with video we

01:10:08,670 --> 01:10:13,830
found it would slow down the connections

01:10:11,070 --> 01:10:16,860
on a group thing but the audio mumble

01:10:13,830 --> 01:10:18,870
works very nicely I like it because it

01:10:16,860 --> 01:10:20,880
lights up your name so you know who's

01:10:18,870 --> 01:10:23,430
speaking because I'm terrible with

01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:25,050
accents and if if we got a group of

01:10:23,430 --> 01:10:27,210
people all from Germany I think have

01:10:25,050 --> 01:10:30,950
everyone's the same and I get mixed up

01:10:27,210 --> 01:10:33,690
he's speaking and we also actually found

01:10:30,950 --> 01:10:37,170
the years that we've had minutes and one

01:10:33,690 --> 01:10:40,830
we've been able to use ain't like Google

01:10:37,170 --> 01:10:43,320
Docs or chaos pad to have someone typing

01:10:40,830 --> 01:10:47,310
the minutes as they happen has been

01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:49,320
really good for language because I mean

01:10:47,310 --> 01:10:51,900
I'm English I can understand generally

01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:53,700
other people speaking English but these

01:10:51,900 --> 01:10:55,740
are struggling with language they like

01:10:53,700 --> 01:10:57,840
they can listen and as you say there's

01:10:55,740 --> 01:11:01,560
love things you get from real-time voice

01:10:57,840 --> 01:11:03,750
and but yeah if you can if you've got

01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:05,610
someone minuting in real time those that

01:11:03,750 --> 01:11:08,370
are struggling with the language find it

01:11:05,610 --> 01:11:11,540
easier so I would really recommend that

01:11:08,370 --> 01:11:14,490
to other groups and meetings generally

01:11:11,540 --> 01:11:16,740
but also those meetings are good for

01:11:14,490 --> 01:11:19,800
specific things that for state of the

01:11:16,740 --> 01:11:21,540
map we need to discuss also having

01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:26,130
things in writing so they get done is

01:11:21,540 --> 01:11:28,020
important to the action points so we

01:11:26,130 --> 01:11:29,540
have I have a hard stop at 6:00 because

01:11:28,020 --> 01:11:32,750
I have another we have another

01:11:29,540 --> 01:11:34,580
meaning I just wanted to take the

01:11:32,750 --> 01:11:38,240
liberty of saying one thing I'm super

01:11:34,580 --> 01:11:40,100
thankful for every contribution like for

01:11:38,240 --> 01:11:41,600
everybody who's on a working group who

01:11:40,100 --> 01:11:43,220
does like an the state of the map

01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:45,470
working group got two people here and

01:11:43,220 --> 01:11:47,900
they're running an event so thank you I

01:11:45,470 --> 01:11:50,090
mean that the work that happens is

01:11:47,900 --> 01:11:52,010
really massive and sometimes people it's

01:11:50,090 --> 01:11:54,680
overloaded and it's breaking people

01:11:52,010 --> 01:11:56,750
right I think there's a lot of really

01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:58,910
beautiful talent and that's amazing and

01:11:56,750 --> 01:12:00,770
that's board members as well but you

01:11:58,910 --> 01:12:02,870
know why don't we get to the next level

01:12:00,770 --> 01:12:04,700
is where I kind of stand right now and

01:12:02,870 --> 01:12:06,170
so whether it's getting better at

01:12:04,700 --> 01:12:08,660
communication it's getting better at the

01:12:06,170 --> 01:12:09,980
tool sets or just being able to make

01:12:08,660 --> 01:12:11,480
sure that we have new people who are

01:12:09,980 --> 01:12:12,820
trained up Fredericks but asking for

01:12:11,480 --> 01:12:16,130
somebody to be trained up on Treasury

01:12:12,820 --> 01:12:18,890
for a while and you know that's a flag

01:12:16,130 --> 01:12:20,660
so we have things to do in the next few

01:12:18,890 --> 01:12:23,090
months which is great but we have

01:12:20,660 --> 01:12:25,960
another ten minutes or so for questions

01:12:23,090 --> 01:12:25,960
please go ahead

01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:34,690
[Music]

01:12:41,679 --> 01:12:46,389
I'd have a question but I don't just

01:12:43,750 --> 01:12:49,469
want to say again because I think it's

01:12:46,389 --> 01:12:52,330
more important to raise your voice in a

01:12:49,469 --> 01:12:54,550
common community conference and just

01:12:52,330 --> 01:12:56,260
listen to talks and stuff because

01:12:54,550 --> 01:12:59,469
because for me it's like this is my

01:12:56,260 --> 01:13:02,050
third state of the map and and now I'm

01:12:59,469 --> 01:13:04,030
at the level to see yeah I don't want to

01:13:02,050 --> 01:13:06,369
listen to every talk I don't want to

01:13:04,030 --> 01:13:08,260
rush through the lessons I just want to

01:13:06,369 --> 01:13:10,719
also talk to the people because I never

01:13:08,260 --> 01:13:14,170
meet why I only meet them once per year

01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:17,679
if I go to as a continent by airplane

01:13:14,170 --> 01:13:20,050
mostly so here's as a chance to talk and

01:13:17,679 --> 01:13:23,949
you have to plan also secessions like to

01:13:20,050 --> 01:13:27,040
talk more to to also get a better

01:13:23,949 --> 01:13:29,320
solutions and keep it on the yeah I will

01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:31,840
write you maybe next I will you write

01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:35,050
your next day but there's no man coming

01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:40,500
because you don't have really a focus on

01:13:35,050 --> 01:13:48,190
on talking about the problem and yeah so

01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:56,520
that's it thank you I enjoyed the

01:13:48,190 --> 01:13:59,739
discussion should we turn these off so I

01:13:56,520 --> 01:14:03,880
think this was really useful I died

01:13:59,739 --> 01:14:05,590
time flew no that was gonna be 20

01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:09,330
minutes so thank you all for coming I

01:14:05,590 --> 01:14:09,330
