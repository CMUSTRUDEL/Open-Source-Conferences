Title: 2019: Board + Working Groups meeting
Publication date: 2019-09-26
Playlist: SotM 2019, Day1, HÃ¶rsaal West
Description: 
	Get to know the Board and the Working Groups. Together, we run the OSMF. Let's use the SotM to have a real face to face meeting. The public is invited to join the conversation too.

SotM is about the community meeting the community. But we don't always seek out everyone we would like to talk to. So let's use this space to make sure as many members of the working groups and the board get to know each other as people and not just online text. All working group and board members are invited on the stage and can discuss anything. The public can also ask questions.

Feel free to suggest some agenda items to joost -at- osmfoundation.org
