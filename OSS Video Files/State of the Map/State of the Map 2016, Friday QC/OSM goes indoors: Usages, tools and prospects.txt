Title: OSM goes indoors: Usages, tools and prospects
Publication date: 2016-10-14
Playlist: State of the Map 2016, Friday QC
Description: 
	Antoine Riche and Adrien Pavie at State of the Map 2016
http://2016.stateofthemap.org/2016/osm-goes-indoors/

Over the last two years a lot of indoor mapping activity has been going on in France. All Paris train stations have been mapped to great details, along with shopping malls, museums and universities. A number of tools and techniques have been developed to assist mappers and visualize indoor maps. To name a few: iD-indoor, OpenLevelUp, a DIY 360Â° camera kit and indoor localisation script.

Through this talk we will highlight some of the best accomplishments and describe innovative tools and techniques. We will share some implications and concerns, on the map, on the tools, on the community.

okay our next speaker is a hot one he's

00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:08,820
also from France from capital city I

00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:17,460
think and he will continue on the topic

00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:19,949
of indoor mapping so this presentation

00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,539
comes nicely after Cynthia's talk and

00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:24,510
thank you to the organizer for making

00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:26,010
this happen and there is one thing

00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,750
missing in this organization so there is

00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:31,140
no indoor map of the areas is difficult

00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:34,320
to find your way sometimes so my name is

00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:37,380
Antoine riche and opportunities for my

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,510
leader company called audacity to do map

00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:42,329
some of the railway station in Paris and

00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:43,710
I will talk a bit about that we're not

00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:50,579
just going to talk about the railway

00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:54,059
stations and so I'm really I'm students

00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:57,000
in genetics and I'm also a developer of

00:00:54,059 --> 00:01:00,750
open develop so I mean twisted in

00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:05,070
Indumati and all of it I started by

00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:08,640
simply wanted to create a map of subways

00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:11,810
in Maya city but local contribute aside

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,549
but various no map to show this I said

00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:17,670
okay I would I will try to create

00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:24,810
something to show data I know but how it

00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:29,990
started so the end of tag was introduced

00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:34,670
a few years ago and they are like

00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:37,350
100,000 items around the world and like

00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:40,920
15,000 only in France

00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:45,360
so we see that there is a huge rise of

00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:49,409
the using of this indoor tag but what is

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:53,549
it made for so let's see different use

00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:56,070
of this so in the map Inc and we done a

00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:59,729
pretty everywhere as we saw its

00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:02,759
well-suited for mapping the highway

00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:04,890
station in Paris but not only this you

00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:07,259
can use it on the shopping malls you can

00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:09,989
use it on museums you can use it on a

00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:11,580
public offices in fact you can use it

00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:13,790
pretty everywhere

00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:16,670
which is open to public

00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:19,370
but if you want to do indoor mapping in

00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:22,159
a public place but managed by a private

00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:24,830
operator you it's better to ask a

00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:28,360
permission to do so in that way you

00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:28,360
don't run into troubles

00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,560
let's see some first use case which is

00:02:32,629 --> 00:02:38,269
accessibility

00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:40,870
so most of public places have to be

00:02:38,269 --> 00:02:44,390
accessible for everyone including

00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:47,629
disabled people so in front we have laws

00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:51,079
that make it mandatory to be accessible

00:02:47,629 --> 00:02:53,660
for everyone so with a group of students

00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:56,030
in a French University we did the indoor

00:02:53,660 --> 00:03:00,260
mapping of the world computer and with

00:02:56,030 --> 00:03:03,349
help of technical services we identified

00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:08,359
the accessibility defects on the campus

00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:11,599
so services can manage to solve them in

00:03:08,359 --> 00:03:13,910
a easy way and we have a world data for

00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,390
the complete which is accessible to

00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:17,560
everyone

00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:20,720
on Open Street Map and the values case

00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:23,900
which is a completely different which is

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:26,690
a business still with a group of

00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:28,819
students in the same University we had

00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:31,760
the project working with a fast-food

00:03:28,819 --> 00:03:36,260
chain where we wanted to open a new

00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:40,040
coffee shop in a city so we wanted to

00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:43,760
find the optimal point of sign to open

00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:46,310
this ice coffee shop so they use indo

00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:51,709
data in shopping malls to find where we

00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:55,430
can find an optimal spot for the shopper

00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:58,400
so they use the endo data to see the

00:03:55,430 --> 00:04:00,799
size of a point of sales but also if

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,079
there are any competitors around so it's

00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:07,810
a different use case and as you can see

00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:07,810
we can do a lot of things with endo data

00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:14,660
these are all areas where passengers

00:04:12,769 --> 00:04:16,609
traveler are useful to map indoors

00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:20,000
usually when you travel somewhere you

00:04:16,609 --> 00:04:22,520
don't necessarily know where the area is

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,860
very useful to to have indoor maps to

00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:26,350
find your platform to find a connection

00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:29,020
to the area ground to

00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:31,450
where to buy ticket offices but what

00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:37,360
find the ticket office the toilet shops

00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:39,160
anything and as part of a and what I

00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,640
won't say too much but the data we

00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:45,280
produced for SNCF is actually being used

00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:49,120
as a mobile hub application which was

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,890
described earlier early on and the other

00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,380
reason is we can't leave it all to

00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:55,720
Google because yes Google is also

00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:59,260
mapping it does and actually the vin

00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:02,650
mapping railway station in France they

00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:07,750
started it for the Euro to 2016 football

00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:12,250
cap and so we got to do it as well and

00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:14,860
and this snapshot is from the Android

00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:17,650
Google Maps application for some reason

00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:22,390
you can't have the level selector on on

00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:23,980
the normal web google map so now I'd

00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:26,620
like to share some of the tools and

00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:30,130
techniques we use to map the railway

00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:32,680
stations and to do that I built a team

00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:35,080
of three people including a shower with

00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:37,750
a koozies expert and each skills were

00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:40,630
very useful for that work and still fun

00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:43,360
with a mapillary aficionado and it's

00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:46,060
very skilled in taking pictures and in

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:49,810
his a real maker as we will see in a

00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:52,720
minute so essentially we did that work

00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:55,090
in two stages the first stage was to use

00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:59,950
architect plants which were supplied to

00:05:55,090 --> 00:06:02,200
us by a sense EF and we were careful to

00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:03,790
use those plans very precisely because

00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:06,940
it was the base from the rest of the

00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:09,340
work and so the first day was to

00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:11,740
georeference those plants to the

00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:13,630
building footprints and fortunately in

00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:16,300
France we have good building footprints

00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:18,880
because we can use the data from the

00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:21,430
carrot and which is importantly imported

00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:25,090
in OpenStreetMap so we were able to do

00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:27,670
very good job referencing to some extent

00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:29,440
because some time it was difficult to

00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:32,860
match plans from different levers they

00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:34,510
were not so accurate some plans were

00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:36,129
actually made after the buildings were

00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:40,599
built a lot of

00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:42,159
the stations were built in the 19th

00:06:40,599 --> 00:06:46,989
century the plans were made afterwards

00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:50,080
and then we produce tiles from a using

00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:53,769
jira to retire those Jerry Franz plans

00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:56,399
to to zoom level 23 and tiling was

00:06:53,769 --> 00:07:01,259
essential so that we could use

00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:03,909
architects plans comfortably in Jotham

00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:06,639
so this is what you get in rhythm when

00:07:03,909 --> 00:07:09,639
you have architects plans which are jury

00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:12,849
front and you can see it's quite nice to

00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:16,659
map from forms of plants and you can be

00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:19,929
fairly accurate and and actually it was

00:07:16,659 --> 00:07:23,580
tempting to map the stairways as a

00:07:19,929 --> 00:07:27,069
closed way we could possibly do it and

00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:28,629
sometimes not so easy because I'll work

00:07:27,069 --> 00:07:30,729
first we're not architects so we can't

00:07:28,629 --> 00:07:34,089
really read plant all the information in

00:07:30,729 --> 00:07:34,899
them and and sometimes the plants differ

00:07:34,089 --> 00:07:37,449
from one another

00:07:34,899 --> 00:07:40,749
and it's sometimes difficult to find to

00:07:37,449 --> 00:07:43,389
know which way is up for a conveyor for

00:07:40,749 --> 00:07:49,229
instance and some conveyor span several

00:07:43,389 --> 00:07:52,829
levels was difficult to find out we

00:07:49,229 --> 00:07:56,289
created a preset for years in order to

00:07:52,829 --> 00:08:00,009
to help us produce good quality data and

00:07:56,289 --> 00:08:02,219
also to do it more efficiently and this

00:08:00,009 --> 00:08:05,229
press L was built from the wiki page

00:08:02,219 --> 00:08:08,349
Vasant is crying early on that just

00:08:05,229 --> 00:08:10,959
watching I'd like to add that this wiki

00:08:08,349 --> 00:08:12,999
page was put together from existing

00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:14,919
sources but it was not just put together

00:08:12,999 --> 00:08:17,949
bias and see if it was also discussed

00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:21,339
with a community and I remember in the

00:08:17,949 --> 00:08:23,379
state of the map 2015 attending a

00:08:21,339 --> 00:08:27,459
workshop which was led by flora which is

00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:29,550
here we made sure that this proposal is

00:08:27,459 --> 00:08:34,060
accepted by the CUNY community which is

00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:35,829
important to outline and this is

00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:38,169
opportunity to say we thank you to the

00:08:35,829 --> 00:08:40,599
job developers because it's intensive

00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:44,259
mapping which we've been doing really

00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:47,180
showed the official purpose jasmine is

00:08:44,259 --> 00:08:50,720
it's really good to to fuse that

00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:51,260
and yes some some features are really

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:56,710
impressive

00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:59,660
very good so we come into phase 2 we

00:08:56,710 --> 00:09:03,530
went to Paris to take pictures of all

00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:05,540
the areas forgot to mention that all of

00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:06,350
the three hundred eighty eighty eight

00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:08,750
stations

00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:10,910
we only mapped eight of them just the

00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:13,420
most complex ones the railway station in

00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:15,950
Paris which have several levels

00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:19,040
including two underground station which

00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:22,190
are extremely complex with many levers

00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:25,010
and stairways and entrances and so we

00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:28,970
went to read all these eight stations

00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:32,210
and this is where Stefan's comes in so

00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:35,960
the mapillary aficionado he built a

00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:40,610
unique 360-degree camera rocket which is

00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:42,800
made from for Chinese cameras and they

00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:46,000
put on top of a pole of a pod and we

00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:52,120
call that the v 4m pod you phone app and

00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:55,790
and the latter night actually a king a

00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:58,250
non droid application in order to to

00:09:55,790 --> 00:10:01,270
take the four pictures at once which was

00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:04,790
quite important for for the process and

00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:07,040
so and the Warsame worked perfectly well

00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:08,810
for the the four days and the hey

00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,570
station we covered and the mini mini

00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:14,030
kilometers and there was no trouble

00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:17,630
whatever the only the only difficulty

00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:21,470
was the weight of carrying it for so

00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:22,940
many so many kilometers so you know

00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:25,040
you're gonna say we're welcome but you

00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:26,690
got you got pictures but the comp

00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:30,100
possibly be geotagged

00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:33,500
so correct we had we then had a process

00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:36,680
to geotag those pictures because

00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:38,240
obviously the these pictures are endure

00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:41,030
on the rural roof or on the ground so

00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:45,260
they couldn't possibly be geotagged so

00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:47,480
we we did your taxi ban and when we when

00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:49,670
we were surveying we actually use field

00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,830
papers that we produced from the

00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:53,630
architect plans well from the orbitrim

00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:56,090
app data we produce with our architects

00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:57,620
plans and we produce those fit papers

00:10:56,090 --> 00:11:00,170
using kuja's

00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:03,170
and you could produce them level by

00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:05,480
level with a clever stunt sheet so we

00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:10,690
took note of all the track all the

00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:13,940
traces that Stefan did and taking x and

00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:16,960
a lot of information and then there was

00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:18,950
a little bit tedious process of

00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:23,180
localizing the pictures and we use

00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:25,180
values tool like active tool to to tag

00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:28,990
the picture but also python scripts to

00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:33,020
correlate with DP GPS track along with

00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:35,990
pictures and I won't go into the details

00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:40,250
because he forgot about it and and

00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:42,980
stiffen wrote it on his on his website

00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:45,500
which you can have a look at it's all in

00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:48,610
French but you interstellar might be

00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:52,910
inclined to to translate it

00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:54,980
the result is happy mappers this is what

00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:59,089
you what you see on this slide is what

00:11:54,980 --> 00:12:01,670
you get in the awesome will the wizard

00:11:59,089 --> 00:12:05,180
pictures which you can see here and you

00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:06,770
can see that the four pictures which

00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:09,920
were actually taken in the same place

00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:14,360
split apart that we will select them one

00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:19,640
by one and which was pretty essential we

00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:23,810
didn't we didn't even try to produce a

00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:26,029
fair one picture a real 360-degrees

00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:31,220
picture because there is no appropriate

00:12:26,029 --> 00:12:32,839
0 in Jotham and and we don't see the

00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:35,600
point we prefer to have the direction

00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:37,910
the orientation of the picture to see to

00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:44,089
in order to use properly but we could

00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:47,660
see on the data and and the pictures we

00:12:44,089 --> 00:12:51,320
had are very high quality and not only

00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:54,890
we could see the sweden on the screen

00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:58,160
here as high at full full scale but also

00:12:54,890 --> 00:13:00,920
we could read the time on the clock

00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:03,680
which are about 30 meters at the hand of

00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:05,420
the of the station under the roof so

00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,280
every there are not of information we

00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:09,700
could get from those picture was very

00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,700
impressive

00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:15,400
another tool we use is of course open

00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:17,920
develop written by Adrian and and that's

00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:20,650
what's really essential because that

00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:22,780
gave us another view of the data we

00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:27,520
produce to the one we could see in

00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:29,860
Joseph and and with upper level AB you

00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:32,290
can select the the floor level obviously

00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:34,480
you can select individual individual

00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:39,880
items and see all the times in them and

00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:41,920
you can it is based on overpass request

00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:46,060
so you have up-to-date data which was

00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:47,250
essential for us and mini extra features

00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:50,110
were so extra feature that I really

00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:52,270
described for instance you can link it

00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:54,790
to my pyramid pictures which is quite

00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:56,920
good so thank you to our reason for this

00:13:54,790 --> 00:14:01,780
because that helped a lot for doing his

00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:05,380
job and no Broussard we and I will like

00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:08,140
to share what's coming next about indoor

00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:10,930
mapping and some concerns we have as

00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:15,280
well with this new type of data with

00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:18,240
creating first thing is that you don't

00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:20,350
always have architect plans and

00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,570
sometimes you can take pictures of a

00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:25,780
evacuation map and sort of derive from

00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:30,070
them with a peak layer plug-in not so

00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:32,560
easy and but there is this video which

00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:35,170
you could have a look at and this is

00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:39,250
quite impressive because what this video

00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:43,780
is made by a university robotics

00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:46,240
laboratory and coupling leader with some

00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:49,710
piece of software which happens to be

00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:51,640
open source which is good and to do you

00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:53,620
simultaneous localization and mapping

00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:56,230
and the video is quite impressive

00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:58,060
because when you look at it there is

00:14:56,230 --> 00:15:00,970
this man working in corridor and offices

00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:03,580
and on the upper right corner of the

00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:06,190
video you can see the map building

00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:07,750
itself automatically so that is really

00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:12,070
impressive and

00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:15,340
and the then was coming next for us

00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:20,140
perhaps is that stiffeners order on the

00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:22,220
Kickstarter project leader a leader

00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:25,610
which is quite small and

00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:27,830
portable and you should get it before

00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:30,490
Christmas or guess it will be his new

00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:33,470
toy to play play with for next year and

00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:35,950
I'm pretty sure he's going to try to

00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:39,050
reuse that open-source software to do

00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:44,930
flam as they call it so that's something

00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:49,400
to look forward to know some concerns

00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:52,790
and this shows the matin Dickman of the

00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:56,000
three map of Paris and the area of the

00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:58,400
earth man subway underground station

00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,140
which is the platform's you can see on

00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:02,330
the slide are 20 meters below ground

00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:04,790
level and worry whatever whatever we do

00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:06,830
with a lever and and they attacked they

00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:11,690
still show up on top of buildings this

00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:13,180
is their good really and and so I'd say

00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:17,020
is that the madniks tiny

00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:20,360
need to adapt so that's something to

00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:23,750
consider and I wanted to share that with

00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:26,090
you today another impact is it becomes

00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:31,900
hard to edit this is what you get when

00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:34,820
you open gasps de Leon in Gotham and

00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:36,350
it's why beginners will just wanna wait

00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:39,740
and actually not just beginners with one

00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:43,940
away if you know a little bit about

00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:46,040
about Gotham you can filter the trick is

00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:49,070
to use filter in order to only work on

00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:50,750
one lever and this is just essential but

00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:54,650
in order to do that you need to know

00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:57,590
what what tag to filter on and then you

00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:59,990
need to work out a proper filter which

00:16:57,590 --> 00:17:05,210
is using regular expressions so it's not

00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:09,850
so easy for for for everyone and but it

00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:15,740
it works but then what about the online

00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:19,370
editor oh ID in order to make this

00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:24,350
situation more comfortable comfortable

00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:26,870
I created a fork of ID ID editor which

00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:30,290
is called i Dee endo which will help

00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:33,820
people maintain places having endo

00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:37,000
tagging so we can add

00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:38,980
on a given level because there is a

00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:44,440
filter like you on the open develop

00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:46,480
which is just under zoom buttons well

00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:50,100
you have a same logic you have only one

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,850
level at a time so this feature makes

00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:54,780
edit easier

00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:58,630
you have also extra features like

00:17:54,780 --> 00:18:01,510
Enterprise set in that way you can show

00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:05,830
during the object in a proper way and

00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:08,830
you can edit it simply and you have some

00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:11,950
other extra feature like a simple napkin

00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:16,570
are linking to OpenStreetMap object so

00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:19,480
it makes easier to have assumed pictures

00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:24,370
associated with in the OpenStreetMap

00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:29,310
data but it's not very suitable moment

00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:33,310
to create a map from scratch it's mostly

00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:37,710
made for editing exist play existing

00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:41,830
places but in the future there will be

00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:46,480
some new feature that will help create a

00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:50,770
new indoor place he'll like the ability

00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:52,540
to show a floor map or emergency map in

00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:56,230
the background so you can draw a

00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:58,840
different room the Carosa over it in

00:18:56,230 --> 00:19:01,990
order to make creating a new place

00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:04,510
simple simple you can also check

00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:06,790
topology between rivers for example if

00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:09,220
you are at level one and you move a node

00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:11,620
but this node is also used on a level

00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:13,450
zero it will break everything on the

00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:17,350
rivers also you will have a warning

00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:20,530
saying you might be careful because you

00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:22,990
are breaking things and also last point

00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:28,510
it will have a better in the preset in

00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:31,390
order to make editing more easier but I

00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:33,610
have a secret dream it's a bad idea

00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:36,490
though will be useless since in a few

00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:39,010
months because the main idea data we

00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:42,820
know provide always tools for helping

00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:46,210
everyone making Windows but it's

00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:47,230
something else to discuss I think so

00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:50,280
having a good

00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:55,600
is a thing but having a good map Java is

00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:58,690
also important so actually open develop

00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:01,140
is only one interface which is the same

00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:04,600
for everyone but we are different

00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:08,710
publics from open develop we have main

00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:10,090
users who want simply to show a map in

00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:14,610
order to know where they are

00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:18,010
in the complex buildings we have also

00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:22,840
contributed we want more tools and

00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:26,460
operators we want to be able to do to

00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:31,030
help a visitor to locate on the building

00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:33,669
so there is already a new version of

00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:37,030
open develop which is still in alpha so

00:20:33,669 --> 00:20:39,730
you can see it most mover and more

00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:42,520
simple to use and there will be more

00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:47,440
tools for contributor contributors as we

00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:51,720
can see for building manager well then

00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:56,320
will be the ability to import to embed

00:20:51,720 --> 00:21:01,390
map on the website and and so we are

00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:04,840
running out of time so it's time to

00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:06,340
conclude just to conclude this is indoor

00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:08,080
mapping it's not adding just in France

00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:10,179
and I came across this project open

00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:15,010
station map which is being done in

00:21:10,179 --> 00:21:17,679
Germany and they're very similar which

00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:20,380
is good news and but there are maybe

00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:23,169
some things to share - practices share

00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:26,950
tools which is proposal of modeling

00:21:23,169 --> 00:21:28,840
stairwells as a close way so these are

00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:31,090
some people doing working on a Penn

00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:34,809
Station map in this conference we will

00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:36,870
be happy to talk to them and there are

00:21:34,809 --> 00:21:40,299
also some questions going forward that

00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:45,040
we don't need to answer now and so a be

00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:46,929
brief and but since we do have indoor

00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:49,450
data allow these raises from some

00:21:46,929 --> 00:21:51,220
questioners or to use it properly what

00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:53,380
impact it can have on topology on

00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:56,049
routing whether we were there linear

00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:57,639
foot ways or not that sort of a

00:21:56,049 --> 00:22:00,279
questions

00:21:57,639 --> 00:22:03,429
which I would be happy to wear this

00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:05,079
really I want to say that these forums

00:22:03,429 --> 00:22:06,639
these conferences might be the

00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:09,070
opportunity to start talking about all

00:22:06,639 --> 00:22:11,700
these questions which are going to be

00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:11,700
very important

00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:34,019
just before you leave is very small out

00:22:30,239 --> 00:22:37,200
skipping we will having lunch after the

00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:37,769
turn after the lunch there is a group

00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,629
photo

00:22:37,769 --> 00:22:42,720
so everyone moved from the one that our

00:22:39,629 --> 00:22:48,659
room to the group photo site and there

00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:50,429
is bird of association so check hi i'm

00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:52,830
fran and audrey and you don't only that

00:22:50,429 --> 00:22:56,159
i'm simon by the way i would like to

00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:58,399
thank you from turning the tagging

00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:04,369
scheme that we devised two years ago

00:22:58,399 --> 00:23:07,950
into something real my question would be

00:23:04,369 --> 00:23:11,489
do you think that attacking scheme works

00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:12,359
as it is now and just to note on the

00:23:11,489 --> 00:23:14,220
side

00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:19,340
the next Vespucci version will be

00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:22,350
supporting indoor layer level selection

00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:24,419
so a little quick get your question the

00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:26,759
question was whether you you thought

00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:29,820
that the tagging scheme for indoor

00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:32,029
elements as it is now is sufficient or

00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:32,029
not

00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:44,480
so a real technical question where we

00:23:41,809 --> 00:23:46,250
quite had sorry we cut as father can

00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,380
tell we were quite happy with a tagging

00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:50,870
scheme that maybe our it needs to evolve

00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:53,240
with some different values and the Q

00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:56,000
achieves me QA tools might need to

00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:58,520
evolve as well to consider new tags or

00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,830
new values but as far as I can tell

00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:02,299
there was no problem with it there were

00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:05,960
two models for indoor mapping actually

00:24:02,299 --> 00:24:09,590
and one the other one which which was

00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:13,220
using relations has been deprecated days

00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:17,740
and we need a need relations form for

00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:17,740
doing this so that's so that's good

00:24:19,029 --> 00:24:25,610
question one of the obvious applications

00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:35,960
would be indoor routing can you

00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:38,950
elaborate on this a bit perhaps I try to

00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:44,720
do some in the routing a few time ago

00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:47,690
may need to for disabled people but it's

00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:49,970
a kind of complicated because with

00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:52,340
different levels and the connection

00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:56,750
between rivers it's so complicated to

00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:59,960
manage the fact that this elevator is a

00:24:56,750 --> 00:25:02,270
is a shell node between rivers so it's

00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:04,669
possible to do routing but it's kind of

00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:11,149
complex it's something we have to work

00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:12,620
on okay as in an add-on to this answer

00:25:11,149 --> 00:25:14,929
an announcement

00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:17,210
we are from open station map on Sunday

00:25:14,929 --> 00:25:19,700
having a session in full our session to

00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:21,529
discuss exactly these tagging points how

00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:24,500
to put it into practice how to put it

00:25:21,529 --> 00:25:26,600
forward with lessons learned from the

00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:28,070
applications of practice for examples

00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:30,020
the essence you have found say any twos

00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:32,059
any turnstiles and so on and all these

00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:35,690
things so I invite you to be here on

00:25:32,059 --> 00:25:38,440
Sunday afternoon for a full hour about

00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:38,440
all the technical details

00:25:45,909 --> 00:25:59,570
and can Danielle DaSilva move to the

00:25:49,760 --> 00:26:02,809
stage please yeah my name is woolen

00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:05,929
Wagner so I'm the other Rowland what

00:26:02,809 --> 00:26:09,230
just will an orbit announced my question

00:26:05,929 --> 00:26:12,710
was about the derived work issue about

00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:16,159
the CID plan and see I've mentioned you

00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:19,880
have started also with SNCF on existing

00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:23,750
cat plans and you took them in the

00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:25,010
background and so one thing is sometimes

00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:27,500
they are not available as you said

00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:29,809
that's why these leader approaches or

00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:32,590
like this distort are very cheap now are

00:26:29,809 --> 00:26:35,240
quite good to start Moritz on scratch

00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:38,900
second question is about is there a kind

00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:43,400
of experience about the licenses because

00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:49,270
it's direct let's say derived work you

00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:49,270
use geocoded digitalize it in a way

00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:56,000
evacuation maps is exactly this was a

00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:58,789
very classical point where is it you

00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,669
find them everywhere but the riot who

00:26:58,789 --> 00:27:04,880
owns the property was always a big

00:27:01,669 --> 00:27:08,080
barrier to derive this work

00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:10,789
did you go to experiences on that point

00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:13,159
I don't have so much experience I know

00:27:10,789 --> 00:27:15,710
this is an issue to whether we can use

00:27:13,159 --> 00:27:18,530
it effectively evacuation maps and the

00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:22,090
main thing is I also only mapping public

00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:27,039
areas and also some concern about

00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:30,010
providing data in the sort of a security

00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:33,679
paranoia we are at the moment and

00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:35,360
something difficult but we had the

00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:38,240
luxury to get architects pencils that

00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:40,940
help and I know I've been map have been

00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:43,429
mapping into evacuation maps but maybe I

00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:46,010
shouldn't be doing it well I think the

00:27:43,429 --> 00:27:48,559
legal point is very different it's an

00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:50,360
absolute critical legal point it's not

00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:54,559
the technical point it's modern

00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:56,029
I agree yeah very about us thank you

00:27:54,559 --> 00:28:05,019
okay thank you very much let's thank our

00:27:56,029 --> 00:28:05,019
