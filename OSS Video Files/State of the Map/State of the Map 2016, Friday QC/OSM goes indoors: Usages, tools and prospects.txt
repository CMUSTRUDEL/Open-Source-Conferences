Over the last two years a lot of indoor mapping activity has been going on in France. All Paris train stations have been mapped to great details, along with shopping malls, museums and universities. A number of tools and techniques have been developed to assist mappers and visualize indoor maps. To name a few: iD-indoor, OpenLevelUp, a DIY 360Â° camera kit and indoor localisation script.

Through this talk we will highlight some of the best accomplishments and describe innovative tools and techniques. We will share some implications and concerns, on the map, on the tools, on the community.
