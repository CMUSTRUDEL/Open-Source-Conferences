How did we classify the 48 million roofs in France by their orientation and shape with minimum effort and time? First, we designed a gamified crowdsourcing platform to manually classify about 10,000 roofs. Then we used standard machine learning techniques (logistic regression and deep learning) to train an automated classifier. Applications include potential estimation of vegetalization and solar energy. The approach to augmenting human contribution impact with image processing techniques could be applied to a wide range of problems.

okay good morning ladies and gentlemen

00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:07,259
welcome in the first session of the

00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:11,040
morning I'm introducing you Michelle

00:00:07,259 --> 00:01:01,609
Blanca will be be our first speaker of

00:00:11,040 --> 00:01:01,609
the morning al applause please thank you

00:01:02,539 --> 00:01:10,619
hello everybody so I Misha Branca I'm a

00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:13,470
data scientist at eight a lab so to keep

00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:16,350
short it a lab is the French Prime

00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:19,229
Minister stacks the task force for open

00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:21,720
that up and go open government open

00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:25,759
source and data sense and we like

00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:33,079
projects that combine several aspects

00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:38,939
and as you will see opens alarm app is a

00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:44,310
all at once because we want we make open

00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:48,540
source code that build open data using

00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:51,560
data science contributing to a better

00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:58,009
awareness of

00:01:51,560 --> 00:02:01,720
of energy management so what what is

00:01:58,009 --> 00:02:07,789
open a map it's a roof orientation map

00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:13,760
so it aims to distinguish north-south

00:02:07,789 --> 00:02:19,540
orientation to flat roof to east-west

00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:23,030
orientation but what for it's for

00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:26,330
estimation of solar energy pattern but

00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:29,660
ensure because you cannot put solar

00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:35,600
panels on every roof you you have you

00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:38,900
prefer north-south orientation and you

00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:43,489
can do rooftop greening only on flat

00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:45,830
rooftops and what which data are do we

00:02:43,489 --> 00:02:51,170
use a satellite images and calloused

00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:59,090
it's a map in France used for a tax

00:02:51,170 --> 00:03:03,019
system if you want to use if you want to

00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:08,720
use machine learning on images typically

00:03:03,019 --> 00:03:12,530
you you need a training set of several

00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:16,910
thousand images and then you can

00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:19,459
generate on new images but building a

00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:22,160
training set usually the pain because

00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:24,980
you either have to do is walk yourself

00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:29,329
which is quite boring if you do it alone

00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:31,940
or you can pay people to do it in Amazon

00:03:29,329 --> 00:03:38,109
Mechanical Turk or other platforms but

00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:44,239
it's really not why not come either

00:03:38,109 --> 00:03:49,420
usually but Christian quest other idea

00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:49,420
to do to build crowdsourcing platform

00:03:49,569 --> 00:03:55,870
where so you can go to open salamat dot

00:03:53,989 --> 00:03:59,890
org and you have a

00:03:55,870 --> 00:04:04,450
is this page this web page and you can

00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:08,730
click choose the class of the roof first

00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:13,510
class is a north-south orientation

00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:18,729
second is east-west third is a flat roof

00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:23,250
and the fourth class is a every roof

00:04:18,729 --> 00:04:23,250
that is complicated or you don't know

00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:33,130
here are a few example you can see that

00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:37,810
some are easy like the first one and the

00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:49,840
top but some are very complicated and we

00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:53,289
cannot always decide next we after

00:04:49,840 --> 00:05:00,210
having built constable training data

00:04:53,289 --> 00:05:05,620
sets of like 10,000 roof in three weeks

00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:11,070
we decided to use automated learning to

00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:13,780
to generalize and you may think that

00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:17,770
machine learning is very complicated on

00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:20,560
the only for specialist in fact nor now

00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:24,190
a lot of algorithms are very well

00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:28,289
packaged and you can you can use it very

00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:30,910
easily like we used two algorithms

00:05:28,289 --> 00:05:34,750
logistic regression and neural networks

00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:38,349
and to use logistic regression you'd

00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:42,490
basically just have to import the model

00:05:38,349 --> 00:05:47,889
and use it on your data so it's

00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:53,590
literally three lines of code and neural

00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:56,229
networks it's the same thing i just

00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:59,470
downloaded a snippet on the internet i

00:05:56,229 --> 00:06:03,580
changed one parameter you can see the

00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:06,639
red box on the top and I changed a few

00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:08,680
layers but it's very light the

00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:12,060
work is very light compared to the

00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:16,389
engineering work used to build this net

00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:19,029
so it's easier to use it than to build

00:06:16,389 --> 00:06:23,650
it but it's it's very well for

00:06:19,029 --> 00:06:27,960
applications and if you want to know

00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:31,810
more I've returned some technical

00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:37,509
expectations on the on the blog of the

00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:47,979
team it's in French but if you're

00:06:37,509 --> 00:06:52,689
interested and speak French so what the

00:06:47,979 --> 00:06:56,979
quality of the prediction or baseline

00:06:52,689 --> 00:07:01,300
you or human baseline makes between one

00:06:56,979 --> 00:07:08,159
on for a percent of euros depending of

00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:14,370
the mood on for classes who you can see

00:07:08,159 --> 00:07:19,930
the results of the automated learning is

00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:25,479
is not as as good but you don't always

00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:30,250
want a very good precision in your

00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:33,879
applications here it's enough to have a

00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:39,120
eighty percent of correct classification

00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:39,120
because we still get new information and

00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:50,710
we can we can analyze the results here

00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:56,199
so here you have a map of the percentage

00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:59,860
of one kind of proof compared to the

00:07:56,199 --> 00:08:03,000
other kind and the first kind is better

00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:08,490
for the solar panel implementation and

00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:12,779
you can you can make an observation some

00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:12,779
regions are much

00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:20,970
have much more potential for solar panel

00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:24,680
implantation and you can see some

00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:33,390
geographical features like the wanna

00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:39,469
hear you you can see and you have in big

00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:43,289
cities you can have very extreme values

00:08:39,469 --> 00:08:46,940
so this is a valuable information for

00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:51,330
public policies because if you want to

00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:54,810
to give money to help Solar implantation

00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:57,810
maybe you prefer to do it on good

00:08:54,810 --> 00:09:01,320
regions on the region where the

00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:05,610
potential is high compared to regions

00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:08,880
where the potential is very low and for

00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:13,710
rooftop greenings we have a similar map

00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:18,720
you can find that the proportion of flat

00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:29,990
roofs is higher on big cities and in the

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:33,480
Paris region too so here we used only

00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:37,070
basic machine learning techniques with

00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:40,050
no complicated

00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:43,620
techniques it was a very light project

00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:47,870
because we quote sourced the training

00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:51,300
set and we use only the first available

00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:58,589
standard technique and we get valuable

00:09:51,300 --> 00:10:01,310
information for public policies and our

00:09:58,589 --> 00:10:07,380
project interested some other project

00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:10,920
wizard as a winner of of Congress by

00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:15,330
fujitsu was a rigid realization of a

00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:18,750
pensare map it linked solar exposure in

00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:24,779
France with altitude data and open Salah

00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:29,130
map database and the same challenge was

00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:33,900
used for the selection phase of the data

00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:37,050
sent game this year the data science

00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:41,520
game is a is an international

00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:47,520
competition for students in data science

00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:50,940
field and with the work of the teams the

00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:58,400
error right dropped from twenty percent

00:10:50,940 --> 00:11:03,270
to thirteen percent so now we can have a

00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:09,690
even better data with more complicated

00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:14,089
models and it paves the way to new

00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:17,150
challenges like the same way you could

00:11:14,089 --> 00:11:24,360
automatically detect bus lines or

00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:29,480
special lanes pedestrian crossings maybe

00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:34,380
classify buildings in unmatched area

00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:38,880
have classification of land use when the

00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:42,130
cadastre or other maps are not precise

00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:45,760
enough and maybe

00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:51,160
a lot of other applications we we

00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:53,500
haven't thought yet so thank you for

00:11:51,160 --> 00:12:10,510
your attention and if you have a

00:11:53,500 --> 00:12:12,700
question sir than thursday yes the full

00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:16,060
congratulation for the idea in the

00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:18,900
project I would have would trick

00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:22,060
question but I forgot one of them so too

00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:25,860
first of all images that you are using

00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:32,410
from what is the size of the image

00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:38,170
typically it's 100 pixel x 100 but I

00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:42,250
will sign them to fit an exact style

00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:45,640
that is neither mine nor network you can

00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:51,700
see the parameters are modified one side

00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:54,400
so it's 996 by next a great indoors like

00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:58,180
are you using like Bing good images on a

00:12:54,400 --> 00:13:01,930
box images or romantic images on the big

00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:06,460
thing for my box because we gathered

00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:11,370
over 1 million image by the API thank

00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:11,370
you ok because this is why

00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:35,720
thank you my name is the recent allah

00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:37,670
azza from Statistics Canada I am

00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:40,459
interested in in the crowd sourcing

00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:44,769
experience of your project you can

00:13:40,459 --> 00:13:44,769
elaborate a little bit more on that and

00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:52,550
be how that happened how many people did

00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:58,579
engage maybe a Christian is a vesicle

00:13:52,550 --> 00:14:02,149
son to to to answer a question I the

00:13:58,579 --> 00:14:05,720
project has been a started and it took

00:14:02,149 --> 00:14:09,440
different steps first I proposed the

00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:11,630
idea to an open that a contest and the

00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:14,060
idea has been selected so I got some

00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:16,850
money for that once you get so much okay

00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:21,019
I need to make it not just as an ideal

00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:23,660
make something so we wait for the next

00:14:21,019 --> 00:14:27,470
step took place during a rocket on about

00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:32,990
climate change for the cop21 in in Paris

00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:36,589
and in one day we wrote the small piece

00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:40,250
of front-end and back-end who have the

00:14:36,589 --> 00:14:42,680
crowdsourcing thing we just sent a few

00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:46,490
emails on the French Open Street Map

00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:48,670
mailing list of few tweets and within us

00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:51,890
I think it was two months we had the

00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:54,250
100,000 contribution so it helps

00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:59,390
creating the first that I said that then

00:14:54,250 --> 00:15:02,260
Michelle used and it's really fun to see

00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:05,690
all the steps one after the other and

00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:08,060
the ideas at the beginning at that open

00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:10,160
data contest there was the first step

00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:12,860
was to select the buildings more or less

00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:16,190
matching the Cardinal orientation and

00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:18,380
then the idea of having crowdsourcing

00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:20,720
interface and then the idea to have a

00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:24,410
neural network to to train a neural

00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:26,329
network but then we did more because the

00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:29,110
first result from the neural network

00:15:26,329 --> 00:15:31,790
from Michele I I put that as

00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:35,150
contributions in the crowd sourcing

00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:37,340
thing as one or two control

00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:39,350
contribution waiting for other people to

00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:44,720
confirm the neural network so you see

00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:47,390
you can do the mix between machine

00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,400
learning and crowdsourcing and unions

00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:52,670
and I think it's really interesting we

00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:54,260
can really reuse it for many things one

00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:56,900
thing that Michelle did not say is that

00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:59,120
once we have enough information about

00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:00,440
the roof orientation of the building we

00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:07,520
push the information back in

00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:11,450
OpenStreetMap of course I remember the

00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:13,790
data set the trained data said first of

00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:17,480
all is available can we use it and

00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:19,160
second with the data set do you know how

00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:22,430
clickable is like if I want to do it for

00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:24,560
Romania would it walked always kind of

00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:28,970
so many particular differences between

00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:32,750
them first you can find the training

00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:44,410
data set on data.gov that effort is a

00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:48,800
French platform for open data yeah and n

00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:53,270
second if you can replicate this project

00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:57,080
on Romania if you have satellite imagery

00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:59,930
and Cadiz it means the boundaries of the

00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:06,530
buildings yes you can reuse my code on

00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:09,050
the improv it and the office maybe maybe

00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:10,640
using with toys and more building yes

00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:12,650
they're building equal house or

00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:15,040
something in fact that's what we use the

00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:18,200
the thing is that in France we are

00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:23,780
importing the cast building footprints

00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:27,410
in osm but i extracted the footprints

00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:30,080
from osm so that I have the the GID of

00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:34,150
the object new sm so we can put back the

00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,150
information in in OpenStreetMap

00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:59,310
thank you that's up okay I do research

00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:04,950
in remote sensing and I want to know

00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:08,160
please for me Solar elimination is a big

00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:12,630
factor when you do machine learning so I

00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:15,390
don't know is your model checking

00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:19,260
account Solar elimination variation

00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:22,350
depending on whether and how much it's

00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:25,320
affect the results the final result of

00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:30,510
your model we thought about that but we

00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:33,300
don't have the date of the photo of the

00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:35,520
satellite image so we don't have that

00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:39,240
information yeah we don't have the

00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:44,010
information about what the shadows son

00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:47,940
or Sarai so now we can you cannot choose

00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:50,400
it did you manage to use another source

00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:55,850
of that are to get more accurate

00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:58,860
information three yes no it didn't but

00:18:55,850 --> 00:19:02,960
the aim of the project was to be the

00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:06,870
light as possible it's impossible so to

00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:11,220
to show that you can produce valuable

00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:14,940
information using very very few work so

00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:18,150
we didn't link to other data but it

00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:21,270
could be very useful to to take the

00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:24,570
project as it is now on to improve it

00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:26,700
like the data science game did so you

00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:28,860
think it will be better if you have this

00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:31,170
information for you yeah if you add some

00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:34,890
more information you will have a better

00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:38,130
results for example one of the eye dr

00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:40,590
proposed to michelle east we know more

00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:43,500
or less the orientation but we have no

00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:46,770
information about the angle and i said

00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:49,290
but when the roof is really flat the

00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:53,250
contrast between the two sides of the

00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:55,160
the roof r is very does not a lot of

00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:57,860
contrast but when it's

00:19:55,160 --> 00:20:01,640
I angle you have higher contrast could

00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:04,190
we detect more or less the angle using

00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:07,420
that information we have not worked on

00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:10,580
that but it's an idea so it's really a

00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:12,890
step-by-step project so what's the next

00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:15,230
step we don't know but we okay if you

00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:17,950
have ideas I have some ideas if you have

00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:17,950
ideas it's fine

00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:40,110
hi I'm I found it very interesting that

00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:43,180
that you had lots of these roofs

00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:45,040
north-south I guess for example in north

00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:48,400
west of France and on the southern coast

00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:50,410
can you can you do you have any

00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:53,530
explanation of why why that might be

00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:55,300
historically speaking any any insight

00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:58,210
anything you you thought about that yeah

00:20:55,300 --> 00:21:02,040
in fact uh I don't know myself but I

00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:05,980
would like to talk with somebody with

00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:07,960
geographical skills to explain to

00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:10,630
correlate the these results with

00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:14,320
geographical features in France it would

00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:17,920
be very interesting possible

00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:21,400
explanations is a in the south part you

00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:24,340
try not to ask too much Sun in your ass

00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:28,600
because it's an odd part of the country

00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:30,070
and in Britain it's not that hot so

00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:32,560
you're happy to have seen in your

00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:34,840
 you maybe you're facing your

00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:37,870
windows are facing more sauce or

00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:40,690
something like that that's a maybe an

00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:44,860
exhibition in may come also from the

00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:49,360
wind the wind is usually blowing from

00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:51,820
west in retain and I wind in the Rhone

00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:54,520
Valley are blowing from north so maybe

00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:57,670
the orientation of the buildings is also

00:21:54,520 --> 00:22:00,790
linked to that it could be interesting

00:21:57,670 --> 00:22:02,980
to mix with weather information to see

00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:07,000
if we have a relation but i think the

00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:10,450
relations are something like that one

00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:13,750
question did you ever try to filter this

00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:15,370
data by christian churches because they

00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:20,500
are all or it should all be orientated

00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:22,750
east-west just as an idea filter is what

00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:25,150
takes you like own filter this but only

00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:27,190
buildings which are churches and then

00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:29,140
see if it if it's really true that

00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:34,300
christian churches are always oriented

00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:38,050
eastern okay they they are not and and

00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:40,360
their roof are usually complex so it

00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:42,620
fells in the false cattery with the

00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:51,050
question mark because you have

00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:53,059
complicated rules yes unfortunately we

00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:54,530
have to proceed to the next speaker

00:22:53,059 --> 00:22:56,390
we're running out of time and we have to

00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:58,730
keep the tight schedule if you have any

00:22:56,390 --> 00:23:01,040
more questions peacefully to add them to

00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:06,430
the speaker directly during the break at

00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:06,430
