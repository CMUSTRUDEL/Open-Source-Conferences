Title: Converting a regular carto project to vector tiles: OSM-carto case study
Publication date: 2016-10-17

This talk explains how we in Geofabrik ported the openstreetmap-carto style from regular image tiles to vectortiles backed raster tiles. OSM-carto is a very complicated, and detailed style, and rendering raster images from a vector tile source with mapnik is not as easy as just changing the source. This talk explains those differences and how to overcome them, so you can port your regular style to vector tiles.

okay guys we're very sorry for the delay

00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:06,420
but I'm very happy that you all

00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:10,290
patiently waited for us entrusted in us

00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:12,059
I present you yogi who is going to talk

00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:14,370
about vector tiles we had a talk about

00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:15,870
vector tiles this morning and we'll have

00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:27,750
a second one now it seems it's some

00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:32,009
quite a thing sorry about the technical

00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:38,879
details and how's that max can't read

00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:41,219
USB fat32 thing and so we're too late

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,899
I'm going to talk to you about and dr.

00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:44,430
Charles it's quite helpful there's

00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:48,270
already been a talk about vector tiles

00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:50,219
because yes that's a good introduction

00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:53,520
so I don't really need to explain a lot

00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:55,879
of the details with that this will be a

00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,680
little bit more of a technical talk and

00:00:55,879 --> 00:01:01,980
a bit more you know presuming you know a

00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:03,989
bit about map styling and avocado and

00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:07,170
that kind of thing and obviously vector

00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:11,250
tiles but I refer you to Lucas SP talked

00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:12,659
earlier about that yes so I'm a

00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:18,420
Rocketeer fabric here's a record house

00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:20,130
talk yes right so the titles are

00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,420
supporting the open sumach artists are

00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:27,689
into vector tiles because it's currently

00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:28,890
done in the non vectors house right okay

00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:31,320
presuming you know about vector tiles

00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:32,759
and a cartel style it's been around a

00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:39,450
while it's the main one that's on the

00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:43,860
offensive map org website and yes it's

00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:49,049
very complicated and so the goal was to

00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:52,939
ported to vector tiles not to have you

00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:55,770
know client-side rendering with and

00:01:52,939 --> 00:01:57,899
JavaScript based off but instead to have

00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:01,409
essentially the same API as what's there

00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:06,540
now namely raster images served over

00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:08,700
HTTP so that from the client endpoint it

00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:11,410
would look the same except it's all made

00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:14,920
with vector tiles in the background

00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:17,440
why would you want to do that it makes

00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:18,940
it much easier to change the style if

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,630
you want to make a little tweak for one

00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:25,660
person or one thing you don't have to

00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:27,850
you know pre-render all your tiles and

00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:31,050
have tens of gigabytes of stuff because

00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:32,950
very few of the when you have the the

00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:35,230
when you're serving tiles you don't

00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:37,780
serve them all straight from the

00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:41,680
database so you could turn off certain

00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:44,940
features or change the language and so

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:48,040
first thing you have to do is porters

00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:49,720
so the basic bit to get started when

00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:54,610
you're using the o consumer cartel style

00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:56,230
is you can just use Tamil or cosmetic or

00:02:54,610 --> 00:03:01,090
something like that and you can you can

00:02:56,230 --> 00:03:03,250
clone the the clone the github thing and

00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:05,650
just start changing yourself if you're

00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:08,350
using addy okay I just got like a raster

00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:11,200
tile but mmm for like old-style

00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:13,600
yeah there's a lot of JavaScript based

00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:16,450
stuff and for rendering and working with

00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:18,790
vector tiles and in when I was playing I

00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:21,850
saw cosmetic can render the old stuff

00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:25,210
and it can also render and weight vector

00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:26,080
tiles and I was using tile log based

00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:29,170
program called

00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,180
Terra which you know run on the ground

00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:35,860
line and you can render things vector

00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:40,510
toss so the first thing you need to do

00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:43,420
is split it in half with an old student

00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:45,450
start old school way you have one

00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:48,100
project that and queries the database

00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:50,800
converts the data into images and serve

00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:54,420
the images up with vector tiles you

00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:56,560
basically have to you have one way that

00:03:54,420 --> 00:04:01,270
queries the database and produces a

00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:03,070
vector tile and bTW tiles and then you

00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:05,980
have another project that takes that

00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:10,150
data or those files and renders it into

00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:11,500
in this case raster image in and if

00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:13,180
you're doing a client-side you're only

00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:16,330
doing the the first step and then your

00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:20,109
second step of turning the vector tile

00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:21,880
into an image is basically done in in

00:04:20,109 --> 00:04:22,780
JavaScript or whatever particular thing

00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:25,370
you're using

00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:28,220
so is the source under style at the

00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:30,110
source makes the vector tiles and the

00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:35,810
Styles tells the vector tiles into

00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:39,710
images so we have to take the existing

00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:41,780
one and turn it half split in half if

00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:43,910
source file just has one file called

00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:48,410
data llamo and it is you can basically

00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:52,400
copy the project llamo from the objec

00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:56,150
artist up and tweak it so the tweaks you

00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:59,420
need to do you need to rename and then

00:04:56,150 --> 00:05:02,300
you change your zoom to 14 and then you

00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:03,920
can optionally remove your although I

00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:05,450
think source you might not have that and

00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:07,640
then the Styles because you don't need

00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:10,100
that so that is the soluble left with

00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:16,070
pasties doodles of SQL queries which is

00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:21,350
what converts your data this style has

00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:25,670
your MSS files and your you have a

00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:28,310
project or yml and you change your

00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:29,840
source to point to where your sources or

00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:32,390
you had a source and that'll be like a

00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,430
URL type thing with the tile Jason or

00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:35,750
something like that

00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:39,500
Annoying bit as you can see is you have

00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:47,060
dot yml not dot why am L which is what

00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:48,290
is in the abstract and that's not all

00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:53,120
you need to do because that would be a

00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:57,160
very short talk mostly so basically this

00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:59,870
talk is mostly what do you do next

00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:02,480
yes I probably said this is obviously if

00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:04,280
you have an existing cartel style and

00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:07,700
you want to vector tile afire this is

00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:10,720
kind of the talk you would want what you

00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:13,130
get is something that looks like this

00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:16,610
there should be roads there there are no

00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:19,370
roads and then if you zoom in so this is

00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:23,930
Dublin you get lots of extraneous stuff

00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:25,430
and lots of missing stuff and this is

00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:30,530
what you need to fix because you can't

00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:31,850
just copy it so left is the output and

00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:35,210
the right is the what it should look

00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:38,670
like you've got arrows you can't use

00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:39,900
classes and Carter classes on vector

00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:42,150
trials they kind of just get lost

00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:43,350
somewhere along the way and that's why

00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:47,700
you don't have any roads because they

00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:48,960
are used for rendering the roads so the

00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:52,280
first thing you need to do is go through

00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:56,580
your style and replace them all with

00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:59,250
your and it's with hash IDs instead of

00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:00,480
dot class not so bad for the awesome

00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:02,040
Carter because there's a lot of sort of

00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:05,700
one-to-one or like one to two so you can

00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:07,140
just find it and price that this is

00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:11,700
another big problem you're going to have

00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:15,110
with with vector tiles is this is a

00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:15,110
national park and there's a green

00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:23,730
there's borders in the middle of your

00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:28,140
tiles you solve this with and then I can

00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:34,050
sit on you have to solve this with a

00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:36,030
buffer for style when you have vector

00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:38,100
tiles you take one tile of data and you

00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:41,280
style that and that is all you see

00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:43,380
essentially and you render from that but

00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,960
you that is sometimes not depending on

00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:48,630
how you set up your style like this it's

00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:52,950
not always going to work so the problem

00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:55,050
is we have a a green polygon here and we

00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:56,250
have some black vector tiles and we want

00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:58,320
to render it and we want to draw a

00:07:56,250 --> 00:08:01,710
little outline border which is in the

00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:08,090
green and it gets split because you you

00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:11,180
get your you get your data and produce

00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:13,680
and in your SQL queries will produce

00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:15,330
data for each tile and then you render

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,400
and when you say draw a line around the

00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:19,680
outside well as far as each tile is

00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:22,290
concerned the outside is at the edge of

00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:25,410
the tile and you get lines through the

00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:28,200
middle and you get this which is that's

00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:34,010
a nice thing the solution you have to do

00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:37,740
is change your style to put a pixel size

00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:43,470
which expands the data for each tile

00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:44,329
around into an outside land and it only

00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:47,779
displays

00:08:44,329 --> 00:08:49,549
- bit inside the black so it clips it

00:08:47,779 --> 00:08:53,209
and then you get a properly rendered

00:08:49,549 --> 00:08:54,739
image for you're doing polygons you can

00:08:53,209 --> 00:08:55,759
get private very small one of about four

00:08:54,739 --> 00:08:57,559
pixels or so but when you're doing

00:08:55,759 --> 00:09:02,299
labels you do you have a big one are not

00:08:57,559 --> 00:09:04,670
stupid pattern of ish typo another

00:09:02,299 --> 00:09:07,429
solution instead of giving the rendering

00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:10,549
a image polygons you can give it a

00:09:07,429 --> 00:09:14,059
boundary as a way and then you are not

00:09:10,549 --> 00:09:15,230
telling map Nick how to render a you

00:09:14,059 --> 00:09:17,239
know telling map like to draw a border

00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:20,029
around a polygon you instead giving us a

00:09:17,239 --> 00:09:22,429
line you're saying draw this line you do

00:09:20,029 --> 00:09:25,639
that way interested way and I do do it

00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:26,989
in one case for this but you have to be

00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:29,540
careful thing but the problem you're

00:09:26,989 --> 00:09:32,209
going to have is a polygon labels the

00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:33,559
left is the nave view and often you do

00:09:32,209 --> 00:09:39,639
nothing and the right is what it should

00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:39,639
look like public theater has many border

00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:47,239
its labels four times similar problem

00:09:43,989 --> 00:09:49,279
you give math Nick a green border a

00:09:47,239 --> 00:09:50,540
green polygons you say put a label here

00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,119
and he'll pick say a point in the middle

00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:56,509
because when you're using meta tiles it

00:09:52,119 --> 00:09:58,819
makes it all into into and it's able to

00:09:56,509 --> 00:10:01,160
look across the other borders it splits

00:09:58,819 --> 00:10:04,790
it it goes here's four polygons let's

00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:08,749
make let's put a label in each one and

00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:12,679
so that's why you get for labeling a

00:10:08,749 --> 00:10:18,079
label in each trial um this happens a

00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:19,459
lot address points etc yeah just

00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:23,269
summarizes what was on the other one so

00:10:19,459 --> 00:10:26,959
you have to change your data and to not

00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:29,299
give math Nick a polygon but a point and

00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:33,589
you say here's a point to draw a label

00:10:29,299 --> 00:10:37,579
here and then you are converting it into

00:10:33,589 --> 00:10:41,839
an SQL AUP so you convert an SQL iniki's

00:10:37,579 --> 00:10:43,369
at a point and yeah so that means you

00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:46,790
only get one point instead of one for

00:10:43,369 --> 00:10:51,529
each tile you can get with a simple post

00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:53,209
gist of centroid and the like and do so

00:10:51,529 --> 00:10:57,920
but

00:10:53,209 --> 00:11:01,600
but that has a problem that you can't

00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:03,649
necessarily use Postgres indexes so you

00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,269
because you've changed your SQL query

00:11:03,649 --> 00:11:07,910
and that'll make everything really slow

00:11:05,269 --> 00:11:11,059
which is horrible so you can solve that

00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:12,769
by changing your SQL to put a where

00:11:11,059 --> 00:11:16,790
clause in there and that's Louie at

00:11:12,769 --> 00:11:18,379
geometric quick boundary bucks great and

00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:20,600
then map postcards can go away I can use

00:11:18,379 --> 00:11:24,050
an index and that's fine or you can make

00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:25,999
an index similar to that the other

00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:28,009
problem you're going to have is labels

00:11:25,999 --> 00:11:30,529
won't necessarily work you will get this

00:11:28,009 --> 00:11:32,920
where Wicklow Mountains National Park is

00:11:30,529 --> 00:11:36,769
what it should say and it is clipped

00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:38,959
similar problem we have polygons we have

00:11:36,769 --> 00:11:41,059
the point and it wants to draw the name

00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,860
and it goes each tile is rendered

00:11:41,059 --> 00:11:44,600
separately and yet the other tiles don't

00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:48,019
have a point so you only see the first

00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:51,290
few characters so you get this which is

00:11:48,019 --> 00:11:54,379
not so nice solution use very big buffer

00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:59,240
and it each neighboring tile will have

00:11:54,379 --> 00:12:01,670
the next one so that's a summary of the

00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:04,819
fixes you need to do this same problem

00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:06,619
happens with lines and like label

00:12:04,819 --> 00:12:10,579
placements at hand for refs and shield

00:12:06,619 --> 00:12:16,549
syllables she feels like you know for a

00:12:10,579 --> 00:12:18,889
to zooms the data gets simplified in

00:12:16,549 --> 00:12:21,920
vector tiles and so when you're using

00:12:18,889 --> 00:12:24,470
use zoom fit zoom 15 and so forth used

00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:26,809
in 14 levels so they get simplified and

00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:29,119
everything looks with rubbish see your

00:12:26,809 --> 00:12:30,980
source needs to have a maxim and that

00:12:29,119 --> 00:12:33,049
way map Nick knows I'm at the maximum

00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:37,519
zoom I won't do any simplification and

00:12:33,049 --> 00:12:39,649
that's half your problem you need to do

00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:43,670
I tried to do a quick hack don't do

00:12:39,649 --> 00:12:46,100
quick hacks they don't work so next

00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:48,829
problem all your vector your data might

00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:49,939
say uh this we don't need to have you

00:12:48,829 --> 00:12:52,279
know we don't need address points at

00:12:49,939 --> 00:12:55,040
zoom level 14 except that zoom level 14

00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:57,049
tiles used for zoom level 17 so you need

00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:59,480
to include a mins you need to change the

00:12:57,049 --> 00:13:03,949
min zoom on all your layers so that it

00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:04,950
will include the data way pixels don't

00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:09,390
work

00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:11,610
because each each zoom the way pixel is

00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:17,630
cut they it's like the area and it is

00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:20,880
calculated for each layer and but it is

00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:25,290
each zoom say 15 tile using the data

00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:27,600
from zoom 14 which is not very nice so

00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:29,670
you need to basically expand your style

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,150
to include all these manually calculated

00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:35,790
weight pixels which is a bit annoying oh

00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:37,230
yeah if you're using node map Nick it

00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:38,700
does silly things where it basically

00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:40,110
goes give me all the world all the

00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:42,450
buildings in the world are ordered by

00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:43,830
area and then give me the first five so

00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:46,160
I can tell you that it's a polygon type

00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:48,330
and then that takes the HSN very slow

00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:51,360
which you can do by changing the jump

00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:54,300
and I have an Oscar either ever patch to

00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,370
make me fix that so thank you that's

00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:59,670
done because we have not done because

00:13:56,370 --> 00:14:12,120
technical differences so that is has

00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:13,830
been released online and so fin oh I've

00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:15,690
been asked to say there's an OS M carrot

00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:15,930
Oh birds of a feather tomorrow at ten

00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:17,900
o'clock

00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:20,010
so if you're injured more not to do this

00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:21,630
all right we have time for some

00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:24,270
questions about this very new and

00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:27,710
interesting thing called the vector

00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:29,010
tiles any questions raise your hand yes

00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:32,100
question

00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:34,680
first Oh is the other all these flights

00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:36,900
published anywhere sorry are the other

00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:39,360
slides published anywhere not yet

00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:44,010
probability yes please yes cuz some

00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:48,560
information there yeah alright another

00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:48,560
question raise your hand in front here

00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:57,090
you touch you touched on the issue of

00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:58,740
buffer I'm sorry could I ask to keep

00:14:57,090 --> 00:15:06,870
quiet for a while we are still asking

00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:09,780
questions guys in the back you touched

00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:12,630
on the issue of consistency of labels

00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:16,620
with line strings but you didn't explain

00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:19,350
what you did to solve that issue so like

00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:20,550
rogue labels right so there's there's

00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:23,400
two things that could be there and

00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:26,370
consistency of labels with roads the

00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:28,890
buffer makes it sort of you know not be

00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:30,720
cut in half across the tile border which

00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:33,360
is one of the most obvious if you don't

00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:36,360
do that it will obviously look wrong you

00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:39,090
can get cases where you get sort of more

00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:40,950
Road labels than you would want I've

00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:42,950
just kind of ignored that as a sort of

00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:45,240
like okay it's not great technic

00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:47,610
cartographically but it's not totally

00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:50,940
horrible and the only other real

00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:53,220
solution is to change your query to

00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:54,870
return to take a loin and return points

00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:56,490
along the the midpoint and put your

00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:58,920
labels there which you can do but that's

00:15:56,490 --> 00:16:01,770
a little bit more complicated so I took

00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:06,300
the easy where and how do you find

00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:12,480
keeping in sync with upstream which is a

00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:15,030
very active project not so bad a lot of

00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:17,580
the cases you change like say I've

00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:19,200
changed the SQL query so whenever

00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:22,200
there's an SQL query intact the get

00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:24,180
merge doesn't work not not too bad not

00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:27,030
just you know there's only about a half

00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:30,540
a dozen yeah changes that I have to make

00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:31,140
so it kind of it's okay as good as can

00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:33,060
be expected

00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:37,170
alright we have time for a last question

00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:40,470
please raise your hand if you have a

00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:43,680
question about your vector tiles this is

00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:46,589
your time yeah I can go and

00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:49,940
Cuffy or something no more all right you

00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:49,940
