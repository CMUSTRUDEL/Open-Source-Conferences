Pathways, biking routes, field roads or shortcuts: these are everyday features whom we rarely contemplate on. Yet what we consider self-evident, often stays invisible. Trage Wegen (literally ‘association for slow roads’) is an organization that celebrates these hidden gems, suitable for pedestrians and bikers.

Trage Wegen, who have been working on government projects since 2013, will unravel their methodology of working with OSM-data. Their focus lies in making the walking-experience in Brussels more pleasant and easy. As a supporter of open data as a way of unlocking information, they are both a user and contributor to OSM – living proof of the necessity of OSM in making exciting things happen.

	00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:09,960
hello good morning my talk wouldn't be

00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:12,120
that technical as the one before when we

00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:15,900
heard about that certain came to Belgium

00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:18,119
we were very glad and when the call for

00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,340
proposals came to us one of my

00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:23,640
colleagues said why don't we write a

00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:27,480
love letter to over them because we like

00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:29,160
it very much in our daily use so I'm not

00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,520
that good and writing love letters work

00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,200
I give it a try when preparing this talk

00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,350
I was thinking when did we fall in love

00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:40,530
with the OpenStreetMap it was I think

00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:42,660
some five six years ago but it was not

00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:45,750
love at first sight it was more like

00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:48,329
nice interesting maybe we could do

00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:52,289
something with it but when the years

00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:54,539
went by we we like Oak Street Map more

00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:57,210
and more and at the given point you and

00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:59,820
you realize it not just interest it's

00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:03,210
more you rely on each other you see each

00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:05,850
other every day we began to believe in

00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:11,430
OpenStreetMap as one of the biggest

00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:14,189
comments in at this moment so maybe it

00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:17,000
could be love to openstreetmap because

00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:21,119
we are also going over comments comments

00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:25,439
of freak parts so until here at the love

00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:28,680
story who are we we are there are we

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:31,079
literally translated as slow roads we

00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,090
are going over public pots we are a

00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:35,009
nonprofit organization that stands for

00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:38,340
the public right of ways and Flanders

00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:40,259
and in Brussels without going in detail

00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:44,399
we want to try to preserve the old

00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:48,060
footways like we always say using a pot

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:52,200
as preserving that part and often used

00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:54,390
parts needs less maintenance but like

00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,399
you may think we are not only active in

00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:58,020
the countryside we also have activities

00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:03,509
in the cities and now we didn't paint

00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:06,810
that but besides the old roads we look

00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:11,640
we looking further the world changes

00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:13,910
constantly Bascombe particle like people

00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:16,110
more specially walking people

00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:19,470
they look always for the most suitable

00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:21,450
track to go from point A to point B if a

00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:23,340
building is getting down and there's

00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:26,430
free space and they can make a shortcut

00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:29,850
they will do it so people design

00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:32,070
elephant parts like this one's not

00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:36,420
designed by special plans but just

00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:40,170
people like you and me and thing is how

00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:42,690
can we let people use those parts at

00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:47,100
both the old ones and the new ones the

00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:49,770
question is simple put them on a map let

00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:52,560
people know where they can find them all

00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:54,989
this the flexibility and the immediate

00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:59,040
result makes openstreetmap a logical

00:02:54,989 --> 00:03:01,440
choice to us besides that a lot of

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:05,220
services both free and commercial rely

00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:07,770
on openstreetmap to make the business so

00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:11,130
we put our business the public plots in

00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:13,470
to openstreetmap so they will be walked

00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:15,300
by and cycled by thousands of

00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:19,500
enthusiasts people every weekend and so

00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:21,989
on but putting things on the map is not

00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:25,950
only one thing we do we do more than

00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:27,870
that we reorganize activities we inform

00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:30,440
people we engage people to stand for the

00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:32,820
rights of free access over common land

00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:35,430
for the people who don't know what's the

00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:38,280
best access for everyone on the thing is

00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:40,080
one of the activities besides that we

00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,299
given from we give formation about

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,950
rights and obligations we help local

00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:46,680
governments to recover and preserve

00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:53,790
public baths so that's what we do and

00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:56,549
one slide one of the many things we do

00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:59,700
is making inventories of the location

00:03:56,549 --> 00:04:03,269
and States the condition of public baths

00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:04,890
we do that by checking of the legal way

00:04:03,269 --> 00:04:07,410
still exists in the field and we are not

00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:10,320
only looking for the ways that exist but

00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:12,660
we also want to know the ways who

00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:16,859
disappeared what is their state because

00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:19,380
maybe we can reopen some of them in the

00:04:16,859 --> 00:04:22,049
early days when making an inventory we

00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:23,849
put it the open ways and to

00:04:22,049 --> 00:04:26,800
openstreetmap by potlatch as an old

00:04:23,849 --> 00:04:28,960
editor I did it

00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,000
after my work in the evening because it

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,669
was fun and we thought we could do it

00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,940
something with it its pleasant but not

00:04:33,669 --> 00:04:42,009
very efficiently so when only I had the

00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:45,699
time I did it so beside us there are

00:04:42,009 --> 00:04:49,690
other professional actors we take care

00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:52,150
of our topic over the time we saw our

00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:53,860
inventories diverged from the others we

00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:55,990
took something else with it they took

00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:59,440
something others with the earthen three

00:04:55,990 --> 00:05:02,139
and over a period of five six years we

00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,930
had over the same topic we had different

00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:07,530
attributes so the five provinces and

00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:10,180
thus we decided to standardize all our

00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:12,909
inventories and to join them together in

00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:17,440
one database it's called the slow route

00:05:12,909 --> 00:05:19,180
registry it was born I think about one

00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,280
year ago it's still a work in progress

00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:25,569
because you have to translate everything

00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:28,120
to the new standard but the important

00:05:25,569 --> 00:05:31,210
thing is it's open data everyone can use

00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:35,529
it as VMs is VFS that can be downloaded

00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:39,370
it can be viewed by geo sm and have and

00:05:35,529 --> 00:05:42,729
other things and from the moment it was

00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:44,770
realised and online we saw on the top

00:05:42,729 --> 00:05:48,610
lists in the community that there was a

00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:51,969
high activity of mapping slur words from

00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:55,750
a local mappers because that was

00:05:51,969 --> 00:05:59,110
possible of open data now one of the

00:05:55,750 --> 00:06:00,969
things on my to-do list here is putting

00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:02,949
those transformations from our

00:06:00,969 --> 00:06:04,960
attributes to the texts used by

00:06:02,949 --> 00:06:08,490
openstreetmap to make the comparison

00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:11,319
easier and add missing tags I know it's

00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:13,659
a little bit where to do but you can

00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:17,289
find them I hope till the end of the

00:06:13,659 --> 00:06:20,710
year at this page now looking back till

00:06:17,289 --> 00:06:25,169
now we noticed we changed from an active

00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:27,190
mapper to as an organization to an

00:06:25,169 --> 00:06:29,259
facilitator and I believe in our

00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:30,879
situation as an organization this is

00:06:29,259 --> 00:06:33,550
more efficiently than putting those

00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:35,469
things ourselves on the map because we

00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:37,719
give it to everybody and there are more

00:06:35,469 --> 00:06:40,110
people who can take care of the those

00:06:37,719 --> 00:06:42,720
data but

00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:46,710
it doesn't stop here we are working on

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:48,470
the feedback too and the project we go

00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:54,000
do in Brussels more about that later

00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:56,430
because we want to know not only if they

00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,750
exist but changes happen people going on

00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:59,610
the terrain and what happened to do is

00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:01,590
play a big part and feedback is

00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:05,310
important to preserve those paths again

00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:10,770
and it's important to put changes into a

00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:13,020
street map again besides contributing to

00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:16,260
openstreetmap we also make use of

00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:20,720
openstreetmap almost daily to make

00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:25,860
analyzes most of the time we do it by

00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:29,880
QGIS not a wonderful open source project

00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:31,680
but I don't go into that it just can't

00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:34,020
talk about over street map and so on

00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,930
that count given things back but it can

00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:40,940
talk with oak street map I have three

00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:43,710
examples of analysis we make with

00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:46,980
openstreetmap the first one simplest one

00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:49,440
is a comparing maps by side we want to

00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:53,340
know the old legal ways projected on

00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:57,660
left of the screen is an old atlas mate

00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:59,970
in 1840 so they made very good work

00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:04,130
without technical approach to do that

00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:07,590
and we compare them with the state today

00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:10,980
besides the roads registry from an

00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:14,430
english flemish or information agency we

00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:16,860
make use of openstreetmap after the

00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:18,990
desktop work we or some volunteers go in

00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:21,590
the field to check the condition of the

00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:24,120
parts and the field we use that

00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:26,640
inventories as a base for local public

00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:28,980
consultations we make about what's

00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:33,210
people thinking about the future of the

00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:35,400
local slow roads and then it's called

00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:40,860
back to the database and hopefully into

00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:43,650
the OpenStreetMap database but the main

00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:46,500
reason why we love osm is that it has

00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:50,640
the potential to contain everything that

00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:52,740
can be on a map with them made the world

00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,300
of geographical data accessible to

00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:56,399
everyone

00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:59,459
individuals tiny organizations small

00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:03,779
local administrations the only thing you

00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:05,939
have to do is learn to use it the first

00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:08,399
time you see it you think oh no what's

00:09:05,939 --> 00:09:12,089
this but once you through it it reads

00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:15,449
like a book you know what tax they can

00:09:12,089 --> 00:09:17,850
be used for parts surface speed and so

00:09:15,449 --> 00:09:20,250
on it's just a step it's a big step to

00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:25,470
take but it's the only investment you

00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:29,850
have to make the second example goes

00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:34,860
about the analysis of green functional

00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:36,569
and meaningful roads it's it's analyzing

00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:38,610
about routes for pedestrians and

00:09:36,569 --> 00:09:41,579
cyclists between the living hood and for

00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:43,170
example working place or school we want

00:09:41,579 --> 00:09:45,750
to look for routes that meet some

00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:48,300
proposed criteria like it has to be

00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:51,089
secure as last class as possible it has

00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:54,209
to be nice it has to be go through

00:09:51,089 --> 00:09:57,000
natural environment which water flowers

00:09:54,209 --> 00:09:58,949
grass trees it has to be functional as

00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,319
short as possible it has to be

00:09:58,949 --> 00:10:03,959
comfortable which surface it has other

00:10:01,319 --> 00:10:07,639
shelters on the way man is raining they

00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:11,189
can and they can height to make

00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:16,439
calculations on the roots why

00:10:11,189 --> 00:10:19,470
openstreetmap a lot of different data

00:10:16,439 --> 00:10:22,139
you need and before we needed to collect

00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:23,970
a lot of sources and wet sources you

00:10:22,139 --> 00:10:27,300
always have to translate and transform

00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:31,259
data to communicate with each other to

00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:33,120
compare almost all of those criteria we

00:10:31,259 --> 00:10:36,480
can find an open street map is it is

00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:38,220
mapped if you need bus stops just check

00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,680
with them if you need to know if there's

00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:42,209
a walking routes in the territory just

00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:45,930
check the multi-line strings through

00:10:42,209 --> 00:10:47,579
openstreetmap as to QGIS if we want to

00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:50,610
know where they are squares that can be

00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:53,220
crossed by pedestrians just look in the

00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:56,459
multi polygons and search for attack i

00:10:53,220 --> 00:11:00,779
vs pedestrian so it contains everything

00:10:56,459 --> 00:11:05,970
that could be interesting now a summary

00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:07,020
of the whole process look like this I'm

00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:08,940
not going until

00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:10,500
but downloading process thing to get the

00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:14,310
things you want making things

00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:16,440
topological bridges don't splitted by

00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:20,250
the rivers and so on and then give a

00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:24,270
value based on those criteria the is not

00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:27,060
like lost step and then you can go make

00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:32,600
a routing over the most valuable route

00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:36,030
if you see the average isn't that high

00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:38,580
we can advise local governments to do

00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:40,770
something about that to put more green

00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:43,410
around the world to put more safe roads

00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:46,170
and we hope that they can achieve this

00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:48,690
to create more meaningful green and

00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:52,310
functional routes around there for the

00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:55,020
inhabitants and the thing is if

00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:57,270
hopefully the government's achieve this

00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:59,010
and then when they did it they put it

00:11:57,270 --> 00:12:02,970
back into open street map and then

00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:05,130
people can routing along this another

00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:10,440
project the last one I will point on it

00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:13,890
is stop us here we make its embrace Hoss

00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:17,100
it's about slurve roads and rest was not

00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:20,780
Brussels city but the entire communities

00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:27,720
around it we make a real fan tree of

00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:30,390
Atlas we made three years ago and the

00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:36,180
thing is we want to do the real inventor

00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:38,880
II because we don't want only make a new

00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:41,700
address we also want to make a routing

00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,950
app for pedestrians and wheelchair users

00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:45,720
that's adapted to the brazos contacts

00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:49,500
you know you've been walked to Brussels

00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:51,210
a lot of parks at night most of them are

00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:53,040
closed there are a lot of stairs they

00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:55,200
are steep roads so for wheelchair users

00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,760
as not that they're comfortable so we

00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:01,140
are trying to gather information about

00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:04,730
that and then collect everything to be

00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:08,190
rootable the process looks like that the

00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:10,740
inventory of 2014 comparing to the state

00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:12,900
today going in the fields gathering

00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:15,600
information put it back in to

00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:19,290
openstreetmap so it can be used by the

00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,040
people who will make the app but can be

00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:22,410
used by

00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:25,500
everybody so that's the first light we

00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:27,360
met using parts as preserving those

00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:30,269
parts that is the core business of core

00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:33,149
business is not making apps but if we

00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:37,440
can offer needed in a project to do we

00:13:33,149 --> 00:13:40,079
do it our core business making pots X

00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:42,300
table accessible for everybody so in our

00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:44,970
projects we always want to make a step

00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:46,889
or two steps that returns things back to

00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:48,899
the community not only oil openstreetmap

00:13:46,889 --> 00:13:58,170
community but maybe other communities

00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:59,790
like it back deck can be dreaming before

00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:03,240
starting to dream I want to try out a

00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:06,540
call I'm looking around I hope there are

00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:10,319
some politicians one you I don't know

00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:14,670
but I want to call team up with your

00:14:10,319 --> 00:14:15,990
local government why we know that

00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:18,389
several members of the Belgian

00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:21,149
openstreetmap community have working

00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:23,639
hard to try to convince governments to

00:14:21,149 --> 00:14:26,850
use openstreetmap as and to look at it

00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:28,970
as a major geographic database which has

00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:31,529
meaningful information we believe in it

00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:34,019
from our experience over the last year

00:14:31,529 --> 00:14:37,019
it's worth to have a closer look at it

00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:38,850
because it offers possibilities for

00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:42,630
local administrations to make their life

00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:44,579
easier some examples last month we got a

00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:46,470
question from an older man he wanted to

00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:48,600
make a city map with all slurred words

00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:51,389
on it and like you know local

00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:54,089
governments their budget is not that

00:14:51,389 --> 00:14:56,279
high so this question was and how can we

00:14:54,089 --> 00:14:59,069
do it as less expensive as it is

00:14:56,279 --> 00:15:01,500
possible I said you use openstreetmap

00:14:59,069 --> 00:15:03,540
it's free data you can use it for your

00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:06,389
own purposes they are it's well

00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:10,110
documented their online tools to achieve

00:15:06,389 --> 00:15:13,949
maps like mapas matic from for example

00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:17,360
to create city maps it's a little

00:15:13,949 --> 00:15:20,430
example another example is based on

00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:23,579
well-defined tax it is possible to

00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:27,209
achieve some maintenance scheme for

00:15:23,579 --> 00:15:30,029
maintenance the local part or maybe

00:15:27,209 --> 00:15:32,579
something else like if you think give me

00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:33,520
all parts on my territory who contains

00:15:32,579 --> 00:15:36,260
the tag

00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:39,530
compacted surface and check them every

00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:42,020
two year gives me all parts with surfers

00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:44,690
grass that belongs to some walking

00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:46,640
routes check them every twice a year and

00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:50,300
all the other parts just check them once

00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:52,670
a year it's possible to gather from open

00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:54,470
street map if it is mapped so if it

00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:57,410
isn't mad local governments please

00:15:54,470 --> 00:16:00,020
organize mapping party with your local

00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:02,240
inhabitants gather those information and

00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:04,580
then you can do these things without

00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:09,890
having expensive infrastructure to keep

00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:13,190
do data that's my call to it and then at

00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:17,210
last the dream we have an address of

00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:18,860
alternatives we are an organization we

00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:23,480
are dream is real want to try to make

00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:25,760
the world a better place we know we want

00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:28,760
to make an ass of alternatives and Atlas

00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:31,460
address that contains the comments

00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:32,870
openstreetmap is a common a creative

00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:36,080
common there are a lot of other comments

00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:39,320
like think of landed comments or

00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:42,070
innovative forms of the citizen let

00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:46,760
governance of public property you have

00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:49,160
CSI community supported agriculture free

00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:51,890
harvesting places you have cooperatives

00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:55,490
fabrication labs think of free little

00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:57,800
library or a network of places suitable

00:16:55,490 --> 00:17:00,200
for playing children think of every ID

00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:02,120
that would make the world a common place

00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:04,550
and we believe that the structure of

00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:09,050
openstreetmap and the knowledge of every

00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:12,770
map can make such an atlas and through

00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:15,800
preparing the talk I found some examples

00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:18,140
of projects and one of them is a

00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:21,680
European project called transform up dot

00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:25,970
zero and that seems to have worked

00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:28,880
around a manner to achieve this most of

00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:31,220
the data is in Germany so let's say

00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:35,410
start mapping those things and flawless

00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:38,930
and help us creating our dream for real

00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:42,700
so this was my talk with love from

00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:42,700
Brussels to openstreetmap

00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:11,940
so if if I understand well there are two

00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:16,350
databases of slow roads in Belgium or in

00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:19,410
Flanders 11 from the government or the

00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:22,560
local authorities or the provinces and

00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:24,720
the other one is openstreetmap you know

00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:26,700
what what's your vision about that how

00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:30,420
can it be synchronized and what our

00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:32,940
future the problem is we also invent the

00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:35,400
disappeared legal way I have we invent

00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:37,560
and make advantage of the disappeared

00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:39,840
and things that are on the tree that

00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:41,670
does not are on the terrain can be

00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:44,310
imported and openstreetmap so we have to

00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:48,440
keep the data of the legal ways they

00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:48,440
have to be on the field but they are

00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:54,630
farmer took it or there's some swimming

00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:56,280
pool on it or some carport so we have to

00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:57,990
know the information we need more

00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:00,090
information than we can put into oak

00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:02,460
street map so we have to gather it we

00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:04,080
made a database to collect it and to

00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:08,700
standardize for all those professional

00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:12,450
actors but we want to know everyone

00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:14,910
people let's use the open roads so we

00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:17,760
give the opportunity to put them into

00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:21,360
openstreetmap and I know it's a

00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:25,320
difficult thing to synchronize it so we

00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:29,550
offered it as an open data source so

00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:31,920
people can look by my side and maybe

00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:33,600
some semi automatic way to look for

00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:36,930
difference in tax and we hope that

00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:40,050
people add some more information to that

00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:42,720
but we don't want to give an automated

00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:45,050
way because it's too difficult to do

00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:49,470
that at the site and our possibilities

00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:51,620
so mad if one can achieve this please do

00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:51,620
it

00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:09,410
not really question but as a Belgian

00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:13,520
pepper and we know each other I just

00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:15,770
like to say that love is mutual so we've

00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:18,590
been having a lot of new members from

00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:20,480
your backgrounds and it's fun that we

00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:22,490
don't have to all answer all the same

00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:26,360
questions over and over again like you

00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:28,910
can do it for us as well it's it's well

00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:32,450
done for you that's that's the thing we

00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:33,980
try to do another job as get something

00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:36,110
back to the communities we working for

00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:38,480
we mostly work with local government

00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:41,720
governments so if you do something but

00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:44,480
local people we try to make their place

00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:46,280
some better place for them by our core

00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,470
business public paths so people can use

00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:50,360
them but if you have other projects like

00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:54,190
comments we try to give something back

00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:57,680
and we believe in OpenStreetMap and we

00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:59,930
the policy i have is making an entrance

00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:02,960
because a lot of local governments are

00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:06,080
interested in our core business as legal

00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:09,790
pot but once we have them on the hook we

00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,790
can talk about openstreetmap as

00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:17,570
you

00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:28,300
our organizations but we don't

00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:31,000
so what you all do just we have some

00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:32,950
common interest and then we hope we can

00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:37,420
learn from each other so I cannot answer

00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:39,430
that question answer it hi I'm curious

00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:41,860
about lobbying activities that you

00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:45,730
mentioned you I'm curious about lobbying

00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:46,840
activities to change things so for

00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:51,130
example you mentioned that the

00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:53,020
wheelchair accessibility if you have can

00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:56,820
you elaborate a bit more on that and if

00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:59,200
you had any success actually changing

00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:02,890
something through the local government

00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:10,120
or or getting them to provide better

00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:13,530
services or those kind of we don't have

00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:16,240
changed yet anything and the wheelchair

00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:18,310
activities we we didn't organize a

00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:20,800
mapping party like you know the mapping

00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:24,850
party used to the open Street North

00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:27,190
community we organize our own because we

00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:29,350
want to collect more info than we can

00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:33,400
put into open street map and through the

00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:35,310
work we do we extract the relevant info

00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:39,910
for openstreetmap to give it back and

00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:43,060
the wheel check is we use for Brussels

00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:46,590
also the Rubies data because then we can

00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:49,510
have some more details about something

00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:52,720
we don't look only on the slow route but

00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:55,710
on walking friendly words also with max

00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,710
speed 30 but

00:23:56,870 --> 00:24:14,549
obviously as my colleague food with vs.

00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:16,230
maybe she can answer that hello I'm

00:24:14,549 --> 00:24:18,509
mahalo and I'm responsible for the

00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:21,740
project in Brussels concerning the

00:24:18,509 --> 00:24:24,980
inventory of all the slow roads and

00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:29,190
little pots adapted for pedestrians and

00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:31,679
wheelchairs we are actually working at

00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:35,759
the moment on a rien Ventura black Peter

00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:38,190
explained the end of the project will be

00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:41,960
like he said an application for

00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:45,200
smartphone and an atlas that will be

00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:47,399
distributed in all of the region and

00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:51,120
along with that project we are working

00:24:47,399 --> 00:24:56,220
with 19 community communities here in

00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:59,970
Brussels to improve their pedestrian

00:24:56,220 --> 00:25:03,149
policy so at the moment the lobbying is

00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:06,330
going on we have direct lines with each

00:25:03,149 --> 00:25:09,289
of those communities where we are

00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:11,700
working together with a responsible for

00:25:09,289 --> 00:25:13,860
sustainable mobility in those

00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:16,590
communities and all the data we are

00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:20,639
collecting through our inventory and two

00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:24,299
of a street map will be used to inform

00:25:20,639 --> 00:25:27,899
those local communities to wear the red

00:25:24,299 --> 00:25:31,110
spots on let's say are situated where

00:25:27,899 --> 00:25:33,600
are the problems where are people in

00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:37,860
wheelchairs for example have to make a

00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:41,399
detour that is out of this world like

00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:44,940
let's say so this is what we do we

00:25:41,399 --> 00:25:47,970
inform the local governments and we let

00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:51,090
them know where the red spots are and we

00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:55,860
provide them with tools like how can we

00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:58,230
adapt those spots and etc to make make

00:25:55,860 --> 00:26:01,919
them better for all kinds of pedestrians

00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:04,679
with me treat orbit wheels and so at the

00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:06,179
moment project is ongoing we cannot

00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:08,429
present you any result

00:26:06,179 --> 00:26:13,110
but we are hopeful that this project

00:26:08,429 --> 00:26:15,720
that will continue next year we'll have

00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:19,070
some nice results in the future that's

00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:19,070
hope for 2020

00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:48,520
there is a half an hour break coffee and

00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:50,440
tea are available for you in the Nelson

00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:53,040
Mandela downstair see you back in half
