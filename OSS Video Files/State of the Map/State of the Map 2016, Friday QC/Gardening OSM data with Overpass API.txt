The review of the data by the community is an often cited advantage of OSM. Nonetheless, it is still difficult to make sense of whole changesets or to trace changes back to the individual user. In this talk, it is shown how the existing tools can be used together and a new approach to trace back automatically the origin of each individual tag with Overpass API is demonstrated. We will finally use the tools to figure out whether there are a relevant number of edit wars in OSM.
