Remote mapping in OpenStreetMap requires access to openly licensed imagery. Working with a community of satellite companies and drone operators OpenAerialMap has been providing open access aerial imagery since last summer. Users can search through a web-based map browser, connect to an API, and upload imagery to publish open imagery. Imagery can be immediately loaded into iD or JOSM for tracing in OpenStreetMap.

This talk will walk through the core components of OpenAerialMap (OAM). We will also share the results of the growth of the community and tools over the last year and share further plans for how imagery within OAM can be integrated with OSM. The OAM community is planning for more growth over the next year and anyone can get involved.
