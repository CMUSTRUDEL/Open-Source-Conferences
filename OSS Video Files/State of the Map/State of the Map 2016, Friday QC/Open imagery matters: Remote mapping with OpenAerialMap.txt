Title: Open imagery matters: Remote mapping with OpenAerialMap
Publication date: 2016-10-17
Playlist: State of the Map 2016, Friday QC
Description: 
	Daniel da Silva at State of the Map 2016
http://2016.stateofthemap.org/2016/open-imagery-matters-remote-mapping-with-openaerialmap/

Remote mapping in OpenStreetMap requires access to openly licensed imagery. Working with a community of satellite companies and drone operators OpenAerialMap has been providing open access aerial imagery since last summer. Users can search through a web-based map browser, connect to an API, and upload imagery to publish open imagery. Imagery can be immediately loaded into iD or JOSM for tracing in OpenStreetMap.

This talk will walk through the core components of OpenAerialMap (OAM). We will also share the results of the growth of the community and tools over the last year and share further plans for how imagery within OAM can be integrated with OSM. The OAM community is planning for more growth over the next year and anyone can get involved.

for that our next speaker will be Daniel

00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:06,629
the silver from development seat and we

00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:15,870
will talk about his open aerial map

00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:18,750
project hello everyone so I'm Daniella

00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:21,480
Silva from development seed and I bring

00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:25,109
you open arrow map so who knows about

00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:27,380
the project okay who has ever

00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:32,160
contributed any imagery to this project

00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:35,969
we have a new well okay that's that's

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:38,489
nice at least there's someone ok so for

00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:39,660
everyone else I'm going to go over what

00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:43,200
kind of problems we try to solve with

00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:45,989
this project sorry why was it built what

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,180
kind of tools make up the its ecosystem

00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:50,160
and then what kind of improvements we

00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:54,809
made to the project over the last year

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:56,610
or so so problems we noticed that there

00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:58,739
was a lack of imagery for disaster

00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:02,070
response and this kind of imagery needs

00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:03,539
to be as available and as ready to use

00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:06,210
as possible users need to be able to

00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:09,630
find it very quickly to actually be able

00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:11,640
to have some impact with it so imagery

00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:13,380
from satellites and mend aerial vehicles

00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,150
and other types of UAVs become

00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:17,189
increasingly available after a disaster

00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:19,110
you have organizations and even

00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:20,640
individuals that just capture all

00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:23,939
imagery that then share with the world

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,520
and make available however sometimes

00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:28,380
it's very difficult to understand if the

00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:31,500
imagery is available where it's

00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:33,689
available what kind of license it's

00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:38,009
released under and if it's actually free

00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:40,710
to be used and so that's what we try to

00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:42,829
do we try to find a simple way for users

00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:46,320
to know this for users to find access

00:01:42,829 --> 00:01:48,860
use and share the imagery for a disaster

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,270
response and new military preparedness a

00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:52,920
good example of where this is important

00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:55,049
was during the Ebola outbreak in memo

00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,090
Guinea the background shows the progress

00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:59,729
of voice m edits where some contributors

00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:01,770
over a short period of time mapped a big

00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:04,200
area and that's important because then

00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:06,450
the proper authorities know what to get

00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:10,950
to different places where facilities are

00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:12,390
and what kind of facility is actually

00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:15,810
available in the area for

00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:18,120
to save lives the lives of people so

00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:20,580
this all works thanks to the open

00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:23,010
imagery network it's actually a network

00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:24,060
of open licensed image released under

00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:26,520
Creative Commons Attribution

00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:30,090
four-point-oh all imagery is available

00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:33,270
under this license this project or this

00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:34,620
part of the OEM to set was born out of

00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:36,510
the collaboration between different

00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:39,120
agencies or different companies in this

00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:41,670
case development seed hot planet labs

00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,340
and as a VSO a big shout out to them for

00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:47,790
helping out with this with this tool

00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:50,910
it's a distributed system not in the

00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:52,920
traditional IT sense but meaning that

00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:55,170
it's made of notes so we have multiple

00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:57,450
nodes of imagery and if in one of these

00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:59,340
nodes fails everyone else will everyone

00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:03,330
else will still be up and available to

00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:05,940
to be accessed to be used anyone can

00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:08,489
contribute to this to this system to

00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:10,440
this network of imagery and essentially

00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:13,260
there are two main ways of doing it

00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:15,480
first one is to host one of these notes

00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:17,549
it's a very easy thing to do you follow

00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:19,709
the instructions on the readme of the

00:03:17,549 --> 00:03:23,130
repo you release the image you're under

00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:25,680
correct license so attribution by to be

00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:27,780
creative commons attribution and then

00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,130
you add your information to the note

00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:31,709
register and that's it you're done

00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:33,329
you're up and then people all over the

00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:36,420
world can start using the imagery you

00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:38,280
share however if you can't afford those

00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:39,540
two node if you don't want to or if you

00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,100
don't have the technical skills you can

00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:44,489
still up us out you can still contribute

00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:46,620
with imagery through the uploader form

00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:49,220
which is a tool that we built and that

00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:52,799
I'm going to go over in a bit forward

00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:55,530
and upload your imagery to the hot wire

00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,060
node which will still then make the

00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:59,900
imagery available to everyone else

00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:02,370
crediting of course the correct people

00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:05,310
okay I've been talking about OEM and

00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:08,880
open l map but what exactly is this what

00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:10,950
what we're trying to do here so briefly

00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:13,470
it's a set of tools for finding and

00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:16,859
sharing imagery that's available on the

00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:19,140
OEM this is this tool is the result of

00:04:16,859 --> 00:04:22,710
multiple iterations many of them

00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:26,000
unsuccessful but we have learned from

00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:28,190
the previous iterations and

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,220
time we make sure that everyone at the

00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:33,020
saying and now we built this we gather

00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:35,420
the broader group of people to make sure

00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:39,350
that this time we actually got it right

00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:41,810
it was a community effort especially

00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:44,300
because if you need to read the

00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:45,800
manual when you are coming like to a

00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:48,980
disaster response or something like that

00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:51,920
it doesn't work that fails every single

00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:53,390
time so what we try to do was to make

00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:56,570
something simple and that's why this

00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:58,190
time we succeeded we actually were able

00:04:56,570 --> 00:05:00,440
to build something that is being used

00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:03,440
and its successful didn't feel like the

00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:05,840
last times it's simple to use people

00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:09,290
there's no requirement for like high

00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:11,330
technology or for to read an extensive

00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:14,830
documentation to be able to use the

00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:18,770
tools that make up the OEM system which

00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:22,100
let's go over some of them the catalog

00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:24,440
it's like the core if you if you want it

00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:26,270
indexes the imagery that's available on

00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,950
the network and then makes it available

00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:31,910
through an API which can then be used

00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:34,280
and to query the all the whole database

00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:36,710
you can query by like the bounding box

00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:40,340
for a specific area by different filters

00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:43,130
like acquisition date basically anything

00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:46,220
that's that's available and so at this

00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:48,500
point we had a way to web imagery a way

00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:50,990
to store imagery and the way to access

00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:54,080
it a way to find it but not every user

00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:56,419
can can understand an API can use an API

00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:59,660
not everyone can make sense of this of

00:05:56,419 --> 00:06:02,710
JSON response so we needed something

00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:06,140
simpler the actual simple part of OEM is

00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:09,800
the browser so the browser comes as well

00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:12,710
as a solution for this specific problem

00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:16,310
it's a simple tool or tries to be simple

00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:21,100
tool for users to find chair and use the

00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:21,100
imagery okay let's see it in action

00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:41,769
what is it

00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:58,360
fantastic I just lost my browser one

00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,360
second

00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:08,030
okay so this is the actual OEM browser

00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:10,250
it's it's based on a grid on a

00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:13,250
grid-based integration system we built

00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:15,140
this like choropleth grid where each

00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:17,840
cell is colored according to the number

00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:21,350
of footprints that intersect a specific

00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:24,230
region users can find whatever they're

00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:25,970
looking for either by browsing the map

00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:30,740
or by searching for specific location

00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:34,190
and as soon as you zoom in you get these

00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:35,810
different colors and you can get an idea

00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:37,430
by then by the number that shows up of

00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:43,820
the amount of footprints that's

00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:46,190
available on each on each cell once once

00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:48,980
you select a specific cell and yeah okay

00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:50,720
you get a preview of the image that's

00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:52,760
evolved on a specific region and then

00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,430
you can just pick whatever you want and

00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:57,320
preview it immediately on the map in

00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:59,030
this case this image it's very low

00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:00,620
resolution it's captured by Landsat 8

00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:03,050
with the resolution of 48 meters per

00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:05,270
pixel so you can't really do any tracing

00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:08,260
with this one but let me find you

00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:11,150
something way better in the Philippines

00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:13,600
which is an area I quite like for its

00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:13,600
imagery

00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:26,840
okay let's give it some time too low

00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:37,529
okay this is a nice one so this image is

00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:40,680
takes up a very very small area because

00:08:37,529 --> 00:08:42,960
it's so I resolution this is like the

00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:45,990
opposite end it's captured with a UAV

00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:50,720
and it's four centimeter per pixel so

00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:55,339
this is perfect for as soon as you can

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,339
well this is not helping me out

00:09:03,059 --> 00:09:10,649
from here okay okay finally so this

00:09:08,849 --> 00:09:11,999
image is very high resolution and with

00:09:10,649 --> 00:09:15,079
this one you can actually trace it and

00:09:11,999 --> 00:09:19,409
you can use it for example directly on

00:09:15,079 --> 00:09:22,589
osm ID just by clicking here for example

00:09:19,409 --> 00:09:25,199
and immediately it's loaded on osm ID

00:09:22,589 --> 00:09:26,999
and allows you for to trace this arian

00:09:25,199 --> 00:09:30,089
specific in particular it's already been

00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:32,939
fully traced but if you get imagery or

00:09:30,089 --> 00:09:35,399
new imagery for a new area you can

00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:37,169
easily connect both apps and start

00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:40,169
working start getting down to actual

00:09:37,169 --> 00:09:41,489
business so the we make sure that

00:09:40,169 --> 00:09:44,249
integration between both of them it's

00:09:41,489 --> 00:09:47,039
pretty easy and for example we can I

00:09:44,249 --> 00:09:48,989
also allow the preview of the thumbnail

00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:50,849
directly on the on the browser which is

00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:54,419
like a new feature that we just released

00:09:50,849 --> 00:09:58,109
like three days ago maybe and allows you

00:09:54,419 --> 00:10:01,439
to immediately see what kind of zoom

00:09:58,109 --> 00:10:03,989
level or what you can do with this with

00:10:01,439 --> 00:10:05,219
a specific image besides that you can

00:10:03,989 --> 00:10:07,319
also download the image with alec

00:10:05,219 --> 00:10:09,419
directly and use it in any other program

00:10:07,319 --> 00:10:15,139
of your choosing or that you actually

00:10:09,419 --> 00:10:17,519
prefer okay that's for it to go back oh

00:10:15,139 --> 00:10:22,829
well this is what where the browser

00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:24,839
weren't fine okay as I said we made a

00:10:22,829 --> 00:10:27,089
bunch of improvements to all these tools

00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:29,759
some of them or some of the improvements

00:10:27,089 --> 00:10:31,349
made over the last year were under the

00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:35,189
hood improvements to increase

00:10:31,349 --> 00:10:37,889
performance to use better tech to to do

00:10:35,189 --> 00:10:41,159
things including my personal favorite

00:10:37,889 --> 00:10:44,069
the removal of flash from OEM so since

00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:47,429
june seventh its flash free which is

00:10:44,069 --> 00:10:52,499
nice another improvement was the

00:10:47,429 --> 00:10:58,069
feedback form now we can get maybe we

00:10:52,499 --> 00:10:58,069
can watch

00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:04,779
okay now we can have users report

00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:08,019
problems with imagery so if the

00:11:04,779 --> 00:11:11,019
thumbnail is misaligned or if it doesn't

00:11:08,019 --> 00:11:13,269
match the area it's being presented on

00:11:11,019 --> 00:11:15,069
we can immediately know and we can

00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:18,129
ensure that the quality of the imagery

00:11:15,069 --> 00:11:21,489
that we have it's as good and as high as

00:11:18,129 --> 00:11:23,980
as possible so another improvement we

00:11:21,489 --> 00:11:27,540
made was the addition of a home page or

00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:31,989
a welcome page that introduces users to

00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:37,239
to the project so like a welcome message

00:11:31,989 --> 00:11:39,069
some stats about the imagery some like a

00:11:37,239 --> 00:11:41,079
list of all the tools that that make up

00:11:39,069 --> 00:11:43,829
this this ecosystem a call from

00:11:41,079 --> 00:11:46,269
contribution obviously and then links to

00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:57,369
more information and the other at the

00:11:46,269 --> 00:11:59,110
other parts of the project so now we get

00:11:57,369 --> 00:12:02,170
to the uploader the apolar is the form i

00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:04,839
mention it at the beginning where you

00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:07,809
can use it to upload your own imagery to

00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:10,059
the hot note in case you can't host your

00:12:07,809 --> 00:12:12,249
own or the order you don't want to this

00:12:10,059 --> 00:12:14,199
also had some improvements over the last

00:12:12,249 --> 00:12:16,329
year including for example the

00:12:14,199 --> 00:12:18,939
improvement of this image relocation

00:12:16,329 --> 00:12:20,799
widget before we had this kind of text

00:12:18,939 --> 00:12:22,749
area box where users had to put the URL

00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:24,850
for their images this led to problems

00:12:22,749 --> 00:12:27,189
because not everyone would respect the

00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:29,170
one your upper lines some users would

00:12:27,189 --> 00:12:31,839
use comma-separated URLs some users

00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:34,059
would I just you see my comments to

00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:36,939
separate URL of spaces and that actually

00:12:34,059 --> 00:12:39,249
break the server and we wouldn't upload

00:12:36,939 --> 00:12:42,850
the imagery in the correct way and so we

00:12:39,249 --> 00:12:45,040
moved from a like unique field type of

00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:48,490
type of solution where each field is one

00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:50,559
URL it's simple and it's intelligible

00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:52,809
users can understand it immediately also

00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:54,910
included integration with Dropbox which

00:12:52,809 --> 00:12:59,079
is already available and Google Drive is

00:12:54,910 --> 00:13:01,419
coming so bear with me for that and now

00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:04,139
let's try to do some upload maybe it

00:13:01,419 --> 00:13:04,139
goes better than the browser

00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:12,339
okay so basically you to make any kind

00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:14,680
of a plug you need to have a token this

00:13:12,339 --> 00:13:17,980
is mostly to ensure that we don't get

00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:19,959
out of spam imagery it's although it's

00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:22,300
very easy to get one you have to you can

00:13:19,959 --> 00:13:25,420
request a token either via email or a

00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:26,620
github issue basically have to say who

00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:28,660
you are what kind of imagery have

00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:30,430
available and then token will be

00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:32,829
assigned to you that you can use this is

00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:36,610
also to be able to link images or

00:13:32,829 --> 00:13:37,750
uploads to certain people so we know if

00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:39,880
there's a problem we know who to contact

00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:42,279
because the the data you put on the

00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:45,370
uploader I mean you can put whatever you

00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:48,880
want to in this case let's try some

00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:51,040
dummy upload I already prefilled this so

00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,079
we are having a data set its captured by

00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:55,750
a kite and I'm actually going to use

00:13:53,079 --> 00:13:57,430
drop box to select my image as soon as I

00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:59,259
click I got the list of all my files I'm

00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:02,199
going to go with this like test

00:13:59,259 --> 00:14:06,250
footprint that's it and now as soon as I

00:14:02,199 --> 00:14:07,839
upload it's done now I'm going to go to

00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:12,100
the backstage you can see that the

00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:15,100
server received it it's it's actually

00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:16,930
downloading the data from my my dropbox

00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:18,610
and as soon as downloads we processed

00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:21,940
will be a thumbnail will be created and

00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:25,300
then it will be sent to an s3 bucket

00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:29,139
which is the hot pocket or addy of node

00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:30,760
to be able to then be used and okay it's

00:14:29,139 --> 00:14:33,100
been it's uploading right now so it's

00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:35,290
working it won't be immediately

00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:37,600
available on the browser because the

00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:39,160
catalog needs to index them and that

00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,920
will take some time because it only runs

00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:44,230
at specific intervals but if we see the

00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,970
image on the bucket on the s3 bucket

00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:49,560
means that it will be indexed sooner or

00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:49,560
later so let's try to do that

00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:23,449
and there we go my footprints test small

00:15:21,319 --> 00:15:24,709
it's official universe three official in

00:15:23,449 --> 00:15:27,259
a bucket you will be indexed by the

00:15:24,709 --> 00:15:36,050
catalog and shown on the browser as soon

00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:38,060
as it runs it works exactly okay another

00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:40,069
piece of this ecosystem is a

00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:41,600
documentation which is very important

00:15:40,069 --> 00:15:43,910
for every project so that people know

00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,730
what it is out to use it and how it

00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:48,379
works although the browser per se it's

00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:51,290
pretty simple and it's what we are

00:15:48,379 --> 00:15:52,430
aiming for the so all the servers and

00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:54,350
the backend stuff it's a bit more

00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:56,509
complicated so when you still need aa

00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:59,990
cumin tation for users to know 20 to you

00:15:56,509 --> 00:16:01,339
out to make it run how to develop for it

00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:03,800
all to help us because that's something

00:16:01,339 --> 00:16:05,720
we also need and how to make it run

00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:07,810
locally if that's that's what I wonder

00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:10,069
if they want to run their own copy so

00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:14,509
documentation it's there exactly for

00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:16,550
that it's still being developed so it's

00:16:14,509 --> 00:16:18,170
still being written so if any of you

00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:20,180
knows about the project and wants to

00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:22,850
help please write documentation it's

00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:24,860
always nice if you dig if you dig long

00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:28,420
enough you'll find some pieces let's say

00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:31,009
coming soon so help us if you if you can

00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:34,360
last piece of this toolkit is the design

00:16:31,009 --> 00:16:38,029
system this is something new we added

00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:39,199
also pretty recently as soon as you saw

00:16:38,029 --> 00:16:40,790
there are a bunch of those in this

00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:44,959
system there's the uploader there's the

00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:46,819
browser there's some admin pages as well

00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:50,750
for example for 2 minus the tokens and

00:16:46,819 --> 00:16:53,240
all these tools use the same styles and

00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:54,980
the same components because we want to

00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,990
ensure some behavior and visual

00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:59,209
consistency across every single tool of

00:16:56,990 --> 00:17:01,459
the system that's why it's a system and

00:16:59,209 --> 00:17:04,400
it's a group of a little apps that make

00:17:01,459 --> 00:17:06,110
up a project so then system does exactly

00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:09,020
that it's like an installable module

00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:11,419
that comes with bundle styles and

00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:12,709
bundled components which you just use

00:17:11,419 --> 00:17:14,630
whenever you need to create a new app

00:17:12,709 --> 00:17:18,309
for the system and out of the box you

00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:20,809
have the visual and behavioral

00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:23,390
consistency that we want across all the

00:17:20,809 --> 00:17:28,010
tools it's all documented it's up to be

00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:30,080
used under the the repo and if you need

00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:32,020
more information about design systems in

00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,420
general why they're important

00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:36,430
why we actually develop some like this

00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:38,380
please check out that URL 10 CC slices

00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:40,510
and system links to a blog post we wrote

00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:44,140
about why they are important and what

00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:46,260
should be used and one should be used ok

00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:49,180
what about the future of who i am what

00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:51,340
what what is in store for for the

00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:53,140
project so first thing we're going to do

00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:54,400
is simplify the contribution process we

00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:56,740
already started doing this especially

00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:59,700
with the improvements in the uploader

00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:03,340
like replacing the imagery widget and

00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:05,740
that splits specifically to lower the

00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:07,180
barrier to share and publish another

00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:09,100
improvement that we have planned it's

00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:11,700
something ready with the tokens simplify

00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:14,860
the process of getting a token and of

00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:17,440
using one and then get more

00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:20,470
organizations to have notes to share

00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:22,720
imagery with us also there are new tools

00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:25,420
coming in one of them inspected which is

00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:27,220
applying OEM to the Pacific Islands Nate

00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:29,890
Smith from heart is leading this out is

00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:31,110
over there so go talk with them if you

00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:36,790
want more information about this project

00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:38,680
there's a possum which is a package osm

00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:41,080
running out of raspberry pi that can be

00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:44,650
used offline in this case so am would be

00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:46,750
part of to chain by helping preparing

00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:48,640
the imagery to be used this is being led

00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:50,730
out by the American Red Cross so speak

00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:53,110
with them for more information and

00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:55,360
please get involved in the project I'll

00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:57,550
pass out everything is available and

00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:59,770
open source under the Ottawa

00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:01,540
semi-transition and get up if you are a

00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:05,050
programmer opposite code otherwise

00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:07,390
review issues suggest features review

00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:10,870
the tools and give opinions it's always

00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:14,280
nice and always welcome so thank you

00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:14,280
very much any questions

00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,769
thank you for the talk and first a small

00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:36,320
Association except if I'm totally

00:19:33,769 --> 00:19:39,380
mistaken this was actually contract work

00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:42,529
paid by hot and development see it has

00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:45,470
not turned into a charity suddenly no no

00:19:42,529 --> 00:19:47,419
it didn't it's a the the project was was

00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:51,529
the opener on my project was paid work

00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:53,450
for from hot exactly but we did like

00:19:51,529 --> 00:19:55,730
discuss the project as a community and

00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:58,220
what the project would entail it was

00:19:55,730 --> 00:20:00,830
with like a communal discussion but the

00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:04,250
project gets was paid work okay now to

00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:10,370
my real question it's not clear to me

00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:13,399
how open it really is because you seem

00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:18,289
to focus very much on disaster vamping

00:20:13,399 --> 00:20:21,169
and so on but 99% of osm is not about

00:20:18,289 --> 00:20:24,230
disaster map and the question is can

00:20:21,169 --> 00:20:26,629
other energy sources people that have

00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:29,090
run drones somewhere in Germany where

00:20:26,629 --> 00:20:30,980
those very unlikely to be ever be any

00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:33,830
disaster mapping also on can they

00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:37,190
include the imagery as well and the

00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:40,730
second part is more from my hat as a

00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:42,590
editor developer what about an API so

00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:45,850
that we can actually retrieve the

00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:48,950
available imagery for a certain location

00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:51,409
because right now most of us rely on

00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:54,259
jotham has its wiki page with the

00:20:51,409 --> 00:20:58,539
imagery list and the ID and verse boots

00:20:54,259 --> 00:21:01,009
you use the imagery index obviously

00:20:58,539 --> 00:21:03,559
given the database behind that you don't

00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:05,809
want to move this into static fires so

00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:07,970
the question would be would you provide

00:21:05,809 --> 00:21:10,730
or think of providing an API so that we

00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:15,049
could retrieve the available image for

00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:17,090
imagery for a specific bounding box okay

00:21:15,049 --> 00:21:18,950
good questions so entering your first

00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:22,309
one yes any kind of imagery can be

00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:24,620
uploaded to open your map using the

00:21:22,309 --> 00:21:26,720
uploader or hosting your own node with

00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:28,159
every image you have doesn't need to be

00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,170
for those preparedness actually the

00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:33,180
image I showed from the Philippines that

00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:34,980
franzia from two brains it's normal

00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:37,710
imagery it's not after a disaster or

00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:40,580
anything answering your second question

00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:45,570
yes we do have the catalogue API it's

00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:48,360
publicly available this one is so this

00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:50,670
sexual response from api opener laptop

00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:52,350
org you can use this one to query for

00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:55,170
images you can put it by bounding boxes

00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:57,090
it's what powers the OEM browser and

00:21:55,170 --> 00:22:00,030
it's totally open and available and then

00:21:57,090 --> 00:22:09,770
you get the links for all the images to

00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:14,220
to use so i was wondering on the upload

00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:17,070
are there tools to help you geocode your

00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:19,590
images that they become useful for this

00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:22,380
map mapping purposes afterwards at this

00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:24,540
moment the images need to be prepared

00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:27,150
already they need to be uploaded in geo

00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:29,280
tiff format with all the geospatial

00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:32,010
others and everything needs to be to be

00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:34,050
ready the only thing that the OEM does

00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:37,830
its read from those headers and then

00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:39,420
make the make the image available so

00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:42,890
maybe in the future mail at the moment

00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:46,650
no you have to have the image prepared a

00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:48,360
great tool thanks very much my question

00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:50,840
is more to do with the imagery

00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:53,670
collecting the imagery are you actively

00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:57,240
encouraging people to provide imagery

00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:59,190
and who who are the main suppliers of

00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:02,280
that so there'll be a number of

00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:05,430
companies utility companies and so on

00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:07,200
who will be flying networks and taking a

00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:10,830
lot of imagery have you approached them

00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:12,030
about this using as a source yeah there

00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:14,250
have been attempts to talk with

00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:17,600
companies for imagery we have imagery

00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:19,890
from planet labs from Esther digital and

00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,180
from other like small company

00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:24,090
specialized for example the Philippines

00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:26,280
as well but yeah we do have like a call

00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:30,240
for action to help us with imagery as I

00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:33,000
mean I just did here that's this

00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:35,120
basically because we are looking for for

00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,120
them

00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:49,669
think I did really like the concept that

00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:52,390
user can add imagery to openstreetmap so

00:23:49,669 --> 00:23:56,840
you can have different details to map

00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:59,960
but I don't know because you talk about

00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:03,649
to making the application easy to use

00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:08,870
for every type of user I think that's

00:24:03,649 --> 00:24:13,279
the big idea of the conception but I

00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:16,419
don't think every user have the

00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:20,240
capability to get the data and to share

00:24:16,419 --> 00:24:24,350
those kinds of satellite or aerial data

00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:29,179
in your application because they need to

00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:31,970
be in in determined to know what is that

00:24:29,179 --> 00:24:35,690
battle to satellite data area data to be

00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:38,529
capable of share that I don't know if

00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:42,980
you understand because I bet anglish I

00:24:38,529 --> 00:24:45,440
think I think I am so basically the main

00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:48,039
focus of the OEM is the browser for

00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:51,020
users to find chair and use the imagery

00:24:48,039 --> 00:24:52,399
and buy this buy share I mean finding

00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:54,200
the imagery development the browser and

00:24:52,399 --> 00:24:56,270
share it with other people not

00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:58,940
necessarily share imagery of their own

00:24:56,270 --> 00:25:00,950
with the system that part yes it's for

00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:02,870
more specialized users you need to be

00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:05,179
able to capture the imagery you need to

00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:06,860
be able to process it in the correct

00:25:05,179 --> 00:25:09,950
format and the correct information to

00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:11,929
its Heather's and then upload it to our

00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:14,149
system that's not for everyone for now

00:25:11,929 --> 00:25:16,340
but the browser which is to find the

00:25:14,149 --> 00:25:18,380
imagery that's available for or easy to

00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:23,539
use for anyone and that was our main

00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:26,690
goal with it okay did you manage to to

00:25:23,539 --> 00:25:29,149
take in account that if someone buy a

00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:32,149
product aerial products we must be good

00:25:29,149 --> 00:25:34,669
and share it from your application there

00:25:32,149 --> 00:25:38,450
will be a ligand problems I think

00:25:34,669 --> 00:25:40,909
because if we buy image at it he not we

00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:45,460
probably able to share it with everyone

00:25:40,909 --> 00:25:48,740
but if he does it did you manage to

00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:50,360
solve those kind of problems okay that's

00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:53,530
a very good question I don't think we've

00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:55,570
had that problem yet if a user bison

00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:57,160
an image depends on the license it buys

00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:59,020
the image under it maybe buys the image

00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:01,300
with a license to do whatever you want

00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:03,730
and then it kind of effect uploaded and

00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:06,940
share it again under the license we need

00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:10,270
which is creative commons attribution if

00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:12,880
they don't do it I mean it didn't happen

00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:14,380
before so we would need to find a way so

00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,270
it probably the image would be removed

00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:17,500
from the system of course because we

00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:22,050
don't want any copyright infringement

00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:22,050
and then the user would be notified

00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:43,680
thank you for attention let's take our

00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:43,680
