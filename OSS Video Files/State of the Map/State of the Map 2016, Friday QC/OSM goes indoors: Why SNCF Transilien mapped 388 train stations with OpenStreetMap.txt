SNCF Transilien is a French public carrier that operates 3 million trips each day in the Paris region on 14 lines and in 388 stations. In order to create new services to passengers, the French community helped to map all the stations at great detail in OpenStreetMap, creating a large database of indoor geographical data.

Why did the French railway company SNCF support this open project? How did OSM became the main database to create maps for travelers’ information? SNCF Transilien’s Innovation Manager will share its strategy of co-contribution with the community.
