SNCF Transilien is a French public carrier that operates 3 million trips each day in the Paris region on 14 lines and in 388 stations. In order to create new services to passengers, the French community helped to map all the stations at great detail in OpenStreetMap, creating a large database of indoor geographical data.

Why did the French railway company SNCF support this open project? How did OSM became the main database to create maps for travelers’ information? SNCF Transilien’s Innovation Manager will share its strategy of co-contribution with the community.

hey good morning ladies and gentlemen

00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:05,730
welcome back to the second session in

00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:07,890
this session will focus on indoor

00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:10,980
mapping and mapping of remote areas a

00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:12,719
first speakers are from SNCF the french

00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:14,849
railway company and will talk to us

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:22,949
about indoor mapping of french railway

00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:25,170
stations and applause please hello

00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:28,050
everyone I'm since a gutin and the head

00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:30,990
of digital innovation team at SNCF

00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,730
casino and this is a vassal Gina he's a

00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:35,460
project manager for all open data

00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:37,710
projects and he followed Florence who

00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:40,800
may be here on the world also a lot on

00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:43,800
this project so we're very happy to be

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,840
here and we had to talk about why we

00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,090
chose openstreetmap for indoor mapping

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,090
and how we did it and what kind of

00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:54,600
issues did we faced so just to give you

00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:57,449
a few indications about who we are so

00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,699
SNCF is the national railway company

00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:04,739
that runs all transport by train across

00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:06,689
friends and trans senior is the company

00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:09,780
within the company that runs transport

00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:12,180
across Paris area so mainly in Paris

00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:17,400
suburbs and we share it with another

00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:20,490
company that runs the tubes in Paris so

00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:23,070
to give you a few figures castalia in

00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:25,890
paris area we have like 3.2 million

00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:29,820
travelers every day seventy percent of

00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:33,030
them are regularly commute every day to

00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:36,930
give you a comparison it's like if there

00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:39,540
was a airbus 380 taking off every six

00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:42,060
seconds so it's really a lot of livin on

00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:44,820
the especially on peak time it's quite

00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:49,439
crowded as it may be in most cities i

00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:52,979
guess some more figures so we have 14

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:59,659
trend lines across Paris area we also

00:01:52,979 --> 00:02:04,640
have 47 night buses we have 6000 trains

00:01:59,659 --> 00:02:08,220
commuting every day as well and 20 and

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:10,709
388 stations so it's quite a lot of

00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:13,310
stations and they are spread across all

00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:13,310
the territory

00:02:25,549 --> 00:02:33,060
so welcome everyone so that just to say

00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:34,830
that it's it's really mass transit and

00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:36,989
we call it must watch it on mass transit

00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:39,510
is really a challenge it's a challenge

00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:41,310
about having trains organized

00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:44,730
efficiently and it's also a challenge

00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:46,019
about services services is what we have

00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:49,260
had to get them out to have the right

00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:52,049
information how we secure the safety how

00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:56,489
we make their travel smooth when

00:02:52,049 --> 00:03:02,129
basically it's not always most so to do

00:02:56,489 --> 00:03:04,859
that to challenge and this this

00:03:02,129 --> 00:03:08,190
objective we have to create services

00:03:04,859 --> 00:03:11,040
that make traveling easier We Trust in

00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:16,040
Yonkers four years ago to have an open

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:19,470
innovation approach and use users

00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:21,180
partners developers data scientists to

00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:23,880
help us to imagine and create new

00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:26,370
services so that's how we studied the

00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:29,099
open innovation process the first

00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:33,150
example is open data so we started it

00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:35,430
four years ago 2012 and we have for

00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:39,380
instance the GTFS time table which is

00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:44,130
the most used we also have real-time

00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:48,630
schedule with an API and all in all SNCF

00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:50,819
now has 80 80 data set open so this is

00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:52,290
the screen of the website that added

00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:54,840
SNCF that come where you can find

00:03:52,290 --> 00:04:00,389
everything including the OpenStreetMap

00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:04,500
data within the open innovation process

00:04:00,389 --> 00:04:06,359
we also organized a few events to get to

00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:09,569
know the community and so that the

00:04:06,359 --> 00:04:12,480
communities get to know us so back in

00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:15,120
2012 d to a first akesson it was quite a

00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,010
first try so that's where we started

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,859
creating a service called tranquila

00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:23,340
which is a collaborating service we're

00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:24,990
all customer can tell how many how

00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:29,970
crowded is a train in the

00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:32,280
in that carriage and then in 2013 we did

00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:34,259
another one about accessibility how we

00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:37,380
can create new services for disabled

00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:39,539
people and that's where we realized we

00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:41,669
needed data as about our stations like

00:04:39,539 --> 00:04:44,639
the stairs elevators where are the

00:04:41,669 --> 00:04:46,650
entrance sixth hour and that's where we

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,349
started the OpenStreetMap adventure in

00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:53,360
2013 because we needed open data about

00:04:49,349 --> 00:04:56,699
the geographical data service stations

00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,699
so we started the mapping parties Reese

00:04:56,699 --> 00:05:02,970
openstreetmap contributors in France and

00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:07,650
then we did other challenges in 2015

00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:10,020
about tourism another example of the

00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:12,300
open innovation approach is our

00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:14,759
application there has been a new release

00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:18,210
in July and the application is clearly

00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:22,020
dedicated and made by customers since

00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:24,780
all customers or users can suggest new

00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:29,000
IDs and they can vote for suggested IDs

00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:32,400
and regularly we decide the roadmap

00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:38,849
integrating the services that has been

00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:40,919
suggested by users so now I'm going to

00:05:38,849 --> 00:05:45,810
focus a bit more on openstreetmap now

00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:49,590
you know it's better so how when how did

00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:52,229
we did we choose to to use openstreetmap

00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:55,469
so I told you that when one day when we

00:05:52,229 --> 00:05:57,360
started really focusing accessibility we

00:05:55,469 --> 00:06:00,419
realized we didn't have so many data as

00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:05,550
delocalized to create services like Maps

00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:07,530
eating Ares and when came to to this

00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:10,229
kind of data which shows up on his map

00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:12,719
for a different reason the first one is

00:06:10,229 --> 00:06:15,930
as you probably understood that we saw

00:06:12,719 --> 00:06:17,849
it as a powerful source of for open

00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:19,650
innovation because the ones with map has

00:06:17,849 --> 00:06:22,830
a large community of contributors of

00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:25,740
developers and for us it was like a

00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:29,159
large amount of data as we could we

00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:31,050
could publish as a public the second

00:06:29,159 --> 00:06:32,880
thing in that as a public company we

00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:37,050
have this culture of contributing to

00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:40,440
comments and for us having people

00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:43,919
using the open data is a way to create

00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:45,810
new services for transport and to do the

00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:50,759
promotion of public transport or

00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:52,669
inference the third thing is it's a

00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:56,370
challenge that we thought that maybe

00:06:52,669 --> 00:06:59,190
using openstreetmap means using a

00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:01,379
database which is alive with a community

00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:03,810
that contribute and that maybe to the

00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:07,470
head paths to keep up to date these

00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:10,740
data's with 388 stations it's really a

00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:13,169
challenge to keep the data up-to-date

00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:17,039
even with contributors inside the

00:07:13,169 --> 00:07:19,430
company so we thought why not having all

00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:23,340
the data open and enabling people to

00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:25,530
contribute and the fourth thing which is

00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:29,879
really important for us is that

00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:31,860
openstreetmap framework is open the data

00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:35,310
is open and it's easily shareable with

00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:39,449
other companies and especially as we are

00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:41,400
in a paris area we work together with

00:07:39,449 --> 00:07:44,849
another company I her tippy that runs

00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:47,279
transport in Paris we are under the

00:07:44,849 --> 00:07:49,889
supervision of the regional conceit

00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:51,630
which is called stiff so we need

00:07:49,889 --> 00:07:53,759
basically to work together all the time

00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:55,830
and we need to share the same data and

00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,750
speak the same language because we had

00:07:55,830 --> 00:08:02,639
lots of services that are really common

00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:05,669
and that's why we couldn't work on data

00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:07,889
as with which our clothes and cannot be

00:08:05,669 --> 00:08:10,680
really shared with others so that's

00:08:07,889 --> 00:08:12,840
really a key thing that is a dependent

00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:16,949
and the fact that we are we are together

00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:19,879
on an RL so now vasa is going to explain

00:08:16,949 --> 00:08:24,000
you how we did it which is a challenge

00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:28,889
so I'm will be more than practical side

00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:32,779
how did we do it and I will keep the

00:08:28,889 --> 00:08:36,510
sing a bit simple because everything

00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:39,539
more complex on indoor mapping will be

00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:42,419
shared by a capacity and the next talk

00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:49,500
and they will talk about how they did it

00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:50,220
in specific ways so we started in 2013

00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:53,310
when

00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:59,670
simply explained it we needed data about

00:08:53,310 --> 00:09:03,060
accessibility and we we did a small

00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:06,959
mapping parties in 30 of our stations

00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:09,810
and a lot of people during the Academy

00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:13,170
we are very very interesting interested

00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:15,660
by the data some people were longtime

00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:18,089
awesome contributors but some new ones

00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:22,379
were very interested because the data

00:09:18,089 --> 00:09:28,439
was a very very useful and so we decided

00:09:22,379 --> 00:09:32,180
to take it seriously and we hired 15

00:09:28,439 --> 00:09:35,639
people students interested by

00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:41,639
openstreetmap and we paid them to go to

00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:44,399
our 388 station 80 stations they were

00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:46,889
formed by osm force a little formation

00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:51,269
and the way they were supervised by us

00:09:46,889 --> 00:09:55,110
and we send it we send them in the all

00:09:51,269 --> 00:09:56,970
the region I took it took us something

00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:58,939
like two or three months because they

00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:02,040
were not available all the time and

00:09:58,939 --> 00:10:06,809
after that we add a lot a lot of datas

00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:10,860
on Paris region but we wanted to use it

00:10:06,809 --> 00:10:14,879
we want it to be more thorough more more

00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:18,000
perfect and we choose 80 stations that

00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:22,920
we we send other contractors at cart 0

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:25,290
CT and arcs IT to go to the very complex

00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:28,500
station because we had milk multi-level

00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:31,379
stations we had a very complex indoor

00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:33,660
mapping in a big big stations so the

00:10:31,379 --> 00:10:38,250
small one when this is just a platform

00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:41,220
and stop and we resort to 20 it will be

00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:45,319
ok but a very complex one and the indoor

00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:48,319
mapping it demands a lot of technical

00:10:45,319 --> 00:10:48,319
knowledge

00:10:54,889 --> 00:10:56,949
you

00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:50,190
then when the clients add two passes or

00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:52,560
tickets so we use Tom deleted it existed

00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:55,950
that we use it for another way it has

00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:59,520
not public park John style and sometimes

00:11:55,950 --> 00:12:05,790
we created new new elements new features

00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:08,430
like like train station entrance to

00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:13,560
mimic subway station entrance because we

00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:17,340
wanted to do some more more specific use

00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:21,270
of the data but we documented everything

00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:23,760
I'm the wiki and we nearly creating and

00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:26,010
nothing we just put all the existing

00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:28,650
part of the existing proposition of the

00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:31,940
existing documented features just in one

00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:37,020
part to map extensively our indoor

00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:39,810
stations so the process of collecting

00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:45,120
the data it was a kind of a classical

00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:50,070
one if you ever did some indoor mapping

00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:54,990
and micro mapping we resent people with

00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:57,390
field papers on the stations and they

00:12:54,990 --> 00:13:01,770
took photos and then took a lot of notes

00:12:57,390 --> 00:13:05,490
and we sometimes when we add them we

00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:08,040
give them plants but we are not not some

00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:11,900
we are not planned for every other of

00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:15,900
our stations and right we collected

00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:20,400
something like 15 thousands photos and a

00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:22,410
lot of them are in 360 degrees in our

00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:25,440
station right now we don't use it

00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:27,660
externally but when we will talk about

00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:32,160
it maybe at the tie at the end but we

00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:36,750
have a lot of photos to use also and and

00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:41,390
the people just use a GU SN and they

00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:43,850
mapped everything just by hand and

00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:50,190
that's a capital city will talk about

00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:54,810
extensively about the mapping process so

00:13:50,190 --> 00:14:02,180
today do you want to talk about it or

00:13:54,810 --> 00:14:06,200
today so we have our 388 stations mapped

00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:09,900
with a lot of datas we have more than

00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:13,140
47,000 elements so it's very diverse it

00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:15,960
comes with certain features such a big

00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:18,120
features and its entrance of the train

00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:21,720
station it's the buildings it's a

00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:24,779
platform it's a elevators we even mapped

00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:30,089
benches and clogs and informations

00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:33,870
screen and terminals we mapped shots of

00:14:30,089 --> 00:14:37,440
course but we also mapped every decade

00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:41,089
validator a lot of ticket validator and

00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:45,000
right now we're not really sure about

00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:47,550
when we can be the reference for the all

00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,100
the SNCF about our data but for the 80

00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:53,640
stations that we map so we map so

00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:56,279
loosely we are very very convient and we

00:14:53,640 --> 00:15:01,530
think that the the qualities is nearly

00:14:56,279 --> 00:15:04,700
perfect and and so yeah we met a little

00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:08,940
bit of our outdoors because we we needed

00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:12,180
park parkings we needed taxi when you

00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:18,950
need some other things to to show to the

00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:24,839
client so that's one of an example of a

00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:28,140
render of our map this is a stylesheet

00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:31,320
made by the SNCF for the SNCF purpose

00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:33,900
and this kind of style sheet is used we

00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:36,780
will show it after but in the conciliar

00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:42,949
application the official one and we use

00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:46,079
just that just osm that as coupled with

00:15:42,949 --> 00:15:49,649
this is stopped from another source but

00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:53,459
for the building and everything you can

00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:55,500
see it's just osm that does and you can

00:15:53,459 --> 00:15:58,500
see on the photos but there is method

00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:06,720
that has also on a lot of the and the

00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:10,649
under elements so now we have the data

00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:14,160
and we worked on creating services for

00:16:10,649 --> 00:16:15,839
customer so lots of people outside the

00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:19,290
company I probably creating services

00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:21,209
with the data so so are we and so the

00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:24,240
first thing is creating a map so that

00:16:21,209 --> 00:16:27,269
consumer can orient it in the station

00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:29,339
and can also have access to the to all

00:16:27,269 --> 00:16:32,160
the information and new services so that

00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:35,250
for the moment it's mainly a map that is

00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:38,070
in trance in your application now it has

00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:39,300
been made by a joke which is there so

00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:43,769
you probably will talk about it later

00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:46,470
but how you did it and that's a first

00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:49,170
step what we are thinking of is how we

00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:50,670
can use the map not only to be a map for

00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:52,949
people who get lost because we have

00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:54,720
seventy percent of customer who are

00:16:52,949 --> 00:16:57,209
regular so basically i think the another

00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,819
station so we really want to think about

00:16:57,209 --> 00:17:05,250
how the map can integrate new services

00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:10,319
and be the basic form for a new access

00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:12,449
to information and not just a map so

00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:15,900
basically in this map you can a customer

00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:21,020
can can check the station they can

00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:21,020
change level they can select services

00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:30,330
the second thing is that it's an idea we

00:17:26,189 --> 00:17:33,690
had already years ago is that how we can

00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:37,590
how can we enable everyone to contribute

00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:39,960
to the data openstreetmap is it's great

00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:44,309
but it's not easy for everyone to create

00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:47,400
that our modified data and as i said

00:17:44,309 --> 00:17:49,630
before one of our objective is that the

00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:52,690
data is alive on this being

00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:55,270
updated all the time and we have in awe

00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:58,330
station we have about 20,000 people

00:17:55,270 --> 00:18:02,430
working in the station or in the offices

00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:05,350
and we thought it's a great resource to

00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:08,440
keep up-to-date data so we created this

00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:12,160
up the goal is to make it very easy for

00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:16,660
everyone to to contribute so to create a

00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:20,940
new point to move an object to give more

00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:24,130
information but shop for instance and so

00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:26,530
this application is being built at the

00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:29,620
moment probably finish by the end of the

00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:32,740
year and the challenge after is to make

00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:34,720
it used by people so for the moment we

00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:37,390
want to dedicate it to the people in the

00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:40,920
stations and then we'll see how we can

00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:51,130
open it to a broader community but it

00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:54,700
gives a few challenges so enriching the

00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:59,140
map existing on in our application with

00:18:54,700 --> 00:19:02,230
new services it's a one of a project so

00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:03,970
professional application to keep the

00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:06,490
data up-to-date is and resolve a project

00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:08,560
but we have a lot of other ideas and the

00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:12,480
big project right now that being

00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:16,210
developed in the SNCF we are creating an

00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:19,420
SSN sense an a-type server just for ice

00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:21,790
and service SNCF services because when

00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:24,300
we started four years ago to work with

00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:27,820
open twist sweet map it was not very

00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:31,750
well used inside of the SNCF but right

00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:34,780
now inside for very very specific

00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:39,280
application but when when a service has

00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:42,820
to to map something eeee it's a lot of

00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:46,660
time you use openstreetmap at least the

00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:50,470
tiles and not not maybe the real data

00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:53,710
but just as a map and but there is a lot

00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:56,200
of maps and people are using the

00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:58,830
official tiles a lot and we think it

00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:02,169
will be better for the SNCF to quit is

00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:05,499
hung tight server to

00:20:02,169 --> 00:20:08,409
impression from the community and so

00:20:05,499 --> 00:20:12,909
we're working on it and it's it's live

00:20:08,409 --> 00:20:15,129
but it's not in industrialized inside

00:20:12,909 --> 00:20:17,499
the SNCF it's not well used right now

00:20:15,129 --> 00:20:19,029
but we think that at the end of the year

00:20:17,499 --> 00:20:25,090
or beginning of the next year it will be

00:20:19,029 --> 00:20:28,690
a more developed we also working in

00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:33,820
trans alia from pushing the information

00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:36,580
of openstreetmap in our G's right not we

00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:38,799
don't have a real g's in Tanzania they

00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:42,119
are creating creating it and so we're

00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:45,220
working with them to make them use more

00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:47,619
the more of the information they can

00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:50,919
from open street map it's not an easy

00:20:47,619 --> 00:20:53,730
process right really because the people

00:20:50,919 --> 00:20:57,309
managing the equipment and the

00:20:53,730 --> 00:21:01,809
physiology of the SNCF the open

00:20:57,309 --> 00:21:05,499
mentality is not very very shared and

00:21:01,809 --> 00:21:07,509
it's it's a kind of a fight of every so

00:21:05,499 --> 00:21:10,690
that way we're working on it so we can't

00:21:07,509 --> 00:21:12,460
promise anything but I think it could be

00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:16,320
very very very important for the

00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:21,909
incentive to use this that kind of data

00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:24,909
and we all see we also working on the

00:21:21,909 --> 00:21:27,249
putting real-time data on all maps in

00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:29,440
our application at the end of the year

00:21:27,249 --> 00:21:35,559
or beginning of the next year we will be

00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:38,019
able to to to to show the state of the

00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:40,029
elevators if an elevator is working or

00:21:38,019 --> 00:21:46,649
not working so we are plugging the

00:21:40,029 --> 00:21:46,649
inside API of the SNCF to awesome data

00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:56,109
time is over I just want to conclude in

00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:57,820
one sentence two sentences now we have a

00:21:56,109 --> 00:22:01,929
few challenge the first thing is where

00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:05,030
we really would really like to know what

00:22:01,929 --> 00:22:08,100
can help the community to

00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:10,530
to work on the data and use it we are we

00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:13,470
willing to know what kind of use is made

00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:15,720
with the data and and one of the

00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:19,470
challenge which is also more internal as

00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:22,500
a son said is that we are the question

00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:25,830
we we face now is how do we mix this

00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:28,530
external source of data with internal

00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:32,580
data we really want to merge it to have

00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:35,160
like a unique source of data but in

00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:36,480
companies like SNCF we have we need to

00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:40,260
have some data which are really

00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:42,450
controlled and we haven't want to be

00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:44,460
sure that where it is its

00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:47,190
characteristics and that really one of

00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:49,080
the challenge to go further and but it's

00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:51,840
really something which is moving on the

00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:53,250
right direction in the company and we

00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,580
think it's really promising for the

00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:55,580
future

00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:10,680
any questions please wait for the

00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,680
microphone

00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:25,210
hi thank you for the talk I just have

00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:28,930
one more or less related question it's

00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:31,570
SNCF considering deploying an indoor

00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:33,540
location system or do you actually think

00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:39,000
that that would make any sense to

00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:41,100
support this kind of application and

00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,870
that's something we are looking at

00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:45,970
indeed to add new services in the map

00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:50,620
and especially location or even routine

00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:53,320
indoor and we still haven't really

00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:56,620
measured what kind of efforts we need to

00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:58,809
do it and I think we'll probably need to

00:23:56,620 --> 00:24:03,309
still to compare what are the benefits

00:23:58,809 --> 00:24:07,080
for the user versus the cost and we know

00:24:03,309 --> 00:24:10,420
some other solutions already do it not

00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:12,760
always that so well but they do it and

00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:14,890
they're going to do it better so yeah we

00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:21,760
we are looking at it but we don't have

00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:26,710
the project yet a question concerning

00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:31,920
your applications as any of them open

00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:35,230
source or they're all closed source and

00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:39,280
in the application hosted on it's not

00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:41,410
open source it's not the same for Matt

00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:45,550
Matt Matt Matt Matt McKay which is the

00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:52,990
application for folks to contribute it's

00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:54,910
not a completely open source I that was

00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:58,330
very interesting so it's often difficult

00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:59,530
to convince back here in the back it's

00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:01,540
often difficult to convince big

00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:03,850
organizations or government agencies to

00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:06,070
use open data at openstreetmap how did

00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:10,990
you convince your supervisors or other

00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:12,970
parts the agency to do it I think we did

00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:17,530
it a bit in a sneaky way because we did

00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:20,590
it step by step and so that's a bit the

00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:23,260
way we we usually work for digital

00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:26,380
innovation we try to to prove things and

00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:28,350
then to have agreements to go further so

00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:31,679
the beginning we started

00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:34,320
a hackathon about accessibility so as we

00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:36,150
didn't have any data Jerrica lies inside

00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,770
the company we needed to create them so

00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:41,360
that's how we started with openstreetmap

00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:44,520
but it was still at a small scale and

00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:46,650
then it worked we saw at the hackathon

00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:49,200
that lots of teams worked on it on the

00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:50,730
created new services with it and like

00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,700
for instance now we are really in

00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:55,620
destroy lysing an application for

00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:59,160
disabled people that use the maps and

00:25:55,620 --> 00:26:03,260
the data is so so it's really a proof

00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:09,150
that it's it's a few phanou services and

00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:11,070
so after that yeah we decided to have

00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:12,870
the data as for all the stations because

00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:15,720
nobody's going to use it if we just have

00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:17,850
one line so that's how we did it on step

00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:19,620
by step after we we thought okay we are

00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:22,260
doing map but the maps of the last

00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:24,929
station they're not that good so we we

00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:26,880
decided to improve them so we went step

00:26:24,929 --> 00:26:31,110
by step and now we are ready at a stage

00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:35,610
when the issue is shall we use this

00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:37,590
database for lots form not everything

00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:41,280
but eighty percent of the services or

00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:43,530
shall we shall we keep it on one side

00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:45,090
and inside the company we keep having

00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:47,940
our internal system and that's really

00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:51,750
the issue we face now and so we have a

00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:55,470
few answers but yeah now we'd say we are

00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:57,270
at a step point again so we'll see how

00:26:55,470 --> 00:27:01,110
it goes maybe next year we can tell you

00:26:57,270 --> 00:27:02,789
about it and sorry I just to continue I

00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:05,909
think one of the question also for the

00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:08,730
SNCF is very practical it's google maps

00:27:05,909 --> 00:27:11,220
it exists it's a very easy for company

00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:14,789
to use it and usually a lot of big

00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:17,400
company use it and how do you convince a

00:27:14,789 --> 00:27:21,539
big company to use something like that

00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:25,320
compared to google maps and the api one

00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:27,960
of the main thing is you use the map

00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:31,500
with the SNCF style sheet it's with

00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:34,090
multi-level you you can't create this

00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:40,190
level of them

00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:42,470
the start of yeah with a google map it's

00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:44,870
just a one nut and you can't show

00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:48,950
anything Google don't want to show and

00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:51,560
usually just shots so in conciliar we

00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:53,750
wanted to show services and we want to

00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:55,700
add new services and we want to show a

00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:57,980
lot of things and it's just possible

00:27:55,700 --> 00:28:01,550
with this kind of that I this kind of

00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:04,730
map so it's very important to convince

00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:06,590
people inside that you can't you can

00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:09,590
modify and you can think about new

00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:11,570
services and I new services to maps it's

00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:13,520
not just an easy way because we are to

00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:18,350
develop it you have text time it takes

00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:20,690
money sometimes usually but you can

00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:30,050
imagine new things you can't do that

00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:33,350
with google so I think I have the mic so

00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:36,290
it may be me thank you for that answer

00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:41,000
it partially answers the question that I

00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:44,150
have for you and the question is what

00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,790
was your initial motivation for doing

00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:49,700
this work it's clear now that you're

00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:52,490
finding applications but you somebody

00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:55,010
somewhere had an idea and a motivation

00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:57,080
to do something different and the reason

00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:59,630
I'm interested in your answer is because

00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:02,480
I am certainly in this situation and

00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:05,330
maybe others here too in which we are

00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:09,500
always trying to balance the push of a

00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:12,560
supply for something to all the balance

00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:14,120
with generating demand and in this case

00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:16,310
I think that's what you all have gone

00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:18,920
through two so to repeat the question

00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:21,680
what was your motivation for engaging in

00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:27,890
something new that no one else had yet

00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:30,170
identified as a problem to address and I

00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:33,380
think my answer would be quite the same

00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:37,190
as my answer to your question we didn't

00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:39,110
have a precise goal at the beginning

00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:43,340
when we have the small goal which was

00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:44,269
how can we give data as to developers to

00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:47,059
create services for

00:29:44,269 --> 00:29:50,169
disabled people and then we saw other

00:29:47,059 --> 00:29:52,700
uses and then we had a new objective and

00:29:50,169 --> 00:29:56,629
step by step we had a new objective and

00:29:52,700 --> 00:30:00,169
we saw new and new new way to value the

00:29:56,629 --> 00:30:03,679
data as inside assoc office for the

00:30:00,169 --> 00:30:06,889
customers and we are still seeing new

00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:09,799
things so we didn't have like a vision

00:30:06,889 --> 00:30:13,459
before and I remember we met a DB which

00:30:09,799 --> 00:30:16,849
is the other operator in Paris i think

00:30:13,459 --> 00:30:19,249
it was in 2014 so we had one year of

00:30:16,849 --> 00:30:21,979
experience with open sitemap and they

00:30:19,249 --> 00:30:25,609
asked us yeah we are looking at doing it

00:30:21,979 --> 00:30:26,959
but how do you value that and I couldn't

00:30:25,609 --> 00:30:30,919
really answer to this question because

00:30:26,959 --> 00:30:33,709
we we valued it but we created new

00:30:30,919 --> 00:30:35,899
services at the beginning but small

00:30:33,709 --> 00:30:38,119
services and we didn't have the vision

00:30:35,899 --> 00:30:42,079
but I think it's also how it works

00:30:38,119 --> 00:30:44,029
sometimes with with innovation it's you

00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:47,089
you don't know where you're going but

00:30:44,029 --> 00:31:02,529
you see the you see new things as you

00:30:47,089 --> 00:31:02,529
move on thank you

00:31:05,049 --> 00:31:07,110
