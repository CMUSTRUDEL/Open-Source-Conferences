Lightning Talk session.

## Kenya Covid-19 Tracker
*Zacharia Muindi*

Map Kibera has launched the Kenya COVID-19 Tracker Ushahidi Instance to document geospatial data, map out resources and services being offered to the community in response to Covid-19 and track cases across Kenya. The project will improve OSM basemaps in Kibera and other informal settlements of Nairobi to allow visualisation of current status and hotspots.

## Mapping Gender issues in Kenya
*Caroline Akoth (WiGIS, Kenya)*

This lightning talk will cover Women in GIS, Kenya efforts to map gender issues in Kenya with support of our community, through #DataViz Challenges.

## Where can you dine like a king?
*Stefan Keller* - [Whitepaper](https://md.coredump.ch/s/H1IQbLzjU), [Slides](https://www.slideshare.net/StefanKeller/where-can-you-dine-like-a-king) 

Synchronizing Local Datasets and OpenStreetMap using QGIS.

## Nurturing a Ministry of Mapping
*David Garcia*

Who cares for the mapmakers who care? I would like to share a story about a geospatial collective about OSM and FOSS4G that we have been trying to organise in the Philippines during the pandemic.

## Building the Street View Experience, Lagos, Nigeria
*Ayo Akinseye* - [Website](http://www.moriwo.com/), [Slides](https://digitalspatial.com/sotm2020/presentation/)

For better Geo visualization, we built a website with Geo referenced 360 degree panorama photos. Lagos, Nigeria is our first phase.

## What's new on OSMCha?
*Wille Marcel*

OSMCha is a validation tool for OpenStreetMap. On the last months we added some new features like visualization of relation members and more options of background imagery. Get updated on OSMCha with this talk.

## [GeoLadies PH](https://www.facebook.com/geoladiesph/)
*Arnalie Vicario*

Brief talk about GeoLadies PH, which was inspired by Maning Sambale's "How Do We Change the Ratio?" presentation in 2014. GeoLadies PH dvocates incommunity diversity, collaborative participation and affirmative spaces forwomen and under-represented communities in OpenStreetMap and the localgeospatial science community.

## Fighting FGM (Female Genital Mutilation) with Maps

you

00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:12,490
hi my name is Zach oh boy

00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:14,990
I work with Mahavira as they lead mapa

00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:17,510
in the first case of coronavirus was

00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:20,329
reportedly Kenya I remember very well I

00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:24,349
was still in the office and the news

00:00:20,329 --> 00:00:29,329
came out the story spread very fast in

00:00:24,349 --> 00:00:31,489
Tierra and so afraid I could see it

00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:34,489
everywhere moving around that was the

00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:37,700
main discussion that were having and it

00:00:34,489 --> 00:00:42,380
was like finally the disease is here

00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:45,340
with us and there was a lot of fear this

00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:47,300
is going to affect the type of Tierra

00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:49,910
considering the nature of the of the

00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:53,420
area how closely the house constructed

00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:57,380
next to each other and other things like

00:00:53,420 --> 00:01:01,760
how people live in a communal setup when

00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:05,239
you are waking up we are going to job to

00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:07,909
close that action with someone does that

00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:09,490
fear that if this disease happens to pay

00:01:07,909 --> 00:01:12,590
attention to the slam they need to

00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:14,060
create a great havoc in the community

00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:16,580
and there would be high number of

00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:18,440
casualties another thing that was going

00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:20,409
around that time was there was a lot of

00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:24,170
misinformation

00:01:20,409 --> 00:01:26,600
it doesn't affect people this is not

00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:30,770
affect children and because of the

00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:33,020
nature of the weather admit that cannot

00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:39,979
get the disease so there's a lot of

00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:41,810
information that was because of this

00:01:39,979 --> 00:01:45,590
information getting the right

00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:48,049
information and because of that we set

00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:51,430
up a covenant in tracker platform

00:01:48,049 --> 00:01:51,430
partnership with Shahidi

00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:59,510
misinformation that was going around in

00:01:56,210 --> 00:02:01,600
providing with the relevant and

00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:03,860
up-to-date information about the disease

00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,110
events that are happening around the

00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:08,210
poor that are being released when the

00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:11,150
Minister of Health maybe

00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:14,510
and some reliable information like

00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:17,810
washing hands keeping distance if you

00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:20,150
happen to get the symptoms the best

00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:23,120
approach to take to seek medical

00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:25,430
attention so this information gathering

00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,400
from different sources and posting them

00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:30,110
on the shady platform and sharing also

00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,080
back to the community another thing that

00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:34,340
you also doing we realized the biggest

00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:37,970
challenge that that the people of Cuba

00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:40,550
were facing was directed to their hands

00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:42,770
then is that challenge of inadequate

00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:45,770
resources such as running water in those

00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:48,560
homes people access from water taps that

00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:49,940
I mounted outside their homes who don't

00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,770
have like running water in their homes

00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:54,140
so this was going to prove to be a

00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:56,000
challenge so as an organization through

00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:58,790
the the platform we were also mapping

00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,800
other resources that are being provided

00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:02,720
by different organization in the

00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,460
community so the position that were

00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,100
coming on the ground and already

00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:09,380
existing organizations offering support

00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:12,770
to the community like putting up hand

00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:17,570
wash points and in strategic points to

00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:21,910
provide clean water and soap to wash

00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:25,190
their hands and a lot of sensitization

00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:27,890
about the disease and now to make sure

00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:29,540
that you follow the directives that are

00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:32,210
given by the government to flatten the

00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:34,070
curve through the platform we have been

00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:35,840
mapping cases different cases as

00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:38,270
reported by the Minister of Health and

00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,880
also mapping on different resources

00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:43,390
provided by different organizations this

00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:47,510
is to make sure that also these

00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:49,850
distribution of resources and so working

00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:52,310
closely with organization seeing how

00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:54,110
they can this information to supplement

00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:57,490
some of the activities that are already

00:03:54,110 --> 00:04:00,050
going on so the platform uses the same

00:03:57,490 --> 00:04:01,400
base map so as people are also

00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:03,650
interacting the information that we are

00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:10,100
putting up on the site they are also

00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:12,890
able to interact with the to see reports

00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:16,700
as they are being posted on the platform

00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:18,980
they can also be able to see that or say

00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:20,720
in specific area so

00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:22,850
not only working give me over to the

00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,940
main focus but you also mapping out

00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:28,400
other cases and other resources in other

00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:30,950
informal settlements of Nairobi and also

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:34,750
countrywide so it isn't a good a finding

00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:37,310
from odds through the rapid response

00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:49,690
grants to support the work that you are

00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:49,690
doing Santi

00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:04,309
hi everyone my name is Carolina quad and

00:05:02,029 --> 00:05:06,589
I focus on operations lead for women in

00:05:04,309 --> 00:05:08,330
jazz Kenya and we're excited to be here

00:05:06,589 --> 00:05:10,520
hi everyone my name is name is alamelu

00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:13,219
gay and the research and development kid

00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:16,069
at women in jazz Kenny hi my name is

00:05:13,219 --> 00:05:21,080
Sofia again the technical lead for women

00:05:16,069 --> 00:05:22,939
engineers in hi guys my name is Yuri

00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:25,639
Ocotillo I'm the strategy and business

00:05:22,939 --> 00:05:29,599
leader to many gs Kenya also really

00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:32,499
excited to be here so the main goal way

00:05:29,599 --> 00:05:35,300
we forms yes women in jazz can young was

00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:37,249
from our own personal experiences and it

00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:39,709
was all towards building an inclusive

00:05:37,249 --> 00:05:41,839
society that is able to celebrate women

00:05:39,709 --> 00:05:43,490
but at the same time enabled women and

00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:45,110
create create an enabling environment

00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:46,789
for women and mentor them to become

00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:48,019
the-best-version-of-yourself

00:05:46,789 --> 00:05:50,659
of themselves within the geospatial

00:05:48,019 --> 00:05:52,519
space so that was the main inspiration

00:05:50,659 --> 00:05:54,949
of women in jazz Kenya and we've really

00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:56,749
grown beyond that and that's what you

00:05:54,949 --> 00:05:58,639
want for us one today our projects and

00:05:56,749 --> 00:06:02,019
our visualization challenges and how we

00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,019
aim to each other it is routine

00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:09,589
OpenStreetMap yeah so at remaining J's

00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:11,719
Kenya work we work focusing on solving

00:06:09,589 --> 00:06:14,569
highlighting and solving women issues

00:06:11,719 --> 00:06:17,119
and we work within four pillars one on

00:06:14,569 --> 00:06:19,279
mentorship our two on projects three on

00:06:17,119 --> 00:06:22,550
events in networking and then the fourth

00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:24,949
one on data visualization challenges and

00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:27,289
today for for this specific topic we'll

00:06:24,949 --> 00:06:29,349
focus on our projects community mapping

00:06:27,289 --> 00:06:31,219
using data visualization challenges

00:06:29,349 --> 00:06:34,099
focusing on the projects that we've been

00:06:31,219 --> 00:06:35,869
able to have a sofa that's on cervical

00:06:34,099 --> 00:06:37,909
cancer awareness and also gender-based

00:06:35,869 --> 00:06:40,219
violence and a future one that's

00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:43,819
actually just launched on teenage

00:06:40,219 --> 00:06:45,979
pregnancies in Kenya yeah maybe I can

00:06:43,819 --> 00:06:48,680
speak a bit on the first like cervical

00:06:45,979 --> 00:06:50,419
cancer um we did this challenge early on

00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:53,180
in DC and it was a great challenge where

00:06:50,419 --> 00:06:54,740
we saw several outcomes from it where we

00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:56,749
were able to see various information

00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:59,509
that would be useful for the public such

00:06:56,749 --> 00:07:01,300
as and where one can go for testing of

00:06:59,509 --> 00:07:03,910
cervical cancer

00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:05,530
if various information that would be

00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:08,140
useful for the public on what type of

00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:10,210
test and how and what is actually means

00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:12,340
when it comes to seven for cancer and

00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:14,560
some of this information is very key and

00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:16,390
important for people out there and

00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,700
therefore beyond just having these

00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:21,610
challenges our next step will definitely

00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:23,560
go into working with the community again

00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:27,370
to ensure that this information is made

00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:29,830
available like on OSF so a key benefit

00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:31,150
that has occurred as we progress with

00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:33,790
the projects that we've worked on

00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:36,610
including from the cervical cancer to a

00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:39,490
project on gender-based violence our

00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:41,800
coverage response project we got a very

00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:44,440
rich data set security data set on

00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:46,930
health practitioner distribution as well

00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:49,600
as health facilities in the country and

00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:51,580
this project has shown us that we would

00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:55,440
become a major conduit to gather

00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:58,570
information from a community based from

00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:02,560
sourcing and this allows us to be able

00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:04,870
to gather very curated very fresh later

00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,210
that we can be able to contribute to SM

00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:08,860
and we hope to contribute further with

00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:12,580
further projects that were able to get

00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:14,290
into I think what makes our second the

00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:16,000
obvious platform to go to is the fact

00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:17,800
that it's driven by communities and it's

00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,930
for communities that's the very basis of

00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,810
what drives RSM and that's the very

00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:25,180
basis of what drives many jazz projects

00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:27,700
our projects are mainly to address Jenna

00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:29,260
B's Jenna issues and to let me do that

00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:30,970
by amplifying the voices of women and

00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:32,770
osm is a really good platform simply

00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:34,810
because it brings about inclusivity and

00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:36,700
enables everyone to access this data and

00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:38,620
that's why I think it's really

00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:41,830
futuristic for women in jazz Kenya end

00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:44,530
for us as that team to push a lot each

00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:46,300
other to enable researchers developers

00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:47,800
programmers knowledge experts and anyone

00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:50,290
who's interested in accessing this data

00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:54,310
to build or innovate around generous

00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:56,440
social you will be asking why and how we

00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:58,380
will be able to make this happen we are

00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:00,820
going to be hosting a mapper done soon

00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:02,020
for us to enable our community and

00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:04,780
different communities that would like to

00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:06,400
come together to do this so during this

00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:08,380
marathon will make available the D

00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:11,560
trusted that we've been using on health

00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:13,990
facilities where cervical cancer is

00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:15,220
available but we're sorry coal cancer

00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:18,370
services are available

00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:20,290
to also make available datasets on kind

00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:22,389
of chess and screening that is available

00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:26,740
for cervical cancer to also make

00:09:22,389 --> 00:09:29,079
available deficits on GBV safehouses GBV

00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:31,689
areas where you can report and also

00:09:29,079 --> 00:09:33,100
where you can go for supports if you if

00:09:31,689 --> 00:09:37,990
you fall pregnant from teenage

00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:40,029
pregnancies yeah so we have gathered and

00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:42,459
learned a lot from various communities

00:09:40,029 --> 00:09:44,589
such as osm that allowed us to get to

00:09:42,459 --> 00:09:46,660
where we are as women in jails and we

00:09:44,589 --> 00:09:49,329
are very very excited to contribute back

00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:51,189
to give back to this community so we

00:09:49,329 --> 00:09:53,110
have the one in jest are very excited to

00:09:51,189 --> 00:09:56,490
be part of straighten them up thank you

00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:56,490
thank you guys

00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:19,709
hi my name is Stefan Keller this laghing

00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:22,019
talk is about an important question but

00:10:19,709 --> 00:10:25,139
before continuing please allow me to

00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:27,360
switch off the camera right now again so

00:10:25,139 --> 00:10:29,630
that you can get a full view on the

00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,630
slides

00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:37,490
this is about the following question

00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:39,650
where can you dine like a king and it's

00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:43,060
about synchronizing local data sets and

00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:46,180
of sleep map using QGIS

00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:49,270
if written white paper a draft on this

00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:52,930
topic and it's indicated here on the

00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:56,470
wiki page and at the end of those slides

00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:58,330
and mentioning he is that's a

00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:01,720
cross-platform desktop geographic

00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:04,360
information system application it's open

00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:09,630
source and not that much more

00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:09,630
complicated than Joe some I think

00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:18,420
of the recent years I've got asked

00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:21,540
modern ones about one or more use cases

00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:24,600
as I've compared here I'll mention only

00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:27,209
the first one because of time so as a

00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:29,850
gastronomy I'm compiling a list of

00:11:27,209 --> 00:11:34,620
restaurants with comments which have the

00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:35,940
ambience of a real castle and we want

00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:40,649
still to be in sync

00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:43,890
without street map how can we do that as

00:11:40,649 --> 00:11:46,890
many of you know the means to extract of

00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:49,980
the map data is to use overpass tool

00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:53,220
ball and I have to find a query which

00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:56,040
defines an area of Switzerland gets me

00:11:53,220 --> 00:12:01,170
all castles and then all restaurants

00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:03,390
within 30 meters if the output is Center

00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:07,709
which means area objects you don't sleep

00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:11,339
map are being calculated as unconverted

00:12:07,709 --> 00:12:14,430
to a point this is an example of a

00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:19,020
workflow using the OSM Data Sync plug-in

00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:21,930
we start with setting all up and the

00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:25,290
most interesting thing is that we

00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:29,190
convert the give Jason file we get from

00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:32,640
the overpass to the query to Gale

00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:36,149
package and within QGIS we enhance the

00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:39,959
schema with two mandatory attributes one

00:12:36,149 --> 00:12:43,200
is the OSM ID and the other one is the

00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:46,380
state and then we start rating the data

00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:49,649
set and we edit it and by pushing

00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:53,790
synchronize we keep up to date this is a

00:12:49,649 --> 00:12:57,720
detailed page which shows all the

00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:59,880
different possible states and I have to

00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:03,899
make it short because of the lack of

00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:09,329
time so let's start with the first part

00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:14,579
which is the fake data and you see six

00:13:09,329 --> 00:13:19,170
features which have a primary key F ID

00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:21,770
and which have an ID and which have a

00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:23,500
name from our sleep map which have a

00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:26,700
cuisine

00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:29,620
and coins and the comments is a local

00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:31,900
attribute I've added and it's which is

00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:34,330
maintained locally and there is this

00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:36,970
important synchronization state the

00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:40,930
synchronization is being done through D

00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:44,560
of street map ID like this one here and

00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:47,920
now you'll see indicated in red changes

00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:50,830
and I have made in this case because

00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:54,730
that's the setup phase the first edition

00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:58,660
it's a comment of mine I also as a user

00:13:54,730 --> 00:14:01,420
flagged this feature to be ignored

00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:05,010
because it's not interesting and I have

00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:08,470
also added locally this feature then

00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:11,890
I've pushed the synchronization button

00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:14,500
and I'm getting back seven records one

00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:17,800
more as before for OpenStreetMap since

00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:21,460
in the meantime there has been a record

00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:24,520
a new one being added and by someone in

00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:28,360
home sleep map those two lamb records

00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:32,020
remain unchanged and even this one

00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:35,260
remains unchanged so my comment goes

00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:37,660
untouched this is a feature not found in

00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:40,890
Oak Street Map so I delete it locally

00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:43,750
also the feature number three and then

00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:47,530
feature number one and two are two

00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:49,800
examples of J this is a preview it's a

00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:54,100
mocked up graphical user interface of

00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:58,589
the new OS M data sink which is plug-in

00:14:54,100 --> 00:15:03,960
and let's move right to the left down

00:14:58,589 --> 00:15:06,750
where we see controls in order to

00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:10,390
iterate over the features we see

00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:15,580
currently feature number three shown

00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:17,770
with this node and the most important

00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:21,010
information here is that we have radio

00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:23,890
buttons to control the st. state which

00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:27,910
is currently unchanged typically a user

00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:31,839
would change the state manually to

00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:34,630
ignored or to local we fully ask if

00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:37,180
there is an answer of where you can dine

00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:40,360
like a king in Switzerland and

00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:43,320
made a small map on you map indicated

00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:47,490
here as well as I've indicated

00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:53,260
repository where I welcome feedback on

00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:55,680
this URL and did I mention which is the

00:15:53,260 --> 00:16:01,410
most beautiful campus of Switzerland

00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:01,410
have a look at the following slide by

00:16:07,739 --> 00:16:12,730
duh and Korra

00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:15,429
I am mapmaker David and I would like to

00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:18,269
share with you how we are nurturing the

00:16:15,429 --> 00:16:24,489
ministry of mapping in the Philippines

00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:26,649
who cares for the mapmakers who care map

00:16:24,489 --> 00:16:29,199
makers especially those in the open data

00:16:26,649 --> 00:16:31,929
and open Geospatial communities care a

00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:35,679
lot about the world if you volunteer to

00:16:31,929 --> 00:16:37,720
help those people in crises we provide

00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:39,819
data for the Commons and maintain detect

00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:41,619
behind it we nurture a lot of

00:16:39,819 --> 00:16:44,379
relationships between many communities

00:16:41,619 --> 00:16:46,839
we carry and great memories of how

00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:48,660
mapping was done before even planned

00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:51,309
what should be done later in the future

00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:52,689
we do these as part of the OpenStreetMap

00:16:51,309 --> 00:16:55,299
foss4g

00:16:52,689 --> 00:16:58,059
and wider mapping communities and so

00:16:55,299 --> 00:17:00,279
much more these Labour's are more

00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:02,040
difficult to do if you come from a

00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:04,480
historically marginalized and

00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:07,240
structurally oppressed background and

00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:10,329
present eye cream at makers in the

00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:14,350
Philippines who cares for the map makers

00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:16,149
who care we map makers in the

00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:19,360
Philippines and in the Pacific in

00:17:16,149 --> 00:17:24,760
general face common intersecting issues

00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:27,659
as listed here and these things prevent

00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:29,889
us from contributing meaningfully and

00:17:27,659 --> 00:17:31,769
consistently to projects like Open

00:17:29,889 --> 00:17:34,510
Street Map and foss4g

00:17:31,769 --> 00:17:39,130
there are so many risks and dangers that

00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:40,779
we face even from fellow mappers some of

00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:44,590
us are even struggling to put food on

00:17:40,779 --> 00:17:48,070
the table map makers are people too and

00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:50,320
we shouldn't forget that so when the

00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:53,679
pandemic happened you wanted to figure

00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:55,720
out an organizational way of helping

00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:58,960
communities while making sure that our

00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:02,230
own health as geospatial workers are

00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:04,750
insured you also wanted to include those

00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:07,210
who while not being regular data and

00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:09,880
tech interpreters to open street map and

00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:11,520
phosphor G are so integral in making

00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,800
sure

00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:16,770
that mapping becomes excellent and

00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:22,080
respectful people like writers reporters

00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:24,510
mental health experts etc and we were

00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,370
trying to figure out the social glues

00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:29,130
that hold map makers and their

00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:32,940
communities together let's take a step

00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:36,290
back when our ancestors were exploring

00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:38,610
the greatest ocean and earth the Pacific

00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:40,290
they were relying not only on themselves

00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:43,170
and their knowledge but on their

00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:45,990
communities this is a map I made about I

00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:48,720
was Aneesha which is a map made in the

00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:50,430
tradition of the stick charts I believe

00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:53,790
that people Sepik map makers have the

00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:57,630
capability and capacity to be one of the

00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:59,840
best map makers of on earth if you only

00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:03,210
take care of each other more properly

00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:05,220
hence the Ministry of mapping we are a

00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:08,190
geospatial collective cared for and

00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:11,010
owned by geospatial rivers and we want

00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:13,740
to serve the people with open geospatial

00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:17,790
data deck and science through open and

00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:20,100
fair work here we are the current

00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:22,680
members of the collective which is

00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:24,990
slowly growing through the months and I

00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:26,760
just want to thank everyone who helped

00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:32,280
us in this journey and everyone who are

00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:35,280
still doing the work so for now we are

00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:36,480
trying to figure out how to relate to

00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:40,560
each other better through a code of

00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:42,510
conduct we want to call it cartography

00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:46,110
for now a code of kindness for a mapping

00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:48,840
community with this code of conduct we

00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:51,710
want to create a fertile and caring

00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:54,630
environment for diversity fairness

00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:56,580
connecting initiatives we are supported

00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:59,820
by a disaster clinical psychologist

00:19:56,580 --> 00:20:02,060
named dr. John Gill Erin you support

00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:04,470
open data and open tech to special

00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:06,840
projects like those at openstreetmap and

00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:09,300
foss4g you want to maintain our ties

00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:12,090
with various communities and the

00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:15,180
Philippines and in Pacific in general we

00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:18,930
discuss what the right thing to do is in

00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:20,760
every important step and most of all we

00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:25,800
focus on relationships with people and

00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:28,470
land this is the core of the core of con

00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:30,780
for now that the mapmaker and any

00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:32,880
community member in the minister of

00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:34,980
mapping are more important that the maps

00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,680
and the mapping and that the community

00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:41,430
being mapped is more important than the

00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:44,220
map maker maps and mapping combined he

00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:46,470
really want to realize these principles

00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:48,870
and we hope you can join us in this

00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:51,040
journey and becoming the ministry of

00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:54,570
mapping

00:20:51,040 --> 00:21:02,290
thank you very much salamat po how do we

00:20:54,570 --> 00:21:05,440
and see you next time my name is aya i

00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:07,870
can say i will be presenting a lightning

00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:10,360
talk or building be street experience

00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:13,049
like was nature this talk is recorded

00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:15,490
for state of the map 2020

00:21:13,049 --> 00:21:21,750
this time of the pandemic i hope you

00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:24,940
guys are staying safe so why did we

00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:26,380
decide on this Ralph we discovered the

00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:29,410
maps of Nigeria by telling me

00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:33,010
out-of-date and inaccurate regardless of

00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:35,530
platform and we thought about it we

00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:39,220
added another layer such as this tree

00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:40,990
tree it will improve accuracy shouldn't

00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:43,750
she be able to see where the user is

00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:45,990
going to and commit and also to

00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:52,000
generally create a better web zero

00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:54,490
experience for users so how we're going

00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,350
to go about this was to create a 2-d web

00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:59,890
man for reference and should use on

00:21:56,350 --> 00:22:01,450
click with a marker identifying either

00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:04,059
where the user was or what it is I

00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:06,160
wanted to see and to get that done we

00:22:04,059 --> 00:22:08,919
had to capture and process 360-degree

00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:11,710
panoramas I had to zone the city into

00:22:08,919 --> 00:22:18,730
Drive zones and we had to upload shaded

00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:21,910
zone myself this is the website which I

00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:31,419
will go through and I'll share the links

00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:33,700
at the end of the presentation so on the

00:22:31,419 --> 00:22:35,890
landing page you have register and share

00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:37,510
your location quickly find the patient's

00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:39,880
on the street view and check our actions

00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:41,530
with your friends which basically

00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,970
summarizes some of what we're trying to

00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:45,400
achieve

00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:47,590
then in this middle area we have the

00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:49,630
neighborhoods within labels that we have

00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:52,780
covered and there's the others as well

00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:56,049
which we actually have in processing

00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:59,590
since panoramas take quite a bit of work

00:22:56,049 --> 00:23:03,040
to do also there's a search box here

00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:05,020
which are essential at the allow demo

00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:09,250
which is a pretty popular road in

00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:12,400
Victoria Island and the map takes was

00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:14,230
there in the lower left corner

00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:17,590
what is loading is the correspondence

00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:20,680
treaty and once it loads that I will be

00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:22,960
able to switch between the two T map

00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:27,880
view which is the opposite Matthew and

00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:31,390
that correspond in one now the

00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:35,800
OpenStreetMap has been minimized to the

00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:37,750
overview on the left and you can see the

00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:40,930
direction in which the camera or the

00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:44,350
view is facing and as you pan around it

00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:48,450
gets you to see where exactly you're

00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:48,450
facing in relation to that location

00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:57,580
so why oka stigma opposite map is an

00:23:54,820 --> 00:24:00,490
amazing 3d mapping platform I have a jet

00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:02,560
I have a GIS background and I had

00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:05,470
watching the OpenStreetMap developments

00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:09,100
from time so even when this project came

00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:11,140
up it was the platform of choice based

00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:13,450
on the fact that it has it also as a

00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:16,450
huge user contribute on community of

00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:18,580
which I am one as well and it's also

00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:19,930
very easy to learn contribute and some

00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:22,750
of the microphones that we have done

00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:24,790
will find out that even people with

00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:27,400
little or no computer knowledge can

00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:30,490
actually navigate that we are around ID

00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:32,440
which is the online tool one of the

00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:34,210
great considerations to operate before

00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:38,890
this project was to build our entire

00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:42,550
server and services which is what you

00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:46,750
just saw so Morrible means I have seen

00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:50,310
it in you by the language one of the

00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:52,660
20-plus languages in Niger as spoken by

00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:55,450
people mostly in the southwest and also

00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:57,310
in West African countries basically help

00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:59,860
users to find and replace' same

00:24:57,310 --> 00:25:02,800
locations with these ribs then we also

00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:04,660
try to update every six months now since

00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:06,760
we've been actively capturing the

00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:10,750
essence 2016 we're working on a time

00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:13,860
series view whereby you be able to see

00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:13,860
one location over time

00:25:14,659 --> 00:25:21,559
so more supports OpenStreetMap to osm

00:25:19,249 --> 00:25:23,210
nigel mansell twitter handle and the

00:25:21,559 --> 00:25:26,029
marathon's our local community building

00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:29,239
that i mentioned earlier in 2017 will be

00:25:26,029 --> 00:25:31,159
uploaded from test data of streets in

00:25:29,239 --> 00:25:33,619
lego sandy but as two cities in the

00:25:31,159 --> 00:25:38,149
southwest of Nigeria to mapillary just

00:25:33,619 --> 00:25:40,279
to see how are things go there and the

00:25:38,149 --> 00:25:42,080
command provides Street View capital

00:25:40,279 --> 00:25:44,599
services and also end-to-end bills of

00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:47,349
similar platforms like this moremore is

00:25:44,599 --> 00:25:48,830
it had a company called simple mobile

00:25:47,349 --> 00:25:50,929
thank you

00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:53,899
this is my email my twitter handle and

00:25:50,929 --> 00:25:55,309
my co street map handle as well so

00:25:53,899 --> 00:25:58,279
please let me know if you have questions

00:25:55,309 --> 00:26:07,399
and I hope in this brief presentation of

00:25:58,279 --> 00:26:09,590
shared enough thank you hello I'm really

00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:12,559
in the cratering maintainer of the same

00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:14,330
channel and today I will talk about some

00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:17,539
of the new features that we have added

00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:19,849
to a simcha in the last month because

00:26:17,539 --> 00:26:21,859
who don't know what a symchay is it's a

00:26:19,849 --> 00:26:25,570
tool that helped us to validate that

00:26:21,859 --> 00:26:30,739
it's made on opposite map which is the

00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:32,539
database they teach at Indian River some

00:26:30,739 --> 00:26:38,059
analysis to identify potential problems

00:26:32,539 --> 00:26:40,789
from each edit and we also provide a

00:26:38,059 --> 00:26:43,789
better solution of the chats so you can

00:26:40,789 --> 00:26:50,269
see easily what was modified what was

00:26:43,789 --> 00:26:53,710
created or deleted change that so here

00:26:50,269 --> 00:26:55,190
for example I have a chance at that had

00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:59,659
modified

00:26:55,190 --> 00:27:00,409
21 elements so we can click on each

00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:04,700
feature

00:27:00,409 --> 00:27:07,999
see the text that change and also we can

00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:11,210
see if the geometry change that case for

00:27:07,999 --> 00:27:14,389
example the user change from what we can

00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:19,820
offer to teach what you subtracted it

00:27:14,389 --> 00:27:26,529
because it's really a teacher Bahrain

00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:26,529
not a canal so we can take it just good

00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:33,640
so if someone else came to come to that

00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:37,480
change that should verify it they can

00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:40,270
see that choice already reviewed another

00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:45,250
possibility that we have my septa is

00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:49,360
true so she 14 sets and also we can save

00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:52,420
that filters you can use a lot of

00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:57,370
information to filter like they exponent

00:27:52,420 --> 00:28:00,310
location today let's try with filtering

00:27:57,370 --> 00:28:03,880
by using large audience at the bank new

00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:08,140
users so I can apply the filter let's

00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:10,000
get that first change that one of the

00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:11,980
new features that we have awesome char

00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:16,150
is the possibility to visualize the

00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:22,840
members of emulation so for example we

00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:27,280
have that yellow box that means the box

00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:30,100
of our relation that was modified so

00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:33,280
here we have a relation that changed

00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:38,820
from reservoir from induce reservoir to

00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:45,400
building yes what is a very bad change

00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:49,450
so here we can check each element of the

00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:52,710
relation here that second column we have

00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:56,470
the role of that member of the emulation

00:28:52,710 --> 00:29:02,110
you can expect it to see if the relation

00:28:56,470 --> 00:29:06,130
is complete and here we can open that

00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:10,060
feature mighty jaws level 0 and also

00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:14,410
check the history some some self some

00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:18,520
services a new feature that we also have

00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:21,940
is the facility to use the big layer we

00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:25,800
always had the Box satellites tweets in

00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:30,610
that layer so now we can switch to Bing

00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:33,970
I hope to help us to validate the change

00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:37,720
sets so here we can see that it was

00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:39,890
which is really adhesive are not beauty

00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:46,640
and we can take it

00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:49,040
Beth here we can also mark some initial

00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:54,140
information on the chain that like if it

00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:58,400
was reserved to a result I I media to

00:29:54,140 --> 00:30:02,960
open it to - OH - - to make the fix on

00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:06,710
the chin set talk a little bit about the

00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:11,030
facility of salah is the relation

00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:14,150
members cheese very useful when we are

00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:17,950
reviewing for example the data

00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:22,130
restrictions so for example here we

00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:27,190
reflect on budget and description it's

00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:30,799
no left town with only from and two

00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:35,260
members it's missing the via member if

00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:41,120
we open the motivation of that feature

00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:49,970
that or the change that we can confirm

00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:53,559
that it had the from via two members so

00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:57,980
we can open it on edge though as well

00:30:53,559 --> 00:31:06,830
also tag that change the change set as

00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:08,620
bad so thank you very much and keep on

00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:11,650
teaching a simcha

00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:11,650
[Music]

00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:19,470
good day everyone I will be sharing with

00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:20,010
you and advocacy that is dear to my

00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:22,470
heart

00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:24,540
first of all my name is aina you I'm a

00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:26,700
progress again specialist for the

00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:29,370
Department of Social Welfare and

00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:32,280
Development I also might voluntarily

00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:35,480
grow up OpenStreetMap together with my

00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:37,920
colleagues will initiate Jai ladies ph

00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:41,160
you may ask that she didn't say

00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:44,460
reinitiate yes I did because actually

00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:47,940
Jamie made this was fresco being in 2014

00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:50,040
by a longtime OSM contributor here in

00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:52,740
the Philippines we since their money and

observed that most mapathon and mapping

00:31:55,560 --> 00:32:01,080
party participants and men so with this

00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:03,510
he wanted to bridge the gap and change

00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:07,950
the nation we are very delighted about

00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:10,140
this initiative and in 2018 we abided as

00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:29,040
hosting mapping activities that we

00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:31,020
support such as foxy dancing center with

00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:32,750

name is pH 14 we have an me who

00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:53,790
advocates for mapping mental health our

are joined expert I mentioned earlier

00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:09,390
that we invited in 20 April in this

00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:11,990
verse to map our body map Ababa is an

00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:14,820
annual mapping activity by the SW

00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:17,580
celebrated every much for the woman's

00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:20,190

piston omnipotent in a moon which is

00:33:29,879 --> 00:33:36,299
last year we had a workshop and iPad

00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:39,779
when women web were participants are

00:33:36,299 --> 00:33:41,129
asked to MA facilities which are

00:33:39,779 --> 00:33:43,739
important to them

00:33:41,129 --> 00:33:44,940
we also had the drone workshop last

00:33:43,739 --> 00:33:47,249
August went in I do

00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:50,190
and we also attended ashamed maps and

00:33:47,249 --> 00:33:53,309
Philip II flying labs from training this

00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:55,919
January we also support and this project

00:33:53,309 --> 00:33:58,259
went to have awareness mapping to

00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:00,899
promote mental health awareness to fight

00:33:58,259 --> 00:34:04,799
the stigma on you and after five years

00:34:00,899 --> 00:34:08,549
from 2014 we had a jail in this up

00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:12,119
meet up which was held in 2019 and we

00:34:08,549 --> 00:34:14,429
had another one last December we also

00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:16,980
participated during the open later than

00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:21,990
2020 celebration here in the Philippines

00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:24,419
and so what's next for Jenny ladies we

00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:26,429
want to continue to engage more women

00:34:24,419 --> 00:34:29,250
mappers and a linguist here in their

00:34:26,429 --> 00:34:31,679
country we also aim to launch the JLA

00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:34,589
this pH community group to build wide

00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:36,929
area networks we will also continue to

00:34:34,589 --> 00:34:38,760
participate then support local and

00:34:36,929 --> 00:34:42,349
international and mapping initiatives

00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:44,460
that promote diversity and inclusiveness

00:34:42,349 --> 00:34:47,129
especially for women and other

00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:49,619
represented groups since there is still

00:34:47,129 --> 00:34:52,500
a public situation here our main channel

00:34:49,619 --> 00:34:56,220
will be online meetups in webinars

00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:59,039
better for women image in the spatial

00:34:56,220 --> 00:35:01,380
field thank you for taking the time to

00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:04,020
be my talk we sketch this awesome

00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:06,660
Filipino speakers here in state of the

00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:09,240
McClintock thank you and if you have any

00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:11,460
questions you may drop them in the chat

00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:15,980
or visit us at that facebook page at

00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:15,980
jail a speech thank you

00:35:23,619 --> 00:35:28,579
hello my name is Janet Chapman from Krab

00:35:26,329 --> 00:35:31,940
to mark Tanzania talking about fighting

00:35:28,579 --> 00:35:35,240
female genital mutilation or FGM with

00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:37,579
maps so FGM is the cutting of female

00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:40,670
genitalia for cultural or religious

00:35:37,579 --> 00:35:44,059
reasons and it has major health

00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:47,180
implications it's illegal in Tanzania

00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:49,880
but very prevalent in Boots particularly

00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:52,190
in certain areas because it's generally

00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:54,619
certain tribes that still practice this

00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:56,930
and girls are rounded up during a

00:35:54,619 --> 00:36:01,010
cutting season while they're on school

00:35:56,930 --> 00:36:03,049
holidays and cut so we've been working

00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:06,020
with Robbie Samwell Ephraim hope for

00:36:03,049 --> 00:36:09,950
girls and women over the last six years

00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:13,160
and she's does outreach work in the

00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:14,180
villages of Serengeti and booty Amma in

00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:17,420
Mara

00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:21,109
region and tells people around the

00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:23,809
effects of FGM she also runs to safe

00:36:21,109 --> 00:36:27,500
houses for girls refusing FGM

00:36:23,809 --> 00:36:30,819
she's a FGM survivor herself she almost

00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:33,829
bled to death when she was cut aged 40

00:36:30,819 --> 00:36:36,079
but girls cannot find the safe houses

00:36:33,829 --> 00:36:38,900
easily and safe house staff and the

00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:41,750
police cannot find them because rural

00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:44,839
Tanzania is very poorly mapped unlike

00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:48,369
places like Jerusalem or London where I

00:36:44,839 --> 00:36:53,059
live so activists and the police and

00:36:48,369 --> 00:36:56,390
everybody needs maps of rural Tanzania

00:36:53,059 --> 00:36:59,539
so we've been making them since 2015

00:36:56,390 --> 00:37:02,450
with the help of global volunteers from

00:36:59,539 --> 00:37:05,420
all over the world and also people on

00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:07,789
the ground in Tanzania so we're using

00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:12,470
satellite images such as this one which

00:37:07,789 --> 00:37:16,430
shows some huts where people live in

00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:19,099
this area people generally sign up

00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:21,740
through UN online volunteers and other

00:37:19,099 --> 00:37:24,410
volunteering sites we send them an email

00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:26,750
with some detailed instructions about

00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:29,809
getting started with OpenStreetMap and

00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:33,799
also how to use rapid which is

00:37:29,809 --> 00:37:36,500
generating machine learning generated

00:37:33,799 --> 00:37:40,369
buildings and roads that we're also

00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:43,550
using to help and also tagging guides

00:37:40,369 --> 00:37:48,109
and explanations of about wrote tagging

00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:50,030
etc so we asked people to join our slack

00:37:48,109 --> 00:37:52,490
channel which now has over four and a

00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:55,220
half thousand members and post some

00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:58,250
examples of the mapping and their first

00:37:55,220 --> 00:38:00,550
attempts at mapping and then more

00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:02,990
experienced mappers give them feedback

00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:04,820
so if you'd like to help with this

00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:08,480
please get involved with we're always

00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:12,560
looking for more volunteers we've also

00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:15,859
set up some quizzes so people can test

00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:18,440
their knowledge about mapping so has

00:38:15,859 --> 00:38:21,050
they include screenshots of typical

00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:23,300
problems and if you get a hundred

00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:27,970
percent then you get a badge for that

00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:30,470
particular module we've also been adding

00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:34,869
open government data such as clinic

00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:38,330
locations which is extremely useful and

00:38:34,869 --> 00:38:40,970
using water point locations to work out

00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:46,220
missing villages which is also useful

00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:49,960
for covert tracing so since we began

00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:56,359
we've now up to almost 14,000 volunteers

00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:59,089
and a total of 6.4 million edits we were

00:38:56,359 --> 00:39:03,410
recently featured in the podcast nodes

00:38:59,089 --> 00:39:05,210
and ways but the most important thing

00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:08,359
that we're doing is training people on

00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:11,420
the ground in Tanzania to map their own

00:39:08,359 --> 00:39:14,630
communities mostly using a free

00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:15,980
smartphone app called map stop me so

00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:19,369
here are some people adding their

00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:23,480
village for the first time we've been

00:39:19,369 --> 00:39:27,290
training activists and many people

00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:30,320
including the police to use maps dot me

00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:33,680
to route them to find places that they

00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:36,290
need to go for example to rescue girls

00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:38,000
quickly typically they will get a phone

00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:40,099
call in the middle of the night saying

00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:43,220
girls are about to be cutting Comanche

00:39:40,099 --> 00:39:45,380
banjo village that wasn't previously on

00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:47,570
any map there's no road signs and no

00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:49,680
streetlights so it's very difficult for

00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:54,869
them to find them and go

00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:57,180
were missed we've been training people

00:39:54,869 --> 00:40:01,400
to use smartphones for the first time to

00:39:57,180 --> 00:40:05,009
map their villages and all then

00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:07,079
producing paper maps and they can also

00:40:05,009 --> 00:40:10,019
add the places that are still missing

00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:11,789
and then display the map in the village

00:40:10,019 --> 00:40:14,460
office this is the first time people

00:40:11,789 --> 00:40:18,119
have seen a map of their village so

00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:20,700
better maps have helped prevent many

00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:23,999
girls from being cut by finding the safe

00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:28,170
houses every time there is a cutting

00:40:23,999 --> 00:40:31,019
season girls bleed to death and die so

00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:34,950
this has reduced the death rate from

00:40:31,019 --> 00:40:36,930
that so we've trained over 1,600 local

00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:40,819
activists to map their communities in

00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:43,289
Tanzania around 40% of these are female

00:40:40,819 --> 00:40:44,940
this has greatly helped when we got a

00:40:43,289 --> 00:40:47,190
micro grant from humanitarian

00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:50,579
OpenStreetMap which allowed us to buy

00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:52,589
some cheap $30 smartphones generally

00:40:50,579 --> 00:40:56,069
women in the villages do not have access

00:40:52,589 --> 00:40:58,380
to smartphones we've set up eight

00:40:56,069 --> 00:41:00,980
different youth map of chapters in

00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:04,950
Tanzania that we continue to work with

00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:07,230
in 2018 we were invited to run a

00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:11,730
marathon as part of the UN General

00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:14,039
Assembly and we have satellite events in

00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:17,430
many different countries so thank you to

00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:20,489
everybody who helped with that we're

00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:22,650
always looking for new volunteers we're

00:41:20,489 --> 00:41:24,989
all volunteers with virtually no budgets

00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:27,720
if you'd like to get involved please do

00:41:24,989 --> 00:41:30,559
get in touch and let me know thank you

00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:30,559
very much for listening

00:41:32,330 --> 00:41:34,390
