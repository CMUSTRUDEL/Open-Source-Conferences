Publication date: 2020-07-18
Playlist: State of the Map 2020
Description: 
	https://media.ccc.de/v/sotm2020-4274-the-state-of-openstreetmap-in-africa



This talk will present the results of a survey done on the State of the OpenStreetMap, the unique challenges and success of OSM in Africa and how the different communities are working together to grow the map and the community on the continent.

The global State of the Map conference is taking place in Africa for the very first time, and it is a great opportunity to light a torch into the state of OpenStreetMap in Africa. What is happening around the Map the West, Central, South and North of Africa? Where are the active communities, what are the reasons for their success, what challenges are they facing and what solutions are they using to overcome the challenges? 
 
This talk will present the results of a survey done with different OSM communities in Africa to answer the above questions, while at the same time looking at the map data to measure the level of completeness in each country, and examining the reasons behind the different scenarios in the different countries. 
 
The talk will also present the views of OSM Community leaders from Africa on how to promote sustainability, resilience, inclusiveness, diversity and equity in decision making in regards to the future of OpenStreetMap. Why are there very few official local OpenStreetMap Chapters from Africa and what can be done to change the situation?

you

00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:12,000
hi everyone my name is different cat

00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:15,660
Erica a member of the awesome community

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,520
in Uganda and a member of SM Africa also

00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,890
working with the humanitarian

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:24,210
OpenStreetMap team are based in Kampala

00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:26,310
in Uganda as we all know the global set

00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,619
of the map conference which is now watch

00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:30,779
oh why supposed to take place in Africa

00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:32,910
for the very first time this year in

00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:34,829
this presentation we are looking at the

00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:37,440
state of OpenStreetMap in the different

00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:40,350
countries in Africa presenting the

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,730
results of a survey we did with the

00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:44,520
different countries

00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:47,820
the survey was fascinated by osm Africa

00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,740
which is a network of always M

00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:52,040
communities from all over the continent

00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:56,640
and we are working together to grow

00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:59,730
OpenStreetMap in our countries the goal

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,310
was to get a response from each and

00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:04,079
every country even in places where they

00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:06,360
are currently no existing communities

00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:08,690
they are working with people in those

00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:13,530
countries to help them set up

00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:15,360
communities where they don't exist but

00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:17,520
before we look at the results of this

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:22,049
survey and this is that by looking at

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:25,080
the state of data itself this map here

00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:27,510
shows us the opens map not based in

00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:29,520
Africa and you can see from the most

00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:33,600
bright places the countries were have a

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:37,140
substantial amount of data in this

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:40,920
visualization we see a number of maps

00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:44,310
buildings bhaiya in africa from 2007 to

00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:47,280
2009 t which also helps us to see the

00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:53,100
historic trend of opens map editing in

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:57,869
africa so in 2007 2008 the pioneers

00:01:53,100 --> 00:02:02,369
about africa algeria tunisia from 2008

00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:11,459
2009 nigeria comes in asia

00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:16,439
egypt and enough i saw from 2010 to 2011

00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:17,940
we have a guinea bissau coming up with

00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:25,350
uganda also right

00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:28,200
to the sea bear um 2012 to 2013

00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:30,300
Cameroon DRC sent to Africa Africa and

00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:36,960
the lies with Madagascar so coming to

00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:40,350
the picture and as we go into 2014 we

00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:44,940
have CRE on South span Liberia and

00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:47,970
Guinea 2015 it will be grazing

00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:54,560
Mozambique with Tanzania nakatsu also

00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:58,700
rising very fast 2016 Zimbabwe rising

00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:02,310
Tanzania is watching me also come up

00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:07,430
2017 and Linea escapes the park

00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:10,800
Mali Malawi and Zambia also rising 2018

00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:14,910
Uganda comes back into the picture with

00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:17,370
Antonia still very far ahead by 2020 we

00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:20,630
have a total of 57 point 7 million

00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:25,820
buildings with Tanzania taking lead at

00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:30,239
11 million buildings thanks to the work

00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:33,510
done by hot and proud to map in Tanzania

00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:37,430
the other countries in the top five as

00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:43,980
we can see at Tanzania Uganda Zimbabwe

00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:49,290
Nigeria and Zambia the other way to look

00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:51,180
at it is to compare with population to

00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:53,760
the total number of multi buildings in

00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:56,910
each country to help us to see which is

00:03:53,760 --> 00:04:01,590
the most map country so the statistics

00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:05,090
here show is Frattini Lesotho specialist

00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:10,500
Botswana Zimbabwe as the most mapped

00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:12,540
countries in Africa but the number of

00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:15,200
map of this alone winner tell us the

00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:17,730
whole story that's why we talk to the

00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,400
community members in those countries I

00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:24,380
try to understand what are the stories

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:27,690
what are the factors behind the

00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:30,240
activities and the status of there are

00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:34,830
seven communities that we see

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:39,840
so yeah we reach out to 55 countries and

00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:43,139
got responses from 52 countries 65% of

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:45,599
the countries that responded say this an

00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:48,449
awesome commit in bear country although

00:04:45,599 --> 00:04:51,599
the live of activity really differs from

00:04:48,449 --> 00:04:56,250
country to country have the active ones

00:04:51,599 --> 00:04:57,750
we have some that inactive or dumb and

00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:00,389
they are there but they're not really

00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:05,039
active also have countries where there

00:05:00,389 --> 00:05:07,919
is no existing community at all um it's

00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:12,199
also interesting to note some countries

00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:16,259
like Egypt and Morocco where there is

00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:18,810
many active mappers but no active

00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:24,539
community some of the countries where

00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:26,370
there are visiting communities we looked

00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:33,090
at so we look at some of the factors

00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:36,949
behind the activity that is happening so

00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:39,750
one of the things to note is the rise of

00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:41,550
Miss Marples which has also competed

00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:44,430
with the rise of the growth of awesome

00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:49,650
communities in Africa though it started

00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:51,479
only in 2018 there are now 105 youth

00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:54,630
MOBAs chapters in different universities

00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:57,870
across Africa which is 50% of a total

00:05:54,630 --> 00:06:00,870
number below Barrett um Egeria allenge

00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:04,409
doesn't mean you have the highest number

00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:08,099
of chapters in Africa and for those that

00:06:04,409 --> 00:06:10,069
don't know his map as the University led

00:06:08,099 --> 00:06:13,919
student clubs

00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:16,860
contribute OpenStreetMap in different

00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:19,740
countries which is a good way to draw a

00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:22,440
pantsuit map because once the gatekeeper

00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:24,060
to university even when they go into the

00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:29,039
work field they are likely to use or

00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:31,530
sell and promote it in their work the

00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,639
other fact that cause that is for his

00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:36,719
work in Africa

00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:39,570
so since 2015 what has run country

00:06:36,719 --> 00:06:40,650
programs in eight countries in Africa

00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:43,680
and also supported

00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:47,880
awesome communities with device and mic

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:49,320
grant in 19 countries in Africa so in

00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,979
most of the countries where God has

00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,690
worked

00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:53,789
they have already added the locus and

00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:57,289
community and helped set up communities

00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:57,289
where they didn't exist

00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:04,740
open cities Africa is a project by the

00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:06,780
World Bank and is engaging open smart

00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:10,169
communities and governments in the use

00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:13,860
of OpenStreetMap to build resilient

00:07:10,169 --> 00:07:17,849
societies the good thing with this

00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:21,720
project is that it is connecting awesome

00:07:17,849 --> 00:07:24,270
communities to government which is good

00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:27,120
because now that means in Africa can

00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:32,479
make use of open SMAP data which was a

00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,479
challenge in very many countries

00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:38,520
definition how do are some committees in

00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:42,740
Africa that have committed that existing

00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:46,560
how do they define their membership so

00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:49,349
56% mentioned that everyone who got

00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,320
based osm in their country is a member

00:07:49,349 --> 00:07:55,080
of the community

00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:57,060
38% mention that even who participate in

00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:59,580
events like mapping parties mapathon

00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:05,760
made ups that's what they count as a

00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:10,830
member and 6% constable have paid a

00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:13,020
membership to be their members we how

00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:18,509
often do committees are some committees

00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:21,360
in African beach and so for the 6% I

00:08:18,509 --> 00:08:22,470
have not had meetings in a very long

00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,889
time

00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:27,360
also half 24% who have never had a

00:08:25,889 --> 00:08:29,849
meet-up and these are the countries

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:37,789
where there is currently no interesting

00:08:29,849 --> 00:08:42,810
awesome community 27 meet twice a month

00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:47,310
17% meet once a month and 8% meet every

00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:50,810
week communication channels from this

00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:50,810
graph you will see that most communities

00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:55,670
communicate through whatsapp and

00:08:53,670 --> 00:09:00,950
Facebook

00:08:55,670 --> 00:09:04,250
and only 34% have a website for the app

00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:09,730
community our communication channels his

00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:14,500
telegram and also that talk mailing list

00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:20,360
that they use for web communication

00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:23,990
leadership structures so for the a 54%

00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:26,510
of the communities we talked to say they

00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:30,710
don't have a leadership structure in

00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:34,010
place whereas for the 5% have a

00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:35,120
leadership structure in place so it's

00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:37,280
also interesting to note that there is

00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,440
no uniform leadership structure that is

00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:41,800
similar in every country so every

00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:46,640
country comes up with their own

00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:48,200
structure that works for them so one of

00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,300
the challenge is that new communities

00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:52,630
face is the same from which kind of

00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:55,910
leadership structure to put in place

00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:58,880
especially one that caters for different

00:09:55,910 --> 00:10:04,460
groups in the same country that are all

00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:09,770
promoting @sm so it can really be a mega

00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:11,300
up breaker if it is not done properly so

00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:14,360
for the countries that have leadership

00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:16,610
structure we have for example national

00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:19,580
coordinator with a secretary treasurer

00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:22,160
and chairperson others have an energy or

00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:26,930
structure with a bottomczek Secretariat

00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:28,250
or an NGO board with structure with the

00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:31,600
president vice president secretary

00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:35,300
treasurer and the project managers and

00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:38,090
others have country associations I was

00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:40,940
have a noisome lead and an activity

00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:43,460
communication person others have just

00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:47,570
the country coordinator project manager

00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:51,140
and a trainer a training coordinator and

00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:53,470
a personal coordinator as I just led by

00:10:51,140 --> 00:11:00,740
a core group of five in the videos

00:10:53,470 --> 00:11:04,340
without any roles then we have several

00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:08,740
that just youth mappers chapters which

00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:08,740
have like their own leadership structure

00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:17,670
community successes so each committee

00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:19,970
defined success in different ways but

00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:24,779
these are some of the common ones such

00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:28,290
where say like common organizing

00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:32,670
community led projects when I my mapping

00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:35,009
my public transport in cities creating

00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:37,170
new from abuzz chapters while also

00:11:35,009 --> 00:11:38,959
pointed out that the success point

00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:41,600
meeting open data through mapping

00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:44,939
perspective in opens this project

00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:48,240
mapping health facilities starting up an

00:11:44,939 --> 00:11:50,730
USM community completely mapping the

00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:53,370
country and using data for spatial

00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:58,529
planning organizing said of the map

00:11:53,370 --> 00:12:01,740
conferences government and NGOs and

00:11:58,529 --> 00:12:03,930
businesses increased steals in awesome

00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:07,470
that I was also a success for some

00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:10,559
countries and also humanitarian mapping

00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:15,889
through Korea to do mapping for career a

00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:15,889
cyclones bola flatting Lassa fever

00:12:15,949 --> 00:12:22,889
running micro grant projects and radar

00:12:20,309 --> 00:12:26,040
training women in mapping and then

00:12:22,889 --> 00:12:28,379
history as a nonprofit I was also

00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:30,509
mentioned as a success by some

00:12:28,379 --> 00:12:31,800
committees because it opens up more

00:12:30,509 --> 00:12:35,009
opportunities for them when they're

00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:37,230
organized registered they can also

00:12:35,009 --> 00:12:42,179
become a local chapter that is a fitted

00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:44,100
to OS n F when it comes to challenges

00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:48,120
there are several challenges between

00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:51,059
mission from lack of tools like laptops

00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:55,519
and furnace to use for mapping a lack of

00:12:51,059 --> 00:12:58,019
access to Internet there's also a

00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:01,589
challenge of lack of commitment from

00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:06,240
some members who don't want to volunteer

00:13:01,589 --> 00:13:08,009
for free so this this is maybe

00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,350
surprising but in Africa

00:13:08,009 --> 00:13:13,740
some people get his to volunteering

00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:16,410
after being paid so even when you ask

00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:19,980
them to participate in mapping as

00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:22,220
volunteers some want to be paid which is

00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:26,190
not possible

00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:28,140
lack of funding for activities lack of

00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:33,530
our engines and buying from decision

00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:38,690
makers like definitely generate of osm

00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:41,760
lack of space from meetups and trainings

00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:45,800
lack of leadership within the community

00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,800
losing community members along the way

00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:54,900
then also have an issue with mappers

00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:56,790
chapters or clubs not being well

00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:59,390
represented in the local community

00:13:56,790 --> 00:14:02,460
especially in countries where there was

00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:04,380
already an existing Wesen community when

00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:07,620
the new mobile chapters are created

00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:09,360
sometime damaged brought in or

00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:14,070
represented in the local media which is

00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:16,170
a challenge multiple languages so I find

00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:19,260
like one country having really big

00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:22,230
French English so multiple languages

00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:24,660
also a problem lack of postal addresses

00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:29,220
and the cause which makes mapping in

00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:32,130
cities to my peaceful that I had and

00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:35,760
also political challenges like watch

00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:38,550
passion by other countries there's a

00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:44,460
challenge because without peace even

00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:47,550
mapping is not possible that means that

00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:50,040
don't want to open up data which is also

00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:53,010
due to lack of awareness about of

00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:55,200
instituting upon what it is difficulty

00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:58,200
in accessing funding without formal

00:14:55,200 --> 00:15:00,300
registration and then Jedi balance where

00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:03,510
we are having very few men involved in

00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:07,710
OpenStreetMap multiple groups with mud

00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:09,870
for agendas with different agendas it's

00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:13,590
very hard to put them under one umbrella

00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:17,540
as an SM community is they also

00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:21,480
concerned around that a pious men try to

00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:24,510
convince people to usm our challenge

00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:27,030
nation is low resolution and create

00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:31,050
imagery so

00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:36,840
is not tagging for some things I would I

00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:40,650
nicked Africa though always an open

00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:45,450
source culture and then concerns around

00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:48,210
data quality so also asked the members

00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:51,780
to to tell us what are the challenges

00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:53,460
that they have used overcome what are

00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:55,830
the solutions obvious to overcome some

00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:58,980
of the challenges they are facing so

00:15:55,830 --> 00:16:02,340
collaboration with different actors jazz

00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:03,960
professionals business government so

00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:06,780
don't just work alone just because

00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:12,390
you're awesome community try to reach

00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:15,000
out to different actors create creating

00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:17,540
ICM open data and open source RN and sir

00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,890
trainings and online campaigns

00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:23,070
establishing local or some communities

00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:26,400
where they don't exists establishing my

00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:27,930
lapis chapters formal registration as an

00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:31,500
organization which will open up

00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:34,410
opportunities forming partnerships with

00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:36,870
organizations and companies writing

00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:40,140
project proposals and applying for

00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:43,790
grants to get funding for example

00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:46,800
through the IMF and hot micro grants

00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:47,430
development of value-added applications

00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,320
on

00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:53,270
OpenStreetMap that meet everyday

00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:56,930
challenges and organizing set of the map

00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:59,930
conferences these are solutions to the

00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:59,930
problems

00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:06,839
organizing radula meetups

00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:10,310
map Athens mapping parties to keep the

00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:13,050
community engaged and active

00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:17,520
establishing digital child are champions

00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:20,579
and in villages who map the villages and

00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:24,829
also having what subgroups segmented

00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:29,180
pass city per district a university

00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:32,160
which helps to keep members engaged

00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:35,820
mobilizing funds from community members

00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:38,150
to contribute for internet for meeting

00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,150
space

00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:45,000
yeah it's also interesting too because

00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,910
one of the reasons that communities

00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:51,059
Express further for their activity was

00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:55,290
lack of funding so we we looked at which

00:17:51,059 --> 00:18:00,210
communities applied for the awesome of

00:17:55,290 --> 00:18:03,900
micro grants this year and it's

00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:05,790
interesting to to note that not everyone

00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:07,980
applied although they had like mid for

00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:11,250
the funding so we tried to ask what are

00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:14,160
the reason they didn't apply so some of

00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:15,240
them didn't know about the micro grants

00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,760
program at OU

00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:22,020
which comes back to the what channels

00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:27,059
does the awesome foundation use when

00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:29,160
communicating to communities in relation

00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:32,640
to what channels to the communities

00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:34,910
themselves use some mentioned that time

00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:38,250
wasn't enough to put together proposal

00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:41,760
some simple reason - needs apply for the

00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:48,840
micro grant and and some had no capacity

00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:52,640
so not team to work on a proposal we

00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:56,790
also tried to look at sm f membership so

00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:59,429
that one person's of the respondents the

00:18:56,790 --> 00:19:03,000
survey said they were already paid up

00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:04,650
awesome F members but for those that are

00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,290
not already members we also tried to

00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:10,110
find out the reasons why they they have

00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:13,050
failed to become a member of Fisher paid

00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:17,280
members and some of the reasons given

00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:20,550
was the payment platform so there's no

00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:23,730
paypal in several countries in Afrikaans

00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:28,679
the main platform used for paying

00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:30,300
membership fees some countries some

00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:34,650
people mentioned that they are not even

00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:37,080
aware of myself membership also this

00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:39,030
includes people who are the countries

00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:43,679
which are new to SM whether is currently

00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:45,419
no existing community some people that

00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:50,789
are just volunteers so they don't need

00:19:45,419 --> 00:19:53,339
to become official members I was third

00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:56,159
of SM is open source free so they don't

00:19:53,339 --> 00:19:59,820
need to pay any membership fee other

00:19:56,159 --> 00:20:02,879
looks placed lack of funds but it's also

00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:06,209
interesting to note that there is an

00:20:02,879 --> 00:20:08,549
option to apply for membership with a

00:20:06,209 --> 00:20:13,709
fee waiver so maybe we can become a

00:20:08,549 --> 00:20:17,309
member for free and you know here to be

00:20:13,709 --> 00:20:20,789
important and good if the people who I

00:20:17,309 --> 00:20:25,319
don't have access to funds and can take

00:20:20,789 --> 00:20:28,949
advantage of this opportunity but

00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:34,049
especially may open SMAP foundation is

00:20:28,949 --> 00:20:42,449
working groups 36% didn't know about the

00:20:34,049 --> 00:20:45,029
organ groups at all yeah for the 1% yeah

00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:48,379
what to participate they're

00:20:45,029 --> 00:20:50,849
participating in some way and 23% aware

00:20:48,379 --> 00:20:53,339
but are not participating due to some

00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:57,659
reason and one of the reasons they gave

00:20:53,339 --> 00:21:00,809
was lack of awareness some didn't know

00:20:57,659 --> 00:21:04,079
about extensive working groups some

00:21:00,809 --> 00:21:07,139
disability on half time lack of access

00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:12,690
to internet language barrier is some of

00:21:07,139 --> 00:21:15,329
the reasons that were a given yeah the

00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:18,659
other thing of course which is a

00:21:15,329 --> 00:21:22,559
challenge is that we won't have any

00:21:18,659 --> 00:21:26,129
local official local chapter in Africa

00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:30,719
at the moment and we asked members to

00:21:26,129 --> 00:21:33,059
suggest ways how we can get more awesome

00:21:30,719 --> 00:21:35,519
local chapter same F local chapters

00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:39,449
established in Africa so one of the

00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:42,269
reasons one of the suggestion that was

00:21:39,449 --> 00:21:44,909
given was to start with setting up local

00:21:42,269 --> 00:21:48,209
structures in countries because that is

00:21:44,909 --> 00:21:49,919
key before I become a local chapter ever

00:21:48,209 --> 00:21:52,079
suggested that you need to make the

00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:56,399
application process a less complex

00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:59,729
I went great incentives and benefits and

00:21:56,399 --> 00:22:04,110
all 4 SM committees to become local

00:21:59,729 --> 00:22:06,600
chapters will integrate more RMS

00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:10,080
i we need to provide mentorship and

00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:13,590
leadership training going to invite the

00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:19,799
IMF board and what group leads to speak

00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:22,559
to sm Africa members the animators that

00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:25,710
will individual membership before even

00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:29,880
we try to become a local chapter and

00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:32,790
also provide communities with financial

00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:35,160
support so this can be done through been

00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:36,980
Michael grant program so if they get a

00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:39,059
micro grant like I knew some of that

00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:41,160
actually gesture themselves I've been on

00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:46,169
the Dishman later on they can apply to

00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:49,370
become official chapters so also wanted

00:22:46,169 --> 00:22:52,710
to know yeah what's the vision of

00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:54,720
awesome communities in Africa whether

00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:57,419
they want with them to be in ten years

00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,880
so when asked this question these are

00:22:57,419 --> 00:23:04,200
some of the concerns we got so they want

00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:08,370
to see the entire world using awesome

00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:10,049
don't see more members in their

00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:13,799
communities and more job creation

00:23:10,049 --> 00:23:17,370
through awesome they want awesome to be

00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:19,890
the main source of spatial and data for

00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:22,770
both national governments organization

00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:26,340
and for development to spearhead

00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:29,040
solutions and policies there will be

00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:32,790
more mappers and more users a bit more

00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:34,440
strong communities all over the world as

00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:39,559
I will be the number in this map in the

00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:43,049
world in the country be fully mapped

00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:46,260
that be if mappers chapters in every

00:23:43,049 --> 00:23:48,150
University person will be an urban

00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:50,400
reference from mapping across the

00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:57,240
continent there'll be more integration

00:23:50,400 --> 00:24:00,150
in games are some integration in 3d in

00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:04,169
mapping in point clouds in virtual

00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:07,559
reality and that animate and even more

00:24:04,169 --> 00:24:10,230
awesome projects in Africa so the

00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:13,350
purpose of this survey was to see where

00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:16,180
as awesome Africa where we need to be

00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:18,760
and now we can focus on how to get there

00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:23,230
us to achieve our goal map each and

00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:26,230
every corner in Africa I'll leave you

00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:31,140
with this video which shows an animation

00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:34,440
of OSM editing in Africa since 2009

00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:34,440
thank you
