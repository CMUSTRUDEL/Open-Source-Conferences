Plenty of research about behavioural differences between men and women for years ago. According to a scientific article in 2013 by Lewis, on average women may have better verbal memory and social cognition, whereas men may have better motor and spatial skills. Moreover, spatial skill is really needed for mapping, especially as a mapper volunteer in OSM that everyone can make their own map. It also has been known that male mappers more dominate OSM mapping than female mappers. Nevertheless, in some mapper communities, the number of female mappers more than male mappers, for example in Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team Indonesia. 19 from 30 mappers in HOT Indonesia are female, yet does it affect the performance and quality of mapping in OpenStreetMap?

It is true that men mappers more dominate OpenStreetMap (OSM) mapping than women mappers. Some mapper communities have the number of female mappers than males mappers. For instance in Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team Indonesia (HOT Indonesia), 19 from 30 mappers in HOT Indonesia are female. Moreover, it is a fact that men and women have some behavioural differences and it might affect their working performance, especially in OSM mapping. According to the number of changesets, addition, deletion and modification in OSM mapping that tracked through OSMCha, it can be seen the difference between female and male mappers when they are mapping some objects in OSM. 

OSMCha offers many features for reviewing OSM, one of the features is to review a changeset and mapper details that include the mapper username, the number of changesets that mapper has contributed in OSM. Besides, it has changeset-map for visualising of changeset on OSM and the addition, deletion, and modification can be seen by other OSM users. Thus, through those data, it can be seen how is the difference between females and males when they are contributing data in OSM, also how the quality of OSM map that they create. I believe, those differences can be helpful for creating better data for OSM and invite another female to contribute in OSM.

good good morning good afternoon good

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,570
evening everywhere you are watching from

00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:17,609
here with us is Linda Burum Adani's

00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:20,310
she'll be talking about gender

00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:23,400
performance in OS and mapping does it

00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:26,519
really matter just daenerys such using

00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:29,070
OS immature and I think her research is

00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:32,189
quite interesting and it is talking

00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:35,460
about the behavioral differences in in

00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:37,290
the community so I think we can use

00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,480
these what all have findings to

00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:45,660
formulate community policies for the

00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:47,430
future so I could under this process

00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:49,350
thank you for being here today

00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:52,980
I'm Xena from humanitarian OpenStreetMap

00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:55,199
team Indonesia I'm here today to talk to

00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:59,340
you about gender performance in noise

00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:01,800
and mapping does it matter you know many

00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:03,539
people assume a woman our method spatial

00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,939
skills for example teacher through minor

00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:08,250
a channels some of us may be a little

00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:10,409
bit confused to say which is the left

00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:12,510
side and which is the right thing when

00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:15,119
Arman is thinking this one is the web

00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,150
site but unconsciously we say this one

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:20,430
is right things and because of that some

00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:23,850
of our male friends conclude that week

00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:26,610
on this team is the directions maybe

00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:28,439
some of us are wondering why in some

00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:31,290
communities smell my personal minute

00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:33,750
morning female members and our the

00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:36,840
differences in objects mapped by male

00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:39,030
and female and so according to Sandra

00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,630
statistics which gender has better

00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:44,700
statistic female or male members

00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:48,299
according to Sansa Collier is a Chapman

00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:50,939
and women's men are wired differently it

00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:52,799
affects their behavior as well and some

00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:55,740
of those differences can easy to see

00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:59,369
from men are better at modern and

00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:01,920
personal skills frak and logic they tend

00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:04,770
to use their logic and internal feeling

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,439
also determine position from directions

00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:10,520
and distance they can be sting is the

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:12,670
point of comfort insulating women and

00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:16,500
higher percentage

00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:19,630
white matter so what about the woman

00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:22,390
women are better at furball abilities

00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:24,640
and strong memory once the toddler girls

00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:27,340
are able to speak a certain voice also

00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:31,600
and we arguing with women they can

00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:32,530
easily remember the past and intuition

00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:36,700
and emotions

00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:39,550
most women are more sensitive nature

00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:41,800
mind positions from landmarks they

00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:44,290
remember the landmarks easily even

00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:46,150
directions our point of compass for

00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:48,220
instance when someone ask me where's the

00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:51,519
certain place I tend to mention a

00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:54,180
specific place like bang or market

00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:58,030
rather than directions or distance and

00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:59,440
higher percentage of brain matter to

00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:01,690
answer the problem is that I've

00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:05,590
mentioned before I did online surveys

00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:10,870
with 66 participants including 35 men

00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:14,230
and 31 women 24 from 35 men members are

00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:16,000
active contributors and they span for us

00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:18,760
and the Mont I prefer actually and

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,910
treating for more four thousand and ten

00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:25,269
sets of richly more offer 21 from 31

00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:27,010
female members are active user and spend

00:03:25,269 --> 00:03:30,340
time before actually 2 years and 9

00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:32,620
months and putting more than 5,000

00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:34,810
transept and bits on how did you

00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:37,510
contribute in OS and websites active

00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:40,060
user need someone who has edited the

00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:42,730
project in any three calendar months

00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:45,070
from the last one year and has

00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:47,290
maintained a valid email to a request

00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:49,299
the fourth feeding three weeks but and

00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:51,640
more from correspondent online surveys I

00:03:49,299 --> 00:03:54,100
create statistic not a huge or a center

00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:55,239
and how did you continue to open Sigma

00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,670
or HUAC

00:03:55,239 --> 00:04:00,700
using this website i often five

00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:02,880
categories first object mapping to see

00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:06,010
which object that they created must

00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:10,630
second created nuts to no average not

00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:12,970
hires and the lows toward create waste

00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:16,660
to feed your reticular tract created

00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:18,400
twice more for total transects like

00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:21,900
upset me for the temperature insects

00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,900
also the highest and the lowest

00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,300
last time frequency which engender that

00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:31,190
use always and more often

00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:34,780
firstly from woman's Mehta we can see

00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:37,580
84% members are mapping highway with

00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:41,900
34,000 highways and touch efforts lead

00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:45,400
that created by the one next fir greeted

00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:50,360
not in the fridge number is more than

00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:54,130
600,000 with new lows not is 150 and the

00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:58,940
highest not almost which 2 million nodes

00:04:54,130 --> 00:05:04,880
and next for cricket waste the average

00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:08,630
number shows almost 300,000 swings with

00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:16,520
the lowest waste is 17 and the highest

00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:20,330
is 289 thousands then for the transit

00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:24,169
the number of average is more than 5,000

00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:30,280
with the lowest chances is 19 and the

00:05:24,169 --> 00:05:34,250
highest chances it's 18000 and loss

00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:36,950
categories is time frequency for time

00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:39,500
frequency it shows three kinds of times

00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:43,280
first almost every day second

00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:46,790
occasionally and third sometimes the

00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:50,030
blue one is almost every day with 42%

00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:53,510
it means multi two persons one of moment

00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:55,880
are using OSF morning four days in a

00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:58,970
week and the red one is occasionally

00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:02,390
with the same number as almost every day

00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:05,200
42 percent this means 42 percent of

00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:08,979
women are making few times in a year and

00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:12,380
the last is the yellow one is sometimes

00:06:08,979 --> 00:06:15,290
with 16 percent women members who

00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:19,910
contribute in OS M for one or two times

00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:22,220
in month in fact 40% of women members

00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:24,169
are paid members they are currently

00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:28,220
doing a certain project so they are

00:06:24,169 --> 00:06:31,640
using I am almost a puny secondly it

00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:32,150
implements nota as we can see from the

00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:35,060
screen

00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:37,790
86 percent of male members are men

00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:43,700
highway with 13,000 highway change

00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:46,850
averagely next created not it shows

00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:50,510
almost 500,000 in snorts intervention

00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:53,780
number with 340 notes and the lowest

00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:57,790
number of predict notes and 1.6 million

00:06:53,780 --> 00:07:01,700
as the highest number of credit notes

00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:05,210
then the creative ways the visitor is it

00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:09,290
shows a fridge number 85,000 space with

00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:13,940
11 ways at the lowest and almost 300,000

00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:16,700
if the highest credit race next the

00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:20,300
chances the number of average expenses

00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:23,120
shows more 4,000 chances with 20 chances

00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:25,160
at the lowest and more 5 thousands and

00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:29,960
the highest critic chances by the main

00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:32,960
methods and next for the goulash studies

00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:35,389
the categories it's time frequency there

00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,639
are five kinds of times which is more

00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:40,460
variation than women's there are

00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:43,340
occasionally sometimes almost every day

00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:46,100
twice in a month and once in a week

00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:50,030
first the blue one is efficiently with

00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:54,260
34% it's the highest time and second is

00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:57,020
sometimes with red color with 26% and

00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:59,930
the third is almost every day with the

00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:02,919
same number as the sometimes and it

00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:06,050
shows my yellow color and the poor is

00:08:02,919 --> 00:08:09,020
11% of once in a week with orange color

00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:13,760
and was if the lowest percentage is

00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:16,880
twice in a month with green color in

00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:19,520
this case 25% when participants are paid

00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:21,800
my friends like the warmer members I've

00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,570
mentioned before so they are missing in

00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,940
RSM almost every day

00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:29,180
however the time frequency by male

00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:31,520
members are more positive because 70% of

00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:33,950
them are unpaid peppers which means

00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,550
they're only in dementing in their spare

00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:37,729
time

00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:45,350
it can be once in a week twice in a

00:08:37,729 --> 00:08:47,720
month or etc next is discussion first

00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:50,060
no members are using Horan and longer

00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:52,700
than female rappers it shown by the

00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:56,120
statistic data that a French time is

00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:58,820
more foyers also men dominate faltering

00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:02,060
geographic information this is confirmed

00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:04,430
by capillary in 2016 who states that the

00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:06,560
neon Geographic revolution requires not

00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:10,040
only in the position of sea travel

00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:12,710
technology for instance a smartphone but

00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:15,200
also the capability and kills the

00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:17,660
capture location here the resulting

00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:23,090
information and importantly shorten on a

00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:28,520
map next second our M users are

00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:33,610
dominated by men 35 from 66 rappers are

00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:36,860
men it bets on online to face next third

00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:40,040
it's a male-female are worth in special

00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:42,370
skills in fact statistics on women

00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:47,320
members created more knots and waist

00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:50,240
also the number of chances and Allah is

00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:55,540
more than women the smoothing inline

00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:59,060
effects like highways waterways and etc

00:09:55,540 --> 00:10:01,700
also like the first album on early

00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:03,680
presentation I said male members to

00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:06,410
Venus more than female members in some

00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,070
communities to the contrary in hot

00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:10,250
indonesia

00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:12,440
19 from 30 members are female

00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:15,440
that's the third point of discussion

00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:18,770
this width between oh worth are in

00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:21,320
special skill in fact woman dominant in

00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:24,200
your graphic community with mapping as

00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:28,400
their main job and the method created by

00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:31,880
them is as good as men do next these are

00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:34,520
few samples of how women and men you do

00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:38,150
the mapping on the personal it's not my

00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:40,430
woman and ii know by men as you can see

00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:43,250
the woman's neck is more detailed in men

00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:45,740
they created more knots particularly in

00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:47,210
performance the wall intend to do

00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:50,120
smoothing more than men

00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:53,600
on the other hand mandala smoothing but

00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:55,700
digitisation all the objects in men's

00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,010
views you think it's not essential as

00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:59,000
well as they are digitizing the whole

00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:02,150
object with

00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,490
properly otherwise in women's field

00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:07,130
smoothing is fairly important after the

00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:11,540
taking object some of real estate it's

00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:14,330
pleasing your eyes hex on this slide we

00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:18,500
can see that this thing is want men do

00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:20,570
and what women do clearly on delight fun

00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:24,020
is never created fear or not in

00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:26,390
turquoise so in the oils MRAP on the

00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:29,780
below the curve way looks kinda shot

00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:32,810
however on the right one this mapper

00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:37,330
created many notes in turn away and as

00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:40,400
the result it looks motor you know SMS

00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:42,260
it is easier to finally use there is

00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:45,110
blue sweating or not with curve

00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:47,030
digitizing like this if the user created

00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:49,520
we need notes on the curve it means the

00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:52,160
user diluting and Mary annoying

00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:54,830
enchanting soul map female members doing

00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,630
this more diamond fortunately in OS and

00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:59,150
math there are not many differences

00:11:56,630 --> 00:12:02,360
between this digitizing with routing and

00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:10,220
not soothing like you can see from this

00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:12,350
slide next the conclusion first moment

00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:14,600
are better at attention more on the

00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:16,850
adults they have more processing power

00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:19,850
for details given by smoothing

00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:23,660
digitation click on lead and window even

00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:26,540
thought it needs more times second more

00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:29,060
aesthetic artistic disciplines they tend

00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:32,560
to adduce anything hit me for freezing

00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:36,560
themselves like this mooting invoice

00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:38,780
chart can give early

00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:41,180
much colored birth amendment because

00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:43,460
they have metaphysical system see

00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:45,950
between colors more finely and it is

00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:50,120
very useful in making and photo skills

00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:51,140
especially cartographic the last able to

00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:53,780
the multi tux

00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:59,570
listen do mapping and other jobs at the

00:12:53,780 --> 00:13:03,710
same time and for the man they have

00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:06,170
methods special skills they can be seen

00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:09,360
at the narration precisely also being

00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:12,580
oil and my pal one burning woman

00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,660
second more dominance in computing and

00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:16,390
technology

00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:19,390
according to college at last Authority

00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:24,190
engineering and math degree in South and

00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:28,660
West Buffalo and by mail and third man

00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:31,390
Felipe power and benefit in this case

00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:33,730
only few of them are doing smooth

00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:36,130
digitation because stiffness is there in

00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:44,440
more times and they think it's not that

00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:46,360
efficient you must have metal focus they

00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:51,520
better except for me on single task

00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:53,890
sorry no need to define their focus the

00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:55,960
conclusion when one general makes the

00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:59,200
majority of notation about what

00:13:55,960 --> 00:14:02,950
information makes it into a mess and yet

00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:05,460
the users are not yet one gender however

00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:08,680
a good map is when it offers very

00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:11,440
perspective and little information both

00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:13,840
man and woman have the chance to mapping

00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,550
in OS m to make a better map that could

00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:18,220
be accessed by the public

00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:22,030
what can complete each other with their

00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:24,670
flaws and exist also inclusiveness must

00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:27,100
inform the local community regardless of

00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:30,210
their background education economic

00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:36,790
level ethnicity religion press and

00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:39,070
interpolation and thank you all for

00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:41,470
being here today and taking the time to

00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:50,320
patiently listen to what I have to say I

00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:54,160
wish you all happy birthday Thank You

00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:56,140
sundar fobel go ahead Trudy nothing

00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,260
thank you so much we hand over to my

00:14:56,140 --> 00:15:00,640
co-host

00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:02,830
wonderful yang I'm happy to have this

00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:05,920
conversation with Trudy and said thank

00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:07,660
you so much for their research more and

00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,910
more over the years and I posted some

00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:11,380
links into the pad around research that

00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:13,900
people have done about gender diversity

00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:17,290
in OpenStreetMap and it's really telling

00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:19,780
that the data set is only as good as the

00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:21,820
people who contribute meaning that we do

00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:22,899
need to have a whole whole world map and

00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,939
so I appreciated your

00:15:22,899 --> 00:15:26,439
comments on that so there are some

00:15:24,939 --> 00:15:28,149
questions in the pad and so for those of

00:15:26,439 --> 00:15:30,040
you who have not asked questions in the

00:15:28,149 --> 00:15:33,009
pad yet I certainly encourage you to do

00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:36,279
that present AB here we go there are a

00:15:33,009 --> 00:15:39,129
few here so the first question that is

00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:42,069
how can you measure men and how do you

00:15:39,129 --> 00:15:46,860
know if an OS M contributor is a man or

00:15:42,069 --> 00:15:50,230
a woman how do you identify that yes

00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:53,740
like I said like I've mentioned before

00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:56,379
in my plantation I'm doing I was doing

00:15:53,740 --> 00:16:00,850
online online surveys using Google Forms

00:15:56,379 --> 00:16:02,980
so on this equation X which is the

00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:06,790
gender and username so I can identify it

00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:08,679
with man and which is woman wonderful

00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:10,779
and as you know when you sign up for

00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:13,179
OpenStreetMap your user profile does not

00:16:10,779 --> 00:16:15,339
have a category for genders so you had

00:16:13,179 --> 00:16:17,410
to do a workaround in order to be able

00:16:15,339 --> 00:16:18,939
to get that data and that's important

00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:20,920
right just to say that how do you how do

00:16:18,939 --> 00:16:22,779
you know about diversity without having

00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:25,420
it in our main system kind of data set

00:16:22,779 --> 00:16:27,550
around the users okay the next question

00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:29,259
and there's quite a few here so look at

00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:32,079
that I was asking for questions and

00:16:29,259 --> 00:16:35,079
there's lots now so take a deep breath

00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:37,029
Sandeep what is the percentage of paid

00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:38,980
mappers in terms of contribution and

00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:41,529
what is their retention once the project

00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:43,749
is done so were you able to discern that

00:16:41,529 --> 00:16:50,740
deep that level of detail about in your

00:16:43,749 --> 00:16:54,579
surveys so apparently in my experience

00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:59,559
on paper and paper these are not much

00:16:54,579 --> 00:17:02,740
deeper and so for the papers some of

00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:07,539
them have fun like certain goals so

00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:11,140
therefore I so aligned to align to the

00:17:07,539 --> 00:17:13,860
map with the imagery and doing the way

00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:19,750
to the mapping more like details in the

00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:22,470
unpaid my first but like what I would

00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:29,020
say like I have said before on

00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:32,740
representation the point is how the man

00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:33,530
and the woman doing the mapping in a way

00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:39,650
Stan

00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:43,700
and I got the woman doing smoothing more

00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:46,010
frequently than the men do and actually

00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:48,380
such about the men however the men my

00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:51,970
purse the unpaid and techni personal and

00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:55,730
the one and never no difference like

00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:59,300
also the paid members the paid woman

00:17:55,730 --> 00:18:04,300
members doing this meeting more than men

00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:08,150
do because because the woman I saw me uh

00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:10,810
feels like I did period details and then

00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:16,040
it is quick this isn't shield for

00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:17,720
freezing my eyes are the woman and did

00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:21,440
you dipper you when you looked at the

00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:24,350
data did you see what percentage of the

00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,910
women that you met are talked about what

00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:27,800
percentage of them were paid and

00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:30,800
volunteer was there a difference because

00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:33,050
the people of your sample so you have a

00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:34,640
sample based on gender and did you break

00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:45,550
it down further to percentage of

00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:50,680
volunteer and and paid I and my

00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:55,460
temptation okay in my foundation like

00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:59,660
the like I thought the the match like

00:18:55,460 --> 00:19:02,620
the first row is my woman and the second

00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:05,600
row is men and it's quite different from

00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:13,430
the denotes that created by men and the

00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:17,630
created by the men do not present under

00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:20,420
men so it's like more details and it's

00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:27,680
also work when I see the unpaid me puts

00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:29,840
the woman in tech numbers was there a

00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:32,600
difference between how men and women had

00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:34,310
access second technology in training so

00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:37,190
you notice a difference in what they map

00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:39,050
and how they map and in their survey but

00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:40,910
was there something about the access to

00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:42,020
technology and training that was

00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:43,550
different you said that in your

00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:46,280
conclusion as well but maybe you could

00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:50,630
tell us a little bit more about that

00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:53,180
sorry contiguity so the question was for

00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:55,250
the women and men that you interviewed

00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:57,380
was there a difference between the

00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:59,570
technology and training access did they

00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:00,440
have equal training and technology or

00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:05,180
was it different

00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:06,800
I really my equation on the island

00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:09,400
surface I didn't ask about the

00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:12,460
technology so but according to my

00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:15,610
article that I'm visit that I read about

00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:18,920
tech bicycle indica in bread and many

00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:26,230
we've been very man and woman behavior

00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:30,770
then they say the men use love to use

00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:35,450
using technology then woman so in my

00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:37,720
according my experience woman I'm not so

00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:43,280
interested in technology that men do

00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:47,510
most money but so that's why I said the

00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:51,940
men are better in technology and also

00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:54,410
like the department that the mostly by

00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:57,230
men doing like engineering and math

00:20:54,410 --> 00:21:00,920
there are a lot of men but just a few of

00:20:57,230 --> 00:21:02,540
moment okay and so I think somebody

00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,710
asked this question but it might be

00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:07,010
related and I think we might have

00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:09,140
answered it so I'm just gonna clarify so

00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:12,230
the way that you were able to identify

00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:14,150
the gender in your analysis is people

00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:15,800
self-identify their gender with you

00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:18,020
right in the survey that you do is that

00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:19,880
correct so you don't get it from the

00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:22,430
okay perfect okay so we've answered that

00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:24,340
question really happy to see all these

00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:28,880
questions here and I'll try and give a

00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:30,770
minute to breathe do you think there's a

00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,540
danger and this is from Gregory thanks

00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:35,930
Gregory do you think there's a danger

00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:38,150
that mappers of that some mappers avoid

00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:39,830
telling their gender or setting a name

00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:42,650
that identifies as gender because they

00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:45,380
do not want to have that conversation

00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:48,020
around men and women not be differently

00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:51,560
so do you think that that changes how

00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:52,970
people identify so people identified

00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:55,910
from their usernames in that but do you

00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:59,530
feel that that there's a danger in how

00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:59,530
people identify in terms of gender

00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:09,289
I think it is like in fact many people

00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:14,360
are not judging like a the agenda like

00:22:09,289 --> 00:22:17,750
many in in my mind government mainly my

00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:20,150
male friends are judging me because I'm

00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:23,390
female and I'm doing this job a

00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:28,210
geographer and they're like mocking me

00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:32,990
like I met at a determiner direction so

00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:36,169
because it is like a really wise if I am

00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:40,039
doesn't mean to need unnecessary to put

00:22:36,169 --> 00:22:43,640
the gender on the profiles of the people

00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:46,520
no need to guess which is my gender are

00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:50,809
we testable my Parliament from men or

00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:52,669
moment yeah I like to say that every

00:22:50,809 --> 00:22:54,350
contribution is a gift gents uneven I

00:22:52,669 --> 00:22:56,529
think that you know we need to recognize

00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:59,000
that and it's hard that that kind of

00:22:56,529 --> 00:23:01,970
comment could potentially deter somebody

00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,700
from being part of OpenStreetMap or any

00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:07,970
other technology community okay

00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:10,580
more questions take a deep breath are

00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:12,860
there more differences are there more

00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:17,690
differences between individual men and

00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:19,549
individual women versus the averages so

00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:21,770
did you notice the nuances in the data

00:23:19,549 --> 00:23:24,380
so you have these two data sets between

00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:26,690
how men have them people who

00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:27,679
self-identified as male in the met in

00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:29,620
the survey and the people who

00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:32,000
self-identified as female in the survey

00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:34,159
was there differences between any

00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,929
outliers of the data was it all pretty

00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:41,510
standard cut and dry

00:23:35,929 --> 00:23:45,320
do you follow that's on my research

00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:48,110
there that is like some sample there's

00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:51,169
no show did it's no difference between

00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:55,760
men individual men and independent woman

00:23:51,169 --> 00:23:59,330
I also found a woman do mapping like the

00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:02,210
men do and also the men like creep it

00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:05,140
knots like really detail like the woman

00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:08,210
do so it is really difficult to the

00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:10,010
difference is anything this which is the

00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:13,990
in deep into a man do and in if either

00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:17,180
woman do because there is no like

00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:19,330
clear clear differences between the

00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:22,190
individual back we can see from the

00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:25,520
leverage and between the Brookman and

00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:26,810
the proponent wonderful and you are you

00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,280
are going to publish your slide

00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:29,810
somewhere so that people can look at

00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:32,710
them are you going to make an OS M diary

00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:35,540
with your slides okay

00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:37,400
wonderful wonderful thank you and Kyle

00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:38,780
how much more time do we have because

00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:40,430
and Kyle's our wonderful tech person

00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:42,440
who's been with Trudy and I all morning

00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:43,460
we do have sex the questions here and I

00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:45,590
just want to make sure that I'm doing a

00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:47,930
time check to honor people's time we've

00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:49,340
got another ten minutes ten minutes all

00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:51,080
right take another deep breath Sonny

00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:54,280
Trudy did you want to do some of these

00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:58,070
questions with me okay

00:24:54,280 --> 00:25:00,170
over the Trudy already said she's gonna

00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:10,490
publish the research and now isn't Barry

00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:13,880
don't ask wonderful okay well how do you

00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:18,290
compute compute smoothness is it

00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:20,180
something qualitative some metrics it's

00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:24,320
something like quality beef wheat but

00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:26,930
from the points and H do I see we can't

00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:29,240
exceed smoothing the smoothing and

00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:33,050
putting that but from lies M each other

00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:35,270
there is a feature that we can see the

00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:38,780
differences between the men and women do

00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:43,180
and there is clear to D that is we can

00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:46,370
see the clearly from the curve and

00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:50,530
apparently we want to delete it not

00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:50,530
smarter more than women on the curve

00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:56,960
this question is quite coming up it

00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:59,330
looks I'm trying to rephrase it like

00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,650
making it in the comment section I think

00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:06,460
it's quite also interesting for me to

00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:06,460
know yeah about when you are category

00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:14,450
did you also did you engage also with a

00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:17,720
transgender or its know like the

00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:19,760
transgender oh did you also interact

00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:21,550
with those event no yet

00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:24,290
well no just decided about the agenda

00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:26,720
okay it's such a wonderful question so

00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:30,100
I've read about the Reese

00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:34,210
psychology research by GS cram syriza in

00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:36,710
2014 he said about white matter

00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:39,230
microstructure in transaxle and

00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:42,140
apparently the transgender groups were

00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:46,030
at implemented stage also some would say

00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:49,480
the hormone structure of transgender and

00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:52,730
this gender are similar so in my opinion

00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:54,350
the transgender woman can be grouped in

00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:58,090
the woman statistic and to do the

00:26:54,350 --> 00:27:01,190
instantly that can be it man statistic

00:26:58,090 --> 00:27:03,890
okay thank you yes so there's another

00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:05,809
one saying what suggestions do you have

00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:12,559
about increasing contribution of women

00:27:05,809 --> 00:27:14,419
in the mapping activity so it would be

00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:21,470
better if we make the most specific that

00:27:14,419 --> 00:27:23,360
is specific to buttons Atomos oh someone

00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:27,020
is asking about how can we increase

00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:29,809
contribution of women in activities

00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:31,760
according to you and do you think it

00:27:29,809 --> 00:27:33,500
will be better if we have holma patterns

00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,890
that have remained specific to their

00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:36,679
needs

00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:41,990
oh we have more precepts and tons that

00:27:36,679 --> 00:27:44,570
for women before many women are less

00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:47,659
confident about their special skills

00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:51,409
like they are in a burden they are

00:27:47,659 --> 00:28:01,730
addicting there no can be compared by

00:27:51,409 --> 00:28:03,950
the men yeah and I don't know how this

00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:06,380
has been covered yet but which part of

00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:08,960
the world does your research cover does

00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:22,059
it cover on the whole world or it only

00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:22,059
covers your country hello

00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:49,070
hello Debbie listen have you heard my

00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:56,300
question sunny I think

00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:58,910
Zana by you then I know looks like not

00:28:56,300 --> 00:29:01,300
Kyle I think we may have lost her

00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:03,740
we may have lost her alright well

00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:05,810
hopefully there's been a lot of

00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:07,910
questions in the chat here and I just

00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:09,830
want to say over the last few years

00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:11,890
we've run a number of sessions on gender

00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:13,910
and diversity and diversity inclusion

00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:16,640
and this research around gender

00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:18,620
performance and trying to do even just

00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:21,410
from one country and then do it more

00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:23,420
globally um is really exciting and I

00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:24,830
just want to thanks I need for the work

00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:27,830
that she said I'm sorry that she can't

00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:29,510
be here to hear us we did try and cover

00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:32,180
a lot of the questions between Trudy and

00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:33,800
I and I do see that there's a lot of

00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:35,660
dialogue there in the comments just

00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:37,400
around like how can we do more research

00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:39,590
on this so our friends from crowd map in

00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:41,780
Tanzania are saying that there's some

00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:43,550
comments about the methodology which I

00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:45,920
do encourage you to call in contacts I

00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:47,540
need the boat it seems to me that the

00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:49,700
you know OpenStreetMap is a research

00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:51,380
agenda you know people having research

00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:55,010
methodologies and sharing those best

00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:56,900
practices is really really important and

00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:58,160
that we do need to have more research in

00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:00,230
terms of that more rigor and

00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:02,630
understanding how people map and why

00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:04,880
they map and that's been a couple of

00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:07,420
themes today in terms of what what makes

00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:09,560
it's a map project like Open Street Map

00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:11,300
inclusive and diverse and so this

00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:14,420
morning we heard from one colleague

00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:19,520
talking about how do we help the wider

00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:22,820
ell disease LGBTQI community in in

00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:25,670
Philippines and we heard from from Dewey

00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:27,530
talking about behavior and how people

00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:29,120
interact and now we've heard from the

00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:31,700
Neeb and so each one of these

00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:33,260
conversations I believe shows a full arc

00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:35,420
and I'm glad that our sales amount

00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:36,290
friends put together this program to

00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:38,630
kind of

00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:40,310
this dialogue so with that maybe I'm sin

00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:42,170
sudden Eva's gone I would encourage you

00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:44,510
to email her or contact her directly

00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:46,010
with questions and she did promise it

00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:47,480
she'll put the slides on there and and

00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:48,740
Trudy do you have any closing comments

00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:52,070
before I talk about the diversity

00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:54,800
inclusion committee over the Trudy any

00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:57,140
comments about this session no I do not

00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:59,510
have a desk what a lot of conversation

00:30:57,140 --> 00:31:01,490
because we are trying like cluster we

00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:04,660
met and we talked about something so

00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:07,940
well for the follow-up and also

00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:10,280
different things that we all need your

00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:12,110
motivation yeah and I just want to thank

00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:14,000
again all the research that people have

00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:15,500
done and share today about diversity and

00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,270
inclusion with an open stream app

00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:19,640
there's a lot of questions and all the

00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:21,260
pads and I hope that we can kind of put

00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:23,150
them all together to be able to tell a

00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:24,710
story but that story doesn't stop I'm

00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:27,650
after state of the map it's an ongoing

00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:29,870
thing so we there is a diversity

00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:31,490
inclusion special committee a mailing

00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:33,500
list a note has been sent out to the

00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:35,120
mailing list you can also find the wiki

00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:37,850
links that we put into the ends of the

00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:39,170
pad for you here there are quite a few

00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:41,480
people who want to have this

00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:42,980
conversation and so not sure if there's

00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:44,980
a self-organized session about this

00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:47,180
today I certainly have been online since

00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:49,310
7:30 looking at this

00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:50,690
so hopefully out you do get a chance to

00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:52,310
look at that but with that I want to

00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:54,470
thanks any of I'm sorry that she had to

00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:57,020
go and then her internet connection went

00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:59,510
and so that maybe will just end a little

00:31:57,020 --> 00:32:01,190
bit earlier with that with that Kyle and

00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:02,420

00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:02,810
a pleasure to co-host with you this

00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:05,420
morning

00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:07,310
it looks like she might be back just as

00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:12,980
deep and give her just an honor just to

00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:16,370
honor her hi welcome back to need hi my

00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:18,080
thank you Lisa yeah no we were just

00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:19,550
asking if you had any closing comments

00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:25,220
or things that you'd like people to

00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:26,810
think about okay just some suggestions

00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:28,130
or comments on what what do you think

00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:29,300
people should think about in terms of

00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:37,040
this topic because you've spent some

00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:39,890
time on this topic what suggestions do

00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:41,480
you have for people to do this kind of

00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:44,810
research what kind of suggestions do you

00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:47,060
have for people if somebody was to do

00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:49,750
this research in their country what what

00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:54,770
what can they learn from you

00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:59,090
maybe well I guess with the station path

00:32:54,770 --> 00:33:03,590
that maybe for the quarter horsepower

00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:07,220
research we can learn about any gender

00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:09,470
not just male and female to to know more

00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:12,830
about how the differences between the

00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:15,290
other genders right and so you use

00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:18,550
always awesome cha for this so tell us a

00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:18,550
little bit more about how you use that

00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:27,620
we're using more time job I'm like I

00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:32,750
like dry I use a like ten samples each

00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:33,620
for the users and from the zip from the

00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:38,090
tank samples

00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:40,490
I met the I mean I'm at the their

00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:42,650
baseball map and that we did not skip

00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:46,280
waste and the object and I might open it

00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:49,910
in a signal using Excel wonderful

00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:51,680
wonderful well you have any suggestions

00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:55,360
for people on this research how would

00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:55,360
the how would how can you improve it

00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:03,050
maybe part of our research they can use

00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:05,960
the mod samples and the more

00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:08,330
participants not only just the paid my

00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:09,830
personal meaning but for the unpaid

00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:13,460
members that community volunteer because

00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:17,840
the open sea map is using by a public

00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:20,030
not just by the papers right right so

00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:22,370
open street map is is complex and

00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:24,409
beautiful wonderful was a need but thank

00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:26,300

Facebook could they find you there or

00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:31,340

00:34:29,659 --> 00:34:33,740
diary entry about this just in case

00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:34,790
people want to ask you questions how

00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:41,899

00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:51,889
that I'm Heather it's been a pleasure to

00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:54,320

00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,590
forward to having more conversations

00:34:55,550 --> 00:35:00,170
about the future of OpenStreetMap and

00:34:57,590 --> 00:35:01,790
about gender diversity inclusion Trudy

00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:02,430
any last thoughts I think send me this

00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:03,900

be great yeah I just want to see how

00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:12,599
best a different research can be

00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:14,309
committed together it would be very

00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:15,900
interesting to see like if all the heads

00:35:14,309 --> 00:35:18,630
can be put together to come up with one

00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:21,660

00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:22,829
helpful for the community wonderful yeah
