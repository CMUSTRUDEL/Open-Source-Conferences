The talk will focus on the Turkish law egulating the acquisition, collection, dissemination and trading of spatial data falling within the responsibility matrix of Turkish National Geographic Information System, effective since February 20, 2020. With the law, acquisition, collection, dissemination and trading of spatial data which is defined within the National Spatial Data Responsibility Matrix by third party individuals or legal entities are subject to prior application fees and approval of the Ministry of Environmental and Urban Affairs. The talk will reflect and report the developments in Turkey after the law, effects and implications drawn focusing on the national spatial sector, OSM, and the Turkish OSM community.

On January 30, members of the Turkish parliament voted in favour of the proposed amendment to the law regulating the acquisition, collection, dissemination and trading of spatial data falling within the responsibility matrix of Turkish National Geographic Information System. The law has officially been put into practice on February 20, with nationwide uncertainties on how it will be enforced, and on what level.

With the law, the sole responsibility and authority on the national spatial data index is given to the Ministry of Environmental and Urban Affairs. Acquisition, collection, dissemination and trading of spatial data which is defined within the National Spatial Data Responsibility Matrix by third party individuals or legal entities are subject to prior approval of the ministry. Moreover, the approval will be subject to a fee of 25₺ for native, 50₺ for foreign parties per each 1/1000 plan corresponding to the study region(s) from the national topographical grid.

The data layers which are included in the national spatial data responsibility list is as follows:

    1. Coordinate Reference Systems and Geographical Grid Systems 
    2. Administrative Units 
    3. Geographical Names 
    4. Cadastre 
    5. Buildings 
    6. Addresses 
    7. Elevation 
    8. Orthophoto 
    9. Transportation Networks 
    10. Hydrography 
    11. Geology 
    12. Land Cover 
    13. Land Use 
    14. Soil Types 
    15. Protection Areas 
    16. Natural Risk Regions 
    17. Infrastructure 
    18. Energy Resources 
    19. Mines 
    20. Public Health and Safety 
    21. Populaiton Demographics 
    22. Environmental Monitoring Facilities 
    23. Industrial Facilities 
    24. Agricultural Facilities 
    25. Public Administration Regions 
    26. Flora and Fauna 
    27. Habitat Zones 
    28. Biogeographical Zones 
    29. Sea and Saltwater Regions 
    30. Atmospherical Data 
    31. Meteorological Data 
    32. NUTS Data 

The talk will reflect and report the developments in Turkey after the law, effects and implications drawn focusing on the national spatial sector, OSM, and the Turkish OSM community.

I'm a civil engineer but I also have a

00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:42,000
PhD in geomatics I'm currently a

00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:44,520
lecturer at math University in Turkey

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,680
I'm also the founding member and chair

00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:49,470
of board of watches on Nash mapping for

00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:52,110
every one of situation in Istanbul and

00:01:49,470 --> 00:02:03,360
I'm also currently project manager with

00:01:52,110 --> 00:02:07,170

geospatially and I'm officially unfit a

00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:35,580
vengeance - okay so what we are doing

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,580
with ya asana is that we have we founded

the artisan in 2017 and we are aiming to

00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:44,790
promote the use of open geospatial data

00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:46,920
and its related tools for purposes like

00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:50,040
disaster management disaster relief

00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:52,769
community mapping and academic research

00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:54,989
etc and we are operating in close

00:02:52,769 --> 00:02:57,150
collaboration and partnership with mint

00:02:54,989 --> 00:03:00,180
and OpenStreetMap team in our projects

00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:03,930
you can see a couple of pictures at the

00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:06,470
side these are our members and mappers

00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:11,970
that are we that we are working together

00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:13,500
in in these activities we have been

00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:18,329
partnering and different organizations

00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:20,640
and Geo's etc as well so what our work

00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:25,190
has started with a refugee mapping and

00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:27,450
in Istanbul so we have a quite high

00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:29,760
population of Syrian refugees in

00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:33,269
Istanbul they're out of camp refugees

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:36,209
and what we have done is just we were

00:03:33,269 --> 00:03:37,230
partnering with other organizations to

00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:38,880
improve

00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:41,280
adaptability to improve that adaptation

00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:44,810
of the Syrian refugees in Istanbul and

00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:47,880
you can see a brochure map a

00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:50,720
transportation brochure that we have

00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:53,970
prepared that the refugees Association

00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,799
in Istanbul partnering with again

00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:59,850
maintain OpenStreetMap in our previous

00:03:55,799 --> 00:04:02,740
project we are currently focusing on

00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:05,590
road network improvement and the

00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:09,130
in the region focusing on both Greece

00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:11,170
and Turkey and for the past two years we

00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:14,380
have mapped more than we have edited

00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:19,630
more than 100,000 kilometres of highway

00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:21,550
data in both countries we are again as I

00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:25,540
mentioned we have been partnering with

00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:29,550
UNHCR in Istanbul the chamber of serving

00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:33,250
Hadassah engineers Turkish Linux users

00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:37,810
Association the the turkeys Search and

00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:40,180
Rescue Association etc so in our in in

00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:43,500
that community work we are promoting

00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:47,020
OpenStreetMap use of OpenStreetMap

00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:50,350
OpenStreetMap data tools are their open

00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:53,140
software like QGIS at cetera with doing

00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:55,120
marathons workshops and trainings that

00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:57,070
be organized and collaborate with

00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:00,370
different organizations and different

00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:02,620
groups so we are organizing marathons we

00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:08,650
are organizing workshops on advanced

00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:13,510
OpenStreetMap QGIS gnu/linux PostgreSQL

00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:16,510
post GIS etc so whatever mapping to

00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:19,540
whatever open mapping tool is available

00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:22,900
we are interested in the Turkish

00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:24,880
community to use it more and benefit all

00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:30,130
of its advantages and benefits of its

00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:33,100
use more than seventy fourth we are yes

00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:36,790
- and we are also members of Turkish or

00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:40,890
Pacific community opposite net community

00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:45,190
of Turkey contains yes is honor but not

00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:48,940
all of the Turkish members are members

00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:52,140
of yesterday attitude so we are

00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:54,280
organizing your community over the

00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:58,900
taught here in a booth

00:05:54,280 --> 00:06:00,910
actually there was all one once and then

00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:04,830
we have established the selectional and

00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:07,960
we have established a Facebook group and

00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:11,980
the group and the spec channels are

00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:16,169
under control of administration of users

00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:19,639
so as Turkish open signal quality

00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:25,789
we organize marathons and most of them

00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:32,610
focused of hub tasks we would contribute

00:06:25,789 --> 00:06:35,159
humanitarian tasks mostly and we online

00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:38,999
discussions about opposite map the data

00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:43,050
quality or consider wiki the tags and

00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:47,400
the other stuff some tips and tricks we

00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:52,289
always here and right now if you check

00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:56,159
the nice ones website you can see the

00:06:52,289 --> 00:07:02,129
contribution from committee of Turkey is

00:06:56,159 --> 00:07:09,360
decreasing and the decrease is can be

00:07:02,129 --> 00:07:12,860
seen on the graph started in 2000 so we

00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:15,389
are going to talk about the design oh

00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:17,339
yeah there's there's a reason for that

00:07:15,389 --> 00:07:20,399
the quiz because now right now the

00:07:17,339 --> 00:07:22,800
OpenStreetMap community is there's

00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:25,620
certain uncertainties regarding the

00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:29,699
production of geospatial data in Turkey

00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:32,250
so in in January we have the news that

00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:33,870
there's a new law is going to be passed

00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:36,649
on national geographic information

00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:39,569
systems which would regulate production

00:07:36,649 --> 00:07:42,620
management and dissemination of special

00:07:39,569 --> 00:07:44,849
spatial data and with the law of the

00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:47,039
responsibility on the National spatial

00:07:44,849 --> 00:07:49,439
data index is given to the Ministry of

00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:52,740
Environment and environmental and urban

00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:54,599
affairs and the law says that the text

00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:56,789
says that acquisition collection

00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:58,800
dissemination and trading of spatial

00:07:56,789 --> 00:08:00,360
data which is defined within this

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,969
responsibility within national

00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,800
responsibility metrics by third party

00:08:02,969 --> 00:08:06,930
individuals or legal entities are

00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,589
subject to prior approval of the

00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:09,779
ministry

00:08:07,589 --> 00:08:12,089
moreover the approval will be subject

00:08:09,779 --> 00:08:14,520
for a fee of twenty five Turkish Liras

00:08:12,089 --> 00:08:16,919
for native and 450 Turkish trust for

00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:19,199
foreign parties per each one over

00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:21,379
thousand plants corresponding to the

00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:25,440
study regions from the National

00:08:21,379 --> 00:08:28,710
topographical grid and it wasn't clear

00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:31,470
at the first draft it wasn't clear

00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:34,110
first text but when we look at the

00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:35,760
ministry's website and look at what is

00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:38,100
that data layers what is that

00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:41,670
responsibility matrix the data falling

00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:44,060
into these 32 categories these 30 new

00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:46,830
layers are falling within the

00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:51,780
responsibility of this newly passed law

00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:53,730
and all these are the general layers

00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:56,460
that is the general layer structure but

00:08:53,730 --> 00:09:01,380
all of the data that is falling within

00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:03,020
this is just the responsibilities

00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:07,710
assigned to different governmental

00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:09,240
organizations and it was when we first

00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:14,610
went looking at the text was quite

00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:16,620
restrictive in perspective of mappers in

00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:19,740
perspective of people working in this

00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:27,960
sector within Turkey which is outside of

00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:31,680
government organizations the new law

00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:34,220
uses plans for calculating the press if

00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:38,340
you divide turkey map into what

00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:42,180
thousands map sheets we will reach 600

00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:46,770
thousand sheets roughly it will cost 15

00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:55,380
million Turkish does for a party to use

00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:59,340
or create or edit copy or sell the whole

00:09:55,380 --> 00:10:08,090
country data and 15 million Turkish

00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:12,120
Liras is click on colors approximately

00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:17,450
it will be huge for a party who would

00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:21,540
like to use the whole country data and

00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:23,670
after this after this law after this law

00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:25,770
was passed in the parliament there were

00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:30,570
lots of comments and there were lots of

00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:32,930
talk within the community so one of one

00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:37,080
of one of the most active contributors

00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:39,150
nessam said that after this low I'm just

00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:41,460
stopping contributing to Turkish data

00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:42,490
and he said that he's contributing to

00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:46,990
Chinese data

00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:50,260
instead one of our members of the

00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:51,760
community site I'm sure that he will be

00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:55,780
also participating in this event

00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:59,200
highside he just made a questionnaire

00:10:55,780 --> 00:11:01,810
and asking after this passing law will

00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:05,080
he continue contributing the Turkish map

00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:06,910
to the Facebook group to the

00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:10,540
OpenStreetMap Turkey's Facebook group

00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:12,310
and most of the almost one-third more

00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:14,410
than one-third of the contributor said

00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:18,760
that they have stopped contributing to

00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:20,710
Turkish data on OpenStreetMap the same

00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:23,400
amount of the users say that they are

00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:26,980
continuing contributing to the data and

00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:29,320
lots of oh maybe one-fourth of that

00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:31,180
people say that they are started

00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:33,790
contributing they keep contributing the

00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:36,820
OpenStreetMap but outside of Turkey so

00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:38,200
this is why there was the drop in the

00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:40,180
contributions there was a drop in

00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:46,630
contributions in Turkish OpenStreetMap

00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:48,910
data in 2020 after the after the bill

00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:50,860
has passed minister of employment and

00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:53,740
urban planning started working on

00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:56,070
regulations they wanted all actors to

00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:58,810
comment about the regulations contact

00:11:56,070 --> 00:12:01,360
assassin and we sent recommendations the

00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:04,810
transfer opens your special data

00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:07,570
innovation and our main focus was about

00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:12,400
obligations of payments so we said that

00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:14,560
basically open data and use create

00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:17,200
instant copy of non-commissioned data

00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:25,860
and crowd-sourced data production should

00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:29,620
be free and after that in April 2000 20

00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:32,160
the Ministry published a revised draft

00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:34,960
of the law but there were no mention

00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:41,350
there are no mentions to open the tap on

00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:43,990
the device drugs either during this time

00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:47,830
also the ministry has announced the use

00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:50,050
of geospatial portals and I mean in

00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:52,540
couple of talks and couple of news etc

00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:55,000
they also mentioned that there would be

00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:56,110
an open data portal there will be a

00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,350
national

00:12:56,110 --> 00:13:00,880
graphical data portal that all the data

00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:03,100
that was mentioned in those

00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:07,450
responsibility mattress mattresses would

00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:10,209
be accessible but it wasn't clear the

00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:11,920
level of accessibility etc but there's

00:13:10,209 --> 00:13:15,010
now an online service called

00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:17,079
atlas go TR and there are different

00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:19,750
access tokens available there you can

00:13:17,079 --> 00:13:22,360
have a public access so you can enter

00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:25,540
just and you can enter there anonymously

00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:28,420
but with that with that access you can

00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:31,029
only see a very limited data that is

00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:33,940
open to access you can apply for

00:13:31,029 --> 00:13:37,140
authorized access so you just apply for

00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:40,029
a user name apply for a user token and

00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:43,630
after one or two days you are granted a

00:13:40,029 --> 00:13:48,970
user token so that you are now having

00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:51,790
access to view more data compared to a

00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:53,500
public access and there's a higher level

00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:56,230
access cough cough governmental

00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:59,200
organization access all the data that is

00:13:56,230 --> 00:14:01,449
defined in this national geographical

00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:04,600
mattress national matrix are accessible

00:14:01,449 --> 00:14:09,610
by the government organizations in that

00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:11,620
system when we're coming to this month

00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:13,449
earlier this month the national

00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:16,870
geographic information systems committee

00:14:13,449 --> 00:14:19,060
has conducted its first meeting so this

00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:22,870
committee is overseeing is going to

00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:24,670
oversee this national geospatial data

00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:28,449
infrastructure the committee will

00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:31,959
oversee the operation of Alaska TR port

00:14:28,449 --> 00:14:33,670
data portal etc the public announcement

00:14:31,959 --> 00:14:37,660
made after the first meetings is that

00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:39,310
there's a they mentioned development of

00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:42,370
a new national geographic information

00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:45,279
platform and online tools to access all

00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:48,760
national data but it is still unclear

00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:51,250
and and on the the access licensing and

00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:53,440
registration details of the data

00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:56,339
available in that portal is still

00:14:53,440 --> 00:15:00,970
unclear so there's not still not an

00:14:56,339 --> 00:15:05,370
explanation about the regulations and

00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:09,640
potential restrictions for third parties

00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:11,260
but from the ministry's website

00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:14,830
you can access that there there's a

00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:18,310
spatial data services pool so there are

00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:20,320
there are the WMS and wfs service is

00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:22,990
accessible from desktop environments

00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:25,540
which is quite a good feature and which

00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:30,070
is quite an important important feature

00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:31,990
so you can that there's a tutorial video

00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:33,850
provided there you can just see the

00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:35,440
shortened links shortened URLs and you

00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:37,870
can follow there but the video isn't

00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,970
Turkish and the second link you can see

00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:42,070
in the screen and we are just going to

00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:44,110
share it within the message res message

00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:46,480
facility of that so if you want to

00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:48,820
access that so if you follow these links

00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:52,840
you can see the list of services list of

00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:55,030
WMS services in XML format some of them

00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:57,310
are not operational because the Ministry

00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:58,750
of organ organization aren't serving all

00:15:57,310 --> 00:16:00,730
of them but other government

00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:03,280
organizations are responsible for its

00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:05,740
service but the information is being

00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:09,700
transferred and shared by the Minister

00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:11,890
of urbanisation so in that list of

00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:15,580
examples a very comprehensive list are

00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:18,010
but lots of inoperative services at the

00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:19,420
moment some services are accessible so

00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:23,770
you can see a couple of screenshots

00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:26,650
regarding that and almost all of the

00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:29,920
data services letters listed in the XML

00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:32,230
file says that these data is strictly

00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:35,290
for information purposes it cannot be

00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:37,660
used in legal or official processes data

00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:39,850
cannot be duplicated and published for

00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:41,500
the use of third parties and if the

00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:43,930
datasets are found to be used for

00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:47,730
commercial purposes legal action will be

00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:50,710
taken against parties responsible so

00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:53,170
although we are able to access a huge

00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:55,660
chunk of data at the moment there's

00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:59,290
still big questions about their

00:16:55,660 --> 00:17:01,750
licensing so we can you know in in what

00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:06,010
manner we can use that data or if what

00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:09,610
may be if we can just refer to that data

00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:11,860
to build or to produce other geographic

00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:13,930
information or if the information

00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:16,329
derived from this data can be used in

00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:18,730
other services like Open Street Map so

00:17:16,329 --> 00:17:20,610
it is still there is still a level of

00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:27,329
uncertainty

00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:30,659
at these processes yes son we contacted

00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:33,000
the ministry again this month and they

00:17:30,659 --> 00:17:34,769
said that the work on their regulations

00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,250
are going on and they are still

00:17:34,769 --> 00:17:39,899
examining your recommendations also they

00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:41,340
mentioned that they have plans to

00:17:39,899 --> 00:17:45,120
publish some data with open data

00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:47,880
licenses and we offered a collaboration

00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:50,669
with opposite Knapp we are still

00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:56,100
expecting the results of the examination

00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:58,230
of our recommendations so the time of

00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:02,460
that presentation we didn't get an

00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:05,220
official reply but by the time but

00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:08,190
between this time and between state of

00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:10,230
the map if we have any information we

00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:14,279
will most probably be discussing that at

00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:17,820
the questions at the questions part so

00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:23,279
thanks a lot for joining us in that

00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:26,010
online session hope that we were able to

00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:29,309
draw a good frame of a good perspective

00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:31,019
on what's going on in Turkey and we'd be

00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:36,450
happy to discuss more if you have

00:18:31,019 --> 00:18:38,669
questions so messages from Istanbul and

00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:41,570
you will be expecting your business

00:18:38,669 --> 00:18:41,570
organisation

00:19:07,220 --> 00:20:16,159
I think we're waiting for jr2 I am I am

00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:20,450
so directly descriptions um we can but I

00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:22,549
can give also as more update since the

00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:26,500
time we have recorded this in our

00:20:22,549 --> 00:20:33,140
presentation within this week new

00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:35,960
legislations legislations regarding to

00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:38,960
those law has also asked now the

00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:42,530
government has also now share the

00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:44,480
timeline regarding the National patient

00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:49,970
information system Nations or graphic

00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:53,780
information systems so it maintains how

00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:56,150
all other governmental organizations are

00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:59,090
Co are going to contribute to this

00:20:56,150 --> 00:21:02,929
system how will they support that system

00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:06,320
how can they share their data or access

00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:08,780
others governmental organizations data

00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:12,710
to those there also talks about the

00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:16,730
licensing at Russell comprehensive plan

00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:20,020
for the future regarding to that data

00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:21,880
but as far as we have

00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:27,429
read through and as far as we have

00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:30,910
followed it is more focusing on how the

00:21:27,429 --> 00:21:32,770
government organizations will be

00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:36,190
structured around and clustered around

00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:38,200
this new geographic information law and

00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:41,280
again there is there's going be

00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:43,030
licensing about the data that those

00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:47,350
organizations that are going to produce

00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:50,200
this yeah but still we couldn't get any

00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:53,050
clearer information and clear intention

00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:55,240
regarding other data sources and other

00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:59,910
open data sources like OpenStreetMap or

00:21:55,240 --> 00:22:04,120
others public or private contributors

00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:08,830
geospatial data so again we don't have a

00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:13,450
clear idea on how that new law is going

00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:15,630
to be enforced or applied in the coming

00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:18,970
weeks out in the coming coming coming

00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:23,380
months and years I'm sorry so there's

00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:26,320
still uncertainties art going on in some

00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:29,590
aspect there are still questions that we

00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:32,200
need to ask officials on how how

00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:34,330
everything will shape up oh I just

00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:40,660
wanted to give you this update before

00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:46,270
going to the question thank you young by

00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:48,880
the update the first fiction is what

00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:52,090
what is the reasoning for the law is it

00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:55,059
connected with the sistine quadrant

00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:58,360
separation factor in control of math on

00:22:55,059 --> 00:23:00,700
this and the second one is do you think

00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:04,390
the government will try to exercise any

00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:09,760
control over nonprofit contributors to

00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:12,900
isempty um I don't think it has a direct

00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:16,600
connection with the separatist movement

00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:19,210
I mean it has also there may be some

00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:21,010
connection because there's also the

00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:25,360
national geographic information law of

00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:27,850
government standardized data so there

00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:30,760
may be disputed names disputing name

00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:33,070
means disputed boundaries not only the

00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:37,480
Kurdish separatist movement but

00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:43,259
there's also others other fractions or

00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:46,779
other groups that the government is also

00:23:43,259 --> 00:23:48,820
against at the moment so name that there

00:23:46,779 --> 00:23:52,720
have been lots of name changes that in

00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:59,590
lots of regions after the coup attempt

00:23:52,720 --> 00:24:02,289
in 2015 so again you'll and movements

00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:04,480
naming some of the names of places some

00:24:02,289 --> 00:24:07,690
of namings of streets etc have changed

00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:10,120
it also has to do something with that

00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:14,019
also the government wants to have a

00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:21,039
standardised legalized data structures

00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:24,490
and also one reason of it would be the

00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:26,980
the fragmentation of government data

00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:28,659
between government organizations the

00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:31,960
communication and data sharing

00:24:28,659 --> 00:24:36,220
government organizations are not working

00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:38,950
perfect so this is also something going

00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:43,570
through a centralized national

00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:46,080
geographic information system but some

00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:51,399
that there have been some concerns about

00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:53,860
people in the sector or people have

00:24:51,399 --> 00:24:55,809
voluntary the contributing to not

00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:58,509
feature map maps this mapping system

00:24:55,809 --> 00:25:00,309
type opens me not for example or could

00:24:58,509 --> 00:25:04,830
you wanna do you want to have extra

00:25:00,309 --> 00:25:10,919
comments on that I don't want to add

00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:13,059
because yeah we guess that it is about

00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:15,720
centralizing and it's about the

00:25:13,059 --> 00:25:21,250
economical issues it is not about

00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:23,259
political issues mostly yeah and the

00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:24,399
second question we missed that do you

00:25:23,259 --> 00:25:26,559
think the government will try to

00:25:24,399 --> 00:25:29,230
exercise any control over non-turkish

00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:31,179
contributors or some map data so we

00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:34,240
didn't get any specific feedback

00:25:31,179 --> 00:25:38,200
regarding OpenStreetMap and we didn't

00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:40,539
see any issues or any roadblocks

00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:43,500
since then regarding OpenStreetMap data

00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:43,500
production

00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:50,700
the the officials from the ministry are

00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:53,680
aware of what OpenStreetMap is what

00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:56,410
OpenStreetMap data is what the

00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:59,110
OpenStreetMap communities so we had that

00:25:56,410 --> 00:26:00,640
impression when we when we had a chat

00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:04,770
with them and when we had an unofficial

00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:07,990
chat with them right now there's no

00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:11,140
action against OpenStreetMap

00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:12,940
contributors worldwide and if even if

00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:15,040
there would be an action towards

00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:18,250
OpenStreetMap I think it would be in

00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:19,900
action towards the database do SMF it

00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:25,030
mean it would be on the awesome website

00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:28,920
instead of the user site yeah we haven't

00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:32,800
experienced with Wikipedia in the past

00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:37,480
which PDA was blocked in Turkey for

00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:39,550
three years or so so you don't want be

00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:42,760
in the same disaster it's opposite map

00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:47,980
data and contributors so we are trying

00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:51,910
to tell the government that the open

00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:56,050
signal data is important and they need

00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:58,870
to let all the contributors worldwide to

00:26:56,050 --> 00:27:02,260
contribute to provide data to produce

00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:07,300
data yeah and our discussion was

00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:09,580
involving non-commercial use of Open

00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:12,870
Street Map data and non-commercial use

00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:16,140
of Open Street Map tools would should

00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:19,180
continue but if there would be some

00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:22,840
governance on that at least it should be

00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:24,910
on the commercial activities on Open

00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:26,950
Street Map data so that may be a middle

00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:31,330
ground another middle ground would be

00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:32,590
just maybe it would be that there should

00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:35,110
be suggestion there can be a

00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:39,910
communication between OS MF and ministry

00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:42,460
so that the licensing issues etc may be

00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:45,430
resolved and we also don't know how that

00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:48,490
national data as licensing would be if

00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:51,120
it's if if if if if that data is shared

00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:53,680
with an open line students we may just

00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:55,690
import that data to OpenStreetMap so

00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:56,780
that the OpenStreetMap data layers would

00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:58,940
be compliant

00:27:56,780 --> 00:28:00,710
with the National Turkish national

00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:03,380
geographic information system so there

00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:05,900
are still lots of questions even we

00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:08,480
didn't get the answers to and thanks a

00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:13,970
lot for lots of support messages you you

00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:16,460
put on the notepad regarding English in

00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:19,190
English documentation the ministry's

00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:20,930
website is only in Turkish at the moment

00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:22,130
we checked the English version of it an

00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:25,670
English version of the ministry's

00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:28,400
website was empty but if you just

00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:30,320

00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:38,000
give you provide the information about

00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:43,000
that or to provide some mediation is how

00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,000
can those of outside Turkey support you

00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:55,790
together with us because we can improve

00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:59,410
what we say by data by collaborative

00:28:55,790 --> 00:29:04,790
data it is meaningful thanks for asking

00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:07,370
yeah yeah I mean in the short term I

00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:09,890
don't think there should be his support

00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:14,450
will be necessary but in in the longer

00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:23,870
term if OS M F and the Ministry would be

00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:26,870
involved in discussions that maybe the

00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:28,970
other one is comment I had no idea about

00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:33,650
this my sympathy is not what his

00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:35,540
colleagues so if you can if you want to

00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:37,880
add anything these are the questions or

00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:42,950
maybe you want to update us more about

00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:46,640
the laws he can go ahead um I think I

00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:48,440
think so like I'm going to say right now

00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:53,150
for if or could I want to add something

00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:56,860

00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:59,420
but it was a great honor to be here with
