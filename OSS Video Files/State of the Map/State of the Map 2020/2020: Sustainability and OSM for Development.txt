We have seen an explosion of OSM mapping in the last few years around maps for development and humanitarian uses, particularly in Africa. During this time it has also become clear that sustaining this essential mapping work, and keeping maps up to date, was going to be a primary concern. Building a healthy mapping ecosystem around mapping for development will not necessarily be able to follow the same model as it has in more developed countries. In this talk, I will share the culmination of my research on sustainability with the World Bank’s Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery and their Open Cities Africa project, and some ways that we can best support mappers and grow a healthier global OSM ecosystem.

Two years ago, at SOTM in Milan, I and several colleagues held a panel discussion around sustainability challenges that were common to working with OSM in developing countries. Mappers spoke up about their struggles continuing to map, keeping maps up to date, and growing their mapper communities in places with very few resources. This research has now concluded with a white paper on the topic, and many new learnings along the way. In this talk, I’ll review the outcomes of "Sustainability in OpenStreetMap", https://opendri.org/resource/sustainability-in-openstreetmap/, a publication under OpenDRI at the World Bank. 

While many groups and projects are arising to do mapping throughout the world, and many for a social purpose, we found a number of challenges to keeping mapping moving forward and overcoming hurdles. These include financial, technological, social, and political challenges, each with its own kind of possible solutions. I also looked into the varieties of OSM actors that would be most likely found in contexts of OSM in development, and what challenges they each may face. These actors include governmental mappers, independent consultants, businesses and startups, nonprofit organizations of a wide variety, international NGOs, formal and informal chapters, and more. Finally, I identified some solutions and supports that are most needed to create a sustainable OSM environment in low-resource geographies. In this talk I will share about all of these findings, and we will discuss the best ways to support a strong international mapper ecosystem.

to kick off

00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,840
with this session um sustainability and

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,280
osm for development

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,000
thanks

00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,520
hi my name is erica hagen and i will be

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,119
talking to you about some

00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,560
uh work that i've been doing on

00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,600
sustainability

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,360
issues in open street map with open

00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,479
cities africa

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,479
part of the world bank

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:49,600
so two years ago at state of the map

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:52,720
in milan actually we organized a panel

00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:55,759
about this topic so

00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,439
myself and several colleagues

00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,119
held a panel about sustainability

00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:01,840
challenge that were common to working in

00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:04,960
openstreetmap in developing countries

00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:08,239
um particularly mappers spoke up about

00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:10,640
struggles continuing to map keeping maps

00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,680
up to date growing their communities in

00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:17,280
places with

00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:17,280
very few resources and this research

00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,879
has now concluded with a white paper on

00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,520
the topic um

00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:27,440
sustainability and openstreetmap under

00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:31,840
the opendri

00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:33,840
section of the world bank so um

00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,239
yeah so in this talk i would like to

00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:40,720
share some about those findings

00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:41,599
and also some ways that we can support a

00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,360
more

00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:45,040
a stronger international map or

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:49,120
ecosystem

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:52,400
so first i'd like to introduce this

00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,680
by um saying that you know i think we

00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,440
all need to acknowledge that

00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,319
openstreetmap is no longer

00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:01,440
and hasn't been for a while really

00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:03,040
primarily just a western european or u.s

00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,720
centric

00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:09,599
endeavor anymore um but

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,519
that said traditionally we also should

00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:14,640
all be aware as mappers that

00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:17,120
maps have been tools of power over

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,239
ways to claim territory ways to hold

00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,360
power

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:23,519
and so openstreetmap of course is so

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,720
important to many of us because of that

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,480
very potential

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:30,400
to reverse this to make it possible for

00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,080
everyone to map

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,000
and this is super important thing to

00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,720
just preface with i feel in

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,680
afrikaan here we are in virtual cape

00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,799
town

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,239
um where as we know maps were one of the

00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,360
key tools that were used

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:49,519
to conquer and colonize and slice

00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,879
up um the territory by european powers

00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,920
when they were

00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:56,000
decided to claim the territory of africa

00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,000
amongst themselves and it had been

00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,879
obviously mapped very differently prior

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,879
to that moment

00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,519
and let's not also forget that that

00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:08,799
endeavor itself was chiefly economic

00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,239
so um in nature so economic forces at

00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,959
play in developing countries should

00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,080
really

00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:16,320
in terms of geography and mapping itself

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,840
should be considered in this context as

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,799
well

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,240
and sustainability of mapping by people

00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:23,919
that live in

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,800
not just africa but developing and

00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:29,440
emerging economies

00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,479
should really be first and foremost so

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,720
in order to

00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,639
achieve this potential for everyone who

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,680
wants to to be able to belong to the

00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,320
openstreetmap

00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,080
community and be take ownership over

00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:43,440
this project themselves

00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:46,880
um and not to kind of reproduce

00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,720
power imbalances and that already exist

00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,160
in our world but to kind of create

00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,000
something better

00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,440
um we really need to support those local

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,919
communities and mappers

00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,840
but how to do so is not really all that

00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:01,280
clear a lot of the time

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,400
so um yeah i i guess i feel that we need

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,919
to look at that a little

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,080
more closely and that's what inspired a

00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:09,199
lot of this sustainability

00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:13,120
um work

00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:14,320
so um

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,800
i wanted to look more closely at

00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,639
sustainability in places like where i've

00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,000
worked for 10 years mapping which is

00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:23,120
kenya

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,600
with map kibera

00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,919
my partner mikhail and i started map

00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,759
kibera and almost immediately saw

00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,759
that there was like a lot of interest a

00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,919
lot of need for

00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,600
mapping and citizens were really excited

00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:38,639
about it and the potential

00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,639
to create their own maps

00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:45,759
and use them for for change and

00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,680
um so increasingly

00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,360
this kind of access issue by less

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,720
privileged mappers became

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,720
a real passion of mine seeing that

00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,240
the typical way that things work with

00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,680
maps and data

00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:02,960
in places like kenya is that

00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,160
those they are created about people

00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,160
living in poverty

00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,080
they are not created by them typically

00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:11,680
they are not given access

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:14,240
so governments create maps but so do

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,880
ngos and international agencies trying

00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,000
to

00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:20,960
provide aid um and

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,639
just everyone is or researchers is

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,560
another category that's that's often

00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:27,759
creating data and maps

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:30,000
um without sharing it so um

00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:32,000
it was just really striking i think to

00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,440
me and start working in kibera in

00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,080
particular an informal

00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,639
settlement how much research and data

00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,520
and

00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,800
maps really were gathered about people

00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,880
without their knowledge

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,639
and approval or maybe with a little bit

00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,360
of knowledge but certainly without

00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,560
any chance to access the results or to

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,680
much less

00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:54,000
help use them to make their own choices

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,160
or to improve policies that affected

00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,080
them very very very personally

00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,840
so there's still this mentality of we

00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:03,280
know what's best for you

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:06,080
we the government we the ngos we the

00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,880
external you know the foreigners that

00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,240
come into

00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:12,560
to help know better um and

00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,919
you don't get to decide what's what's

00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,360
best for you

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:19,440
um we have the data we get to decide

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,840
so having this ability to map an

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:25,039
openstreetmap was really

00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:28,160
potentially a piece of that puzzle um

00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:30,800
trying to shift that mentality and shift

00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,800
that kind of

00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,720
assumption really that people don't want

00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,680
to take part in

00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:40,319
highly technical projects which is

00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,639
definitely not the case

00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,319
so well so bringing this back to

00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,680
sustainability

00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,759
we might have seen these kind of needs

00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,560
but the the potential to sustain the

00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,520
mapping was

00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,840
really difficult to achieve and starting

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,240
with

00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,039
training people there was you know

00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,759
supporting

00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:59,599
capacity or just trying to solve this

00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:02,879
puzzle of how

00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:05,280
to sustain um something what

00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:07,680
we hoped would be some really impactful

00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:11,919
stuff so

00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,400
um i guess from here came a lot of you

00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:14,479
know

00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,400
looking for grants and contracts and

00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:18,639
different kind of ways that

00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,240
mapping could be sustained in very poor

00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,479
area so of course

00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,680
in a lot of places there's it's really a

00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:27,840
pure volunteerism

00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:29,759
kind of model and that can arise in

00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,039
developing countries and emerging

00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,080
economies as well

00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:35,200
but it's not necessarily going to

00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,959
provide

00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:41,039
opportunities for those who can't

00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:44,159
simply can't afford to spend time on

00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,159
voluntary activities

00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,880
so i guess something that you realize as

00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,279
you start this

00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,320
openstreetmap journey is that there's

00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:55,519
always more to map

00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:58,959
and even in one small place there is

00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,720
going to be a layer upon layer of

00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,080
things that can be captured things that

00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,040
change things that still need to be

00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,000
mapped

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,480
there's always improvements to do so you

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,959
know

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,760
what does it require to keep that moving

00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,120
forward

00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,760
from here i started to work on this

00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:16,800
research to do the white paper and

00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:19,920
let me lead into what i actually

00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:22,560
developed with that um

00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,839
so first of all defining sustainability

00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,560
so the first thing that

00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:29,120
we tried to do was figure out well how

00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:31,279
do we define this kind of amorphous term

00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,760
which has kind of a generic application

00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:36,240
which also references

00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,839
environmental sustainability came up

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:41,279
with this idea of sustainability

00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:42,480
sustained benefits so say like you do

00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,480
some mapping

00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,399
project of some kind what are the

00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,800
benefits that you were hoping to get out

00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,120
of it

00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,760
and how can they be made more long-term

00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,920
so that it doesn't just kind of drop off

00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,040
um and this itself can have a lot of

00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,200
aspects so

00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,839
then we i further broke it down into

00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,920
these dimensions financial economic

00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,680
cultural social technological and

00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,200
political institutional so i'll go into

00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:08,800
those a little more

00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:11,040
shortly but um you know thinking of

00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:13,440
sustainability beyond just

00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,800
um economic first of all which is the

00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,000
top thing that people think about

00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,360
usually

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,959
um and beyond um you know just can my

00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:24,720
organization survive

00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:28,079
can my personal work survive but like

00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,560
what are the benefits um kind of divorce

00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,959
from

00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,000
individuals and organizations but what

00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,480
are the actual benefits

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,720
we want so then i wanted to look at you

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,720
know in terms of achieving these

00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,640
particular benefits and sustaining them

00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:44,000
who's involved

00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:46,079
in developing an emerging economy

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,440
setting countries we might have these

00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,839
kinds of groups small

00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,519
ngos we might have individuals and

00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,680
consultants you can think about how

00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,680
this matches with your country whichever

00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,480
whatever kind of country you happen to

00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,720
live in but

00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,640
do you see all of these or not

00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,519
individuals serving larger ngos or

00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:05,920
consultant as consultants

00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:07,600
in the aid sector or for government um

00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,760
university groups and student groups

00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:13,519
like youth mappers

00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:15,680
international ngos large agencies

00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,200
might be present local startups and

00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,079
companies

00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:22,320
creating apps using osm for example

00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:25,120
chapters and networks

00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,839
osm chapters being much less commonly

00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:30,720
formally recognized

00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:33,040
um in developing countries but

00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,720
hopefully that's changing um

00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,959
government-led and internal to

00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:40,160
government mappers

00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:41,360
um and individuals

00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,200
and i'd like to mention there's

00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,360
definitely sort of a tension between the

00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,959
loose flat structure of osm generally

00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,480
and this kind of network structure and

00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:50,560
the voluntary nature of

00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,560
global mapping and the demands of

00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,040
specific mapping needs tied to things

00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,440
like

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,360
world bank projects so you know you

00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,120
might have a massive world bank project

00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,200
in a country

00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,360
to the tune of like millions of dollars

00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:07,519
infrastructure projects say

00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:10,480
involving roads or dams electricity

00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:12,079
things like this they might need a

00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,959
specific map

00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:16,720
um and then you have this kind of

00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,120
volunteer community so this tension is

00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,639
really

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,079
interesting to me um and we

00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,079
don't need to pretend that it's not

00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:27,200
there basically

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:31,839
as i was trying to do this work

00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:35,040
i interviewed a number of people

00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:38,079
for case studies so

00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:40,079
let's see

00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:41,360
in quite a number of countries i wanted

00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:43,600
to see like really what were their

00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,360
sustainability challenges by country

00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,639
like in context because they are quite

00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,399
different

00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:53,040
so um one of the first i looked to was

00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,880
bangladesh bangladesh having this is

00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,480
openstreetmap bangladesh foundation

00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,920
which was

00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,880
just starting out when i did that

00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:03,519
interview and so what i discovered was

00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:05,279
in in that country they really have

00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:08,560
quite robust

00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:10,000
map mapping communities quite

00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,399
lots and lots of students have been

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,839
involved lots of ngos and aid

00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,519
organizations have worked with

00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:17,680
openstreetmap there

00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,720
including the world bank's open cities

00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:22,240
including

00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:24,959
the red cross just

00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,240
pretty much every ngo international ngo

00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,839
that you can think of has probably

00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,399
worked there

00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:33,360
with osm in some way shape or form so

00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:35,279
they had a really good start

00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,880
i was interested in the format that that

00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,240
took it seemed like at the beginning

00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,560
there was quite a lot of

00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:43,040
work with like getting volunteers out of

00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:46,160
universities student volunteers

00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:48,320
led by consultants so individual mappers

00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,639
that would be consultants to those

00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,680
organizations primarily mom would

00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,600
organize things

00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,279
with student mappers at the universities

00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,160
that they knew

00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:59,519
and train young people so that's sort of

00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,600
a model that was used

00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,760
um as far as sustainability what have

00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:06,880
been their challenges

00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:09,600
so um keeping those student volunteers

00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:12,160
engaged supported and adequately trained

00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,519
has been challenged requiring funding so

00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,279
this is in the financial kind of

00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,600
economic challenge area

00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:20,399
turnover is very common due to this lack

00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:22,880
of financial resources

00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:25,360
a lot of kind of retraining is needed if

00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:28,480
you're going to rely on the students

00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,480
and volunteers a lot

00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:33,360
also there's a issue in the country with

00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,279
sort of brain drain so the

00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,399
brightest graduates might might leave

00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:40,079
the country

00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:41,360
often um technological challenges many

00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:44,160
times they create data

00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,959
this is along the lines of data quality

00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,079
requiring

00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:49,920
kind of checking the data cleaning it up

00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:52,160
just a lot of

00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,680
also multiple concurrent large projects

00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,880
across the country so a lot of data

00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:58,800
management issues

00:14:54,880 --> 00:15:01,279
um social cultural challenges were

00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:03,440
there were quite a few competition

00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:05,360
amongst many projects and independent

00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:10,160
consultants can be a challenge

00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:12,639
to overcome the foundation wanting to

00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,320
this bangladesh osm foundation hoping to

00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,160
kind of coordinate those

00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,399
so it's an interesting model to see if

00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,079
it works for that country too

00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:22,560
and maybe for other countries to kind of

00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:24,399
try to coordinate but not really like

00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,320
dominate the osm projects so people

00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:30,079
might undertake them independently

00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:32,079
separately but having some kind of group

00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:34,320
way to network together and coordinate

00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:38,079
better

00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:40,639
became important so overall we found

00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:42,639
these kind of like categories of

00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,000
of challenges under each of those

00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,759
headings that i

00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,600
mentioned previously financial social

00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:49,839
technological political

00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:52,560
so i'll just go through those really

00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,560
fast then

00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,120
um financial being lack of consistent

00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:00,320
funding of course that's sort of a top

00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,600
sustainability challenge tricky issues

00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,480
around volunteerism

00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,519
and careers and livelihoods and the

00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,720
needs of people

00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:12,000
living in different levels of poverty

00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,279
so then there's also like an internal

00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,600
challenge where some are sort of

00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:18,320
professional professional gis

00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,320
you know graduates um others are

00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,639
community volunteers

00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,560
um there's a lot of if you want to

00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:27,839
provide access to everyone

00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:30,639
how do you kind of um

00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:32,160
i guess be fair to to the needs as well

00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:35,839
as the backgrounds of every

00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,560
of everyone involved leadership capacity

00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,720
being

00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,959
perhaps a challenge as well for

00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:43,920
financial

00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,800
accessing financial resources failure of

00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,120
the commons

00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,240
just that things aren't getting done

00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,160
that aren't

00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,639
that are maybe beneficial to everyone

00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:55,040
but not specifically

00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:55,759
to anyone so these kind of base mapping

00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,839
functions or

00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:59,360
data quality checks or making sure that

00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:03,040
there's sort of an even map

00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:04,959
that's that's like a commons task

00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:07,199
key chain challenges under social and

00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:09,360
cultural competition amongst

00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,400
individual mappers or group or mapping

00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:13,280
groups that can

00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,319
ultimately be sometimes detrimental if

00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,880
they're all trying to work

00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:17,520
ultimately towards the same goal human

00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,319
resource

00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:22,079
capital and capacity and social equity

00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:24,079
and access that has to do with

00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:25,679
you know are you only working with the

00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:29,520
elites of the country

00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:31,200
um what kind of penetration to

00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,520
rural areas do you have in terms of

00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:36,640
training mappers and so forth and

00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,520
data access as well technological we

00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,520
have

00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,960
data quality issues and longevity issues

00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,440
of course

00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,520
capacity challenges in general but also

00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,520
hardware and software choices

00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:49,919
whether you know projects are being done

00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,520
with overly expensive or complicated

00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:54,320
equipment

00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,280
that can't be kind of easily or maybe

00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,760
it's even

00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,960
subject to theft in country being too

00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,559
valuable

00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,320
basically appropriate technology and

00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:05,360
appropriate software that can be

00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:07,200
understood and kept up to date

00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,840
and then politically and institutionally

00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,600
there's integrating osm into these

00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:14,640
institutions

00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:16,000
having still barriers to open data as a

00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,679
concept

00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,799
um unstable political environment

00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,039
there's so many things that could go

00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:24,000
under here

00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:25,520
but i wanted to get into sort of what

00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,440
what do we do about it

00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:32,799
before we run out of time um

00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:35,600
building the ecosystem so

00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,720
um that has been kind of the main tactic

00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,520
that i've come up come

00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,400
out of this with is you know in any

00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,280
given country

00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,400
or region even we really need to have

00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:47,600
that kind of

00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,600
human infrastructure

00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,720
also need a lobby for open data in the

00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:58,960
government level

00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:02,000
also building osm among ngos

00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,840
use also recruiting data contributors

00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,200
um you know those who already have data

00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,600
to share it

00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,440
convincing private clients encouraging

00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,360
canadian social goods so

00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,799
what does a healthy ecosystem look like

00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,280
basically it

00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:17,039
looks like it has all of these um the

00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:20,000
human infrastructure

00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:21,840
can't really be underestimated like what

00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,799
kinds of groups and trainings and

00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:26,799
networks do you have

00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:31,600
do you only have um you know a local

00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:33,520
kind of pseudo chapter like a

00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,440
in kanye we have osm kenya but it's not

00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,760
like a formalized chapter but that's

00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,640
kind of what exists in a lot of places

00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,240
or do you also

00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,240
or do you only have a couple of youth

00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,600
mappers groups do you have consultants

00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,080
only

00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,280
how much how what's the mix of players

00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,039
that you have

00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,880
and how can they be kind of better

00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:54,400
balanced or what's missing to

00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:58,160
keep a sustainability of

00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:59,919
osm in the country and increase it

00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,200
so looking for ideal organizational

00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:02,960
structures so like

00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,960
you know the way that bangladesh was

00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,640
doing or drc was trying to do like are

00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,200
these models to copy

00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,400
for your particular region or country or

00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,480
are these

00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,760
um is there a better way of doing things

00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,440
you know

00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,760
what does each context might need

00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,960
something different um but perhaps

00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,400
there's

00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,240
there are things to learn here from what

00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:25,039
they've tried to do

00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,400
planning for data longevity looking

00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:28,080
ahead like well

00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,360
if you create this map today but

00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,760
everything's going to be different next

00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,400
year

00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:33,600
who's going to update it social

00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,400
sustainability

00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,919
means increasing widening opportunities

00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,520
so really looking for equity and

00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:42,559
participation

00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:45,120
um not just kind of

00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:46,559
keeping all of the opportunities in one

00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,480
group only

00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:50,480
that's a very difficult thing to to do

00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:54,159
without kind of a network or a

00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:55,120
larger group of some sort that's going

00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:58,320
to

00:20:55,120 --> 00:21:01,520
look out for the greater good of

00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:04,960
of mapping basically in the country

00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:07,120
systems for reliability just to

00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,559
improve reliability of data like what do

00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,240
we do if somebody comes in and does a

00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:13,280
bunch of bad edits you know

00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:16,159
who's who's kind of checking on that

00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:17,679
and this is not things that there can

00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,679
also be international

00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:22,480
people trying to do helpful things but

00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:24,400
creating some bad data on accidents so

00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,760
you know who's kind of looking out for

00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,080
reliability

00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,840
um working with government at all levels

00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:33,440
not just

00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,440
national but looking at local

00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:37,760
just looking specifically at what

00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:41,200
program planners and funders can do

00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,919
external actors please resource the nuts

00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,280
and bolts of

00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:47,440
open data base mapping data refresh

00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:49,360
i mean these are kind of things that uh

00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,200
in all kinds of open source projects

00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,880
there is a lack of

00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,760
resource for like there's things that

00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:58,880
just go don't go don't get done

00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:02,240
in osm i'm seeing that happen as well

00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:05,600
and it's it'll be really helpful to have

00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:07,760
kind of funding for that stuff um

00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,200
incorporating universities more into

00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,360
ecosystems sometimes they kind of

00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:14,400
operate very outside of the

00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:16,320
the rest of the osm worlds or um

00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,080
like graduates aren't automatically kind

00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:21,679
of placed in

00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:24,960
into the osm i guess community

00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:27,520
um and how it's functioning so

00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,039
just bringing together those ecos those

00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,919
academic and

00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:32,640
maybe ngo and individual mapper

00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:36,240
volunteer

00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:38,159
kind of ecosystems supporting champions

00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,280
analyzing incentive structures

00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,159
accurately and well that's

00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:45,520
always very much easier said than done

00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:47,360
but i would like to bold that one

00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:49,600
and then just capacity building and

00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,360
supporting local mappers that's really

00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,280
what it comes down to like looking at

00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:57,120
who's doing stuff

00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:59,600
not um kind of being inclusive as

00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,600
possible

00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,400
for smaller organizations and for

00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,919
national osm communities being specific

00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,520
about the core benefits that will be

00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,880
prioritized by different groups and

00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,559
projects

00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,919
so you know what is it that we want the

00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:15,280
projects to do

00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:17,039
um having a plan

00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:19,200
considering how competition could be

00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:20,880
more productive or you know where we

00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,440
want to encourage it where we want to

00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,280
have collaborative decision making

00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,480
considering forming a chapter or local

00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:29,600
network and

00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:31,360
looking really carefully at data quality

00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,799
so just a few things there's so much

00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,559
more that could be discussed here so

00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:37,280
please do reach out to me

00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:37,760
this is one of my my osm and twitter

00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:41,840
handle

00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:44,880
my um email

00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:47,360
and um yeah

00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:51,840
i hope you have something to contribute

00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:51,840
in the in the questions

00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:01,440
great um so thanks so much erica for

00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,919
that really engaging talk

00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,640
um i can see a bunch of questions have

00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:07,200
come through

00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:09,039
on the pad so just quickly for anyone

00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,080
who's participating in the session who

00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:13,120
doesn't know

00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,720
what a pad is or where to find it if

00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,240
on the program you click on the name of

00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,400
this session

00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,240
then you can see a link to the pad on

00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,760
the left hand side and you can see other

00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:25,120
people's questions

00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:28,400
and um type in your own as well um

00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:30,080
so now i'm just gonna um coordinate a

00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,440
few of the questions that have come up

00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:34,880
with erica

00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:38,159
we have about 10 15 minutes um so

00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:39,039
uh a few to go through um so the first

00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:42,960
one

00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:46,000
then erica to ask is going to be

00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:48,400
around do you think that the companies

00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,039
who are working in openstreetmap can be

00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:54,080
helping

00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:54,080
local communities um to map sustainably

00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:58,000
uh i mean i think there's a role to play

00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:00,240
for for everyone

00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,720
so that's kind of i guess that's the

00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,559
idea of this kind of

00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:05,440
ecosystem way of thinking about it like

00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:07,200
what are all of

00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,400
what's the proper role for those

00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,159
companies so i don't know if by

00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,799
companies that person meant

00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:13,600
a local company i mean company means a

00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:16,240
lot of things

00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,640
could be any size um if you're thinking

00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,919
like an

00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:23,679
international company um

00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:25,360
there's definitely i i mean i've seen

00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:27,279
i've seen it happen where there was kind

00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:29,520
of a focus on like well let's we want to

00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:32,799
work on maps in a particular place and

00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:35,919
let's support uh local mappers and work

00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:37,600
jointly um there's there's also there's

00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:39,120
kind of like a view that a

00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:42,880
company could take that you know they

00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:44,880
might need data for something

00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,400
but they also want to support those

00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,720
local communities

00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,559
and i think that that's definitely

00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,240
possible but again it takes like that

00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,960
leadership from someone inside the

00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,559
company

00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:57,600
to to want to do that sometimes that's

00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:59,760
come out of like

00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,679
a more like a foundation within a

00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,279
company you know more of a charitable

00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:04,799
side of that company but a lot of times

00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:07,120
now it's just like

00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:08,880
they need data or they want maps to be

00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,720
more complete

00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,559
i kind of wish that some of them would

00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,400
take more time with this aspect

00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:16,400
and like actually look at what's there

00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:19,120
and how they can be more supportive

00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,880
if there's like a long way to go um as

00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:23,919
for local companies

00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:25,200
i think that that's like a great you

00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:26,640
know especially if there's a local

00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,480
company that wants to use mapping

00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,919
looking at the open street map community

00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:34,400
i mean we've developed

00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:35,760
some some work locally in kenya where

00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,440
there's there's definitely a lot of

00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:40,320
potential in that area where there's

00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,279
say like a local company that works on

00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,760
transportation

00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:45,440
or something that uses a map there's so

00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:47,360
many ways that they can integrate with

00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:50,640
that local

00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:52,320
osm community and help it be more

00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,880
sustainable but i don't think that any

00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:56,559
either

00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,960
these two potential areas of growth are

00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:59,120
like

00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,400
just beginning so there's like a long

00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,640
way to go in

00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:04,000
in most countries i think that there's

00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,679
some that have kind of gotten further

00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,760
along

00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:10,000
but yeah huge role to play really that's

00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:13,600
what i'm saying

00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,360
okay um thanks for that um so now a

00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:18,799
couple of questions have come in

00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,520
um one of them from um transport for

00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:23,200
cairo

00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:25,200
in egypt so they're asking

00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,880
that they are an example of a

00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:30,159
consultancy working with

00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:33,520
and contributing to osm in a country

00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:36,799
where they have not identified

00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:39,120
a an osm community so

00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:41,279
a company working in osm but without

00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:43,679
necessarily a community link

00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:45,120
what do you think the relevant authority

00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:47,600
is um

00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,799
to allow different contributors and

00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:51,200
stakeholders

00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:53,520
to work together in a given country or

00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,520
city

00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:59,039
well that's a good question i think

00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:00,240
in a lot of countries there will be some

00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:03,360
kind of a group

00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:05,919
that's called um for instance we created

00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:07,039
a bunch of mappers in kenya created osm

00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:10,080
kenya together

00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:12,799
um which is kind of a loose umbrella

00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:15,200
group it's not really it's not even

00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:17,200
formally a chapter or anything but there

00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:19,120
could be and so i don't know somebody

00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:22,720
else can probably chime in on the pad

00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:25,840
actually if there's that group in

00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:27,440
egypt um something like it and so that

00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,240
wouldn't be necessarily an authority but

00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,000
it would allow

00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,360
people to work collaboratively so i

00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,840
think it's what they're looking for

00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,360
now if there isn't such a thing or you

00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:38,480
don't feel that that's really

00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:39,039
the right body to work with um i know

00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,039
that

00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:42,799
you know there's a on whatsapp there's

00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:45,120
osm africa

00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:45,840
chat that you can always ask questions i

00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:49,360
think that there's

00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:51,760
there's ways to find out but that

00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:54,399
is kind of what i think we would aim to

00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:58,000
have everywhere if possible

00:28:54,399 --> 00:29:00,000
in some way shape or form

00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,159
but yeah i can't answer too specifically

00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,039
about egypt and i hope somebody else can

00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:06,559
um chime in there yeah that's a good

00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:08,960
point if anyone else on the group

00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:10,320
knows about egypt you can also type in

00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,120
some some info

00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,760
um on the pad

00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:15,679
[Music]

00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,039
so then i'm going to move on then to

00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:20,559
next question

00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:24,000
which is coming from guy and

00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:25,440
guy is asking um what impact do you see

00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,440
covert 19

00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,880
having on the sustainability of osm

00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,080
mapping um so

00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:32,000
i think this might be the first time

00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,600
i've heard covered women today which is

00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,360
very unlike every other conference that

00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,039
i've joined in the last few months so

00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,320
actually a bit of a refreshing break up

00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:40,640
till now

00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,760
but bring us back um to the covered

00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,240
situation

00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,960
do you see people returning to osm after

00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:48,000
leaving

00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:49,440
like for example if they're in a

00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,799
particular circumstance right now which

00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:54,159
means it's hard to

00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:56,480
contribute um like economically and

00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:59,440
could they kind of return to osm um at a

00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,440
future point

00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:03,360
that's a good question i hadn't really

00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:05,600
considered i mean there is an

00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,960
issue around sustainability of mapping

00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:09,279
that's quite obvious

00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,399
where you know if you have field mapping

00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:13,039
projects lined up

00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:14,320
they are now probably on hold or being

00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:18,000
rethought

00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:19,760
um so in that sense the kobe 19 is

00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,279
definitely impacting

00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:24,080
um or for example you know you had

00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,919
something

00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,279
lined up to map but now the whole point

00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:30,320
of mapping it is kind of

00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:31,919
not the top priority anymore so now

00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:33,679
you're going to push it back by a year

00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:34,960
or something like that so i think it's

00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:38,159
it is having a huge

00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,799
impact um as far as people being able to

00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:41,840
like

00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:43,919
participate in mapping that's

00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:46,399
i'm not i guess i'm not sure if that's

00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:46,799
going to to show up i think it depends

00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:48,399
on

00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:50,080
exactly how they're participating so

00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:51,600
obviously if a mapping project they were

00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,720
going to take part in is gone then they

00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,960
won't participate

00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,559
will they come back later probably if

00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:00,000
that project comes back

00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:01,120
um but if they

00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,960
you know are just having a lot of

00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,519
financial difficulties it's definitely

00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,640
had

00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:08,559
like it's this huge economic impact

00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,080
then maybe they're not going to be able

00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:11,919
to take part again so

00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,440
it'll be interesting thing to track is

00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:16,240
like the

00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,960
i guess you could track the the mappers

00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,960
and like

00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,799
their edits over time and see if covet

00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,640
has had an impact so

00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:24,080
that would be kind of a cool research

00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:27,679
product down the road

00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:29,519
um it would because there was that blog

00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:31,440
earlier this week as well which showed

00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:33,279
that actually osm was like breaking

00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,679
records with number of daily editors

00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:36,000
which

00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:37,200
i realized like there's a lot to break

00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,559
down there in terms of who are the

00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:42,640
editors and where they are but

00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:44,559
actually showing that during covet

00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:46,000
mapping had actually gone up in many

00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:47,679
locations which is

00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,279
kind of an interesting counter i guess

00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:52,080
to right

00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:53,760
and then like in kenya we're working on

00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:56,000
covid specific mapping

00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,960
so there's actually probably a lot of

00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,360
people are were

00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,080
looking to increase the coverage of the

00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:03,120
health

00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,600
like health sector maps and health sites

00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,760
and doing

00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:07,360
a bunch of mapping of the coveted cases

00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:09,039
and things like that so maybe

00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,480
there's actually been this growth in

00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:10,799
that aspect but it would be interesting

00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:14,480
to see

00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:17,919
the locations of that as you said so

00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,919
the locations of those mappers

00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:23,279
well thanks thanks guy for keeping us

00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:27,760
keeping us current

00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:29,519
um so i am going to move back up to so

00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:31,120
there's a statement added in here

00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:33,679
um i'm not really sure if it's a

00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:35,519
question um but it just says map

00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:36,960
or b maps i don't know if you want to

00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:40,000
respond quickly to that

00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:42,000
or shall i move on to another question

00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,840
if you don't map you may be mapped

00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,360
[Laughter]

00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:47,760
i don't know if that was a quote that i

00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:50,559
uh maybe that was included

00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:52,159
in there somewhere but it's um i think i

00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:52,799
remember that coming up kind of towards

00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:55,919
the beginning

00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:57,679
like it was tied into i i thought it was

00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:58,480
tied into this kind of always being more

00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:02,159
to math

00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,799
idea um and they're being like different

00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:05,919
layers

00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:09,519
um and creating that kind of map

00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:11,600
for yourself um but yeah i

00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:12,640
i don't know what else to say about that

00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:16,159
actually

00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:17,919
but it's possible it does link us

00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:19,120
to another question which is there's

00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:21,519
another question just above that which

00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:23,440
says always more to map

00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:25,600
how did you go about defining what is

00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:29,279
sustainability for data

00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:29,279
not just for community

00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:35,200
right yeah so um as i kind of try to

00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,720
detail

00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,399
there's different types of

00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,919
sustainability in one i

00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:41,440
kind of lump data and technology

00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:44,799
together

00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:45,519
but data sustainability is is huge i

00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:48,159
mean

00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:49,200
you know you look you look at the map

00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:52,159
and you kind of

00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:53,919
don't obviously see sorry if there's

00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:57,120
some fireworks going off right next to

00:33:53,919 --> 00:34:00,159
my my house here um

00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:02,559
you don't necessarily see uh the dates

00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:04,720
of when each map edit was made so you

00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:07,120
might say that you have like a map of

00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,960
water points or schools

00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:11,520
but what you might actually have is like

00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:14,480
10 year old 10 years old or 5 years old

00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,960
and therefore not that useful so i guess

00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,040
i

00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,560
defined it as like how do you keep

00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,879
things up to date how do you keep the

00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,119
map

00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:22,720
up to date and if you don't have you

00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:24,480
know if you put a lot of

00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:26,000
effort and energy and money into

00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,919
creating a very

00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,760
accurate picture of the moment but you

00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:32,320
don't have any way to

00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:34,399
um look at it a couple years down the

00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:37,520
road i mean this is a huge project for

00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:40,000
a huge problem for maps in the

00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,720
sort of traditional mapping sector in

00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,359
government

00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:45,440
for example like they have to keep

00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:48,639
surveying

00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:50,879
when things change and it can be

00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:52,399
a huge sustainability issue at least

00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:54,240
i've seen in like

00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:56,079
data that's being used in development

00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:58,240
development

00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:00,000
so i think osm presents opportunities

00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,839
for that but you have to think

00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,040
about what those are so like training

00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:04,560
local mappers is

00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,480
obviously can help in that

00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:09,200
sustainability you can call on

00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,839
people to continue to update data and

00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,160
with your

00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:14,079
local osm chapter or community you can

00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:17,040
make targets for that

00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:19,280
um and check on the dates and how old

00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:22,079
data is and stuff like that but

00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:24,960
um yeah it's a key piece of

00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:24,960
sustainability

00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:31,040
perfect well um yeah happy uh happy

00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,760
holidays i'm glad you clarified that was

00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,760
fireworks

00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,520
i was getting feeling a little along for

00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:39,359
a minute there

00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:42,480
but um yeah happy holidays

00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:44,320
also wishing you wishing you happy happy

00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:48,400
independence day

00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:51,760
yeah so um there's a couple of

00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:53,599
um kind of comments in relation to the

00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,119
the questions from earlier so just given

00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:55,760
that we have time i'm gonna whiz through

00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:57,599
those

00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:59,599
um if people have other questions feel

00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:01,359
free to add them in at the bottom the

00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:03,359
the rainbow colors are getting a bit

00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:05,760
much for me to be able to

00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:07,599
read right now um so there's a question

00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,720
around which local companies

00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:12,640
in kenya have you worked with if any i

00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:14,480
know you guys have had a lot of partners

00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,760
in kenya but just wondering if any of

00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:19,599
those are

00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:22,720
local based companies

00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:25,359
um i mean because brings to mind is

00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:26,960
ushihidi but i think they are formally

00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:29,359
not

00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,880
actually i think they're formally an ngo

00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:32,000
um that's a

00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:34,079
company that we're working with right

00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,960
now but um

00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:37,760
let me think we've we've put together

00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:41,040
plans

00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:42,240
with uh what i consider kind of more

00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:44,079
traditional companies

00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:46,160
like a lot of times we've done sort of

00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:50,160
work with the aid sector in the

00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:52,400
development sector but there will be

00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,920
um companies that are say they're trying

00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,680
to create like a mobile app that

00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,079
requires a map or something like that

00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,079
but

00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:59,359
those have been more like brainstorming

00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:02,560
sessions i think

00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:05,440
um we recently developed

00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:07,280
a sort of a plan with a company that

00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:10,480
does motorbike delivery

00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:12,880
um into and was

00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:15,359
interested in doing that kind of work in

00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:19,280
slums and since we have these

00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:21,520
kind of network and maps that's like a

00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:23,200
that's a type of partner that we've been

00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,800
trying to work with for a while

00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,640
developing we've found that developing

00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,640
the business plans and having these kind

00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:32,240
of sessions of discussion

00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:35,119
have been um getting more

00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:37,040
easier over the years like more recently

00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:39,520
it's like the business sector

00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:40,440
has become more technology-oriented and

00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:43,359
more

00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:44,880
geo-tech oriented than it was before

00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:47,200
so before it would be more like an

00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:49,680
international company more likely

00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,640
um so i think it's a matter of time but

00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:53,440
it's

00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:54,560
yeah i can't say that we've actually

00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:57,280
actualized

00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:58,960
i wish that uh my colleagues were on

00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,560
this chat they could probably remind me

00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:04,079
of something though

00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:07,599
i'm forgetting

00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:09,680
great um okay so i can see here there's

00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:11,119
a couple of responses to the discussion

00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:14,640
we were having earlier about

00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:16,640
um whether kind of contributions to osm

00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,280
were changing with covid and if so for

00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,040
who

00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:21,200
um just a couple of comments here i'm

00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,560
gonna um just read out so everyone's

00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:24,800
aware of them which was

00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:27,119
i'm just someone saying kind of you know

00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,240
is that an opportunity or a threat that

00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:31,359
um

00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:32,720
people are mapping more or less um and

00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:34,480
then um

00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:36,079
someone else kind of commenting on about

00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:38,720
general sort of situation

00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:40,400
in economic situation if people are

00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:43,680
things like furloughed um

00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:45,680
etc then maybe they're nothing more um

00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:48,000
but really just some comments there no

00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:51,040
further questions mentioned

00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,480
um so i think with that let's wrap up i

00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:54,079
don't know eric if there was any sort of

00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,520
final statement or

00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:58,480
sort of place people can get in touch

00:38:55,520 --> 00:39:01,359
with you that you wanted to mention

00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:02,400
yeah well i hope that there's i mean i

00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:05,839
guess i can put my

00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:08,400
email address on the pad for people um

00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:09,280
to get in touch that way if you i can

00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:12,640
also put a link

00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:14,720
to the actual paper which is um

00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:16,480
yeah might be of interest to some people

00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:20,000
to actually read through

00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,800
um yeah i think that you know i would

00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,640
love to have

00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:25,280
a bigger discussion about this i think

00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:26,640
it's like a huge issue and multi-layered

00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,720
especially when you bring in sort of the

00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:31,839
economics of mapping

00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:33,119
um it's it's challenging to sort out all

00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:36,160
of the pieces

00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:38,079
um i was reminded recently in a

00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:40,160
discussion with someone about about

00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:43,119
ethics and mapping which i'm also

00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:43,920
working on and very interested in that

00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:45,280
you know the

00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,960
the default and also from some of the

00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:49,040
talks earlier today that like the

00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,640
default of osm

00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:52,960
typically no matter whether they're

00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:55,520
using advanced technologies or not

00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,000
is to really defer to local communities

00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:58,640
needs

00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,000
and you know what they want but um i

00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:02,400
think you know

00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,280
it's hard for people that don't you know

00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,680
it's hard to

00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:07,520
go below the surface and see what what

00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,640
is actually going on in each country and

00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:10,400
what do they really

00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:12,240
when you say like defer to the needs or

00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,680
the demands or what the people

00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:15,280
want it's like but you're talking about

00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:17,760
a whole country

00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:19,440
so like which you know what's the who's

00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:22,319
gonna speak for that country

00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:24,240
um or even just one community within

00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:27,440
that country is difficult

00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:28,560
um so these are kind of

00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:31,280
i don't know i think these are

00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:32,800
interesting things to keep discussing

00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:34,560
i don't know if there's going to be an

00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,480
opportunity to have a if this was

00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:38,480
a live conference i would say let's

00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,319
gather afterwards and birds of a feather

00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:43,359
session to talk more about it so

00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:44,240
um maybe if there's interest i will set

00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:48,640
something up for

00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:50,800
tomorrow great great okay

00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:52,000

00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,280

00:40:54,160 --> 00:41:06,480
pad that was

00:40:55,280 --> 00:41:06,480
