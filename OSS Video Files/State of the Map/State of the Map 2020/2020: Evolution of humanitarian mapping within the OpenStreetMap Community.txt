Since 2010 organized humanitarian mapping has evolved as a constant and growing element of the global OpenStreetMap (OSM) community. We analyse the history of humanitarian mapping using OpenStreetMap History and OSM Tasking Manager (tasks.hotosm.org) data. We conduct a comprehensive quantitative analysis on a global scale and long term perspective to depict more than just snapshots of individual events. Results show that in regard to edits, users, projects, geographic diversity, almost all of these have experienced linear growth. But regarding user commitment and validation efforts we conclude that the humanitarian mapping community still faces huge challenges to achieve sustainability.

## Introduction
Since 2010 organized humanitarian mapping has evolved as a constant and growing element of the global OpenStreetMap (OSM) community. In the last few years, several researchers have analyzed humanitarian mapping practices (e.g. Zook et al. 2010,  Soden et al. 2016, Dittus et al. 2017), however most of this work was either event-driven or focused on specific time periods and regions. The OSM ecosystem and the actors involved in it are constantly changing and emerging, for instance also due to the mapping activities of corporates (Anderson et al. 2019).

## Purpose of this study
In our work we analyse the history of almost 10 years of humanitarian mapping in OpenStreetMap using the OSM Tasking Manager (tasks.hotosm.org). We conduct a comprehensive quantitative analysis on a global scale and long term perspective in order to depict more than just snapshots of individual events. We show how humanitarian mapping was impacted by major mapping disaster response events, but also widened its application to other domains such as disaster preparedness. Our approach follows two paths. One focuses on the mapping itself. The other focuses on the composition of the humanitarian mapping community.

We provide insights on the following research questions:

1. Where, for what purpose and at what scale did humanitarian remote mapping actually happen in 2012-2020?
2. What is the impact of humanitarian contributions and how does it differ among user groups and over time?

## Methodology and Results

### Data

Our analytical approach is characterized by the combination of the following data sets: (1) For general OSM mapping and user characteristics we use the whole history of OSM object versions and edits provided by the OSHDB framework (Raifer et al. 2019). (2) We were provided with a HOT Tasking Manager database dump covering the time between 11/2012 until 12/2019.

### Method

Our method uses spatio-temporal time series analysis based on a hexagonal grid for all areas humanitarian mapping activity has been conducted. We investigate the evolution  of humanitarian mapping with respect to several attributes including number of OSM contributions (created, modified, deleted OSM objects), percent of tasks mapped and validated in the Tasking Manager and number of OSM contributors involved. We set our findings and the geographical distribution of our results in context to the overall OSM mapping and user characteristics. 

## Results
Humanitarian mapping has grown almost linear with respect to the numbers of projects, unique users, tasks mapped and OpenStreetMap contributions. While at the same time it got more diverse in terms of spatial distribution of mapping activities and organizations involved. In 2018 more than 100 organizations were running projects on every inhabited continent except Australia. 

Peaks in mapping activities in the first quarter of 2015 and the third quarter of 2017 are reflecting activations of the community in responses to the Gorkha earthquake as well as to the hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Puebla earthquake.

Although the number of mappers is growing, the humanitarian community lacks long term commitment. Almost 70% of humanitarian mappers contribute one day only. Another 10% drops out after ten days of being active. However the number of one day only contributors is steadily rising, whereas mappers involved on 5 or more days seem to be saturated since 2017. Nonetheless, the one day only contributors have a considerable impact on the data. They account for 10% of all edits, whereas contributors involved on 100 or more days account for 50%. This pattern is reflected by the composition of user actions as well. The number of mapping activities is growing almost linear, whereas the amount of validators stagnate. However, different organisations have varying degrees of success in recruiting new validators. The american red cross for instance accounts for 30 to 50% of all first time validators in the last 12 months.

## Discussion
Humanitarian mapping with the tasking manager now exists for more than seven years. In terms of scale it is definitely a success story. We have shown ed

hello everyone my name is benjamin

00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,840
harford i'm

00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,679
giving a talk about the evolution of

00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,519
humanitarian mapping within the open

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,000
street map community

00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:20,800
i'm a bit excited so yeah i'm having a

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,600
small audience here in my my flatmate so

00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,640
let's see how this goes i have to like

00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,960
get some

00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,480
energy so i have still a blf from last

00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:32,079
year's conference

00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,360
so yeah i can enjoy that um but the work

00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,280
that i present here is

00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,640
not only my work it's the work of many

00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,320
people so

00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,399
special thanks to my colleagues in

00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,840
heidelberg martin jorgen alina and

00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:45,600
marcel and all the others

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,280
um all the graphics and figures you will

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,399
see in this presentations are also

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,840
available online

00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:56,079
at the website listed down yeah and

00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:58,399
um let's start um

00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,440
what we've been interested is what has

00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,680
happened during

00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,600
the almost like 10 years of my time

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,360
mapping in open suite map

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,040
where did it happen and when did it

00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,520
happen and

00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,159
for this analysis we use openstreetmap

00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,360
data

00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,880
and we use the os hdb the open suite map

00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,640
history database

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,360
that's a high performance spatial

00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,360
temporal data analysis platform

00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,479
for open treatment data obviously and

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,000
developed here by

00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:28,320
colleagues at hybrid and we use the data

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,680
from the tasking manager that has been

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,520
provided by the humanitarian

00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,400
openstreetmap team

00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,680
and our approach is to combine those

00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,720
data sets

00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,439
using the so-called oshdb contribution

00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,240
view

00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:44,799
and based on this we can analyze all

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,119
edits that happened in openstreetmap

00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,399
based on the so-called sessions i will

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,200
define that later

00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:53,600
in the task manager so basically we can

00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,000
look at every geometry or every task

00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,320
that has

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,399
been mapped in the task manager look

00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,960
when a user started to work on it and

00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,159
finished

00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:05,600
working on it and by yeah

00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:08,160
using the osm user id we can match this

00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:11,039
to the respective contributions directly

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,039
in open treatment

00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:17,520
okay and just want to give you

00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:19,840
some background also on the terms that

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,080
we are going to use and the following

00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,000
so for the ones of you that are not

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,400
familiar with

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,760
humanitarian openstreetmap task manager

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,480
and so on just a brief

00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,000
um introduction so let's start in the

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,160
middle

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,720
at the task manager they are so called

00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,760
projects usually they consist of an area

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,360
of interest that

00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,519
should be mapped there are some

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,440
instructions that tell you what you

00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,800
should map which imagery you should use

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,800
and so on

00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,000
and the project is usually set up by an

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,879
organization

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,640
that could be a local osm community or

00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,000
like an international humanitarian

00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,640
organization

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,120
and then for each project this large

00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,159
area

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,000
is divided into many smaller tasks that

00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,879
are usually squares there are some

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
projects that

00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:08,879
do not use squares but most of them do

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,239
finally the users so the people using

00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:13,519
the tasking manager

00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:15,599
work on individual tasks and when this

00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,640
happened so the combination of the user

00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,840
in the task

00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,640
is what we call a session so this should

00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,640
give you

00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:27,200
the basic um yeah reference points here

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,360
just to mention for tasks in the task

00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,680
manager they're different states

00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,599
so the most common ones are either

00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,080
mapped or validated

00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,879
it's like this that first the task gets

00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,440
mapped and then

00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:40,799
in the second round another user looks

00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,959
at the same area

00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,680
and validates all the data that has been

00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:48,560
added or contributed to openstreetmap

00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,920
okay this is about the tasking manager

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,000
now let's take a look at the

00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,720
openstreetmap data i already mentioned

00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,959
it

00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,120
we take a look at the full history of

00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,799
openstreetmap so all the contributions

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,159
and all edits that happened since the

00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,519
very beginning

00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,920
i brought you an example here t1 refers

00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,560
to

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,120
timestamp 1 t2 to time stamp 2. so we

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,840
have

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,640
two points in time and between those two

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,640
things have

00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,080
changed in open sweep map so users did

00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,160
some edits

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,120
the easiest case we start on the left

00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,479
side is

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:23,600
the creation so basically if you

00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:23,919
or someone adds for example a building

00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,639
as

00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,960
listed here to open suite map this would

00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,680
be

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,680
a creation so new data is added there

00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,080
has not this building has not been an

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,080
osm before

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,600
another change that we can see from the

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,400
data is attack

00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,479
change that's what we have on the yeah

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,240
where the highway is marked

00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,759
so the geometry of the highway the

00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,919
highway itself

00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,960
was already present so it has been added

00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:52,240
at some

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:55,520
previous time not listed here but

00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:58,320
now from t1 to t2 some user

00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,759
changed the tag so the description of

00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,120
that specific highway

00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:06,160
it was marked as unclassified for

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,479
t1 and now it's marked as residential so

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,400
this

00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:13,360
is what we refer to as the tag change

00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,880
another type of change would be the

00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,680
geometry change

00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,080
so look at the waterway you obviously

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,160
see

00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,440
that the geometry of it change between

00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,919
the two timestamps

00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,080
and that could be either like most of

00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:26,960
the cases it's because you either move a

00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,000
node

00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:32,560
or you can like for like you can move

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,560
nodes so that will infer geometry change

00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,840
and for waves and relations you can also

00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,000
add or remove nodes

00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:43,680
okay and the last

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,680
um type of change or thing we can see in

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,080
the open super history data is a

00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,960
deletion also fairly simple to

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,280
understand

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,639
it's in the easiest case here just the

00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,639
object another

00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:58,319
example here the building has been

00:05:54,639 --> 00:06:00,080
removed from the openstreetmap database

00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,520
there's a bit a simplification there are

00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,840
some edge cases

00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,600
um that i will not go into many more

00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,080
details here if there are questions we

00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,759
can

00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,759
address that later i would say

00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:15,120
okay but now um let's come back to our

00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,400
initial question so we have now have

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,440
like the basic

00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,240
concepts and terms here but now let's

00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,639
really look at

00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,840
what happened when did it happen where

00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,160
did it happen

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,880
so the map or i will show you a short

00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,919
video

00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,280
in a minute um shows you all the

00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:34,639
locations where

00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:37,520
projects in the tasking manager have

00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:39,120
been created and the size of the dots

00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,960
that you are seeing here already and you

00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,000
will see in the video as well

00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:46,720
shows the activity so how many sessions

00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,440
how many users worked on tasks

00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,759
per project and for the specific example

00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,199
we counted all the sessions where a user

00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:56,400
marked something as

00:06:53,199 --> 00:07:02,479
being mapped um

00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:06,800
so let's shift here okay so

00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:10,319
what we see basically it starts in 2012

00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,280
we go on and it's the first thing you

00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:15,039
can see okay

00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:17,599
from 10 years ago to today the amount

00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:19,759
of projects increases a lot and the

00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:24,960
overall mapping also increases

00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:24,960
so and let me stop it here for a second

00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,960
i can also go a bit back so usually you

00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,360
or you

00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,720
are maybe aware of the events that

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,840
happened in the past

00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:38,720
so if we go back to 2013

00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:40,080
that's when the the typhoon and the

00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,680
philippines happened

00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:45,520
um that was the first major disaster

00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,479
activation we clearly see it in this

00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,720
data here

00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:50,479
before that we had some projects in

00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,599
central africa mainly

00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:58,560
if we go on um we see

00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:59,199
from mid of 2014 west africa the ebola

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,759
outbreak

00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,960
caused a lot of response activity and

00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:06,160
mapping there

00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:09,599
so it's somewhere here um

00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:12,720
we follow the line we see 2015 may

00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:15,360
april nepal earthquake but

00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,840
maybe just to mention here already it's

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,919
not only activations anymore we see many

00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,080
other projects being active at the same

00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,680
time or those as a major disaster

00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:27,039
activation

00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:30,000
and this goes on now for the

00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:32,000
following years and months and basically

00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,959
we see that south america gets more and

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,120
more mapped and

00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:36,800
in general also from the geographical

00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,200
distribution

00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,159
it's not only a few countries in few

00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,200
regions

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:46,080
but task manager is used

00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,760
by a diverse community of communities

00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,480
from many different types and

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,440
in many different locations so this is

00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,560
the main

00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,920
takeaway that we can see here and i

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,399
didn't show you yet but

00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,600
this is also backed by more

00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,800
organizations

00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:06,240
being involved in setting up projects

00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:08,560
um so we can really kind of

00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,240
say that there is a global humanitarian

00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,560
open street map community

00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:15,360
and that is what what you can see from

00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:18,640
from this animated maps here

00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,240
okay um let's quickly look at the user's

00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,320
site so

00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,160
we already seen that of activity and

00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,560
this goes along with

00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,920
more and more users being active in the

00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,720
task manager

00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:33,120
so here we have the number of users per

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,279
month that have been active

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,200
for for mapping so the users marked a

00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:39,839
task as being mapped

00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,160
we clearly see again the major disaster

00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:46,560
activations

00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:46,560
2013 philippines 2015 nepal

00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,880
ebola irma all the recent ones and we

00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,399
see that

00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:56,480
how how much the active map has

00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,600
increased but also how many new members

00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,760
per month

00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,600
join mapping in the task manager so

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:06,399
several thousand mappers

00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:09,200
starts using the task measure per month

00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:11,040
and now quickly looking at the other

00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,040
side the validation part i already

00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,399
mentioned validation is the second step

00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,200
in that workflow

00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,320
it's required that we are a bit more

00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:22,720
experienced

00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:24,880
and here we see an interesting fact that

00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,560
for the first years it kind of is

00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,519
similar to the evolution of

00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:32,000
how the number of mappers increased but

00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:35,040
since 2018 2019

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,480
we see that the number of users that

00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,200
validated the task

00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,560
was either steady or even the number was

00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,120
reduced a bit

00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,839
so that would be interesting to further

00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,360
investigate

00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:50,880
why this was the case and we now

00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:52,079
for the year 2020 see an increase so it

00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,440
will be interesting to

00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:57,040
to monitor this further um what might be

00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,959
the reason for this so

00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,760
i didn't look into it but it might be

00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:03,600
the case that with a new task manager

00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,279
um it's easier for people to start

00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,680
validating than before that would be

00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:09,760
a really good thing but need to be

00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:12,880
double checked

00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:15,600
okay so far we only

00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:17,200
looked at the task manager data so the

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,920
activity where has

00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,279
been mapping happened how many users

00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,120
have been active

00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,560
but we didn't look at the openstreetmap

00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,680
data that comes now

00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:29,120
so now we use the oshdb we look at the

00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:32,160
open street map history

00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,480
and we see really what all those mappers

00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,800
have

00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,720
added to the map and we will take a look

00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,480
at two

00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,320
feature types we will look at buildings

00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,000
and at highways because that's what's

00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:45,360
mainly mapped by humanitarian

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,800
mappers at the moment so the dark blue

00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,480
line shows you

00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,880
the number of buildings that have been

00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:54,880
added by

00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:58,240
all osm users since 2008

00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:01,680
so we see that building mapping in osm

00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:04,800
became a thing roughly around 2010

00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:07,519
and since then till today

00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,079
users have added a bit more than 400

00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,079
million

00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:11,760
buildings these are the buildings that

00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,320
have been added some have been deleted

00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,560
so

00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,920
to get the the number that is now

00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:19,120
present you would have to

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:21,519
um yeah subtract the deleted ones but

00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,120
roughly 400 million buildings have been

00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:26,880
added to open sweep map

00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:30,320
since then and now we take a look at

00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,760
the other line that starts to grow only

00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,920
in

00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:36,000
2015 or so and that

00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,240
is the mapping or the buildings that

00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,279
have been added through

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:43,760
the hot tasking manager and we see that

00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:47,600
this has grown to a quite

00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:50,639
a big share of the overall buildings

00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:53,120
so in 2020 again

00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,480
we have roughly a bit more than 50

00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,440
million buildings

00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,320
that have been added to the task manager

00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,600
and that's

00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:04,720
it's around 12 13 or so

00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,760
so it's a huge impact that humanitarian

00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,480
mapping has

00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:10,240
or the open sweepmap data when it comes

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:13,839
to buildings

00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,720
one side fact here my interpretation of

00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:19,040
this

00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:21,120
curve is that this is mainly due to the

00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:25,440
efforts of the missing maps project

00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:27,279
in 20 2015 missing maps like it was

00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:30,399
started in 2014 but it

00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:33,040
really went off in 20 2015

00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,480
and since then many buildings have been

00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,680
contributed through the missing maps

00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,120
project

00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:41,519
at side note again missing maps in

00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,360
general accounts for around 60 percent

00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,040
of the activity in the task manager in

00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,839
total

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:49,839
so that has been regarding buildings

00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:53,920
let's now take a look at highways

00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:56,720
for highways it's slightly different so

00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:58,880
okay the general trend is clear highways

00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,320
are still being mapped in openstreetmap

00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:03,360
and they're still a big need

00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:05,600
that we have to map more highways

00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,760
the share of humanitarian mapping

00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,839
through the task manager

00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:12,320
is much lower here it's around two

00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:16,480
percent in 2020

00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:19,519
um you know but still two percent is

00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,199
quite also like a contribution and we

00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:22,160
will see how this will evolve in the

00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:24,639
future

00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,440
especially if it comes to like new

00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,160
approaches

00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:31,839
like using assisted ai assisted mapping

00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,839
and so on

00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:36,079
okay let's quickly go to the challenges

00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,079
that we

00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:39,760
maybe some of you already noticed in the

00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:42,079
data that i presented

00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,040
so first one mapping versus validation

00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:45,839
ideally

00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,800
every task that is mapped should also be

00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,720
validated

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,800
and this is what we can see at this

00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:55,600
figure here it shows

00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:58,160
like the relative share of both so if

00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,440
in one month the same number of tasks

00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:03,199
gets validated and

00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:07,199
mapped it would be 50 50. so

00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:08,720
those lines would be just equal

00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:10,959
but it's not the case obviously and

00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,760
that's also what we what we kind of know

00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:14,480
but this

00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,360
shows us quite um nicely in my

00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,959
impression

00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:20,079
that we do the mapping activities are

00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:22,959
much

00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:24,240
more than validation activities and this

00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:27,519
is a problem if we

00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,959
know that many beginners um our mapping

00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,440
and validation would be an important

00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:32,800
step

00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:36,240
towards like having good data quality

00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:38,000
and so we are going to use this

00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,000
approach as a figure in the future to

00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,199
see how new efforts

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,160
towards better validation will perform

00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,079
and see if

00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,680
if we can get like closer to the

00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:50,959
equilibrium line

00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:54,079
and see that um everything that

00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:57,519
gets mapped is also validated

00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:59,600
but it's still a challenge another one i

00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:02,800
want to mention is user retention and

00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,920
contribution imbalance so user retention

00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,680
means

00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:08,399
in the specific case for the task

00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,440
manager that 70 percent of the users of

00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,560
the task manager

00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:15,680
map only for a single day and

00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:18,480
it's around four percent of the users

00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:20,959
that are active for more than 10 days

00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,880
it's to a certain degree that's normal

00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:25,920
for any crowdsource project

00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:28,480
as openstreetmap is as well

00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,360
but ideally we would make sure that more

00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,000
users

00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,360
come back and map more days than only

00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,920
ones also to

00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,519
to improve their contributions that's on

00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:40,079
the one side

00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:41,360
on the other hand the like the

00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:44,480
distribution of

00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,880
who does how much work it's this logan's

00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,079
curve

00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,720
on the right hand side so this shows us

00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:51,199
again that

00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:53,519
especially for validation most of the

00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:57,680
work is done by only a few

00:16:53,519 --> 00:17:00,720
people for validation it's around

00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,759
90 percent of the work is done by 10 of

00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,880
the users only

00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:05,679
and it's not as extreme for mapping and

00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:09,199
here again

00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:10,160
i would say this is kind of a an idea

00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:11,600
that we need

00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,280
maybe other strategies towards

00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:15,600
validation validation

00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,360
because if more and more tasks gets

00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,039
mapped we also need more people that get

00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:21,280
involved in validation and

00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:22,480
the few ones that are active already

00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:26,640
might not be able to

00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,640
handle this anymore

00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:33,840
okay i'm not sure how much time i have

00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:37,760
left probably not too much um

00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:40,640
so let's have a quick outlook here

00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:41,440
and put the things that we've seen now

00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,960
into

00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:47,840
into the context and i tried to come up

00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,320
with a rough overview here and i'm happy

00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,880
to

00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,960
to hear your thoughts on that and to add

00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,640
more things that i probably missed

00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,640
so on the top we have the mapping

00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,400
activities these are the ones that i

00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,320
already mentioned

00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,440
mapping for typhon hayan nepal

00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,440
earthquake

00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,360
hurricane matthew and and so on and so

00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:08,480
forth um

00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:11,039
that we clearly see in the data

00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,240
but another thing that we already

00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:14,160
touched a bit is

00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,480
which organizations are involved in

00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,120
mapping hot has been founded in 2010

00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,120
already

00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,320
but we've seen an impact of the missing

00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,799
maps project

00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,679
we could look deeper and we might also

00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,679
find

00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:27,360
impact of other groups and communities

00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,919
like youth mappers

00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,960
i didn't look into how the corporates

00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:33,039
are being active but

00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,880
there would be many more dimensions here

00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:36,320
which organizations become active in

00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,919
openstreetmap

00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:43,280
and the tools itself might have an

00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:45,679
impact how many people can validate

00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:47,200
how easy is it to use and contribute

00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:49,440
data to openstreetmap

00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:52,320
that starts with a task manager but also

00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:56,799
like the general osm tools like the id

00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:59,220
editor or other tools like map swipe or

00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:00,640
rapid editor and so on

00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:03,440
[Music]

00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:05,440
imagery are listed as well so when bing

00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:09,120
bing imagery became available

00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:12,400
this had a big effect on

00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:15,760
remote mapping and we see um

00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:19,679
like open area map but also my pillary

00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:21,600
street level images like contribute to

00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,039
new types of mapping we haven't seen

00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:26,080
before

00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:28,000
and last but not least maybe put

00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:30,640
everything into the big context

00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,600
especially humanitarian mapping also

00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,559
acts

00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:36,400
um like often in regards to the bigger

00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:39,120
frameworks such as the sustainable

00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:41,039
development goals the zen day framework

00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,679
for disaster risk reduction

00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:44,160
or the paris agreement and all the

00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,039
things

00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:49,280
that i unfortunately couldn't look into

00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:51,840
detail for this talk but i'm

00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:54,240
happy to to work on in the next couple

00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,240
of months

00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:00,080
this was my talk thanks for your

00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:07,840
attention

00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:07,840
and i'm happy to answer questions now

00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,840
um

00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:34,640
thanks a lot benjamin for this great uh

00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:36,559
work as usually the heidelberg team is

00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:39,760
showing us something great

00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:43,039
um and also uh while listening

00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:45,039
and looking at the stream um i i really

00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:46,799
uh i really thought that we should

00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:48,080
probably take this opportunity also to

00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:49,200
thank all the people and all the

00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,000
volunteers

00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:54,159
and all the mappers that over uh so many

00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,159
years have contributed to the

00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:57,520
uh to the to the contribution of mapping

00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:00,080
data through the

00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,120
tasking manager which uh i think it's

00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,440
something really

00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:05,120
extraordinary and that we should really

00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:08,159
uh recognize so

00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:10,720
um there's uh there's been uh

00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:11,919
quite some activity in the in the pad uh

00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:15,200
so i'm happy to

00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:16,720
uh read the first uh question i see

00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,320
people that are still writing uh

00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,520
questions which is great

00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:24,720
so the first one um is this one

00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:28,080
so how do you determine if a building

00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:30,960
or a highway is a contribution uh done

00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,440
by the hot tasking manager so are there

00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,360
tags

00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:36,000
at the data for example in the change

00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,840
set comments that you are looking at

00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,760
uh maybe you said it and i missed this

00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:45,360
part of information this is from suzanne

00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:47,760
okay shall i go nice um hey everyone

00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:50,159
i'm benny from heidelberg and thanks to

00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:53,679
zanner for for that question

00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:55,440
so we do it like

00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:57,200
differently than what has been done

00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,440
before often so

00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,600
many analysis has been based on change

00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:05,360
set and change set comments

00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:07,360
we are um not using this so we are

00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,880
getting from the task manager as a task

00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:12,640
so the geometry

00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,360
we get the user the osm you the osm user

00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,120
id

00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,360
and we get the time so whenever you

00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,159
start or end working on that specific

00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:21,200
task

00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:23,520
and with this information we can query

00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:26,480
the os http so we are not looking for

00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,520
missing maps tags or hot osm tags in a

00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:31,679
change set but

00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,679
only geographic region user and time

00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:39,760
thanks a lot ben you mean we have a

00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:42,799
second question that is uh

00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:45,440
similar because it's still on the uh on

00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:48,720
the methodology so how did you count

00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:51,760
mapping versus validation activities um

00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:54,000
number of users features edits

00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,600
and this is from serena thanks serena

00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,080
for this question

00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:00,320
yeah also a very good question and um

00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,840
let me make like clear what what this

00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,360
figure referred to

00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,960
so in the one that i showed in the

00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:08,159
presentation we compared

00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,640
the number of tasks that has have been

00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:11,520
mapped

00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:13,039
per month against the number of tasks

00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:15,600
that have been validated

00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:16,880
in that specific month so it's not the

00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,280
users but it's the

00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,480
amount of work measured in tasks or

00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:23,440
sessions

00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,159
and we put that like the sum of both is

00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,799
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:27,679
and then we just have to share how much

00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:31,360
each has and

00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:33,360
ideally we would assume that 50 is

00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,640
the the best number or close to it

00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,799
because

00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,240
everything every task that is mapped

00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:40,080
should also be validated

00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,559
but that's not what we have been seeing

00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:45,440
in the data the data clearly shows

00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:45,840
there's more mappings and validation

00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,679
yeah

00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,200
so it would be interesting to also look

00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:53,039
at the features

00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:55,200
but i guess that here you cannot easily

00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:57,360
compare because

00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,320
we have to double check this again but

00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,919
ideally

00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,360
during the mapping phase that a lot of

00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:03,440
data gets added and during the

00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:05,600
validation phase it's maybe not so much

00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,440
but it gets corrected so

00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:11,520
comparing features will be interesting

00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,520
but we'll show you a different thing

00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,440
thanks benjamin i go to the next one

00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,000
that was actually asked by me but i will

00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,480
take this for

00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,240
the end if we have time uh so in the

00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,240
interest of really

00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,480
hearing what the what the community has

00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:29,600
asked so has your study show any

00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:31,600
impact on osm mapping during the current

00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:34,880
pandemic that it's also another very

00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:38,000
interesting question from serena

00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:41,679
um that's a good question

00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,840
um so i i cannot

00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:45,120
really say yes or no to this

00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,080
unfortunately

00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,640
so um

00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:51,679
[Music]

00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:53,600
how hard to how to decide on that so

00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:55,200
we see that there's a lot of mapping

00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:58,480
campaigns related to

00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,960
covet 19 and we will also clearly see

00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,039
this

00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,159
in the data that gets produced by

00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:05,440
tasking manager

00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:07,600
and then ends in osm but at least for

00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:10,080
the analysis that we conducted so far we

00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,080
did not

00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:15,039
took a more detailed look at this

00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:17,120
specific things only we were more into

00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:18,880
looking at the overall trend

00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,640
but it's definitely a good comment that

00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:23,600
we should um

00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:25,600
like add in the future and see how like

00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,240
the current pandemic is visible in the

00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,880
data

00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,240
yeah also to encourage the mappers and

00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:33,360
really show what

00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:35,360
has been done in the last month

00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:37,039
thanks benjamin once again thanks serena

00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,679
for this uh question i think we are all

00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:40,240
very

00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:42,080
interested in understanding uh how osm

00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:44,080
was used in the pandemic and how

00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:46,559
much data was actually collected during

00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:48,080
the pandemic especially because

00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:49,840
the pandemic has developed and is still

00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,760
developing in a different uh

00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:55,120
way throughout the world so it's

00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:58,480
definitely a very fruitful ground for

00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:00,880
further research so next

00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:03,600
question are you aware of studies or

00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:05,760
have possibly conducted one yourself

00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,960
investigating possible differences

00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,679
regarding mapping

00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,000
behaviors between humanitarian mappers

00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:12,960
and

00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,559
ordinary mappers also beyond specific

00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:17,679
actions or tasks

00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:19,679
and are hot mappers mapping different

00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:20,320
kinds of features in possibly different

00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,960
ways

00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:25,039
this is from rene and thanks because

00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,440
this is also very interesting

00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:29,200
yeah also like many good questions here

00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:33,120
i'm happy about that

00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:34,000
um so yeah um i think we are definitely

00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,400
sure that

00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,360
ordinary mappers and humanitarian

00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,960
members

00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:43,120
will add different things to the map um

00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,400
and this would like mainly what i could

00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:47,360
present to you was

00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:49,360
more or less unfortunately only the data

00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,480
preparation part so to say of everything

00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:53,039
so we

00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,559
i can throw a lot of numbers descriptive

00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:56,080
numbers at you but there would be much

00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:58,640
more needed to

00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,919
to to go to the questions that renee has

00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,480
been asking

00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:04,080
um but definitely so we only looked at

00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,480
highways and buildings

00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,520
so there we see a clear impact of what

00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,640
has been mapped

00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:11,600
in the task manager and we would like to

00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:15,200
extend this to

00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:18,640
other attributes or keys in osm

00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:20,799
but i'm pretty sure that we won't see as

00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:24,799
much activity there

00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:27,120
and so going into to those details to

00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:29,919
also set the community that is mapping

00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:31,840
to the tasking manager in perspective to

00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:33,200
everyone else mapping through other

00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,840
tools

00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,760
will be like a important next step for

00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:41,200
this analysis

00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:42,159
um so ideally what what i have in mind

00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:46,399
is

00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:49,360
first thing is starting on a geographic

00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:49,760
spatial like distribution and see where

00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,640
is

00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:55,200
the remote mapping community most active

00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:58,240
in terms of the overall mapping activity

00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,640
yeah not sure if that's a clear answer

00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,559
but

00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,880
um i hope that i can give a clearer

00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:04,880
answer in the future then

00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,320
yeah that would be very very interesting

00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:09,360
i think as a future uh

00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:11,440
work um next question um

00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:13,600
it was sort of implied by the numbers

00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,840
and the graphs you have shown but that

00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,200
was not exactly formulated as such would

00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:19,279
you conclude that

00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,039
initiatives like hot and missing maps

00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:23,840
are successful drivers

00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:24,720
for mapping participation that was asked

00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,919
by yagura

00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:31,600
station um

00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:34,320
so okay easy answer i would say yes

00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:36,480
so we see that a lot of people start

00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:39,440
mapping in the task manager

00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,080
and a little a big part or share of that

00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,039
people

00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:44,480
mappers that start start within a

00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:47,039
missing maps project

00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,919
so that's for the mapping activity part

00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:50,559
okay

00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:52,080
we also showed that starting is one

00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:54,399
thing but sustaining

00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:56,000
uh map contributions over a longer time

00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:58,240
is much more difficult

00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,039
so i would say that all initiatives like

00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,200
missing maps

00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:02,640
are really good at attracting new

00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,880
mappers to join

00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,799
but still like people are doing a lot of

00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:09,600
efforts already but still

00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:10,080
even more effort should be put into like

00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,880
having

00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:14,799
users contributing longer or finding new

00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,919
ways how to engage with users on a

00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:19,360
longer

00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:21,440
time scale yeah

00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:23,520
thanks a lot benjamin uh we have another

00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:26,240
question um

00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:27,919
about the um yeah about which tasking

00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,799
manager you have actually considered so

00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:30,880
the question is

00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:33,520
uh have you included several tasking

00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:35,760
managers used for humanitarian purposes

00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,960
for example the hot tasking manager from

00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:40,080
indonesia or

00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:41,520
the taski manager of legiograph libra

00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:44,080
sorry for my french

00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,720
that is basically yeah the francophone

00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,200
movement

00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,320
or is it only an analysis of one tasking

00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,919
manager that is

00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:52,159
the hot tasking manager yeah also good

00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:55,120
to

00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:55,760
to be clear on this so we only use the

00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:59,320
data

00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:00,880
that or the projects that you see at

00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:03,200
tasks.hotosm.org so

00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,320
what here is called the principal hot

00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,240
task manager

00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:07,520
and we didn't consider all the other

00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,200
instances that

00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:11,200
that are there we are aware that there

00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,960
are many instances

00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,799
and that they also contribute a lot of

00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,840
data to open sweeper probably but

00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:19,200
we couldn't uh take this data into

00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:21,760
account here

00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,440
and maybe this also points to maybe one

00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:26,080
major limitation of

00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,799
what i could present to you here is that

00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:30,320
what

00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:32,799
would we be oversimplified relatively

00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:33,440
sure what humanitarian mapping is we

00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:35,840
only took

00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,640
at what mapping happens in the task

00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,480
manager and

00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,840
we know that there are other task

00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,840
managers and there are many local

00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:44,240
mapping activities we could not

00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:47,039
analyze with this approach here at least

00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:48,640
not with the data from the task manager

00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:50,399
yeah thanks a lot for the question and

00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,960
also for the for the answer as a matter

00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,399
of fact

00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,840
we all know that the tasking manager is

00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:54,880
an open source software and of course

00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,960
this facilitates

00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,159
its reuse not only in the examples

00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:01,279
mentioned in the questions but

00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:01,600
i think uh overall across the world this

00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:04,080
is

00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:05,279
highly used by local communities as you

00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:08,000
have just

00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:08,880
said i can just mention the case of the

00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,360
italian

00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:13,120
earthquake of 2016 uh given that i come

00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,880
from italy and i remember that we use

00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:17,200
also the tasking manager to

00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:19,760
facilitate a collaborative mapping after

00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:21,279
that earthquake so yeah definitely

00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:23,039
everyone can use the task manager and

00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:23,600
this might be a limitation of the study

00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:25,519
although i

00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:28,080
of course many of your results i think

00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:29,840
give a quite clear picture

00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:32,000
of the mapping activity especially the

00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:34,640
evolution over time in the number of

00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,519
objects that were mapped i think this is

00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,519
a valid result

00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,720
so uh well there are a couple of

00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,320
questions that i asked in the chat i

00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,559
think we still have a couple of minutes

00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:47,840
so i will go with the first one

00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:50,320
um i i know that the uh the os hdb

00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:52,640
framework um was created by the

00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:55,840
heidelberg team you know in order to

00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:57,360
facilitate uh performing osm history

00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:59,279
based analysis by

00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:01,600
non-developers because working with the

00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:02,960
history is not definitely an easy task

00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:05,360
for for everyone

00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:07,519
including also researchers um i was

00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,640
wondering if you have an idea of how

00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:11,519
many people

00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,880
have used it or are currently using it

00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:16,240
mainly from

00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:18,880
research centers universities or local

00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,880
communities

00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,640
that's a tough question i'm not sure if

00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:25,840
i have

00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:28,720
a good answer to that i know that

00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:30,480
at least yeah in heidelberg we almost

00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,200
use it for every project we are doing

00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,600
because

00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,440
we are also like through the projects we

00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:38,559
are building the tool

00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:39,279
further and further i i know about i

00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:42,880
think the talk

00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:45,360
um we heard before in the project

00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:47,840
from drow and his group they also used

00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:50,640
the os hdb for some parts of their work

00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:54,159
at least to to get the historical

00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:57,120
evolution of osm and

00:32:54,159 --> 00:33:00,159
yeah besides this maybe i i should um

00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:03,360
like ask alex to send a tweet about that

00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:05,679
um and give us the actual numbers

00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:08,559
i hope that it's used by many people and

00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:11,519
um could also encourage you to

00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:13,600
to use it basically we have like for the

00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:15,760
non-developers the easiest endpoint is

00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:18,240
the so-called awesome api

00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:20,480
it's like just the rest api and what we

00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:22,640
used here was a bit more complicated

00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:25,840
because we used our edge to be

00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:28,799
like directly and there you have to

00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:29,360
like code in java so that might be a bit

00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:32,399
not so

00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:34,799
non-developer friendly as just using an

00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:34,799
api

00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:40,559
thanks benjamin of course i can only

00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,519
recommend to use it uh really if you

00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:45,120
need to make

00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:47,679
a history-based analysis of the data set

00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:48,399
um yeah so last question again it was

00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:50,320
from me

00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:51,600
it was a general question on whether

00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,919
this study

00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:56,080
started because it was asked by the

00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:59,760
humanitarian openstreetmap team

00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:01,919
uh if yes maybe why if no

00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:04,799
did you share the results with them and

00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:06,640
did you get any feedback from them

00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:08,960
um yeah thanks for that question as well

00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:11,919
so um

00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:13,200
so yeah i can give you like a short

00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:15,679
story of this maybe

00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:17,359
so we've been involved in the missing

00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,919
maps project for the last couple of

00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:19,919
years and

00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:21,679
as one contribution that we wanted to

00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:23,679
give to the project is like

00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:25,359
better understand what missing maps is

00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:27,760
actually doing so we we're only

00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:29,839
taking a look at missing maps we had the

00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,800
poster on missing maps last year at

00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:32,639
state of the map

00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,800
and when working on this we soon

00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:35,520
realized okay we are also missing quite

00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,440
a lot

00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:39,919
that happens outside missing maps so

00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,520
that's why we said okay let's do

00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:44,159
it a bit like bigger and the full

00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:45,839
picture and

00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:48,480
then we also discussed it with hot

00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:50,480
already so that like these numbers we

00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:52,720
produce here of course they're also

00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,240
interesting numbers to write in any

00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:56,159
proposal for

00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:57,839
for funding or long-term funding that

00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:00,560
you can really show what has been your

00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:04,240
impact over the last couple of years

00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:05,520
and so yeah we are in close contact with

00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,839
with people from the might have an

00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:09,440
openstreetmap team on this also to

00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:11,359
to see how we can move this in the

00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,280
future to

00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:16,160
yeah what this was here now was like

00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:18,160
just a one-shot activity but ideally

00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,920
we will have this sustained over the

00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:22,000
next couple of months and years to

00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:24,400
come into the monitoring phase to really

00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:27,520
see how different

00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:29,440
mapping approaches really affect number

00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:32,720
of mappers validators

00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:36,800
osm contributions and so forth

00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:39,200
yeah thanks a lot benjamin i think we

00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,240
completed the questions uh that were

00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:43,440
asked in the pad

00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:45,520
uh just to conclude this

00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,640
talk i would like to thank the audience

00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:58,000
for being

00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:58,000
