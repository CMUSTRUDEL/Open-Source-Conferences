To assess the possible human and financial losses of earthquakes and to estimate the long-term earthquake risk that many people on Earth are exposed to, detailed knowledge of buildings is paramount. This encompasses not only the position, size, and type of buildings, but also the reconstruction value and the number of people inside the building at any time. Using OpenStreetMap data and further open data, we are implementing an open, global, dynamic, purely algorithmic, and reproducible exposure model for the probabilistic description of the aforementioned parameters for every building on Earth, growing and changing with every edit in OpenStreetMap.

Earthquakes are threatening many regions in the world with constantly increasing risk due to rapid urbanization and industrialization. To improve resilience and preparedness, we need to estimate the risk of earthquakes with the greatest possible detail. For this, exposure models are used that translate the physical earthquake hazard to building damage, human and financial losses. The level of detail in the risk model directly depends on the level of detail in the exposure model. So far, exposure models are usually described as aggregated building-type descriptions for larger geographic areas, from city districts to even larger administrative units.

We present our new open, dynamic, and global exposure model based on OpenStreetMap that does not stop at administrative boundaries but rather attempts to classify and describe every building on Earth with the greatest level of detail. Our open-source model extracts all possible exposure indicators, i.e. footprint shape, number of stories, occupancy type, shape of the roof, etc. and combines the OpenStreetMap data with other open datasets if available. Using these indicators, the model assesses in a probabilistic way the possible building classes, the number of people inside the building depending on the time and day, and the reconstruction value. In areas with incomplete building coverage, the classical aggregate-based exposure models are combined with our model to deliver a probabilistic description of the entire building stock. To achieve a better spatial distribution of buildings in areas of incomplete coverage, we estimate the likely locations of buildings through remote sensing using again open data only, mainly Sentinel-I radar data. Due to the near-realtime computations of our model, it directly profits from the growth of OpenStreetMap and with about 5 million buildings added each month, the areas of incomplete coverage are constantly shrinking, making way for our building-specific exposure model.

the second day of

00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,920
state of the map but this particular

00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:22,400
state of the math all online

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,960
i'm glad to introduce to you to to this

00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,279
talk

daniel schwarlemer that is the leader of

00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:29,359
the testing and evaluation program for

00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:32,000
the global earthquake model in german

00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,280
in the german research center in boston

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,160
in particular for the focus for

00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,160
geoscience

00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,600
i remind to you that when during the

00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,600
talk you have quests you knew

00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,120
the questionnaire could be done to be

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,120
asked inside the

00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,320
pod that you can find on the state of

00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,840
the map website

00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,600
you can go and there are there is space

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,840
for every question we are going to reply

00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,000
after in the q a section

00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,120
the the talk will be focused on the

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,760
possibility to use

00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:58,079
the osm data as the input for an

00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,800
expositor model to transform the

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,280
earthquake hazard to building damage

00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:13,840
human

00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:13,840
and financial losses

00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,360
hi i'm daniel shorlamer i'm a

00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,880
seismologist

00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,360
and risk researcher at the german

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,119
research center for geosciences

00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:28,400
my work is centered around earthquakes

00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,400
and their risk to society

00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,479
research is usually not done alone

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,320
therefore i would like to introduce my

00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,000
collaborators from all around the globe

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,640
that have significantly contributed to

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,840
this work

00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,200
i have put all their names onto this

00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,439
slide

00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,079
earthquakes pose a significant risk to

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,840
around a third of the world's population

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,200
here you can see the effects of the mega

00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,840
earthquake and tsunami

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,320
that hit the east coast of japan in

00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,000
2011.

00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,439
japan is one of the countries with the

00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,640
highest chance to be rattled by

00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,960
earthquakes

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,560
in 1923 the great kanto earthquake

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,000
destroyed many parts of tokyo and

00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,200
yokohama

00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,880
more than five hundred thousand

00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,439
buildings were destroyed and more than

00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,679
one 100

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,280
000 people lost their lives it's only a

00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:14,160
matter of time before another large

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,840
earthquake will hit the tokyo area

00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,239
what will tokyo look like after the

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,680
earthquake what will any community

00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,120
around the world look like after an

00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,040
earthquake hits

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,319
what can these communities do to

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,680
mitigate their risk

00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:28,319
and how do we make communities

00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,920
understand their risk

00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,680
let me take you on a quick tour through

00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,560
the phenomenon of earthquakes and their

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,560
impact on people and values

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,160
the births of modern seismology can be

00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,239
dated back to 1906

00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,760
after the great san francisco earthquake

00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,599
in which similar to the great kanto

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,319
earthquake many buildings were destroyed

00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:47,760
during the fires in its aftermath

00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:50,239
it happened that shortly before the

00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,760
earthquake the san francisco bay area

00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,760
was geodetically surveyed

00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,280
and this survey was repeated after the

00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,280
earthquake

00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,720
the changes detected in comparing the

00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,680
measurements before and after the

00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,959
earthquake

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,879
led to the conclusion that the

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,200
earthquake was a result of motion

00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:07,120
along the san andreas fault named after

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,080
a lake in the san francisco area

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,840
that the fault line is crossing we know

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,440
today that this fault stretches all the

00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,239
way through the state of california to

00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,920
mexico

00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,959
and that two major plates are moving

00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:21,040
horizontally along this fault

00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,800
the picture here shows the very exposed

00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,640
and easily visible part of the san

00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,239
andreas fault in the carrizo plane in

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,920
central california

00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,000
it should be mentioned that the fold is

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,959
nowhere near to be seen as clearly in

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,480
the bay area

00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,480
as it is in the carrizo plane

00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,599
at many locations along the san andreas

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,080
fault geodetic measurements revealed

00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,760
that

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,159
during the earthquake the plates have

00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,120
suddenly moved by a few meters as can be

00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:48,159
seen in the photo

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,680
of the shifted fence as a result of

00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,440
these observations

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,439
modern seismology started with the

00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,040
so-called elastic rebound theory

00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:57,200
basically stating that the plates are

00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,920
moving constantly but are stuck at their

00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,480
interface

00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,319
in this case the san andreas fault if

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,200
the stresses due to the motion become

00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,879
too high

00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,720
the fault cannot sustain them anymore

00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:08,000
and gives way for another sudden motion

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,280
at the fault interface

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,120
which actually is an earthquake

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,200
the fact that this behavior is repeating

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,560
approximately every century can be seen

00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,479
by a shifted creek

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,000
in the carrizo plane that i visited some

00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:21,519
15 years ago

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,440
this shift is the result of many

00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,360
earthquakes moving the right part the

00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,600
northern american continent

00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,520
towards the viewer in this photo the

00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,040
major finding in these observations was

00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,080
the fact that large earthquakes are

00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,720
generated along

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,720
large faults

00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,520
therefore seismological and geological

00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,600
activities were focused in mapping these

00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,000
sources of earthquakes to create models

00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,520
that can

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,840
forecast the locations of future

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,720
earthquakes in order to help countries

00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,479
to prepare for the coming disasters

00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,479
here you see a map of major faults in

00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:54,400
japan and it is pretty obvious that at

00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:57,840
least moderate earthquakes can occur

00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,840
almost anywhere in the country

00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:02,160
but the world is still experiencing what

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,400
we can call surprise earthquakes

00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,440
the earthquake that shook kobe in japan

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,440
for 20 seconds

00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,880
destroyed or heavily damaged more than

00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,400
100 000 buildings

00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,919
and more than four and a half thousand

00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,160
people died

00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:16,160
the surprising factor was the fact that

00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,720
the fault underneath kobe causing the

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,479
earthquake was not known before

00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,240
this catastrophe has led to

00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:23,360
significantly improved building codes in

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,320
japan

00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,400
only 25 years later in tokyo alone more

00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:31,919
than 70 percent of the buildings are now

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,919
built according to these codes

00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,080
however not only the location of faults

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,080
are important to understand

00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,600
earthquake hazard let's return to san

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,520
francisco where the loma prieta

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,039
earthquake 1989

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,880
destroyed buildings in the marina

00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,440
district and a highway in the oakland

00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,080
area

00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,240
shown here although the fault causing

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,960
this earthquake was known for almost 100

00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,800
years

00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:56,160
another key parameter influences the

00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:58,880
destruction the local underground

00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,600
very dangerous unconsolidated soft soils

00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:04,479
and sediments which amplify the shaking

00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,080
one can imagine them as a wobbly pudding

00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:08,960
that is shaking for much longer

00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,880
than the stiff rock it is the irony of

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,039
history that the marina district and the

00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:16,000
highway location in oakland are areas in

00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:18,840
which the rubble of the 1906 earthquake

00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,080
was used as a poorly consolidated

00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:24,000
landfill the destructions in 1989 can

00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:27,280
therefore be considered a consequence of

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,280
the 1906 event

00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,800
this graphic nicely shows the effects

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,400
the different types of sites can have on

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,319
the surface shaking

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,639
this ranges from solid bedrock where

00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,639
shaking is comparatively the weakest

00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,919
over well-consolidated sediments with

00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,840
some amplification

00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:48,560
to poorly consolidated sediments with

00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,720
comparatively stronger shaking

00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,240
in case of water saturated sediments

00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,000
liquefaction can occur

00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,919
an effect in which the formerly solid

00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,840
sediments behave like a liquid

00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,680
during the shaking making building

00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:03,840
foundations move or turn over

00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,840
or buildings sink into the ground

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,360
as a consequence the most important

00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,440
product of seismological research

00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,880
are earthquake hazard maps that combine

00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,759
the location and probability of

00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,919
earthquakes

00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:18,319
was the site conditions to express

00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:20,800
locally the probabilities to experience

00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,560
certain degrees of shaking

00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,319
the hazard map of japan shows a

00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,120
different image than the map of active

00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,199
faults

00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,120
the highest hazard shown in red is

00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,960
concentrated in the flat areas

00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,800
which are covered by sediments

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,639
unfortunately these are not only the

00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:38,639
agricultural areas but also the

00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,639
locations of the biggest cities in japan

00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,120
probabilities of shaking levels are not

00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,080
the best way to communicate the danger

00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,560
of earthquakes to people communities or

00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,400
municipalities

00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,080
it is anything but easy to understand

00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,199
how a particular level of shaking will

00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,319
affect a building or

00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,360
town and it not only depends on the

00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,039
earthquake itself

00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,800
and the site conditions but also on the

00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:03,759
buildings themselves and how resistant

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,759
they are to shaking

00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,919
the effects that earthquakes have on

00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,520
buildings and people are called risk

00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,039
which itself is a combination of the

00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,319
earthquake hazard locally

00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,319
the types of buildings in their

00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,919
distribution called exposure

00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:19,440
and the vulnerability of each of these

00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:21,680
types of buildings to the shaking

00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,520
therefore a risk estimate describes the

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,879
expected long-term building damage and

00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:28,560
loss of lives

00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,319
but we know that while the earthquake

00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,720
hazard does not change strongly over

00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,959
time

00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,719
the exposure is very dynamic the

00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:36,560
building stock is changing constantly

00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:39,519
over time cities are growing

00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,959
and was it the number of people also in

00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,800
many countries the building stock

00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,399
changes in terms of vulnerability with

00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,920
old buildings being removed and new

00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,640
buildings following new and better

00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,480
building codes

00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,080
therefore monitoring the changes in

00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,440
exposure allows us to monitor the

00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,600
dynamics of the risk

00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,760
people are exposed to monitoring the

00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:01,360
risk gives us the means to communicate

00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:03,440
risk and detail to the affected people

00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,200
and it gives us the means to understand

00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,000
how we have to shape our cities and

00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,839
communities

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,839
to reduce the risk they are exposed to

00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,680
the goal of our so-called global dynamic

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,120
exposure model is to describe every

00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,760
building on earth in respect

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,279
to key exposure indicators exact

00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,560
location and size

00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,399
the type of building and its

00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,399
vulnerability to earthquakes to assess

00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,160
potential degrees of damage

00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,440
the replacement value to assess the

00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,200
economic losses

00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,880
and the number of people inside each

00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,480
building during an earthquake to

00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,800
estimate the number of casualties in

00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,800
injured people

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,720
knowing all these indicators will allow

00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,480
us to completely model the impact of

00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,680
earthquakes on people buildings

00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,680
communities and cities

00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,000
our challenge is to create a dynamic

00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,680
exposure model that monitors any

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,279
change to the building stock to be able

00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:56,080
to precisely capture the fast

00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:57,920
urbanization in many areas of the world

00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,600
and because every building is different

00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,800
we want our model to be of highest

00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,959
possible resolution

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:06,880
the building scale classically exposure

00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:09,120
models are created by engineers

00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:11,120
analyzing the building stock of a city

00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,279
and describing it as aggregates with

00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,040
varying resolution

00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,640
it is obvious that there are not enough

00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,160
engineers on the world to inspect every

00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,560
building in a terminated size

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:23,600
type and value therefore we are going a

00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,600
completely different way

00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,040
we are developing our model around

00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,720
crowdsourcing of building relevant

00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,760
information to be able to capture the

00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,519
whole world

00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:36,800
what other platform is more suited than

00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:39,040
openstreetmap for this endeavor

00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,880
we are combining osm data with other

00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,560
open data where available and expert

00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,399
knowledge to estimate the key exposure

00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,240
indicators for each building

00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,839
based on the proxy values that we can

00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,519
access through osm

00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,600
like footprint number of stories or

00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,519
occupancy type

00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,440
each building is dynamically processed

00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,000
and exposure data is delivered as a web

00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,600
service

00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,120
following standard taxonomies to

00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,839
describe the key features of each

00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,839
building

00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,240
we are updating our local copy of osm

00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,240
every 60 seconds and immediately

00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,079
processing all changes

00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,600
out of this processing all buildings

00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:13,680
that require an assessment of their

00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,760
exposure indicators are identified

00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,839
and placed into computational cues to be

00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,959
processed at the next possible time

00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:23,120
this usually only takes a few minutes

00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:25,120
the entire processing is algorithmic and

00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,959
all exposure indicator interpretations

00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,480
are based on expert rules

00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:30,320
making this exposure model fully

00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:34,320
reproducible and documented

00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,320
as no expert guessing takes place

00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,240
let's have a look at a very complete

00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,000
example of our exposure model

00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,160
here you see the downtown area of san

00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,240
francisco is each building colored

00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,720
according to its occupancy type

00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,160
red colors indicate residential use

00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,480
yellow educational

00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,399
and blue commercial light blue is used

00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,240
for various types of assemblies

00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,880
that is cultural or transportation

00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,880
related buildings orange indicates

00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,600
governmental brown industrial buildings

00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:03,680
and purple

00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,680
is used for mixed types of occupancy

00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,839
as you can see the occupancy type is

00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,519
assigned to each building separately

00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,440
we are using land use information

00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,279
building tags and points of interest to

00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,320
derive the best guess of the occupancy

00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:16,320
type for each building

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,880
let's look at the connection of our

00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:22,800
exposure model to earthquakes

00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,720
here you see the building types that we

00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,320
derived for each building based on

00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,279
various parameters like shape

00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,959
occupancy number of stories etc we are

00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:33,440
following the standard building types as

00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:35,360
defined for the u.s

00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,959
the inset on the top left shows the

00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,240
aforementioned marina district in

00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,920
northern san francisco

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,519
just to highlight the fact that we

00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:44,320
performed all computation for each

00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:46,240
single building separately

00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,760
you can see that the residential suburbs

00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,040
to the west are predominantly covered

00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,440
with wood frame homes

00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,279
shown in red while in the downtown area

00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,040
we can see many different building types

00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:58,720
in particular the steel frame concrete

00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,720
buildings showing bluish colors

00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,399
let us now shake the whole city with an

00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,920
earthquake we have chosen an event very

00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,200
similar to the earthquake that hit the

00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,639
city in 1989

00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,880
and caused the damage in the marina

00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,560
district and in auckland

00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,920
what you see here is the maximum level

00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,560
of shaking measured in g

00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,839
per location as mentioned before and

00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,360
nicely visible here

00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:23,680
the local site conditions have a

00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,680
profound impact on the level of shaking

00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,839
to understand the shaking at each

00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,760
building site we interpolate the

00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:32,160
simulated shaking down to the building

00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,160
scale

00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,639
now that we know for each building its

00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,639
type and vulnerability to shaking

00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,160
and the level of shaking it was exposed

00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,160
to during the earthquake

00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,560
we can compute the probability of each

00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,720
building to be completely destroyed

00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,320
the probability to be destroyed is very

00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,279
small for almost all buildings in san

00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,320
francisco

00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,320
given this earthquake

00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:58,000
but we can also compute the probability

00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,000
to be extensively damaged

00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,720
moderately damaged

00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:11,920
or slightly damaged these computations

00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,519
now give us a clear picture of what is

00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,519
likely to happen to the city of san

00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,600
francisco in such an earthquake

00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:19,040
we can also see that the marina district

00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,959
has an overall higher chance to

00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,079
experience damage than most other parts

00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:25,199
of the city

00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:27,760
as was indeed observed after the 1989

00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,760
earthquake

00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,399
one can ask whether or not this level of

00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:34,639
detail is necessary

00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:37,279
the answer is yes details matter just

00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:39,040
ask these cows after the 2016 kaikoura

00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:41,120
earthquake in new zealand

00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:44,959
the underground can react differently on

00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:47,920
relatively small scales

00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:49,360
to give you some examples with buildings

00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,360
here you see some building blocks

00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,320
strongly affected by liquefaction of the

00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,160
underground

00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,079
while the two rows of buildings on the

00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,160
left hand side are tilted and some

00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:01,680
almost tumbled the buildings on the

00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,680
right hand side have not moved

00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:06,240
christ church new zealand was struck by

00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,680
a series of earthquakes in 2011.

00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,600
some parts of christ's church were

00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,199
heavily affected by liquefaction

00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,800
and even partly flooded due to the

00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:14,720
uprising water

00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,639
on the photo taken right after the

00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,399
earthquake you can see the part west of

00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:21,279
the river was flooded while the eastern

00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:22,720
part was not affected

00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:24,639
as a consequence the city of

00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,079
christchurch has designated so-called

00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,680
residential red zones

00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,839
in which all buildings were removed and

00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,600
no further developments were allowed

00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:35,440
this was a very effective measure to

00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,440
reduce losses in future earthquakes

00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,600
here's another example showing you on

00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,639
what a small scale the location of a

00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,320
building

00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,680
can make a difference between complete

00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,480
destruction

00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,920
and relatively low level of damage it is

00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,519
important to know whether or not you

00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:52,160
live in a house on the left

00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:54,480
or right side of the yellow line the

00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:56,160
ability to communicate on this level the

00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,040
risk building owners or tenants are

00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,279
exposed to

00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,639
can trigger necessary reinforcements of

00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:04,079
buildings or other

00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:05,040
risk mitigation strategies exposure

00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:07,199
models describe

00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,440
exactly this aspect of the earthquake

00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:13,839
risk chain that we can change to create

00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:15,600
safer cities shortly after the 2016

00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:18,480
kumamoto earthquake in japan

00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,600
i visited the affected area here you see

00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,279
the surface trace

00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,759
of the fault that ruptured and how it

00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:25,440
shifted the ground

00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,199
buildings very close to the fault

00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:30,000
experiencing a high level of shaking

00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:30,000
were destroyed

00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,440
but further away it was often the type

00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,480
and quality of buildings that made a

00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,920
difference

00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,160
here you see two buildings that were

00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,839
exposed to the same level of shaking

00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,680
the building in the front completely

00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,839
collapsed while the building in the back

00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:46,720
retained its overall shape despite

00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:48,639
likely being structurally damaged it may

00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,320
be uninhabitable in the future

00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:53,360
but the people inside have likely

00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,360
survived the earthquake

00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,160
most likely it was later tacked as

00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:59,839
unsafe after manual inspection by

00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,360
engineers

00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:03,120
a lot of buildings that on the first

00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,959
glimpse looked ok were attacked as

00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,079
unsafe because they lost the structural

00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,520
integrity

00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:11,360
they will all need to be completely

00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,360
removed and replaced by new buildings

00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,959
i also visited the emergency management

00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,640
group in kumamoto

00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,240
their main job was to understand how

00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,799
many buildings were damaged beyond

00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,480
repair

00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:25,120
and how many people they expect to be

00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,720
homeless after the earthquake

00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,720
these numbers are most important in the

00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,480
direct aftermath of such an event to be

00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:33,120
able to correctly plan for sufficient

00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:35,440
supply for the population

00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:37,039
only if the building situation is known

00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,880
sufficiently well

00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:41,919
the number of shelters needed can be

00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:44,000
reasonably estimated

00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:45,760
a model delivering this information will

00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
be able to speed up this process from

00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,600
many

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,679
days to a few minutes and provide the

00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,440
emergency managers with the data needed

00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:53,360
to most efficiently help the affected

00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:56,480
population and provide the necessary

00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,480
shelters for the homeless

00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,880
i hope i was able to make the case for

00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,480
good building data in osm and to

00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,200
convince you that every building detail

00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,039
in osm

00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,799
can contribute to mitigating and

00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:08,720
understanding risks

00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:10,400
how can you contribute and what are we

00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,240
looking for

00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,000
obviously we need the footprints of all

00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,000
buildings preferably together with

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,679
the number of stories they provide the

00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,280
location and size of the building and

00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:22,320
give us hints to the building type and

00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,320
its replacement value

00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,320
the occupancy coded in the building tag

00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,640
the building use

00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,640
tag or through points of interest help

00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,919
us assess the number of people per time

00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,320
of the day that are likely in the

00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,320
building

00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:38,799
and all of the simple 3d tags describing

00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,480
the roof and the outside material can

00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:41,679
give us further clues to the type and

00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,440
value

00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:45,120
even not being visible on the standard

00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,039
map all these extra tags provide

00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,480
valuable information that we translate

00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:52,400
into an exposure model

00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,400
to understand the building specific risk

00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,120
this exposure model can be used to

00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,559
improve earthquake resilience of

00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,160
communities and their preparedness

00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,919
planning

00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,679
it helps in rapid loss assessments as

00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:04,960
shown for the scenario earthquake in san

00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:06,640
francisco

00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,480
in upcoming projects we're including

00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,000
communities in taiwan and japan to

00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,280
increase their risk awareness and help

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,320
them understand

00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:16,400
their possible mitigation measures

00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,320
our goal is that after the expected big

00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,280
earthquake that will hit tokyo sometime

00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,360
in the future

00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:25,840
the city will not look like after the

00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,840
1923 earthquake

00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,480
with this i want to thank you for your

00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,440
attention i hope i was able to get my

00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,120
ideas across

00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,520
and to generate some interest in

00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:37,360
building data in openstreetmap

00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:40,000
you can visit our website for more

00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:42,000
information or contact me at any time

00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,280
i hope to see you all at next year's

00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,559
state of the map

00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:53,840
wherever it might be thanks again

00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:53,840
and goodbye

00:19:54,480 --> 00:20:00,960
life thank you very much dania for your

00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:03,440
very interesting talking about

00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,720
the data interface between open street

00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,720
operand earthquakes

00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,760
we have some question that we have in

00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,200
the pad

00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:13,600
so i just start with the first one so

00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,240
uh it's say there is a very interesting

00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,360
example

00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,919
the example of san francisco is great

00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,039
but

00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:24,080
the the that was thanks to one that i

00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:26,559
import from the project of uh

00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:28,559
gov open data what will happen in the

00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:30,640
country when the government doesn't want

00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:32,480
to share this data to a sam because

00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,799
there they might be

00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:37,679
corruption or some construction

00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,679
launching that they gave

00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:44,720
um not anymore right

00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:48,000
you can hear me um

00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:49,679
yes yes perfect for this park we have

00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,600
particularly selected san francisco

00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,840
because of the high level of detail to

00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:56,080
actually really make the case

00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,440
of why it is important to know about

00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,520
everything about the buildings

00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,520
but we're not limited to an area where

00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:04,880
we have a complete building stock

00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:08,240
so the the general approach that we take

00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:11,039
is that we subdivide

00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:13,440
the the country or the city into

00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:15,840
basically tile so call it cells

00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,919
and for each cell we estimate the

00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,200
expected number of buildings for remote

00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:22,000
sensing

00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,840
or other sources and then we distribute

00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,880
classical exposure models to all of

00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,360
these buildings

00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,880
and as buildings are coming on in into

00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:31,919
openstreetmap

00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:34,320
we specify this aggregated exposure into

00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:37,760
a building by building type exposure

00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:39,679
so if we have all the buildings like

00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,960
in case of san francisco we give a

00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:43,919
building specific

00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,039
um risk assessment if we don't have it

00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:48,159
we go by the

00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:49,840
zoom level 18 tiles 150 meters

00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:51,280
and have the aggregates at these

00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,440
locations so we can

00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,440
basically always make a statement

00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:58,880
sometimes with higher

00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,360
precision than others okay thanks there

00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,159
is a

00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,960
very similar question about these topics

00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:06,400
uh

00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,760
for for knowing the risk of of the

00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,080
foreign risk of the building is

00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:12,480
necessary to know the exactly position

00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:15,679
and the level of the buildings but what

00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:19,760
about the risk of the rotor

00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:22,400
um well if the road is very close

00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:24,080
and then we can make a probabilistic

00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,159
assessment whether or not the road will

00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,679
likely be blocked with debris of the

00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,960
building

00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:31,200
that of course can only be a

00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:33,840
probabilistic assessment because we

00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,760
cannot definitely say how a building

00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,159
will react we give probabilities as

00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,200
shown

00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:41,200
in the presentation and also

00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:44,240
there is a particular probabilistic

00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:47,280
function that given a particular type of

00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:49,840
damage there will be a lot of debris

00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,799
on the road so the proximity of the road

00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,880
to buildings

00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:54,640
can be a very important factor and what

00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,960
we have not shown in this talk is we

00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,000
also run simulations of a realization of

00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,440
what happens

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,360
so we say okay each we given run a monte

00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:06,000
carlo simulation

00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:08,240
assigning each building a particular

00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,200
damaged state and then we can

00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,559
add which of these buildings potentially

00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,799
block roads

00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:16,559
and then you know you can run different

00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:18,080
simulations based on that if you like

00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:20,720
for instance

00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:22,000
what is the passage time or the way that

00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,600
somebody has to take

00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,200
going from a damaged building where you

00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,480
have to expect injured people to the

00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:30,159
next working hospital

00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,159
because the direct road may be blocked

00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:35,280
thanks very clear there is a ford

00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,679
research is needed a digital elevation

00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:40,480
model external from the data of osm it's

00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,480
or is not needed

00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,480
that's actually a pretty good question

00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:45,440
for what we're doing in terms of

00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,080
earthquakes

00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:49,200
it is not very much needed sometimes the

00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,919
slope

00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,679
uh can give us an additional information

00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:55,760
but the point is that an exposure model

00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:58,400
is essentially hazard agnostic

00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,760
only when you assign vulnerabilities to

00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,679
a building

00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,279
you are defining the hazard that you're

00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,120
looking at let me give you an example

00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:06,720
for earthquakes of course it

00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,279
this is important what kind of

00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:11,440
structural integrity a building has what

00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:13,679
material it has been built off

00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,200
if you look into the hazard of floodings

00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:16,960
then it's most important to know whether

00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,919
this building has a basement or not

00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:22,000
because that will run full of water and

00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:23,919
while talking about floodings

00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,440
the digital elevation model here is

00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:28,400
extremely important

00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,360
because then we can assess the chance of

00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,520
a building being

00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:33,039
exposed to a flood or to the water

00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,880
coming in

00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:37,440
into the basement of that very house and

00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,440
destroy it

00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,880
thanks there is a sim a question there

00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:44,320
that maybe

00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,960
before i answer maybe there can be a

00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:50,080
more complex answer the lack

00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:52,080
of geological data on osm and those

00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,120
uh north among the open data is a limit

00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,279
for the model sorry

00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,159
wrong i read it wrong before it is

00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:58,400
totally new

00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:00,159
so the lack of this geological data is

00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,880
something that limit the model

00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:04,880
or there is will this type of data

00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:07,919
improve the model

00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,440
um it is independent of this data this

00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:11,679
is an exposure model

00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,360
it basically describes the building so

00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:14,240
say the assets it describes where the

00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,559
people are

00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,640
at what time of the day and what the

00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:19,360
value or say replacement cost of these

00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:23,039
buildings

00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:25,279
is the geological data comes into play

00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:27,840
into the hazard model so if you want to

00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:29,520
you know create a good risk assessment

00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:31,120
you need a good hazard model and a good

00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:34,240
exposure model

00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:35,360
and so we are focusing here on the pure

00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,840
exposure part

00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:39,679
and we have to assume like everybody

00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,360
else that the people who do the hazard

00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:44,480
model do it the best way

00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:46,720
and that is not necessarily open

00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,760
data that goes in but the hazard models

00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:51,520
that we use

00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:54,240
as um as basis for computing the risk

00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,240
they are open

00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,000
okay we have just if you have in the

00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:59,919
public there are some

00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,279
more questions we have some few minutes

00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:03,520
to write it we have just

00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:05,440
one last comments that he said in most

00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:07,679
of the informal cities

00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,279
buildings did not apply for permits and

00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:12,400
they are in fact illegal

00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:13,600
so any muffin of them is rather

00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,200
sensitive

00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,640
how this i think it's referred to

00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,679
something to say before if you have some

00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:23,120
other comments to add to these uh

00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:26,640
to these statements um yeah sure um

00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:27,440
i i see that point um but i think what

00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,960
we're doing is

00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,799
we're not going into these cities and

00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,600
mapping we're taking what is in open

00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:33,919
street map

00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,440
which has been mapped so if for some

00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,320
reason people don't want this to be

00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,720
mapped then

00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,520
they may you know remove that data or

00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,000
not

00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:43,200
um we are just taking every building

00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,200
that we find in our

00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,960
open street map and try to squeeze out

00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,440
the most of information that is an open

00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,760
street

00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,960
in terms of exposure and vulnerability

00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,559
to put it into

00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:55,200
our exposure model to run the risk

00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:55,200
calculation

00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,080
so thank you very much we don't have any

00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,840
any other questions

00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,279
thanks to daniel for your very

00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,039
interesting presentation about

00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:06,960
this different model that can be the

00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:09,840
different use that can be done with the

00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,320
osm so thank you very much i thanks also

00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,559
to the

00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:14,080
all the technical team since he's my

00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:16,720
last uh

00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,760
truck told us as a host so thank you

00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,679
very much uh

00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:21,520
rapper for your work and your support

00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:24,799
during these talks

00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:25,840
and see you in a in a next set of the

00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:29,279
map maybe

00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:31,760
in person and not virtue bye thank you

00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:31,760
bye

00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,840
bye
