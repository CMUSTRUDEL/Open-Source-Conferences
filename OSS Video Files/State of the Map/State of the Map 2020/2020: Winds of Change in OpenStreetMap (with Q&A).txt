so

00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,400
our first speaker is a keynote is the

00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,440
keynote speaker

00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:18,480
um there won't be a q a session but

00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:21,279
he does have a session later to um

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,240
if you want to ask questions um it's

00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:26,160
alan mustard

00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:29,439
who is the um he's the chair of

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,199
the openstreetmap foundation and he's

00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,320
been talking to a lot of people over the

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,960
last year

00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,399
um virtually and in person so he's got a

00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,879
lot of insight

00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,960
into open street map where it's come

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:43,920
from and what's changing

00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,640
um so we're gonna hear from alan on

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:51,360
winds of change

00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,360
i believe my technical team will

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,399
since being elected first to the osm

00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,480
foundation board of directors and then

00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,760
chairman of the board last september i

00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,600
spent a great deal of time

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,800
on the telephone skype and various

00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,239
conferencing apps

00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,840
listening to members of the osm

00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,880
community going all the way back to

00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,040
steve coast

00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,080
and forward through a mix of old timers

00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,760
heavy mappers

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,000
software developers working group

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,600
members local chapters and communities

00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,080
and advisory board members i also kicked

00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,240
off a swot analysis on the osm wiki

00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,119
a survey of strengths weaknesses

00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,520
opportunities

00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:27,119
and threats to hear from the broad osm

00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,479
community what it thinks about the state

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,680
of osm

00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,600
i'd like to share with you some

00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,520
conclusions i have drawn

00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,799
from these conversations and the swot

00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,560
analysis

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,400
i want to underscore that what you were

00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,240
about to hear is my own assessment

00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,079
based on 32 years of management

00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,439
experience 20 of them in senior

00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,200
leadership roles

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,200
this assessment does not necessarily

00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,439
reflect either official osm

00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,640
foundation policy or the views of the

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:55,840
board or

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,840
any other of its members

00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,439
the osm foundation is responsible for

00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,000
supporting but not controlling

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,000
openstreet

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,239
raises funds and generally creates an

00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,239
operating environment that allows

00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,039
mappers to map and data users to use the

00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,879
data

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,319
the board does not tell anybody what to

00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,319
map or how to map

00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,840
the content of the osm database is up to

00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,040
the mappers themselves and the local

00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,080
communities made up

00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,520
of those mappers the data working group

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,640
ensures that data conform to our

00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,160
copyright rules

00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,480
and helps the community enforce its

00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:31,200
other rules as to what the map database

00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,879
and its associated wiki should contain

00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,480
the foundation's mission statement lists

00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,200
several responsibilities the board

00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,239
carries

00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:40,319
and among them is this the osf osmf

00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:43,040
board and board members define a

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,800
strategic vision

00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,480
that vision has clearly been lacking for

00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,160
the last few years in part because of

00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,840
dissension on previous boards

00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,440
and in part because of dissension among

00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,680
members of both the foundation

00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,360
and the osm community some of whom have

00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,680
historically objected to the notion that

00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,519
the board should make any decisions

00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,200
the idea of the foundation board making

00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,840
decisions has been condemned as

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,440
not the osm way and in some corners of

00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,879
the community the view continues to be

00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,319
advanced that all decisions should be

00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,319
made collectively

00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,400
this has led to paralysis and thus many

00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,159
needed decisions were not made

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,080
in my conversations with community

00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,840
members since the start of the new year

00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,360
only one person has insisted that the

00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,480
board should continue not making

00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,159
decisions

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,400
all others have expressed fatigue with

00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:26,080
the paralysis and suggested to me that

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,840
it is time for the board to start making

00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,640
decisions that do not affect how anyone

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,080
maps

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,319
but which will ensure the health and

00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,840
stability of our infrastructure and will

00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:35,599
protect the community's intellectual

00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,200
property

00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,120
and make no mistake about that last

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,840
point our intellectual property is

00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,840
valuable

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,319
it's now used by apple which combines it

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:48,400
with data from tomtom for apple maps

00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:52,159
in 2010 excuse me 2019 facebook switched

00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,760
100 to osm data not because it is free

00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:56,000
but because it is the highest quality

00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,239
global cartographic data set available

00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,080
the user base is enormous and ranges

00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,680
from big corporations to a very long

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,560
tale of small users

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,120
at one end microsoft's bing uses osm

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,120
data

00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,400
and so does esri and then there's the

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,720
humanitarian angle

00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,640
exemplified by hot the humanitarian osm

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,560
team which over the last 10 years has

00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,280
saved lives by creating maps needed by

00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,239
rescuers

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,759
and medical personnel all with osm data

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:21,759
but that's only part of the picture it's

00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,680
not just the big guys using osm

00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,080
it's thousands of map creators

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,160
everywhere for whom osm is crucial

00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,840
and millions of users of the maps that

00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,880
they create from small companies like

00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,040
maps with me

00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,919
to individual cartographers from maribor

00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,199
to manila

00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:39,120
from krakow to cape town a map of the

00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:41,120
world that anyone can use

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,120
has spawned an ecosystem of commercial

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,440
and humanitarian organizations

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,639
that don't merely use our data they need

00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,440
it

00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,440
they live by it

00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,840
between the swot analysis and the many

00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,199
conversations with stakeholders in the

00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,280
osm community

00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,360
i have identified a set of opposing

00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:02,160
viewpoints that in their extreme forms

00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,039
cannot be reconciled this means that

00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,720
ultimately

00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:06,400
the community will have to make some

00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,000
decisions about which way to go

00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,000
in terms of a strategic vision or

00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,759
direction this slide shows

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,520
perhaps the most obvious of the opposing

00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,919
viewpoints i've heard or read

00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,520
with traditional osm views shown in red

00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:20,400
and advocacy for change

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,000
shown in blue who is supposed to

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,440
arbitrate between these two sets of

00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,960
opposing viewpoints

00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,280
this arbitration is the board's

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,680
responsibility and as a board member

00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,560
i have a fiduciary responsibility to our

00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,800
foundation

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,280
and through it to its members to protect

00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,520
the osm community's interests

00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,560
that means that i as a board member must

00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,320
pull the community

00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,919
and through that process must discern

00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,720
what decisions the majority

00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:46,320
of the community supports by law i

00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,400
really do not have a choice

00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,479
the board has to make decisions but the

00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,160
decisions we as board members make

00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,520
must reflect what the community wants

00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,520
osm to look like

00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,919
there's a very simple reason for this

00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,360
without the community there is no osm

00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:02,319
and a board that diverges from the

00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,720
community will endanger osm's future

00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,000
osm is the community and our map depends

00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,440
solely on the contributions

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,600
of data from that community

00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,639
i will not lead you through my analysis

00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,400
of the swot here

00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,240
simply because i cannot do that in the

00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,800
time allotted you'll have to visit the

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,199
wiki

00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,039
and read the swot for yourself if you

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,759
want to read my analysis of the swot

00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:25,280
send me an email and i'll send it to you

00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,960
however i would like to lead you through

00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,680
some highlights drawn from both the swot

00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,600
analysis

00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,600
and my more than 40 conversations with

00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:35,840
representatives of various factions

00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,840
within the osm community

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,440
the cognoscenti widely recognized that

00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,160
demand for osm

00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,039
services including tiles geocoding and

00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,000
geodata

00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,919
has outstripped the current

00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,520
configuration of hardware and software

00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,000
and is straining the volunteer labor

00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,800
force

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,639
particularly the sysadmins according to

00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,479
the operations working group this demand

00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:57,599
is growing at an astounding rate

00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:59,520
50 year on year

00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:01,840
our current configuration of hardware

00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:04,160
software and human beings operating and

00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,680
maintaining the hardware and software is

00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,919
not sustainable

00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,919
something has to give either the system

00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,360
will implode at some point or the osmf

00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:13,280
will take action to ensure that the

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,680
platform remains reliable

00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,440
this is the rub those who are screaming

00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,199
that the osmf board should not make

00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,400
decisions seem not to recognize that the

00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,280
world has changed

00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,840
and the demand for osm data is straining

00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:28,400
the system to the breaking point

00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:30,000
the cognoscenti also widely recognized

00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,360
that the operations working group has

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,960
collapsed

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,880
which they see as symptomatic of the

00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:38,080
increased demands placed on the hitherto

00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,680
100 percent volunteered duocracy though

00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,759
not universally held

00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,800
the view that osmf should begin to hire

00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,879
staff to augment

00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,960
to volunteer labor particularly

00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,479
sysadmins and a software developer to

00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,840
maintain the api

00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:53,520
is widespread notably individuals

00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,280
responsible for maintaining osm

00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,960
infrastructure specifically expressed

00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,680
that sentiment

00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,280
interestingly enough resistance to this

00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,199
notion appears to come from people

00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:06,080
not involved in operations or

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,840
maintenance of infrastructure

00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,680
multiple old-timers made comments the

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,680
effect that quote nobody envisioned

00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,599
osm's success unquote

00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,360
or as one of them put it osm shouldn't

00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:17,680
have worked but somehow it did

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,800
with lots of time effort emotion and

00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,560
pride

00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,639
one respondent commented that osm

00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,199
provides maps to two billion users per

00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,319
day

00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:29,520
yet has only two sysadmins to maintain

00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:31,520
the hardware several remarked that osm

00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,719
has outgrown the model of duocracy that

00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,320
carried it this far

00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,399
and opined that it needs a new

00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,919
management model one respondent

00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,440
highlighted the disconnect between

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,240
casual mapping and the size of the

00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,479
project

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,320
as it is today and noted that having

00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,160
grown from a smaller project

00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,560
and not especially geographically

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,680
diverse osm today requires greater

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,320
commitment

00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,200
another said more structure and more

00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,040
governance

00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,399
is required just because it's used more

00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,720
extensively

00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,560
put another way a respondent said growth

00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,519
and success have let it pass the type of

00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:05,760
individuals who started it

00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,920
countering that one respondent commented

00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,080
the catch-22 of osm is that actual

00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,680
mappers want a smaller osmf

00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,080
and don't want dependence on outside

00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,279
money one respondent perhaps captured

00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,760
this dilemma best

00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:18,640
super organization isn't necessary but

00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:23,279
anarchy

00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:25,360
is not an answer either

00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:27,279
the conversations reveal the desire for

00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,279
better communications between the board

00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:30,959
and the community's various tribes

00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,800
including working groups which can only

00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,440
be satiated by making the effort to

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,160
reach out

00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,680
to schedule calls and then just a call

00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,240
local communities and chapters in

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,399
particular

00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,320
would like better communication with the

00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,920
board

00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,440
geographic coverage of the current

00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,399
outreach effort remains a work in

00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,080
progress

00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,160
that said i must point out that the

00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,279
board has begun reaching out to local

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,360
communities

00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:55,760
and perhaps more important has begun

00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,480
working harder to process local chapter

00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,160
applications more quickly than before

00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,920
the board is also inviting a local

00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,480
chapter each month to brief us

00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,839
at the end of each board meeting

00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,920
surprisingly

00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,839
a desire for vector tiles came up 12

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,320
times in conversations tying for second

00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,959
place

00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,800
with community outreach some respondents

00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,519
merely see invector tiles a sign of

00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,760
progress

00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,839
that osm is keeping up with google but

00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:23,360
others seeing them a solution to desires

00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:25,120
such as multilingual standard maps

00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,360
while the tech wizards asserted that

00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,880
osmf hardware is adequate to host vector

00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,880
tiles at least initially

00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,120
surprisingly not one respondent could

00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,880
quote a solid cost estimate for shifting

00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,560
from raster to vector tiles

00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,320
nor could any respondent describe in

00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,760
brief a course of action needed to carry

00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,440
out such a shift

00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,839
time estimates range from a couple of

00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,680
weekends to six to eight weeks

00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,360
one major issue appears to be who would

00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,120
control the style sheets that determine

00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,720
which vector maps are displayed

00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,040
and some users in the commercial sphere

00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,720
expressed concerns that osmf's

00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,720
sponsored vector tiles would compete

00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,320
with their paid services

00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,640
in short though there is a strong

00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,079
indication that vector tiles are

00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,839
desirable

00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:05,920
there is a lack of consensus either as

00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:08,560
to how much would be too much

00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,279
and how much it would cost one

00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,040
respondent

00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,720
noted that there is nothing to stop

00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,480
local chapters or others

00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,079
from hosting vector tiles if they wanted

00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,760
to and suggested urging local

00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,959
communities and chapters to experiment

00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,519
with vector tiles

00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:24,880
before the osmf decides on the solution

00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,880
should it decide to do so

00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:30,880
respondents widely viewed the board as

00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,959
having failed to take responsibility for

00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,640
issues that have arisen

00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:36,079
one respondent asserted that the board

00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,720
has taken exactly one

00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:41,120
significant decision since 2010 the

00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,959
change of license to odbl

00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,640
one consequence of this is that third

00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,720
parties unaccountable to the community

00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,480
at large have filled some vacuums

00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,240
the board's conscious decision to take a

00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,000
hands-off approach to development of the

00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,639
id editor in particular

00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,920
is a flash point in this regard while

00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,680
some welcomed development of a

00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,360
user-friendly intuitive editor

00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:02,079
even if by a third party not under

00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:04,079
community influence ids tagging precepts

00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,519
have ranged concerns about perceived

00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,920
lack of community input

00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,040
into development decisions as one

00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,959
respondent put it

00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,560
key technology should be osmf's

00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:14,800
responsibility

00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,680
this is why the board has undertaken an

00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,240
effort

00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,399
to establish a software governance model

00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,800
for id that will allow community input

00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,440
on

00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,079
controversial aspects of id development

00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,920
surface

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:27,519
and to be taken into account without

00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,680
stifling the innovations that have made

00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,920
id such a fantastic editor

00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,279
and yes i'm showing my bias here i use

00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,320
id i use it a lot

00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:37,680
and i absolutely love it

00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,440
another respondent viewed this

00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,360
abdication of responsibility as a

00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,240
prelude to long-term death of the osm

00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,320
community

00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,480
as it pays the way for a backdoor

00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,160
corporate takeover of osm

00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,000
another respondent said bluntly that

00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,000
board weakness creates a power dynamic

00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,440
with outsiders who can pay workers and

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,120
then control it

00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,720
one respondent noted there is room for

00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,079
the board to be more assertive because

00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,000
of the threats out there

00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:02,720
the need to meet threats and challenges

00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,079
volunteers cannot do it themselves

00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,680
were the board to begin making

00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,720
substantive decisions in the opinion of

00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,320
some respondents

00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,639
another weakness would quickly become

00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,800
apparent as one put it the board has no

00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:15,200
real ability to put contracts in place

00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,000
to implement decisions the board this

00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,000
person said

00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,880
must either build capacity or let

00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,560
outsiders do it

00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,560
another issue is the board's failure to

00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,279
enforce its policies such as tile use

00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,040
policy

00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:29,040
which has led directly to a massive

00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,399
overload of osm's tile servers

00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,320
which according to the operations

00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,959
working group that peak loads respond to

00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,399
nearly

00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:38,000
400 000 tile calls per second

00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,600
respondents raised protection of the

00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,760
trademark a few times and thought that

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,600
previous boards had neglected it

00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,680
additional issues include failure to

00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,680
pursue community development

00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,360
a bias in favor of european points of

00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:52,720
view and failure to demand

00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:54,959
attribution for use of osm data

00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,680
however two prominent computer community

00:13:54,959 --> 00:14:00,959
members asserted that board inaction is

00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:03,360
quote the osm way unquote and indicated

00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:05,760
a desire to see the osmf board as a

00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:08,160
figurehead existing solely to fulfill

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:11,120
requirements of the company's act 2006

00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,800
and nothing more as one put it the board

00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,000
is to do the minimum necessary to keep

00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,600
osm running

00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
another expressed fear that a future

00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,639
board could quote go in a bad direction

00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,120
unquote

00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,240
and thus the precedent of the board's

00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,720
making decisions

00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,160
could bow deal the community will need

00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,959
to reconcile this divergence in

00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,000
attitudes

00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:32,160
one way or the other shifting

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,600
to the diversity question communities

00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,360
outside western europe

00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,279
generally welcomed the board's recent

00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,720
adoption of a diversity statement

00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:40,800
and formation of the diversity and

00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,800
inclusion special committee

00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:45,040
one community went so far as to say it

00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,959
was long overdue but still is not enough

00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,440
because local communities avoid speaking

00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:49,519
up

00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,279
out of fear of very vocal and hostile

00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,839
community members in other geographic

00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:54,480
areas

00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:56,240
shouting them down one respondent said

00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,600
bluntly that the diversity and inclusion

00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,360
special committee quote

00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,959
needs a space for discussions without

00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,680
being attacked unquote

00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:05,760
and cited a tendency to intimidate on

00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,839
the part of other community members

00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,600
in that regard multiple respondents

00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,079
called for a code of conduct of some

00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,480
sort

00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,120
to moderate dialogues and reduce the

00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,160
fear

00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,839
of hostile responses

00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,000
respondents in africa and asia

00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,920
underscored the cost of volunteering

00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,079
noting that in lower income countries

00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,920
the cost of internet access and the need

00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:28,000
to work more than one job to support a

00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,279
family constrains time devoted to

00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,120
volunteer mapping

00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,639
this is an obstacle to geographic

00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,480
diversity

00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,560
respondents see the fee waiver program

00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,279
for foundation membership positively in

00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,199
theory

00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:40,320
but in many minds its impact remains to

00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:42,240
be seen

00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,160
data users were surprisingly supportive

00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,759
of diversity because they see it as a

00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,240
source of data quality

00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:50,079
as one respondent put it quote mapping

00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,199
is somewhat subjective unquote so

00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:53,199
diverse mappers

00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,720
generate more diverse that is more

00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:56,800
complete data

00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,240
than does a white male-dominated mapping

00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,079
community

00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,800
many respondents complained of special

00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:04,079
interests steering or dominating issues

00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,959
to the detriment of the broader

00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:09,199
interests of the osm community

00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:10,880
as one of them put it if you let the

00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:12,959
loudmouths direct strategy

00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,079
nothing will happen another put it

00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:16,160
slightly differently

00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:18,240
use of the project is imperiled by a few

00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,399
loud voices

00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,399
on the other hand one respondent in

00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,800
europe criticized the board for focusing

00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,800
on

00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,079
political correctness by publishing the

00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:29,519
diversity policy

00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:29,519
and forming the special committee

00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:34,800
the sixth most raised issue revolved

00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,079
around artificial intelligence and

00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,759
machine learning

00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,680
with those in favor of incorporating

00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,560
them under human approval processes

00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,800
represented in

00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:45,680
asia africa and among the corporate

00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:47,600
members sponsoring those technologies

00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,800
opposition to artificial intelligence

00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,000
and machine learning seems to be

00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,399
concentrated in western

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,759
europe where it is viewed as of little

00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,680
utility

00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,279
support is found in geographic locales

00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,279
facing daunting obstacles

00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:01,680
high internet costs low internet

00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:03,519
penetration and low volunteerism

00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,039
the latter two often rooted in economic

00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:07,120
circumstances

00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:08,959
as one respondent put it bluntly our

00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,480
country is vast and we don't have enough

00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,319
volunteers to map all the roads and

00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,319
waterways by hand

00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:16,559
mappers in such circumstances appear to

00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:19,679
welcome ai tools as a way of increasing

00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:21,760
craft map or productivity

00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,439
interestingly the corporate members

00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,319
underscored the critical importance of

00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,799
local knowledge

00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:28,960
whereas one put it hey i can draw a road

00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:31,440
but only a local mapper can name it

00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,760
and you and i might add certify that

00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,919
it's a road and not something else

00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,600
another non-corporate respondent noted a

00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:39,280
growing proportion of data cannot be

00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,600
collected by armchair mapping

00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,200
we need on-the-ground knowledge

00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,039
corporate users who professed keen

00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,039
interest in improved data quality

00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:48,480
highlighted the role of ai in rapidly

00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:50,160
detecting vandalism

00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,480
so that the data working group and local

00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,640
mappers can react quickly

00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,480
while application of ai and machine

00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,200
learning is not a board issue strictly

00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,120
speaking

00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,320
but rather one squarely in the labs of

00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,160
the local communities

00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,320
each to decide within the framework of

00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,760
organized mapping guidelines

00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:09,120
its importance to certain local

00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,120
communities was striking

00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,880
as i start to wrap up this presentation

00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,480
i want to share some quotes that seem to

00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,960
strike a middle ground between the two

00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:21,280
extremes i showed you earlier

00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,440
the last quote hit me right between the

00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,679
eyes

00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,280
in researching the word cub past boards

00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,120
and the low level of decision making for

00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,960
the past decade it became apparent that

00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:33,039
in many cases the board shied away from

00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,280
making decisions that were expected to

00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:37,039
attract vocal criticism even if the

00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,240
number of critical voices itself was

00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,919
small

00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,000
just like there's no healthy democracy

00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:44,160
without a free press critical voices

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,160
have their place in a healthy community

00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,480
while some might suspect such voices to

00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,840
simply seek to impose their own views

00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,919
they can also have their fingers on the

00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:54,000
pulse of the community

00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:55,039
but the expectation of criticism even

00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,559
fierce criticism

00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:58,880
should not lead to a failure to make

00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:00,799
decisions on the part of the board

00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,400
as long as those decisions reflect the

00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:04,160
interests of the community as a whole

00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,120
and what's critically important of the

00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,840
osm project more generally

00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:11,200
anarchy is not healthy for any

00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:12,720
organization and it is my firm opinion

00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,240
that the elected board of directors of

00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,080
the usm foundation

00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,000
must make decisions that will ensure the

00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,160
continued health and stability

00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,080
indeed the very future of the usm

00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,600
movement all the while not telling

00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:26,480
anybody what to math

00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,480
or how to map

00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:32,480
these are the core values of osm as

00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:34,880
posted on the osm foundation's wiki

00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,320
i invite you to read them now and i have

00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,000
a request

00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,760
translate them into your native language

00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,960
if it isn't english and post them on the

00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,520
osm wiki

00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,200
if we bear them fully and firmly in mind

00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,480
we can more easily come to agreement on

00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,000
the decisions the community and the

00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,720
board are going to have to make over the

00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,440
next year

00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,120
the next two years the next decade we

00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,400
want to make the best map data set of

00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,320
the world

00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,400
we want the data to be available under a

00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,760
free and open license to everybody

00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,240
we want it to be powered by its

00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,919
community we want the data to be used as

00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,640
widely as possible

00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:08,000
we favor objective ground truth over all

00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,600
other sources

00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,120
and we want for you to map the things

00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,799
that you care about and we

00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:16,080
want to be able to ensure that you have

00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:16,080
the freedom to do so

00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,880
based on the core values these are

00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,480
examples of the types of questions the

00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,720
board needs to ask the community

00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,320
in my opinion if we're going to live up

00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:31,679
to our core values

00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,480
the board needs answers in most cases

00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:34,000
however

00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,840
the board will leave the answers to the

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,400
local chapters and communities

00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,840
to the degree possible i agree that osm

00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,120
should govern itself

00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,559
and that local communities in the

00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,080
volunteer working group should decide

00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:45,840
what works best for them and for the

00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,240
project

00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:50,159
but when it comes to existential issues

00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,559
such as maintenance of infrastructure

00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:53,600
such as expanding osm into spaces where

00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:55,520
it is not

00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,600
such as protecting our intellectual

00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,679
property the board must act

00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,760
if it is to live up to its

00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:02,799
responsibilities demand for osm data is

00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,039
growing 50

00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:07,200
year on year we need more money to

00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:09,600
ensure stability of our platform

00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,799
where will the money come from what

00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,440
risks do we face

00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:15,280
and how do we guard osm against them do

00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,799
we need to invest in a project to render

00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,720
vector tiles for example

00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:20,240
should we even do that or should we

00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,159
leave it to someone else to a local

00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,240
chapter or to a third party

00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:25,520
if we should do that should we limit

00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,159
access so we don't compete with

00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,679
commercial providers in the ecosystem

00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:31,360
the community is divided on these

00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:33,280
questions so the dually elected board

00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,400
has to decide based on a combination of

00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:37,120
community input

00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,440
and the board zone assessment of what is

00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,400
in

00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,200
osm's best interests not merely for

00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,960
survival

00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,840
but in order to thrive into the next

00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,840
vector

00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:52,480
i encourage you to make your voice heard

00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,679
join the osm foundations you can do it

00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,400
online

00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:57,840
once a member then join the osm talk

00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,760
mailing list and start sharing your

00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,600
expertise and ideas for making osm

00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:13,840
better and better for everyone

00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:13,840
i thank you for your attention

00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,880
okay so um that was the keynote from

00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:29,360
alan mustard um

00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,000
and i see you've been putting stuff in

00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:33,679
the

00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:37,039
um q a there

00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:40,320
so alan uh as keynote isn't

00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:43,360
there isn't a q a session but he

00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:46,720
does have a self-organized session um

00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:48,559
that's at 7 pm 1900 hours

00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,640
so you can go to the website look at the

00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:54,320
self-organized sessions there

00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:57,360
and join him he's doing a q a um

00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:59,520
as chair of the board which

00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,799
that talk kind of pushed some big

00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,039
questions

00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:05,520
on there um you'll get to see him face

00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:08,640
to face and that will be a live

00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:11,520
kind of chat um we'll make sure he can

00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:13,200
see those questions um so that he can

00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:15,919
maybe answer some of them there

00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,720
but i think he's opening up to any

00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:20,960
questions

00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:23,280
um that you might have um

00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,080
also on that talk it talked a lot about

00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,000
the

00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,280
history about open street map and the

00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,400
project um

00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:34,000
you might be interested that at 5

00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:37,480
15 this evening so 17 15.

00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:40,159
frederick rams talking about um

00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:41,279
misunderstandings uh in the history of

00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:43,679
osm

00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:45,120
that i think might bring some context to

00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:47,200
some of the things

00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:50,000
um or add on to some of the things that

00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:53,360
frederick talked about in that talk

00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:56,720
um now this is track one

00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:59,360
of states of the map 2020 um

00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,799
track two is about to start i think

00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,640
they're just trying to work out some

00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:05,440
technical difficulties

00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:07,279
um but there's about two minutes there

00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:10,080
until that starts

00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,960
um and yep you've got your questions

00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,440
there so

00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,400
and as i said we're talking on social

00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:21,360
media

00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:23,840
um there's twitter the hashtag sotum2020

00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:25,440
there's the telegram group we're using

00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:29,039
the old ones

00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,919
sotm 2018 because lots of people are

00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:34,480
there

00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:34,480
um and there's irc as well

00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,480
so if you uh want to come up on the

00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:42,159
microphone ask orally or if you want to

00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,960
type it if you prefer to type it go

00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:47,840
ahead and type it

00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:47,840
but uh we're open for questions

00:24:54,720 --> 00:25:00,000
i was hoping we could have kind of an

00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:03,840
oral q a here so uh

00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:07,120
um you should be able to

00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,120
come up on your microphones

00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:14,960
i'm looking for those some questions

00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,720
that were asked when your keynote uh

00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:20,720
session was going on i know

00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:22,880
that wasn't the intention of um this q a

00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,480
but i do like on there there's question

00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,799
number three which is uh

00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:29,600
i'm not sure who asked it but how are

00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:32,720
you ensuring the loud voices don't

00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:34,720
derail progress

00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,480
well i think this is one of the critical

00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:40,840
things has been the outreach

00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:44,880
to the community uh that we don't only

00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:45,600
uh look at the responses or to reactions

00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,159
or to

00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:49,520
uh suggestions by people who volunteer

00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:51,440
information

00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,799
i think it's been important that this

00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,919
board has been reaching

00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:56,559
out to people who have uh hitherto been

00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:59,760
silent

00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:00,799
quite frankly and have hesitated to make

00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,679
their voices heard

00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:05,840
so we're reaching out we're reaching out

00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:07,120
geographically we're reaching out to

00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:10,240
different strata

00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:11,520
of the community different corners of

00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,520
the community

00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:15,120
uh in hearing what more people have to

00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:17,600
say so i think

00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:19,600
i think that's tactically how we're

00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:21,600
approaching it now in terms of getting a

00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:24,000
sense of what the majority of the

00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:26,640
community thinks about an issue

00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,720
that's more difficult and we don't have

00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,159
the resources we don't have the time and

00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,520
i don't think the community has the

00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:34,640
attention

00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:36,960
to want to vote on every issue so

00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,679
uh there's going to be a certain amount

00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,400
of

00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:41,919
the boards simply going out talking to

00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,240
different corners of the community

00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:45,279
and then doing its very best to try to

00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,960
figure out hey

00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:48,720
what's what's best for the community

00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:51,440
what's best for the project

00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,240
and b uh what do people think is the

00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,559
best

00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,320
best path forward and whatever the issue

00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:58,000
is

00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,559
i'll go back and look at the pad here

00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,559
for a minute

00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,559
uh do we have a breakdown of osmf

00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,039
members by country or continent no we do

00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:07,440
not

00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:08,880
because i don't think we have those

00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:12,080
statistics

00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:13,440
we can go back and we can ask i can go

00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,480
back and ask but i don't think we've

00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:18,320
ever done a breakdown

00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,320
i've never seen a breakdown like that

00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:23,600
um

00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,960
okay someone has a question here i'd

00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,039
like to challenge the idea that

00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,039
decentralization and vision or opposites

00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:31,919
are incompatible

00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:31,919
um yeah

00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:37,440
i have no argument with that um they're

00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:40,880
not necessarily

00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:43,279
incompatible but we haven't had much of

00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:46,480
a vision up till now

00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:48,080
uh what led you to conclude that craft

00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,399
mappers are universally opposed to

00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:54,399
change while the commercial stakeholders

00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:58,320
universally want change um

00:27:54,399 --> 00:28:02,240
i don't think i came to that conclusion

00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,799
um you know when you're talking to large

00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,080
numbers

00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:08,799
of the of the community and and and

00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:09,120
trying to reach out across the community

00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:11,360
you

00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,159
draw some generalizations and so i've

00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,640
never said

00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:15,520
that all members of one particular

00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,320
faction

00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:21,039
believe a certain thing uh it's more

00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:24,399
along the lines of

00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:27,600
generalities and

00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:27,600
where we see things going

00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,840
um

00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:37,360
loud voices did you talk to any non-loud

00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:39,679
voices in your talks how did you choose

00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:42,159
between who to talk to and who not

00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:43,120
um i talked to all kinds of non-loud

00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:46,000
voices in my

00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:47,760
in my conversations and in terms of how

00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,880
did i choose them

00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:53,600
uh it's a it's a something called

00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,640
snowball sampling you start out talking

00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,279
to people

00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,000
you know about and then you ask them who

00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:00,080
else should i be

00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,679
talking to and they give you the names

00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:03,120
and sometimes emails and phone numbers

00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:05,840
of other people to talk to

00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:07,840
and it snowballs it gets bigger and

00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,360
bigger and then of course in geographic

00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:11,520
reach i reached out to the people i

00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:13,279
could find contact information for

00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,960
and who would respond to me i mean there

00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:16,559
were people i reached out to

00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,559
who never got back to me and i would

00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:21,520
still like to talk to them

00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:22,960
but uh it basically was a combination of

00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:25,279
recommendations

00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,640
from people you should talk to this

00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:29,360
person or

00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:31,200
my identifying people i wanted to talk

00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,720
to or groups that i wanted to talk to

00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,840
and reaching out to them and then they

00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,600
responded and were

00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:38,159
happy to give me an hour of their time

00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:39,600
which quite frankly is a gift you know

00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:43,039
someone talking to you for an hour

00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,039
that's that's a gift

00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:47,539
um

00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:47,539
[Music]

00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,640
you point out that the weight of

00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,240
someone's opinion voice should not be

00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,000
defined by its loudness

00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,760
what you think should be the criteria

00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,440
instead to decide what weight is given

00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:59,520
to opinions voiced by those in a

00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:01,279
position of making decisions

00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:03,919
you know this is uh this is an issue

00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:04,799
that is you bet you you face this

00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:06,399
decision

00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:09,120
no matter where you are whether you're

00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:11,840
in an ngo like the open street map

00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:13,600
foundation or whether you're in a

00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,960
private company or

00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:19,039
or whether you're in the government

00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:21,039
quite frankly to to whom do you listen

00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:22,880
and a lot of times you listen to the

00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:24,559
people who make the most sense

00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,480
you listen to the people who are clearly

00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:29,840
informed and the people

00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:32,240
who clearly have a sense of

00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:33,760
the reality of the situation how

00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,320
situations are changing

00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:37,919
how circumstances are changing uh if

00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,880
there's one constant in the world it's

00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,840
change

00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:44,240
and we need to adapt to those changes so

00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:46,080
i i think a lot of it comes down to

00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,840
having common sense

00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:50,720
uh on the part of the members of the

00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:52,960
board of directors of the foundation

00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:55,200
and we will listen to everybody but one

00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,799
of the axioms of leadership is listen to

00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,080
everybody but listen most closely to

00:30:56,799 --> 00:31:00,240
your best people

00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:02,000
so i think that's what we're trying to

00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,720
do we're trying to hear what everybody

00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:19,760
has to say

00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:21,840
because everybody has a perspective okay

00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:24,480
didn't intend to evoke laughter but i

00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,480
guess i did

00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:36,640
um

00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:39,519
let's see you've got a

00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,000
question in the um chat as well from

00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:42,080
done

00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,120
all right all right let me take a look

00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:46,620
at the

00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:49,690
question in the chat here um

00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:49,690
[Music]

00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,880
does osm keep very good backup so our

00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:57,360
recent edits don't disappear one day

00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,399
yeah we have pretty good backups of the

00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,840
of the data

00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:01,840
and there are multiple copies of the

00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:04,000
planet file too

00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,880
um is there a link to your talk and

00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,640
slides earlier

00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,159
i think there will be i don't have it up

00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:11,440
yet but i think i think the state of the

00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:15,200
map committee is going to do that

00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:19,360
um dorothea just posted that for you so

00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,679
that's up there see did i miss any in

00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,880
the

00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:24,640
in the chat no that's that's

00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,159
it on the chat i'll go back here to the

00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,519
pad then

00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:30,320
when you say the community do you

00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:32,720
include corporate voices in that

00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:34,399
uh this is a very interesting question

00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,240
simply because so many people

00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:39,519
in the community have tried to tell me

00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:42,799
who is in the community and who is not

00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:43,440
uh my view and this is my personal view

00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:45,279
my view

00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,120
is that the community consists of

00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:50,480
anybody who believes he or she

00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:52,799
is in a in the community

00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:54,840
so if you have people who say i am part

00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:56,159
of the osm community because i

00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:58,080
contribute

00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:00,960
mapping i contribute software

00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:03,760
development i contribute money

00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:05,840
i'm a member of the foundation uh for

00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:09,039
whatever reason

00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:11,120
i i think that anybody who

00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:12,240
thinks they are part of the community is

00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,240
part of the community

00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,919
and particularly it's important if they

00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,039
are a contributing member of the

00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:18,960
community

00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:20,720
so yeah i i would say yes i would

00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,240
include the corporate voices in that

00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:24,000
because the corporate voices

00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,519
are contributing they are contributing

00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
software development

00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:29,679
they are contributing mapping data they

00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,159
are contributing money

00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:33,600
uh so yes they are part of the community

00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:37,279
are they

00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:39,200
uh do they have a a larger

00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:41,440
voice in the community than anyone else

00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,519
i would say probably not

00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:46,080
they have a voice they have a point of

00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:47,600
view is their point of view the one that

00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:50,720
is going to prevail

00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:52,640
uh i would say probably not

00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:55,600
because the community is quite large

00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,600
it's quite expansive

00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:59,039
um

00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:07,360
let's see the full swot analysis

00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:09,119
yeah pretty much i think uh i'll have to

00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:11,919
go back and look at my diary

00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:14,159
and and see how extensive that is i

00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:16,159
think i have a little more extensive uh

00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:17,599
i have a more i do i have a powerpoint

00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:19,679
presentation

00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:21,280
uh on the swot analysis it's a little

00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:22,240
bit more extensive than that and i can

00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,159
send you that

00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:26,399
if if you're interested i didn't want to

00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:28,800
inundate people with that

00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:30,879
um but if you're interested in looking

00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,879
at my take on the swot analysis just

00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:34,879
email me

00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:36,000
and i'll i'll send you a copy of that

00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:38,240
powerpoint slide

00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,240
set

00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:46,839
a very long question here number nine

00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:48,879
uh regarding the role of businesses in

00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:54,320
osm

00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:54,320
global logic um

00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:58,320
i oppose corporate involvement in osm

00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,839
and osmf not just under the global logic

00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:03,200
model

00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:03,760
but also let's see where's the question

00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,440
where's the

00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,200
okay here's the question what measures

00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,400
can we have in place what is being done

00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,240
what can i do

00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,680
to ensure the osm project continues

00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:13,200
being open and volunteer driven while

00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:15,359
allowing for a healthy relationship with

00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,560
powerful corporations

00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:18,480
well i think there are two things two

00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:20,720
points i want to

00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:22,000
first of all i think uh one of the most

00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:24,400
important things we can do

00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,839
is empower the local chapters and the

00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:28,839
communities

00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:30,480
uh this is one of the reasons that this

00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:33,040
board is

00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:34,640
working as hard as it is to get more

00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:37,760
local chapters

00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:40,000
in under the osm umbrella to

00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,680
support local communities this is one of

00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,240
the reasons we've changed the membership

00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:45,119
criterion from contributing 15 british

00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,680
pounds

00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:48,800
to being able to do 42 days of mapping

00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,800
per year

00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,160
and that qualifies you for foundation

00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,079
membership so

00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:57,359
this will these sorts of things are

00:35:54,079 --> 00:36:00,720
broadening the base of the community

00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:03,760
geographically as well as in terms of

00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:05,359
socio-economic status and this is

00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,960
important because the broader the base

00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:07,680
of the community the harder it will be

00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,880
for someone

00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:13,520
uh come in and try to take over the

00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:16,800
project so that's the first thing

00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:18,560
um the second thing is i think it's

00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,760
important for us to understand what the

00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,920
motivation of

00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,359
companies and corporations is

00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,560
corporations and companies are about

00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:27,280
making money

00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:28,400
they want to turn a profit uh at least

00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,960
the ones in

00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,000
in the private sector that are that are

00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,520
about

00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,920
commercial activity i'm not talking

00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:39,119
about ngos

00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:40,320
uh the corporations we're dealing with

00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:42,320
right now

00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,839
pretty much understand our model they

00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,240
understand that we are a community

00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:45,920
driven

00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:47,839
organization they understand that we are

00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:50,560
volunteer driven

00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:52,240
so they're not about to touch the

00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:54,079
wellspring of the data

00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,760
that they find so valuable and i think

00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:57,920
this is the interesting

00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,040
part of being part of the osm community

00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:02,320
right now

00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:04,000
is that the data which are

00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:06,720
allegedly according to accenture are

00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,960
worth over a billion and a half dollars

00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:10,320
or at least they would cost let me

00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,920
recommend that they're not worth a

00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,119
billion and a half dollars i suspect

00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,720
they're worth more than that

00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:16,480
but it would cost over a billion and a

00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:19,359
half dollars to reproduce them if you

00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:22,400
went out and paid people to do it

00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:25,280
um these companies are not

00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,320
interested in messing with that model

00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,760
they're interested in

00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,839
getting their hands on the data and

00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:32,160
using the data and making sure that the

00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:35,520
data are available so

00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:38,079
i don't perceive a threat from

00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:40,160
those corporations that are right now

00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:42,000
using our data and are part of our

00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:44,480
ecosystem

00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,040
what i do see is a potential threat from

00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:48,160
somebody

00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:49,040
outside that group trying to come in and

00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:52,480
take over

00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:54,560
so that's that's the

00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:55,520
the threat that i perceive you may have

00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:58,000
you may uh

00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:59,440
perceive other threats but but that's

00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,720
what i'm guarding against and that's

00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:04,160
what i'm trying to

00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:04,560
to to create some some barriers to or

00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,400
some

00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:09,040
some sort of insurance policy that makes

00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:12,880
sure that that won't happen

00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:14,960
um you mentioned white male dominance in

00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,720
your talk

00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,320
does this race and sex gender in your

00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,920
opinion constitute the most severe and

00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:23,760
most significant dimensions in the lack

00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,760
of diversity in the osm community

00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:31,920
i don't know the answer to that question

00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:34,079
i don't know if it is the most severe or

00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:38,079
the most significant dimension

00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:42,079
i would argue that geographic diversity

00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:44,000
is probably just as significant

00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:46,000
and this is one of the reasons again

00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,160
that the board is pushing very hard to

00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:51,599
get more local chapters to

00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:54,400
to develop better connections to the

00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:58,480
local communities

00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:59,200
because we need we need more on the

00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:02,320
ground

00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:04,720
data collection we need more

00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,760
people in the community for a variety of

00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:08,480
reasons both

00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,520
to improve the database and to also to

00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,280
inoculate

00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:13,200
the organization against a hostile

00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:17,040
takeover from outside

00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:20,079
so uh that's a hard question to answer i

00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:22,800
i don't think that i can answer that uh

00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:26,000
truthfully but it is an issue and that's

00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,000
why i raised it in the talk

00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:30,240
you were speaking of uh opposition to

00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:31,920
machine learning and artificial

00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:33,520
intelligence in western europe could you

00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:36,880
elaborate on what this refers to

00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:38,880
this refers back to my conversations i

00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,920
talked to people in western europe i

00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:42,800
talked to people

00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:44,079
in asia especially east asia and south

00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,640
asia

00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:49,520
i talked to people in africa i talked to

00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:53,839
people in latin america

00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:56,880
in those geographic locations

00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:59,440
i did not hear opposition

00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:01,280
to machine learning or artificial

00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:03,520
intelligence and in fact

00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,880
in some of those places machine learning

00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:07,280
and artificial intelligence

00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:11,119
are viewed as necessary tools for them

00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:13,920
to do what they think they need to do

00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:14,560
and since we put a high premium on local

00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:17,040
mappers

00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:19,599
and the idea that local mappers should

00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:21,599
drive the project

00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:22,880
i listened to that i heard that and i

00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:25,200
carried that message back

00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:27,200
to the community at large through

00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,680
through my my diary entry and then in

00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:31,359
this

00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:32,800
this presentation um opposition

00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:34,800
to machine learning and artificial

00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,839
intelligence came exclusively from

00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,319
western european

00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:40,000
uh interlocutors i didn't hear it from

00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:43,359
any other geographic location

00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,359
and that's just what i'm telling you

00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:49,200
um question number 12 vector tiles

00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:51,040
have you asked current developers of

00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:54,079
community map styles on input in the

00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:56,240
future of community map design

00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:57,200
um it hasn't really gotten that far i've

00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,880
asked people

00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,319
when they've raised vector tiles well

00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,640
how do we do this

00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:03,680
i'm not a software developer i'm a

00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:06,480
mapper

00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:07,200
so i know how to map and and i can

00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:10,240
generate

00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:14,240
some very primitive uh raster maps using

00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:15,680
uh freeware but uh i'm not someone who

00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:19,200
actually even knows

00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:21,200
really what questions to ask so

00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:23,440
we haven't gotten that far in the in in

00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:26,400
terms of the discussion of vector maps

00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:28,319
and in terms of whether the osm

00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:32,960
foundation would pay people to work

00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:32,960
on development of vector maps

00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:38,160
um that's a possibility uh

00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,200
that that we would pay somebody to do

00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:41,359
that but i don't

00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,960
think i don't think the the foundation

00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:43,760
board is at a point yet where we're

00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,480
willing to

00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:48,160
to consider that seriously because we

00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:52,480
don't have a plan we don't have

00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:54,800
uh we don't really have a decision

00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:56,240
uh yet that that we want to go forward

00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,720
with vector maps and again that's

00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,839
something

00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,760
we really need to hear from the

00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:02,960
community

00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:04,400
does the community want us to do vector

00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:07,040
maps and if so

00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,920
what kind of vector maps and what should

00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:10,480
they look like

00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:11,119
and how extensive should they be and

00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:13,280
should we

00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:15,040
compete with the commercial ecosystem

00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,319
that is producing and selling vector

00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:19,200
maps

00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:20,640
i i really think i think there are a lot

00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:24,000
of questions that need to be answered

00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:24,000
before we go down that path

00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:28,880
uh question 13 lucky 13 what are your

00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:30,880
thoughts on user group instead of

00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,400
chapter in some countries running a

00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,839
government-approved legal entity like a

00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:36,160
chapter is very difficult

00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:38,000
yeah we've talked about that naveen uh

00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:39,280
and and you and i talked about this of

00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,440
course

00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:43,440
that is something that that we're going

00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:44,079
to look to the local communities to tell

00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:47,359
us how they

00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:50,160
want to associate with the foundation uh

00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:52,079
there is no one-size-fit-all and and

00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:53,200
india is not the only country where this

00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:54,800
is an issue this is

00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:56,480
this is an issue in other parts of the

00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:58,400
world as well so

00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:00,400
we really need to hear from the local

00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:02,800
chapters

00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:04,160
if for the local communities i should

00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:07,280
say if

00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:08,640
local chapter status is not something

00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:10,560
that works for you

00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:13,200
tell us what does tell us what would

00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,839
work and we'll try to figure out some

00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:17,359
way of

00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:17,359
making it work out for both of us

00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:27,119
question 14 what is the common goal of

00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:29,200
the osm

00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:31,520
well i think if you go back to look at

00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:33,040
the osm foundation website there's a

00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:36,560
line in there that says

00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:37,280
uh we want to create a map of the world

00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:41,119
that

00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:42,560
anybody can use and as frederick ram

00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:44,480
pointed out we aren't really building a

00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:45,200
map we're building a database from which

00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:47,680
you can

00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:48,400
project a map you can render a map which

00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:52,000
which

00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:53,040
is true uh he's absolutely right about

00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,680
that but of course

00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:56,160
if you try to say that our objective is

00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:58,800
to

00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:00,319
create a database from which anybody in

00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,599
the world can render a map you're going

00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:02,880
to lose your audience and

00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:04,640
they're going to really understand what

00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:06,800
you're talking about so

00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:08,800
we tend to oversimplify that statement

00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:10,240
but that's that's the common goal the

00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:14,079
common goal is

00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:15,040
is to create a map which is really a

00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:17,119
database

00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:20,960
from which you can create your own map

00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:24,880
that anyone can use free of charge

00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:28,720
so i agree with fred uh on on that score

00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:31,359
um unfortunately

00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:35,359
you can't take that and put it into one

00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:38,000
compact sentence so that sounds good

00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:39,520
uh question 15 with each image we set

00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,280
several meters different from each other

00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:43,760
the more we add the more damage we do to

00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:46,880
the map yes this drives me crazy too

00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:49,119
so yes please get some good data imagery

00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:50,319
well you know uh the imagery is pretty

00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:55,040
much all donated

00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:58,599
and this is something

00:44:55,040 --> 00:45:01,280
it has to do with the uh

00:44:58,599 --> 00:45:03,680
orthorectification of the imagery

00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:04,960
which is not 100 accurate that's why an

00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:08,000
id you can slide

00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:09,760
the map around to to fit and that's why

00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,839
i'm very glad that in my mapping of

00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:16,800
turkmenistan i collected an

00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:19,440
awful lot of gps excuse me gps traces

00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:20,960
so i have gps traces i can use to go

00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:23,119
back to truth back to

00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:26,079
in order to make sure that that the

00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:28,720
imagery is lined up with

00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:30,480
with the map i don't know if there's an

00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,520
easy solution to it because ortho

00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:36,480
rectification

00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:36,480
is kind of loosey-goosey at times

00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:47,839
uh questions asked during the q a

00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:47,839
uh let's see

00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:52,240
what are the threats to osm in the

00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:54,160
future presidential order shutting it

00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:55,440
down evil empires troops secretly

00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:57,680
deleting edits anything

00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:59,200
legal action from google for who knows

00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:01,200
what better back it up in several

00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:02,640
different jurisdictions

00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:04,240
yeah in terms of backup that is

00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:05,839
something that we're looking at as to

00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:07,920
where we need to have backups

00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:11,040
uh we're looking generally at what we

00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:13,839
need in the way of infrastructure

00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:14,880
and in terms of whether we need to start

00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:18,000
hiring

00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:20,240
uh people like sysadmins to augment our

00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,880
volunteer sysadmins

00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:24,319
uh where we're concerned about the

00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:27,599
infrastructure we're looking at this a

00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:31,119
little bit more broadly in terms of the

00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:35,440
the threats to osm i don't i don't

00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:38,960
see i don't see threats from google

00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:43,599
or from uh any of the evil empires out

00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:46,319
there trying to shut us down um

00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:48,240
again the major threat i would see is a

00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:49,760
potential hostile takeover

00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:51,599
from somewhere in the corporate world

00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:52,960
from somebody who is not currently part

00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:55,200
of our ecosystem

00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:56,000
and doesn't understand that a hostile

00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:59,200
takeover would kill

00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:01,839
the project so uh

00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,839
i think

00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:07,680
i just don't see i don't see a high

00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:09,599
probability threat

00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:12,400
all the threats i see are relatively low

00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:13,920
probability but potentially high impact

00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:15,680
and that's why we need to guard against

00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:17,839
them and we we're basically talking

00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:19,040
about low probabilities but high impact

00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:22,160
events

00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:22,880
and that's again this is this is what's

00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:25,200
behind

00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:26,720
my efforts and the board's efforts to

00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:29,119
expand the user base

00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:31,040
to to get more people into the osm

00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:33,599
foundation

00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:38,000
to get a broader base of local

00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:39,440
communities and chapters

00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,200
do you think the osm intellectual

00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:42,800
property is not currently protected

00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:45,520
enough from your comments in the talk

00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:48,800
earlier i think from a legal standpoint

00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:52,400
it's protected well enough i think uh

00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:53,760
we have the legal protections we need

00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:55,760
but i think we need to be more

00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:57,839
aggressive about defending them and in

00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:59,520
this regard i'm very happy with what one

00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:00,319
of our local chapters is doing and

00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:03,359
defending

00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:07,440
our intellectual property in

00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:09,440
in one of the countries of europe

00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:11,440
we have again this is something where

00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:12,160
the local chapters can be very helpful

00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:15,119
as well

00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:15,760
but if you see a violation of our

00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:19,599
license

00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:22,000
under the odbl take action

00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:22,880
and this particular local chapter came

00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:26,319
to us

00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:27,280
last year asked for a power of attorney

00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:31,440
to

00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:34,400
pursue a legal action in order to

00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:35,680
cause someone violating our license to

00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:39,280
come into compliance

00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:40,800
and is pursuing that so

00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:42,640
this is a good thing and i think i think

00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:44,319
we've been a little lax in the past

00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:46,839
about this i think i think it's good

00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:49,839
that we're protecting our intellectual

00:48:46,839 --> 00:48:49,839
property

00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:56,160
so that's that list let's go back to big

00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:58,400
blue buttons here there's some new ones

00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:58,400
here

00:49:00,839 --> 00:49:06,400
um

00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:07,680
let's see here uh should the board

00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:09,680
ensure that all continents are

00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:11,440
represented then

00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:16,559
uh janet what do you mean and

00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:21,680
represented where

00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:24,559
i uh oh in the board

00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:26,800
you know i don't i i worked in the us

00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:27,920
government where we had de facto quotas

00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:31,520
for years

00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:32,960
um officially there were no quotas but

00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:35,760
unofficially

00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:37,200
yeah we had quotas uh for hiring and

00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:38,240
things like that and it just never

00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:40,079
worked

00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:42,160
i'm not a big fan of saying oh we're

00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:44,160
gonna have one person from north america

00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:45,520
one person from europe one person from

00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:46,960
asia what not

00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:48,960
what i would rather see is i would

00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:52,000
rather see a more organic

00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:53,520
growth of of the geographic diversity on

00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,760
the board

00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:57,760
i would like to see more people actively

00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:58,079
involved in the working groups more

00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:01,200
people

00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:02,480
actively involved in

00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:04,720
some of the special committees that

00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:08,480
we're setting up

00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:11,680
and then see them run for the board

00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:13,599
so yeah i i don't think we should have

00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:16,079
quotas and say

00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:17,359
every continent will will be represented

00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:19,119
on the board

00:50:17,359 --> 00:50:21,359
i just don't think that's necessary and

00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:27,839
it's not going to lead to a good resort

00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:27,839
result um

00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:33,359
okay gee has asked what about sovereign

00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:35,680
international threats to osm are these a

00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:38,960
possibility in your opinion

00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:43,440
i suppose it's possible um

00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:47,359
i suppose it's possible that a uh

00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:52,480
a country could sue us because

00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:52,480
uh it doesn't like something in the data

00:50:53,040 --> 00:51:01,119
again i think it's a low probability

00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:01,119
um but i think it's something

00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:04,720
i think it would be very hard for a

00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:06,240
sovereign country to to

00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:08,240
pursue us on something like that

00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:11,520
particularly since

00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:13,040
uh the map is in a state of flux and

00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:14,800
you know it'd probably be easier for a

00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:17,119
sovereign country to

00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:19,930
unleash some mappers to go in and say

00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:21,040
we're going to change the map

00:51:19,930 --> 00:51:23,119
[Music]

00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:24,800
draw a different line of control or a

00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:25,280
different boundary or something like

00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:27,920
that

00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:29,920
and then tag it appropriately so that

00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:32,319
that

00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:33,920
as long as it doesn't run afoul of of of

00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:36,800
our general principles and how things

00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:40,079
should be tagged i

00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:40,079
i haven't gotten a whiff of that

00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,599
other questions

00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:52,079
go back to the pad

00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:08,559
okay here's a question in french which

00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:10,480
i'm going to have to run through

00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:12,079
i'm going to have to run up your dbl or

00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:19,839
something

00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:19,839
just a minute

00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:33,839
okay

00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:49,920
where did it go i don't see where the

00:52:48,319 --> 00:52:53,520
question went

00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:53,520
i clicked on translate and it

00:52:58,839 --> 00:53:01,839
disappeared

00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:14,319
i guess this is at the topic of what you

00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:16,400
do questions

00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:18,240
from time to time as in should the home

00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:20,079
page show something other than the map

00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:21,599
links to local communities what thoughts

00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:23,680
do you have on this

00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:26,720
is the microcosm's work in progress the

00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:26,720
start of something bigger

00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:32,079
um i don't

00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:38,800
i don't really have a view on that

00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:39,680
um you know i thought what what

00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:42,800
frederick

00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:43,200
said about what what what they've done

00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:48,000
in

00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:50,319
in vasquez uh was pretty interesting

00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,319
um

00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:55,359
i really did i don't have a position on

00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:57,520
that i i

00:53:55,359 --> 00:53:59,440
i think that that it would be good to

00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:01,359
have links to the local communities i

00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:03,920
like that that's available through the

00:54:01,359 --> 00:54:05,599
the the id editor for example that's

00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:08,880
really good that that information

00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:10,079
is there but in terms of whether we

00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:12,880
should do a revamp

00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:15,839
of the osm website so that it shows that

00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:18,559
information before it shows the map

00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:20,640
um i'll leave that to web designers and

00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:21,040
to to to people who understand that a

00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:23,040
lot

00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:24,720
better than i do to to come up with

00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:27,200
those suggestions

00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:29,440
uh i'm probably the wrong person to to

00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:31,119
ask that question of

00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:33,760
oh here's an interesting comment gee you

00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:36,079
talk like a ca ceo and i like that but

00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:38,640
ceos need big salaries i understand that

00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:41,760
you were just a volunteer so might i

00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:45,440
say osm is your hobby uh

00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:47,200
well uh i got involved

00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:50,720
if you've if you've seen the video that

00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:52,880
i did uh at state of the map 2016

00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:54,720
you know why i got involved in osm in

00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:56,960
the first place and if you've seen my

00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:59,359
uh banquet speech to the north american

00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:02,000
cartographic information society

00:54:59,359 --> 00:55:02,400
from last fall you can see where it led

00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,799
to

00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:06,559
uh that it became a little bit more than

00:55:04,799 --> 00:55:09,359
a hobby it

00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:12,319
actually became part of my work plan

00:55:09,359 --> 00:55:15,359
while i was ambassador to turkmenistan

00:55:12,319 --> 00:55:16,160
um ceos need big salaries well that

00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:18,240
would be nice

00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:19,599
but i'm retired now i'm living on my

00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:22,720
pension

00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:24,559
which is enough to live off of so um

00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:26,640
yeah i'm still a volunteer mapper i

00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:28,319
still work on the map of turkmenistan i

00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:30,559
still work on the map of falls church

00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:32,000
virginia

00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:34,319
if you go in and look at my edits you

00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:37,280
can see what i've been up to

00:55:34,319 --> 00:55:38,640
so is os10 my hobby yeah i guess at this

00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:42,960
point it is my hobby

00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:46,640
um and given that

00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:49,040
i'm under social isolation due to the

00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:50,000
covet 19 pandemic it's a pretty nice

00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:52,400
hobby

00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,680
lets me go to other places around the

00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:56,240
world and

00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:56,240
the internet

00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:01,200
so if you want to offer me a big salary

00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:03,040
for no work that

00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:06,000
would be wonderful but i don't think

00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:08,880
anybody's likely to do that

00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,880
other questions

00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:18,720
oh yost just pointed out we pay alan

00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:22,799
with tlc and the privilege to buy us

00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:26,559
beers yeah um

00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:28,000
so yeah

00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:29,760
they're all gonna collect on their beers

00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,680
one of these days

00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:34,480
anybody buddy anybody want to come up on

00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:45,839
the microphone and ask a question

00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:45,839
open mic

00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:59,839
no no open mic

00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:06,799
gee says i think we need to have a

00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:08,079
debate about the use of ai in the future

00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:11,200
of osm

00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:13,920
and discuss the benefits to the project

00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:15,200
uh you know my my stance on this has

00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:16,960
been that this is up to the local

00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:19,359
communities

00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:22,000
it's up to the local mappers this isn't

00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:26,079
something that i think the foundation

00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:27,520
really can touch simply because we don't

00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:30,640
tell anybody how to map

00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:34,079
and we don't tell anybody what to map so

00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:36,480
as as the as a board chair

00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:38,480
of the foundation i'm not in a position

00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:40,480
to say yes we should do ai

00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:41,680
no we should not do ai or we should

00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:44,799
restrict it or

00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:44,799
regulate it somehow

00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:48,799
this is really something that's up to

00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:51,760
the local communities

00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:52,880
to decide and then local mappers so if

00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:54,880
you want to have

00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:56,319
a debate on this i would say go ahead

00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:58,559
and have that debate

00:57:56,319 --> 00:57:59,920
but the debate should be should involve

00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:02,559
the entire community

00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:05,040
and should be is quite geographically

00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:05,040
diverse

00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:08,720
and ghee says i think it would be

00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:10,480
beneficial to assist with the tedious

00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:11,839
jobs such as plotting building outlines

00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:13,280
which take much time but offer

00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:15,520
advantages perhaps

00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:16,559
well there's that but you know when i

00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:19,920
talked to one of the

00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:22,160
local communities ghee their comment

00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:23,280
was that it's very helpful in drawing

00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:25,839
roads

00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:26,720
and drawing waterways in areas that have

00:58:25,839 --> 00:58:30,240
lots of

00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:34,799
roads and lots of waterways

00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:36,160
and my concern on that is that i can

00:58:34,799 --> 00:58:38,559
remember driving uh

00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:40,880
once in and out in the boondocks of one

00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:42,319
of the countries that i was assigned to

00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:43,760
and we thought there was going to be a

00:58:42,319 --> 00:58:45,280
road that would go off to the right that

00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:46,799
would take us where we wanted to go and

00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:47,280
we got there and there was no road there

00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:49,760
it was a

00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:51,200
it was a creek and we couldn't drive in

00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:53,760
the creek obviously

00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:55,599
uh but somebody had an armchair mapper

00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:57,760
had added this road where there was no

00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:59,599
road where it was a creek instead

00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:01,119
and i found this in turkmenistan too

00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:02,720
when i was in turkmenistan that there

00:59:01,119 --> 00:59:04,720
were armchair mappers who had drawn

00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:08,400
things that simply didn't exist

00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:10,000
i had to correct them so i think i think

00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:11,359
there's a place for ai

00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,119
i think there's a place for machine

00:59:11,359 --> 00:59:16,079
learning but i think that that place

00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:18,720
needs to be coordinated on the ground

00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:21,839
local knowledge

00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:24,880
because only a local mapper

00:59:21,839 --> 00:59:26,559
can tell you if what you are looking at

00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:28,079
is is really what you think you're

00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:30,400
looking at

00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:30,400
and

00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:34,640
and one interesting thing i want to

00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,799
share too

00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:37,839
is was in my conversations with the

00:59:36,799 --> 00:59:41,359
advocates for

00:59:37,839 --> 00:59:42,960
ai uh their insistence that it must be

00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:45,920
combined with local knowledge

00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:47,680
because the on the ground knowledge is

00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:49,680
is key

00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:51,280
one person put it this way we can we can

00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:53,280
build the christmas tree

00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:55,599
but someone else has to decorate it for

00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:57,040
us you know we can draw the outlines but

00:59:55,599 --> 00:59:58,960
somebody has to tell us what they

00:59:57,040 --> 01:00:02,000
actually represent what's inside

00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:04,799
so so yeah i think a debate would be

01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:06,720
would be healthy it would be useful but

01:00:04,799 --> 01:00:10,000
i think it has to incorporate

01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:10,559
uh geographic diversity as well as a lot

01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,680
of

01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:14,400
of a lot of discussion of what the

01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:18,799
benefits

01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:20,480
versus versus the the dangers are

01:00:18,799 --> 01:00:23,680
okay i've got a little thing here saying

01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:23,680
there are more questions

01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:29,119
i'll jump into if your offer of open

01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:38,400
the uk can you hear me okay yeah

01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:39,760
so you used the phrase a couple of

01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:41,920
moments ago in answering that

01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:44,720
previous question um i think the phrase

01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:47,839
was debate with the entire community

01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:49,119
i find it very hard to judge the opinion

01:00:47,839 --> 01:00:50,559
of the community and

01:00:49,119 --> 01:00:52,400
even to follow all the different

01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:54,640
communication channels and

01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:56,480
that's just the ones you know in one

01:00:54,640 --> 01:01:00,000
language that alone throwing in

01:00:56,480 --> 01:01:02,559
a diverse set of languages into the mix

01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:04,319
so i just wondered if you wanted to

01:01:02,559 --> 01:01:06,079
expand on that a little bit as to

01:01:04,319 --> 01:01:07,359
yeah if we are having these really

01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:09,520
difficult conversations about things

01:01:07,359 --> 01:01:12,799
like ai how do we

01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:14,960
ensure that we are getting a full

01:01:12,799 --> 01:01:16,640
debate across the entire community and

01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:18,160
that we're

01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:19,839
working together to try and find

01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:21,440
consensus rather than

01:01:19,839 --> 01:01:23,119
just opposing opinions in different

01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:23,599
places and not actually sharing that

01:01:23,119 --> 01:01:26,640
across

01:01:23,599 --> 01:01:28,160
different channels or forums

01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:30,559
yeah well this is one of the big

01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:32,720
challenges of of

01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:34,000
osm and and the community is the fact

01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:35,440
that we are not only dealing with

01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:38,079
different languages we're dealing with a

01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:39,920
lot of different communications channels

01:01:38,079 --> 01:01:41,839
uh maggie cawley had did a great

01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:44,000
powerpoint presentation at state of the

01:01:41,839 --> 01:01:45,680
map africa a few years ago showing how

01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,720
many different communication channels

01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:48,559
there are

01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:50,480
i highly recommend her powerpoint

01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:52,400
presentation on that to just give you an

01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:55,760
idea of the complexity

01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:57,760
of that task so

01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:59,760
for example if you want to talk to osm

01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:01,520
japan you don't talk to osm japan

01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:05,359
in the mailing lists you talk to us in

01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:07,359
japan on facebook and then slack

01:02:05,359 --> 01:02:09,839
that's that's what they use pretty much

01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:11,920
exclusively and they communicate 100 in

01:02:09,839 --> 01:02:15,359
japanese they don't communicate in

01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:18,400
any other language so that's just one

01:02:15,359 --> 01:02:20,640
example there are other examples as well

01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:22,480
so i think it's going to take a lot of

01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:23,200
effort and anybody who wants to

01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:26,960
undertake

01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:30,559
a community conversation on ai

01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:32,079
and on on machine learning needs to bear

01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:32,640
in mind you're going to have to do some

01:02:32,079 --> 01:02:35,039
outreach

01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:36,000
you can't just send out a broadcast

01:02:35,039 --> 01:02:37,920
message over

01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,520
one of the talk lists and say we're

01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:40,400
having this discussion we're having this

01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:43,039
debate

01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:44,480
please join us join in with us and and

01:02:43,039 --> 01:02:46,160
let's talk about it

01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:48,720
you're going to have to identify the

01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:50,559
communities what channels they use

01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:52,559
you're going to have to translate your

01:02:50,559 --> 01:02:53,440
message into their language and send it

01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:54,640
out to them

01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:57,039
and then you may have to pick up the

01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:59,119
phone and call them and ask them

01:02:57,039 --> 01:03:00,160
did you receive my message are you

01:02:59,119 --> 01:03:02,240
thinking about it

01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:03,359
how soon can we expect a response from

01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:04,799
you

01:03:03,359 --> 01:03:06,480
and this was one of the interesting

01:03:04,799 --> 01:03:08,160
things when i started my outreach in

01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:10,000
january of this year

01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:11,440
calling different communities calling

01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:15,039
different uh

01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:16,000
individuals the reactions that i got

01:03:15,039 --> 01:03:17,760
were quite interesting

01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:19,119
in some cases of people saying well this

01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:21,760
is the first time we've ever gotten a

01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:23,920
phone call from a member of the board

01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:26,079
asking us our opinion this is the first

01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:28,160
time anybody's contacted us

01:03:26,079 --> 01:03:29,760
which tells me just how badly fragmented

01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:33,520
the community is

01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:35,200
so it's not a trivial task it will not

01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:36,799
be a trivial undertaking and you're

01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:38,559
absolutely right

01:03:36,799 --> 01:03:40,799
it's something that needs to be done we

01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:42,000
need to have a conversation about ai and

01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:43,920
machine learning

01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:47,200
and in terms of where it comes out i

01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:50,559
think it's going to come out probably

01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:51,280
based on what what each local community

01:03:50,559 --> 01:03:53,520
wants

01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:54,319
uh you know if if western europe doesn't

01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:57,200
want a.i

01:03:54,319 --> 01:03:58,000
and western europe then ai will stay out

01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:59,680
of western europe

01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:02,240
because the local mappers won't accept

01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:05,119
it but if local mappers in

01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:06,160
parts of asia want to use ai and machine

01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:08,079
learning

01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:09,440
then i suspect it'll happen it'll be

01:04:08,079 --> 01:04:10,880
used and and

01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:13,839
there may be parts of asia where it's

01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:13,839
not used

01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:19,440
but i really i really see this as

01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:22,240
as something that is the domain of the

01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:22,240
local mappers

01:04:25,839 --> 01:04:28,480
other questions

01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:32,480
and thanks for coming up on open mic

01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:41,839
anyone else for open mic

01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:52,319
let's see someone wrote trick menacing

01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:53,440
boy i bet they clamped down in their

01:04:52,319 --> 01:04:56,720
national data bad

01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:59,839
yeah it's hard to get good data out of

01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:59,839
out of turkmen understand

01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:06,799
what do you do when you can't zoom in

01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:08,319
past zoom level x and can't convince the

01:05:06,799 --> 01:05:11,599
carto people that people think their

01:05:08,319 --> 01:05:11,599
mouse must be broken

01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:23,839
well you just go to another geographic

01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:23,839
location and map there i guess

01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:34,319
kristoff did you mean that as a joke

01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:36,640
might be a good idea to reread the whole

01:05:34,319 --> 01:05:51,839
question on pat padre western europeans

01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:51,839
and ai mapping

01:06:02,079 --> 01:06:19,839
which one was that kristoff which which

01:06:04,799 --> 01:06:19,839
which question number

01:06:31,599 --> 01:06:35,760
yeah let me see if i can find that

01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:35,760
kristoff

01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:47,839
oh let's see

01:07:01,039 --> 01:07:04,319
okay here's here's the question okay

01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:05,599
question 11. you were speaking of

01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:07,039
opposition to machine learning and

01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:08,480
artificial intelligence in

01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:10,000
western europe can you elaborate on what

01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:12,000
this refers to is it possible that you

01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:13,359
have misunderstood opposition

01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,960
to a certain practice of using

01:07:13,359 --> 01:07:16,079
technology to generate data with

01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:18,079
questionable collection to the

01:07:16,079 --> 01:07:19,280
observable reality and no or limited

01:07:18,079 --> 01:07:20,960
control of the mappers over the

01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:22,960
technology it's principle

01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:25,280
opposition to a technology in general

01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:27,280
here no i don't think so

01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:28,559
i don't think i've misunderstood it

01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:31,839
kristoff and

01:07:28,559 --> 01:07:34,960
i think i think the key here

01:07:31,839 --> 01:07:36,559
is again that it has to be a decision of

01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:37,200
the local mappers and if the local

01:07:36,559 --> 01:07:38,799
mappers

01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:40,400
are in control of the use of the

01:07:38,799 --> 01:07:43,680
technology and

01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:45,440
are able to exert quality control over

01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:49,119
it so that

01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:52,480
a ditch that is in reality a ditch

01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:54,720
but which ai misinterprets as a road

01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:56,240
does not get drawn as a road you have

01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:57,920
someone on the ground

01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:59,680
uh in the local mapping community who

01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:01,520
looks at it and says no that's a not a

01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:01,839
road that's a ditch we're rejecting that

01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:04,160
so

01:08:01,839 --> 01:08:06,000
really i don't think there's

01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:07,599
disagreement here on philosophical

01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,480
grounds i think it's more along the

01:08:07,599 --> 01:08:11,280
lines of

01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:15,280
who's in control of the map and the

01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:15,280
local mappers are in control of the map

01:08:16,159 --> 01:08:21,600
um the debate regarding paid mappers is

01:08:20,159 --> 01:08:23,120
an interesting one that came up last

01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:24,719
year at state of the map with the idea

01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:26,000
that in developing countries this could

01:08:24,719 --> 01:08:27,600
be useful

01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:30,000
we need to be able to finance it too and

01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:32,080
have mappers would that be

01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:33,600
would that be advocates to assist

01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:36,480
perhaps

01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:36,960
um i can only give you my personal point

01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:39,440
of view

01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:41,440
on paid mapping i can't really speak for

01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:44,080
the board or for the community or for

01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:47,199
anybody else

01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:49,359
uh my view is is that the foundation

01:08:47,199 --> 01:08:51,600
should not pay for mapping

01:08:49,359 --> 01:08:53,600
uh there have been people i've conversed

01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:55,520
with in my conversations who have

01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:57,279
advocated for that who've said that we

01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:58,159
need to do paid mapping in certain parts

01:08:57,279 --> 01:08:59,839
of the world

01:08:58,159 --> 01:09:02,319
and that the foundation should pay for

01:08:59,839 --> 01:09:05,359
it i disagree with that

01:09:02,319 --> 01:09:07,920
um it is on one of my slides because it

01:09:05,359 --> 01:09:10,560
was part of the information i collected

01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:12,400
but my personal view is that if we're

01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:14,719
going to maintain

01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:16,239
a policy that the foundation does not

01:09:14,719 --> 01:09:18,799
tell anybody what to map

01:09:16,239 --> 01:09:20,080
or how to map then the foundation cannot

01:09:18,799 --> 01:09:22,239
pay for mapping because

01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:24,000
as soon as we start paying for mapping

01:09:22,239 --> 01:09:24,799
we start telling people what to map and

01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:27,920
how to map

01:09:24,799 --> 01:09:31,040
and and that is a red line to me

01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:32,560
so uh if other people want to pay for

01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:35,759
mapping

01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:38,400
whether it be ngos uh

01:09:35,759 --> 01:09:39,359
whether it be private corporations

01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:41,120
that's up to them

01:09:39,359 --> 01:09:43,199
and the local communities they need to

01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:44,960
discuss that with the local communities

01:09:43,199 --> 01:09:46,560
they need to work out the protocols with

01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:50,080
the local communities

01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:52,719
work out quality control uh

01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:54,800
all that needs to be done but i don't

01:09:52,719 --> 01:09:58,719
see a role for the foundation

01:09:54,800 --> 01:10:00,400
in paying for mapping um and that's

01:09:58,719 --> 01:10:01,840
you know you can disagree with that and

01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:02,880
there i'm sure there are people who

01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:06,159
disagree with that

01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:08,000
but uh because they told me so but uh

01:10:06,159 --> 01:10:12,480
that's where i come down on the

01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:12,480
foundation and paid mapping

01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:20,640
um

01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:21,440
can i ask the question yeah sure who is

01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:24,000
this

01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:24,000
this is craig

01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:30,000
um it talked a bit about you doing

01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:32,320
mapping as a hobby and you referred to

01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:33,199
your talk which i put linked to in the

01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:36,480
pad in

01:10:33,199 --> 01:10:38,080
2016 um i remember you talking very

01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:40,159
passionately about that

01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:42,000
um and when before you were doing your

01:10:40,159 --> 01:10:44,640
talk you talked to me and i

01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:47,040
had to say this great chat but you need

01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:50,320
to go do your talk in two minutes

01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:52,159
um so i just wondered since 2016 you're

01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:54,000
you're obviously retired now and not in

01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:57,199
um

01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:58,719
but have you connected to that community

01:10:57,199 --> 01:11:01,440
and to the mapping

01:10:58,719 --> 01:11:02,560
um and is there any update to what's

01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:07,120
happening

01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:07,120
in open street map in mexico now

01:11:07,199 --> 01:11:10,960
well i i am still in connection with

01:11:09,199 --> 01:11:12,239
people back there there isn't really a

01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:14,080
community

01:11:12,239 --> 01:11:15,679
in turkmenistan because it's a police

01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:18,719
state and

01:11:15,679 --> 01:11:20,320
uh ngos are frowned upon

01:11:18,719 --> 01:11:22,239
and are tightly controlled by the

01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:25,040
government so there there is not really

01:11:22,239 --> 01:11:25,679
an organized community of osm mappers

01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:29,440
but

01:11:25,679 --> 01:11:29,440
i am in touch with some of the mappers

01:11:30,239 --> 01:11:36,960
i do still get some data from them

01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:38,560
and help them with mapping because of

01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:41,199
the bandwidth limitations and

01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:43,199
difficulties that they have

01:11:41,199 --> 01:11:44,320
uh in in just simply getting things on

01:11:43,199 --> 01:11:47,520
the map sometimes

01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:49,840
so i am still mapping i also while i was

01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:50,560
there i collected a voluminous amount of

01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:52,320
data

01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:54,880
that i did not have time to put on the

01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:56,800
map i simply collected the raw data

01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:58,480
and brought it out with me and so i have

01:11:56,800 --> 01:12:00,719
been mining that

01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:03,440
and improving the map using data that i

01:12:00,719 --> 01:12:06,640
collected before departure a year ago

01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:07,679
so yeah that that effort continues uh at

01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:10,480
this point

01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:12,400
i have identified all cities in

01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:14,960
turkmenistan i have identified

01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:16,239
all but four towns and and these are

01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:18,320
defined by statute

01:12:16,239 --> 01:12:20,000
turkmenistan has laws that define what

01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:22,960
is a city what is a town

01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:24,480
what is a village we have identified

01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:28,800
over 500 villages

01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:28,800
out of roughly 1 700.

01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:33,120
we have come pretty well completed the

01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:36,320
national highway network

01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:38,480
and just continue to to to build this

01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:40,800
out and what is gratifying to me is

01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:44,000
seeing how local mappers

01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:44,800
when we create a village or a town or a

01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,719
city

01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:48,719
and draw the streets they go in and fill

01:12:46,719 --> 01:12:50,640
in the blanks they add the businesses

01:12:48,719 --> 01:12:51,760
they had their own little bed and

01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:53,760
breakfast places

01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:54,960
they they had their little hairdressing

01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:58,239
salons

01:12:54,960 --> 01:13:00,159
um they're they're really using the map

01:12:58,239 --> 01:13:01,920
it's not just a static map that sits

01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:03,199
there they're actually adding detail to

01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:04,960
it so that's

01:13:03,199 --> 01:13:06,640
that makes me feel good that i can i can

01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:07,600
go in and do some of the heavy lifting

01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:09,520
and actually

01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:12,719
creating the christmas tree and then

01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:12,719
they come in and decorate it

01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:19,760
great you almost got me worried

01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:20,480
when you kind of stop having any data

01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:23,360
that

01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:24,000
took mixed on that stop up stops being

01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:26,480
updated

01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:28,000
but um it seems that there is some

01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:30,159
activity

01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:32,000
there is a fair amount of activity uh

01:13:30,159 --> 01:13:34,640
it's not as robust a community

01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:35,840
obviously as uh the communities and in

01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:37,760
other parts of the world

01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:40,239
again because of bandwidth limitations

01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:43,280
the high uh cost of the internet

01:13:40,239 --> 01:13:45,280
and and simply uh the fact that it's

01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:47,840
it's a police state which tends to

01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:50,719
suppress that sort of community-based

01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:52,080
organization but but there is still some

01:13:50,719 --> 01:13:54,880
stuff going on

01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:54,880
and it's good to see

01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:58,640
uh someone asked a question erica asked

01:13:57,360 --> 01:14:00,640
a question does that mean you do not

01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:03,600
support the microgrants no i

01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:04,800
voted for the microgrant program and in

01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:07,920
fact

01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:11,520
when the microgrant program was

01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:13,440
first proposed we gave a

01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:16,480
limit of 10 microgrants to the

01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:16,480
microgrant committee

01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:20,880
and said we would only fund up to 10

01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:22,800
well they came back with

01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:24,080
with a total of 13 that they wanted to

01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:27,360
fund

01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:31,520
we said fine we'll do 20

01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:34,880
over and we approve 12 out of 10.

01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:43,840
so yeah i

01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:43,840
i support the microgrant program

01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:47,679
more questions

01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:57,840
go back to the pad see if there's

01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:57,840
anything new there

01:15:18,239 --> 01:15:21,280
one person put a comment here that there

01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:22,719
should have been a photo of the speaker

01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:25,120
in my presentation

01:15:22,719 --> 01:15:26,560
i dispensed with that because uh quite

01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:30,239
frankly

01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:32,719
um i'm not the most attractive person in

01:15:30,239 --> 01:15:34,320
the world so i don't think

01:15:32,719 --> 01:15:36,239
you need to look at my picture in the

01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:38,159
presentation i want you to focus on what

01:15:36,239 --> 01:15:41,040
i was saying anyway

01:15:38,159 --> 01:15:41,040
any more questions

01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:53,840
we're coming up on the top of the hour

01:15:43,199 --> 01:15:53,840
so we'll be wrapping this up fairly soon

01:15:55,600 --> 01:16:07,840
no more questions nobody wants to come

01:15:57,360 --> 01:16:07,840
up on open mic

01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:26,800
nobody else has a question gosh

01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:35,840
well somebody's typing all right so

01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:35,840
we've got a couple people typing

01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:41,360
uh rob's asking what does the next 12

01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:44,000
months look like for the board

01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:45,840
i think i think a couple of things that

01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,880
the board is going to be focusing on is

01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:50,560
the question of whether

01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:54,800
we should hire hire some people

01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:56,239
to maintain the infrastructure um

01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:57,679
that's a that's something that the board

01:16:56,239 --> 01:16:58,400
needs to grapple with we're very

01:16:57,679 --> 01:17:02,000
concerned

01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:03,440
about uh

01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:06,880
the fact that we're down to two sis

01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:09,360
admins both volunteers

01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:10,640
who are in charge of managing over 90

01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:15,440
servers

01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:15,440
uh spread across multiple sites

01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:20,400
there are just we're we're looking at

01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:22,640
some infrastructure issues

01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:24,400
uh particularly in the face of 50

01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:27,600
year-on-year growth for demand

01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:31,040
of of osm data

01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:33,360
um what do we need to do to ensure that

01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:36,000
the platform remains stable

01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:37,040
that the platform remains robust and

01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:39,040
that the platform

01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:41,040
is going to be there when people want it

01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:43,280
to be there whether that's

01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:45,679
mappers like me who are we i want the

01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:47,520
platform there so that i can map

01:17:45,679 --> 01:17:49,360
uh other people want the platform there

01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:50,480
so they can download the data and can

01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:54,320
use the data

01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:56,960
so i think

01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:58,000
i think that's that's one of the big

01:17:56,960 --> 01:18:00,640
issues we're going to be looking

01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:02,159
at is should we hire people and if so

01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:03,600
how would we go about doing that what

01:18:02,159 --> 01:18:05,840
would that look like how would it be

01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:08,000
financed how would it be funded

01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:09,360
is the money out there can the money be

01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:12,800
collected in a way

01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:14,960
that insulates the foundation from

01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:16,080
pressure from the donors and things like

01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:17,520
that so

01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:20,000
these are the questions i think that

01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:22,640
we're going to be looking at

01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:23,920
that's probably the top priority the

01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:26,320
second priority

01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:27,360
i would say is the continued geographic

01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:30,640
expansion of

01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:32,640
of the community and getting more local

01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:33,520
chapters and where local chapters are

01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:35,280
not possible

01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:38,840
have local communities with some sort of

01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:41,280
an affiliate status

01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:43,600
so that

01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:44,960
that i would say that's going to be

01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:55,840
plenty for us to work on

01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:55,840
over the next next 12 months

01:18:57,199 --> 01:19:01,199
uh would you like to see a third-party

01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:03,520
google maps competitor osm site do you

01:19:01,199 --> 01:19:09,199
see this being run by osmf any day

01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:11,520
or get an openstreetmap.org subdomain

01:19:09,199 --> 01:19:11,520
um

01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:18,400
are you talking about a commercial site

01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:20,159
like google maps

01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:23,840
is that what you have in mind something

01:19:20,159 --> 01:19:23,840
that's not free

01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:30,080
yeah i i don't see the foundation doing

01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:34,320
that

01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:36,120
um you know there has been one fork of

01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:39,600
the project

01:19:36,120 --> 01:19:42,800
fosm.org um

01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:45,840
but i i don't see us going

01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:49,520
going the route of a a commercial fork

01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:52,239
that would compete head-on

01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:54,000
on with google what what are you talking

01:19:52,239 --> 01:19:56,239
about you say not really commercial but

01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,239
what

01:19:56,320 --> 01:20:05,840
what does that mean

01:20:06,159 --> 01:20:09,040
yeah i uh

01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:20,880
yeah i guess i'm out of my depth on on a

01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:22,159
question like that it's not something

01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:24,080
that the board has thought about it's

01:20:22,159 --> 01:20:25,199
not something we've we've thought about

01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:28,080
it's not something that's under

01:20:25,199 --> 01:20:28,080
consideration

01:20:31,199 --> 01:20:35,280
that said i mean uh projects are

01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:36,880
eminently forkable if you want to fork

01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:38,320
the project and do something as long as

01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:41,040
you're in compliance with the license

01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:41,040
you can do that

01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:47,840
more questions

01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:55,199
now people are typing

01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:03,760
going back to the pad there uh

01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:09,199
i don't see any questions back there so

01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:10,719
we're very close to the top of the hour

01:21:09,199 --> 01:21:13,760
if there are no further questions

01:21:10,719 --> 01:21:16,320
uh ogui is typing something

01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:17,920
he and gregory are both typing something

01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:21,120
so we'll wait for their questions and

01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:21,120
then i think we'll wrap it up

01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:25,040
really good to consider the long-term

01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:25,920
strategy it will evolve i'm sure thanks

01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:28,639
for the talk yeah

01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:29,920
well you're welcome and and we really uh

01:21:28,639 --> 01:21:31,440
we really would like to hear from

01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:34,719
everybody in the community

01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:35,920
what your thoughts are how we should

01:21:34,719 --> 01:21:39,920
evolve

01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:41,760
um we can't afford to stagnate

01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:43,840
we do need to evolve we do need to look

01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:45,760
at the the problems that we're facing

01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:47,280
and figure out how to solve them gregory

01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:48,560
is typing something and i think we'll

01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:50,239
take that

01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:57,840
whatever gregory is typing and then we

01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:57,840
will wrap up

01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:11,840
type faster gregory

01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:21,360
have you had difficulty learning how to

01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:21,360
communicate with the community

01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:29,600
um

01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:33,040
not really um

01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:34,320
you know i was a diplomat for uh 34

01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:38,080
years

01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:40,719
um i lived in multiple continents

01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:41,679
and i've dealt with people from all

01:22:40,719 --> 01:22:45,120
walks of life

01:22:41,679 --> 01:22:46,800
so actually

01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:48,560
this is one of the more homogeneous

01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:50,239
communities because

01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:52,000
most the vast majority of the people in

01:22:50,239 --> 01:22:55,120
this community are are

01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:57,280
involved in technology and so uh people

01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:58,960
involved in technology

01:22:57,280 --> 01:23:00,880
tend to have higher than average

01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:02,320
intelligence they tend to have higher

01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:04,000
than average awareness of

01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:05,760
of what's going on in the world around

01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:08,880
them so

01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:10,480
actually communicating with with this

01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:13,199
community has been

01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:14,560
a relatively easy thing to do and and

01:23:13,199 --> 01:23:16,639
i've also found that

01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:18,400
in the vast majority of cases if i can

01:23:16,639 --> 01:23:19,920
get a phone number for someone

01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:21,440
they're happy to talk to me and happy to

01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:24,000
tell me what they think

01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:24,719
i don't have to try to to draw them out

01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,880
and

01:23:24,719 --> 01:23:27,920
and coax them into telling me what they

01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:30,880
think

01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:34,000
so no this has been a relatively easy

01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:37,040
communication exercise for me

01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:38,800
but uh a very enjoyable one

01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:40,639
and i look forward to the next year of

01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:43,520
this so

01:23:40,639 --> 01:23:45,040
thank you all thank you everybody for i

01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:47,520
i really appreciate this

01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:50,560
uh the questions were great i hope that

01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:52,880
my answers were at least acceptable

01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:54,639
um and and if i wasn't able to answer a

01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:56,239
question i apologize but some of your

01:23:54,639 --> 01:23:57,440
questions touch on things that the board

01:23:56,239 --> 01:24:01,440
just hasn't thought about

01:23:57,440 --> 01:24:13,760
so thank you and uh let's go back to

01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:13,760
