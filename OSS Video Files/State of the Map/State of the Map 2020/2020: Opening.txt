we stay to the mat 2020 so I'm Gregory

00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:16,410
we're just making sure that everyone

00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:19,619
gets here because now I would normally

00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:22,590
be shouting maps and asking you to come

00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:26,010
from the foyer into the main hall but I

00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:31,619
guess you're here already so I can look

00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:34,170
onto my computer and see say if you're

00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:36,030
on Twitter or IRC perhaps you'll say

00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:39,750
hello and I'll know that people are

00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:41,700
watching the video feed in a moment I

00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:46,460
went to that and perhaps see some things

00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:50,370
in a moment I'll go through some notices

00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:53,730
here and and the app will we'll get

00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:56,610
started I think we want to just check

00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:59,460
people are watching and then we'll

00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:06,540
continue but this you are in the right

00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:08,970
place for state of the map to 2020 so

00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:14,159
let's see I'm not sure anyone say yet

00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:24,020
but I'll check and I think people are

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:31,530
watching I think we were then to have

00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:34,110
Christine do a welcome yeah brilliant I

00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:38,430

moment so yeah we are all open street

00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:03,240

one another and be OpenStreetMap errs so

00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:15,000
try and get along and just think about

00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:18,390
others as with other years we have a

00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,820
code of conduct because we want to make

00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:23,160
sure you all know you're welcome if you

00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:26,320
see anything you're uncomfortable about

00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:29,290
with or think it's inappropriate

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,300
you can contact the team Eva free the

00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:35,050
email address that's being shown now or

00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:38,950
free those social media channels and the

00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:41,560
team will give you emails to privately

00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:45,100
most of myself and Christine because we

00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:47,590
the code of conduct leads and we can

00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:50,080
take what you say and we'll think about

00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:53,440
it and sort it out maybe talk to other

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:55,540
people if needed or just be aware

00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,960
sometimes you might just want us to be

00:04:55,540 --> 00:05:01,330
aware of something and we can keep that

00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,070
to one side in our mind or it might be

00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:06,220
that we've already dealt with that

00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:09,910
situation and that's okay but contacting

00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:12,220
us means it can be sorted and being made

00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:14,620
aware of far rather than it go to the

00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:17,230
whole team or be discussing lots of ways

00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:20,530
so anything you're uncomfortable about

00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:22,900
please do contact us about that because

00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:25,540
we want to try and make this a safe

00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:30,300
place and a welcoming place for everyone

00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:33,370
which hopefully you found already and

00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:36,370
this conference is the OpenStreetMap

00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:39,820
foundation conference so they helped

00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:42,520
support the achievement project and run

00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:44,830
it in various ways there's a few talks

00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:49,480
later all sessions where you'll hear

00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:50,800
about OS MF and can understand it but if

00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:53,350
you're interested you can visit the

00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,720
website everyone's welcome to be a

00:05:53,350 --> 00:06:00,850
member of the foundation so you can

00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:04,030
visit join dot osm foundation - org to

00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:07,690
learn more about art and we look forward

00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:09,640
to welcoming you as a member there's

00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:11,680
more details there and I think if you're

00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:13,150
watching the conference you'll pick up

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:17,860
some more understanding about the

00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:21,160
foundation I want to say a big thank you

00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:24,040
to our gold sponsors so ESRI Facebook

00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:26,050
and Matt box you've probably heard of

00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:28,660
these companies they all do slightly

00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:31,360
different things or in different place

00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:35,050
with maps but there are gold sponsors

00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,760
and it's great that they will go sensors

00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:38,410
but when we announced we were going to

00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:40,030
have to be an online conference or

00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:43,270
online only

00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:45,520
they still decided to support us at the

00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:47,200
same level and stairs Gold Sponsor so I

00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,140
think that's great just the attitude

00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:55,270
they say but also it does financially

00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:58,420
help support the OSM foundation and lets

00:06:55,270 --> 00:07:00,700
us keep running these conferences each

00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:03,670
year so there was a few costs till this

00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:05,890
year but you know next year without we

00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:08,710
can meet in person and now because in it

00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:11,620
it helps us on it and we're grateful to

00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:14,110
our other sponsors as well so you can go

00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:18,430
to the State of the mat website and see

00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:20,680
their logos there the sponsors as well I

00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:23,200
think particularly three are running

00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:26,140
sessions so you'll be able to see them

00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:28,890
listed in the self-organized sessions so

00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:33,120
you can meet people from these companies

00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:33,120
using the technology that they're using

00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:38,200
so to move on to that what what should

00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:42,400
we expect from state of the map this

00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:44,590
year well the live broadcast is going to

00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,950
be here so you're in the right place for

00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:47,200
that

00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:49,600
there's also a second track which you

00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:51,760
should find from the website in the same

00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:54,880
way you found this track so there'll be

00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:57,580
lots of talks here now be live chats

00:07:54,880 --> 00:08:01,600
with the speakers afterwards for

00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:03,820
questions so I'll explain that but

00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:06,340
really important are the self-organized

00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:07,660
sessions so we normally have these are

00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:10,360
the states of the map where we have a

00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:13,180
room set aside if you've had a

00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:16,240
conversation on one of the social media

00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:18,640
channels or perhaps a talk has spurred

00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:21,130
you to start signing you can go in the

00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:26,040
range and say hey let's join on a video

00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:28,540
chat or a text chat and you can join and

00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:32,260
discuss that and get things worked out

00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:37,360
or just share experiences so yesterday

00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:39,760
for example there was women's breakfast

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:43,210
where women of OpenStreetMap met and

00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:46,210
just had a chat and socialized a bit in

00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:48,490
math so I think that was quite informal

00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:51,010
later today I'm in the UK so I'm

00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:52,780
interested there's one that some been

00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:53,890
set up because some new date has been

00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:57,640
released and so

00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:59,500
this people meeting to discuss that so

00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:03,279
you can go to the website following the

00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:05,200
link to see what self-organized sessions

00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:07,839
have all been ready been arranged and

00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:10,120
check the times but also do arrange your

00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:14,800
own and those instructions and help on

00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:17,110
setting up your own video chat or an RC

00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:22,570
channel or whatever's relevant and

00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:25,269
helpful for you now to ask questions

00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:29,440
they will be playing the talks will be

00:09:25,269 --> 00:09:31,450
pre-recorded as the talks happening go

00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,180
to the website look at the program and

00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:36,370
find the talk that you are currently

00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:39,279
listening to whether that's in track 1

00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:41,230
or track 2 click the link and on the

00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:43,329
left there's a link to the session pad

00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:45,970
so if you click that that's text

00:09:43,329 --> 00:09:48,880
document that anyone can edit type in

00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:50,800
your question and ideally do that while

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,180
the tops still happening cuz there's a

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,209
big delay and it's good to get the

00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:58,750
questions out there see them your

00:09:55,209 --> 00:10:01,870
session host will then see that so when

00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:04,000
the tour finishes the livestream will

00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:07,480
then show a video of the session host

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,610
and of the speaker and the session host

00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:11,320
will look at the the path where you've

00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:13,480
been editing where everyone's been

00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:16,029
editing and we'll pick out questions

00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:18,630
from that to read and to ask aloud to

00:10:16,029 --> 00:10:20,589
the to the speaker who will then

00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:23,459
hopefully be able to answer your

00:10:20,589 --> 00:10:26,949
question or at least will try their best

00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:28,839
so make sure you edit that there is a

00:10:26,949 --> 00:10:30,519
session part for the opening but I

00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:34,240
wasn't planning to you a name because

00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:36,730
I'm not said much but if anyone wants to

00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:39,430
go and check and practice how it's

00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:44,079
working I can see someone's written test

00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:45,730
1 2 3 and maybe in a moment I'll ask us

00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:49,029
some questions or read some things out

00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:53,620
if you want to practice asking a

00:10:49,029 --> 00:10:55,269
question there then you can do yep

00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:58,240
someone's saying good morning that's how

00:10:55,269 --> 00:11:01,420
like we are and yes so make sure you ask

00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:04,540
your questions before the before the top

00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:07,810
finishes if possible and hopefully we'll

00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:12,590
get lots of discussion from that

00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:14,360
so there we go moving on and you've seen

00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:16,160
this slide bits of recap because the

00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,300
social channels are important to keep

00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,460
the conversation going

00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:21,440
it's not just about the talks but it's

00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:23,300
about that interaction you know we've

00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,730
had people welcoming each other and

00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:28,010
giving introductions about how they're

00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:30,200
involved in OpenStreetMap so do that

00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:33,410
make sure you chat along that and most

00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:37,850
of all that's where the when you can ask

00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:39,350
questions and especially if you've

00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:41,630
forgotten anything I've said in these

00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:43,250
notices go to the social channel and you

00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:45,410
can ask it there or if I've missed

00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:48,440
something which is probably quite

00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:53,240
possible then you can go there and ask

00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:56,030
those questions but now say we were

00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:58,450
planning to being Cape Town that means

00:11:56,030 --> 00:12:01,490
that the local team have still been

00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:05,140
organizing lots of this conference so I

00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:09,280
went handing it to the lead of that

00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:17,480
conference but now he's going to give us

00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:18,280
welcome from her side of things Thank

00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:23,720
You Gregory

00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:25,640
hi everyone I'm just checking thank you

00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:28,640
for joining the OpenStreetMap state of

00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:30,290
the map virtual conference 2020 I'm sad

00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:32,590
not to be able to welcome you to Cape

00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:36,170
Town in person these are difficult times

00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:38,360
at this time I've been so revitalize by

00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:41,060
all the people willing to help shape

00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:44,000
energy multiplies energy and difficult

00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:45,740
times are good for innovation my

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,660
personal reason for organizing this was

00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:49,970
to learn more about using OpenStreetMap

00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:52,460
to visualise urban resource flows to

00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:54,650
communicate to people about how how much

00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:57,170
and where we are interacting with our

00:12:54,650 --> 00:13:00,530
environment in short pretty massive

00:12:57,170 --> 00:13:03,590
method pictures I was not disappointed I

00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:06,200
have learned so much so far particularly

00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:08,690
on the OSM Africa Watts up group and I'm

00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:11,540
very excited for the talks and the post

00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:13,280
is during the next two days well done to

00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:15,590
all and thank you to this phenomenal

00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:17,930
community I also know that some of your

00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:20,430
joining from really weird time zones

00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:24,780
I think Netflix it's 3 a.m.

00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:26,670
thank you for being awake and some of us

00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:29,190
off in a hammock outside I see on the

00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:30,840
telegram group I didn't know when I

00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:32,820
started that from a social point of view

00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:35,250
the always-same contributors in South

00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:37,230
Africa is very few not very active I

00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:39,330
hope we can use this conference to

00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:41,400
improve that and if there are people in

00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:44,400
the woodwork now is a good time to come

00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:46,170
out thank you very much to the team and

00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:48,390
particularly the local team for helping

00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:51,150

rapper who are not primarily interested

00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:57,840
in OpenStreetMaps they're more line X

00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:59,490
and Debian Fawcett types but you ended

00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:01,350
up doing this because I asked them to

00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:03,600
you and ended up doing most of the work

00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:05,820
with the move to online so thank you so

00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,530

00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:33,120
/ - Gregory again

00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:34,920
great thank you banal so that was

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:39,030
wonderful welcome and I can see you

00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:41,580
using the questions and answers Pat for

00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:44,850
the opening someone translated it into

00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:47,910
French which isn't so helpful if the

00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:51,150
session host is me who is challenged

00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:54,150
with languages one person asked where

00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:55,410
the coffee station is I'm afraid this

00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:58,980
year you've got to provide it yourself

00:14:55,410 --> 00:15:01,560
and a few years ago if you went to stay

00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:03,180
to the map in Birmingham you can you

00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:06,870
would have your monk with your name on

00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:09,390
it from one of our sponsors so that's my

00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:14,070
OpenStreetMap mark it's empty cuz I

00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:16,260
finish my tea already and so we've got

00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:19,470
about two minutes for the first talk so

00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:24,080
just looking down seems people are also

00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:29,730
talking about where they're from so I'm

00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:34,140
I'm talking from England the UK and the

00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:35,970
now was in South Africa so we really are

00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:40,460
nor an international conference this

00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:44,190
year and it's great to see you talking

00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:47,940
so we yeah as I say we've got about two

00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:51,480
minutes before the first talk

00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:54,990
there's the Q&A I think if I go back to

00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:57,000
the social media channels these are the

00:15:54,990 --> 00:16:00,540
main social media channels if you've

00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:03,630
just tuned in you are you miss the

00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:05,940
Mertzes but don't worry if there's

00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:08,580
anything you think you needed to know

00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:13,260
you can ask on these social media

00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:18,210
channels there's a hashtag on Twitter so

00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:20,880
Tom 2020 and there's the telegram chat

00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:23,640
that most of us joined a few years ago

00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:27,450
so we were using that group and there's

00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:29,760
IRC another tool in focus team which

00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:32,280
this morning is currently chaired by but

00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,880
now they're happy to answer your

00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:37,650
questions

00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:39,120
so teach up there and yeah and ask any

00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:45,290
questions if you think I've forgotten

00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:49,590
anything or maybe you didn't hear it and

00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:52,830
yep so by my clock it is just about to

00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:55,620
take two alone between 1020 because

00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:57,020
we're working in UTC and I will remember

00:16:55,620 --> 00:17:00,950
