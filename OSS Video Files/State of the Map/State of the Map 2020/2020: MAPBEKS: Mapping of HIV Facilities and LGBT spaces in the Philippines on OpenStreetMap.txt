Title: 2020: MAPBEKS: Mapping of HIV Facilities and LGBT spaces in the Philippines on OpenStreetMap
Publication date: 2020-07-18
Playlist: State of the Map 2020
Description: 
	https://media.ccc.de/v/sotm2020-3522-mapbeks-mapping-of-hiv-facilities-and-lgbt-spaces-in-the-philippines-on-openstreetmap



The Philippines is to be considered one of the most-LGBT friendly countries in the World. In 2019, it was able to host the largest pride celebration in Asia. Amidst all this, crimes against LGBTQ+, discrimination, and bullying is still rampant in the country.  

The Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Expression (SOGIE) Bill is still continuously being delayed. It is intended to prevent various economic and public accommodation-related acts of discrimination against people based on their sexual orientation, gender identity or expression. Despite of being tolerated, the LGBT community is still far from being accepted by society.
Evidence of our community have been written on books, told in stories, presented in movies and yet the community has not left its mark in data. Spreadsheets, research, books have identified spaces where community activities happen but this are not shown on any map online. Our spaces are mere descriptions or addresses on tables and paragraphs. 
This talk would be about how we would be more represented on OpenStreetMap so as to provide emphasis on being on the map.

MapBeks is an online community of mapping volunteers that advocates for diversity inclusion and representation focused specifically for Lesbians, Gays, Bisexuals, Transgendered, Queer, Inter-sexed, etc. (LGBTQI+) on OpenStreetMap.
As part of its advocacy is to map-out and locate all HIV facilities (testing, counselling, and treatment hubs) in the Philippines. It has researched, collated, and validated various sources to build an updated and comprehensive online database with location data. Currently, it has identified 650 HIV testing and counselling centers all over the Philippines and already mapped out 140 (20%) of the facilities on OSM using MapContrib.xyz.
We would like to share our experiences in building our small community of LGTQ+ advocates, and digital volunteers. We hope we can inspire the world with our endeavour to make change from what little we have.
The talk will discuss the following:
1. The STATUS QUO- LGBT places are not that much represented on OSM/ tagging/ lack of data
2. How was Map Beks able to start up as a local community and how it was able to reach out to the growing LGBT and PLHIV community
3. Its current projects and advocacies
4. Its plans for the future

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,879
bears and chasers

00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,120
from the lgbt here in the philippines i

00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:45,200
am

00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,480
also the ex-partner student office meet

00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,120
workmate and

00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,640
colleague of mr map maker david garcia

00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,920
he has been my professor

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:57,280
way back in 2010 i believe and

00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:59,920
uh we've been through very much

00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,320
in the past years working together so if

00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:05,199
you've been into one of his talks

00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,840
with in osm conferences i believe you

00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:09,360
pretty much

00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:12,720
seen a picture of myself in one of his

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:15,439
lectures or topics by then so

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,759
i am here is because i believe that not

00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:20,159
all spaces are defined by

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,759
straight line going through just a

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,840
background of the philippines or the

00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,159
country where i've come from

00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,159
it's a very beautiful place with more

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,880
than 7 000 islands it's an

00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,360
archipelago in the pacific so we are

00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,560
known to be one of the most

00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:37,360
lgbt-friendly places in the world

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,600
and yet we do not have an equality bill

00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,920
that protects the lgbt community from

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,119
any form of discrimination

00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:47,200
so aside from that the philippines has

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,560
hosted the largest pride march in asia

00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,079
in 2019

00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:54,640
we have uh accounted for more than 75

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:58,159
000 participants for our

00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:01,280
pride march only okay so

00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,399
this happened last year in marikina city

00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,840
and yet

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:08,959
uh even with that large number of

00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:11,520
attendees and allies that come together

00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:14,400
the lgbt community has continued

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:17,360
continuously face discrimination

00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,480
in all aspects of life in your workplace

00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,959
in schools

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:24,640
in the military in churches each other

00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,560
additionally the philippines is also

00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,280
known to be one of the fastest growing

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:32,560
countries in terms of hiv cases and yet

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:35,360
there is no consolidated data table map

00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,920
that shows any accurate location of all

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,519
these

00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:41,280
places in our country so

00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,040
that is one challenge that we have been

00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,200
facing here

00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,280
uh one organization would show you a

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:50,239
need a different

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,560
a different list of hiv facilities for

00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,640
testing for counseling for treatment for

00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:58,159
dispensary another

00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:00,879
organization has a list with a varying

00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:02,400
information on it and tables on it and

00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,239
lastly the philippines

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,840
has a strong and passionate mapping

00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,599
community in the country so

00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,400
our community in the philippines is

00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:13,440
especially the osm philippines community

00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:16,480
is very uh supportive uh

00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,120
with emerging uh mapping communities so

00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,239
they were

00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:24,799
very much uh guide us through

00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:28,159
the mapping in openstreetmap and yet

00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:29,040
uh as of december 2019 we were able to

00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,799
notice or

00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,080
some of my friends and i were able to

00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:36,560
notice that not a single

00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:39,519
lgbt place was mapped on openstreetmap

00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,360
so these are just some things that we to

00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,400
set up the context of what we have in

00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,239
our country

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:48,799
okay so i'd like to introduce to you

00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,879
uh the organization i am representing so

00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:54,080
it's map decks so map backs

00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:56,560
is an online community of volunteers

00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,480
advocating for lgbt representation and

00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,439
inclusion and various mapping platforms

00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,560
such as

00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:05,840
so map box is pretty much a play of word

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:09,519
uh with map map map box

00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:12,640
so in our country bex or becky

00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:14,159
means that it's somehow a comrade or an

00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,160
ally or a friend

00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,759
like if you have a friend that is from

00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,320
the lgbt community

00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:23,199
you can call him becky or bex so that's

00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:26,639
where the name of mapdex comes from

00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:29,759
so currently our community is around 10

00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:32,880
volunteers active volunteers wherein we

00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:35,280
help and we help each other to

00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,520
actually put the lgbt community on the

00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,520
map

00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,800
the idea of map back stems from the

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,520
thought

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,560
that we would want to put or we would

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,440
want to see

00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,720
the places that have meaning or gave us

00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,960
meaning and lives

00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,320
to be on the map so since if you are on

00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:56,320
the map it shows that you are

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:58,560
evident it shows you are existing so we

00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,720
we thought of a way wherein we could

00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:05,039
push through the representation

00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,039
that there is a need to have a

00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:10,479
anti-discrimination bill

00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,759
for the lgbt community and we saw that

00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:14,000
open street map

00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:17,039
or through maps we are able to be

00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,160
represented or visible or evident

00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,880
since uh this is what we want in the

00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,400
future

00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:28,720
we would want to have a country uh

00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:31,680
that that that treats us equally

00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,160
that sees us equally that's why we saw

00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,160
that

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,840
uh through mapping this could be an

00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,400
avenue wherein we are able to be

00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,800
represented

00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,720
way back in 2018 philippines jobs and

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,919
chasers the organization i

00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,919
uh helped organized was looking for a

00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:52,320
waiver and it could contribute back

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:55,759
to the society so one way we saw was to

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:57,440
participate in mapathons uh

00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,280
and since then since there was a super

00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,840
typhoon that will be hitting kagayan

00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,960
region

00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:06,319
in the north part of the philippines

00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:08,800
we actually participated in it and

00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,800
and contributed in drawing building

00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,520
footprints in roads so that

00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,639
disaster responds or the data could be

00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,680
available when

00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:21,120
the response is goes through

00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:23,840
after the disaster pretty much

00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,080
uh more than 10 colleagues of mine from

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,639
the organization participated we learned

00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,960
how to map building footprints roads

00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:33,360
and that's where the idea came through

00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,840
where in our lgbt organization was

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,880
it would be able to be an integral part

00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,919
in mapping

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:42,960
places here in our country so since

00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:45,199
from uh from a very small portion

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,639
of my group we were able to extend it

00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,520
throughout

00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:51,599
the coming years and us and joined other

00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:55,039
mapathons hosted by h.o.t

00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:59,840
by osm philippines and others uh

00:06:55,039 --> 00:07:02,479
and it gave us a sense that

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,400
aside from just partying drinking or

00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,800
just enjoying the night

00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,680
or doing whatever we found something

00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,120
that we could do

00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,080
together and enjoy also the company of

00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:16,560
each other

00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:19,840
in 2019 then the group became bigger

00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:22,960
and needed to make sense of

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,560
what it should do with the mapping

00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,639
community

00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,199
so instead of just drawing building

00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:32,000
footprints in remote areas for disaster

00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:35,520
response and preparedness it actually

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,680
uh was able to stumble upon

00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,440
the mental health awareness project by

00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,000
andy tabinas and

00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:44,000
coordinate with them wherein we were

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,280
able to see

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:51,280
the direction of where map makes can

00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,280
be bigger can be better

00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,280
and was able and was able to find its

00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,560
niche

00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:02,080
inside the mapping community so

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:05,199
by then 2019 late 2019

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:08,560
we were focused to map out lgbt

00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:10,800
spaces and hiv facilities for our

00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,240
pale hiv brothers and sisters for our

00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,800
lgbt community

00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,879
and put those spaces in places that have

00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,919
meaning to us

00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:22,319
uh on openstreetmap so on the first

00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:25,440
the and the first time that the mapping

00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:28,160
community of mapex

00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:30,319
organized a mapping party is the first

00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:33,519
ever in the philippines i believe

00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:36,240
uh last december ever in groups from

00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,760
other organizations joined us and

00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,159
supported us

00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:44,240
and this gave us direction towards

00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:47,760
2020. so in a span of six months

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,279
by 2020 map x was able to conduct eight

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,720
mapping events

00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:55,519
uh from january to june it has also

00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,480
hosted the largest lgbtqia mapping party

00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,200
in the world

00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:02,080
so we were able to tap 56 partner groups

00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:04,399
and more than 150 participants joined us

00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,839
in our webinar so it's really it was a

00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:09,440
really big party

00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:12,240
wherein we would need to to

00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,600
get other organizations on board that

00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,600
there is this group

00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,040
focused on mapping safe spaces there's

00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,920
this group focused on

00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,800
assisting other organizations with their

00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,640
mapping

00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,920
needs and there was this group that

00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:27,839
wanted to

00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:31,519
mainstream uh the lgbt advocacy

00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:33,920
towards the mapping side

00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,800
so with that we were able to immediately

00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,720
get

00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,560
our gardener media attention from cnn

00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,360
philippines and gma news

00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:43,279
so kudos to that and we were able to

00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,160
establish strong partnerships with

00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:48,000
academy ngos community organizations

00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,880
mapping groups etc

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,279
we can say that map backs as one has

00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:55,279
been

00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:57,360
one of the uh fastest growing

00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:59,200
mapping communities in the philippines

00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,040
as it has garnered attention from

00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:04,079
various organizations

00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:07,279
because of its timely and

00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:08,079
pressing advocacy and mapping lgbt safe

00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:12,160
spaces

00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:14,320
and hiv facilities so since because not

00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:18,320
all spaces are defined

00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,959
by straight lines uh mapbex was able to

00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,320
develop

00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:23,519
four mapping uh mapping platforms for

00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,480
the community so

00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:28,560
the first one is lgbtqia safe spaces map

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,680
you have partnered with pantai filipinas

00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,480
with this map

00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:34,480
wherein it shows you the places where

00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:37,079
for municipalities cities

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:39,360
and provinces that are protected by an

00:10:37,079 --> 00:10:43,120
anti-discriminatory bill or law

00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:46,959
so local that that protects lgbt

00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:49,839
locally and it also shows you

00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:51,120
uh places that were nominated as lgbt

00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,519
safe spaces

00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,399
in our country so you could visit the

00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:58,000
website at

00:10:54,399 --> 00:11:00,000
beat.lee lgbtph you will be able to get

00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,600
a quick preview about it

00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:07,519
and we use various tools uh in getting

00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:10,959
the data from crowdsourcing from

00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:13,120
from nominations by lgbt organizations

00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:14,640
and groups so pretty much we are able to

00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:18,640
add 50

00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:21,680
around that number more than 50 lgbt

00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:25,760
save spaces on the map so it features uh

00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:28,480
safe amenities safe workspaces

00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:30,399
safe health services and safe

00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,040
organization so we're putting that on

00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,680
the map

00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,880
so after we are able to validate and

00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,440
coordinate with the

00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,320
lgbt safe space or the owner of the safe

00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,640
space

00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,360
we then that's where we put it actually

00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,560
on

00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,120
open street the second map that we're

00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,680
doing

00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,839
currently is the hiv facilities map so

00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:53,760
pretty much this was the bulk of

00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:56,480
the initial napex uh struggle since

00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,040
data from various organizations was

00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,160
different

00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:01,920
from one another so the data from this

00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,240
organization is different from the other

00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,079
one and yet we were able to consolidate

00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,320
it through the process of

00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:09,360
coordinating with this organization so

00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,839
currently

00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,480
i'm proud to say that the mapdex

00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:16,399
database of hiv facilities is currently

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,560
the largest number of facilities that

00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:22,399
were able to be

00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:24,560
uh consolidated or collated by a group

00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,639
or an organization uh we were able to

00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:29,680
tan them with

00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:32,639
various hiv advocacy advocate groups

00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:34,320
during the covid pandemic to support

00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:38,320
them with the maps

00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:41,279
or the location of medicines for hiv

00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,399
individuals the next process of the hiv

00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:46,160
facilities we have to

00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:49,040
actually validate the the data

00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,639
uh where we will be needing to call in

00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,240
all 600 plus

00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,320
facilities and validate their

00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:57,360
information from phone numbers emails

00:12:54,320 --> 00:13:01,279
websites contact persons addresses

00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:05,279
so that we can be able to put it on the

00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:07,440
on open street yes

00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,320
uh the third and fourth map that we've

00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,760
created was

00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,480
in partnership with mental health

00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,800
awareness so we need to create a space

00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,839
or a mapping platform where people can

00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,440
uh

00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:22,880
share their stories of either love life

00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:24,160
emancipation etc or stories for

00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,240
discrimination

00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,000
so that people can be knowledgeable of

00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,079
the experiences that we

00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,920
as the lgbt community are commonly

00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:34,480
facing so there are

00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,360
stories that were added through the map

00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,040
back stories

00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,959
and the stories of discrimination and

00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:42,000
bullying wherein

00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:43,680
anonymously people can just put pins all

00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
over the philippines

00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,440
and read those stories for them to

00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,880
appreciate

00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:52,720
so moving forward we

00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,880
from map-backs would like to enrich the

00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,320
relationships with various organizations

00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,800
by introducing mapping

00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,639
so i believe that the lgbt community is

00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,760
an untapped territory for mapping

00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,720
volunteers

00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,920
and this is one entry point wherein we

00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,600
could

00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:11,839
go into and

00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,920
get the help from their community since

00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,880
a lot from the lgbt community are very

00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,920
techy

00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:21,839
very young are very able

00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,839
just with the right guidance

00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:26,399
they'd be able to give or contribute a

00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:29,440
large

00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:31,600
number of contributions in mapping

00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:34,000
we would also like to continue support

00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,560
in disaster response mapping

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,800
uh in the philippines so we are in tight

00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,560
partnership with hot with other mapping

00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:43,600
organizations in the philippines

00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,079
wherein we would want to still aid them

00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,399
because

00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:48,160
once we finish all the other maps or the

00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,279
other projects that we are currently

00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,920
facing we would then

00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:53,839
default to going back and assisting uh

00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:56,000
disaster response mapping or mapping of

00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,600
remote areas in the country so a lot of

00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,720
places here in the philippines are still

00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,760
not mapped

00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:03,440
and i've been in most of them and that's

00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:06,000
one thing that i think

00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,800
where our community can stand out as

00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,040
well in

00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,480
providing support in disaster response

00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,240
mapping

00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,320
we would also like to continue to reach

00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,279
out to further to further organization

00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,760
so not not

00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:19,360
all cities in the country have lgbt

00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,399
organizations and we would want to put

00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,800
them on the map

00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,320
we would want to them to be connected to

00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:27,279
other organizations

00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,800
and help that connectedness and that's

00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,920
very important especially in any

00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,079
communities

00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,480
in in the numbers that we are able to

00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:35,440
connect we are able to also foster and

00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,320
empower

00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,519
our communities within them and that's

00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,680
if you would like to implement the

00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:43,040
nationwide project and add more lgbt

00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,519
safe spaces

00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,279
uh there were a lot of challenges that

00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:50,800
were faced by map decks

00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:53,839
throughout uh starting basically

00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:55,440
it was a very roller coaster ride for

00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:58,320
the organization

00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,279
ideally the first thing that that we had

00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,920
difficulty was

00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:03,120
finding the niche within the community

00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,440
since there were a lot of

00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,040
people mapping roads people there were

00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,440
already groups mapping schools

00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,600
mapping buildings map backs needed to

00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:14,480
stand out so that the advocacy

00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,920
did not just feel like we're just

00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,800
mapping

00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,839
it needs to be somewhere that is very

00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,240
close to our heart

00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,360
and that's where we where we were able

00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,880
to find

00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:29,519
our role in this mapping community

00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,480
and then from there if we were able to

00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,600
instill

00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:35,519
the seeds of passion on the

00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,040
purpose within the hearts of our lgbt

00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:39,279
community members that's

00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:41,680
then we are able to reach out to more

00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:44,639
mapping activities mapping events

00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,360
and contribute better contribute more

00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,800
secondly

00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,639
it was difficult getting the attention

00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:52,000
of paris organizations

00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:54,079
since a lot was was competing for

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,040
the attention of the media or social

00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:57,199
media

00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,399
uh map-backs needed to stand out with

00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:01,199
this advocacy

00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:03,120
and make sure that everyone is on board

00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:06,160
or at least everyone would know

00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:10,240
what mapdex is doing for this community

00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:14,079
so that then started only

00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:15,679
by late may or early may wherein we were

00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:18,240
able to reach out to a lot of

00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:20,480
organizations and partner with them

00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,559
uh especially through the pride month

00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,640
mapathon that we conducted

00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:26,640
but before that it was very hard to

00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,200
actually ask for people to hey

00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,080
can we partner hey do you want to be to

00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,760
join us

00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,480
going going through this mapping

00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:36,559
activity a lot of people was very

00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,320
skeptical of the technical side of

00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:41,039
mapping and that's

00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,080
that's where we made sure that we need

00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:44,559
to invite

00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,679
at least a person to persons so that

00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:48,320
people can actually

00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:50,000
have the feeling that this mapping

00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,720
portion of map decks is

00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,039
really not difficult it's just more of

00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,120
like

00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:57,679
answering a survey putting it and

00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:00,240
putting a pin onto a place etc

00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:01,200
so more or less we were able to break

00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,799
that barrier by

00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,559
bit but by this june and more people are

00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:08,240
getting more aware map that's getting

00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:09,200
more attention and getting more

00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,360
partnerships

00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,960
and that's where in we are able to

00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:16,480
actually

00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,760
survive because hosting these projects

00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:21,440
and these activities

00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:24,480
actually need support financially

00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:28,000
and and logistically

00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:30,640
uh people were wanting to be volunteers

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,320
they would want to do this do that and

00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,720
that's where

00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,960
uh the third problem comes in we're in

00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,520
it's more of an organizational thing

00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,679
we're in

00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,799
i think with the lockdown with the

00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:42,720
quarantine

00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:44,000
it became more difficult since

00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,039
everything was online

00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,679
there was still a need to have physical

00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:51,039
connection with your new volunteers your

00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:54,480
new members

00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:55,120
and uh that became very difficult

00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,600
especially

00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:59,679
just doing things on online so and

00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,840
because not all spaces are defined by

00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:03,440
straight line i would like to leave this

00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,919
note as a conclusion

00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,280
that hopefully the open street map

00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:09,679
community would be

00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,720
more embracing for emerging new

00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:14,240
communities

00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:16,799
uh let us always put into ourselves that

00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,840
uh mapping shouldn't be bounded by just

00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:20,160
drawing four

00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,200
points and making a building mapping

00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,160
should it be

00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,600
coming from just data from imagery data

00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,559
from gps

00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,880
points or gps tracks mapping shouldn't

00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:32,000
be

00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,280
very technical somehow mapping or we

00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,400
should adjust

00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:39,280
towards making more tools and

00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,000
making it more accessible to people

00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,320
because

00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,480
because i think mapping is very integral

00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:47,520
in anyone's life

00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:50,080
that it's necessary that we use it every

00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:52,640
day we use navigation every day we use

00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,240
a mental maps in our head go go to get

00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,880
to one point to another

00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,280
thus thus mapping shouldn't be just for

00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:01,679
those who knows how to make maps

00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,559
those who know how to use openstreetmap

00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:05,679
and those who

00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:06,000
are accessible to this technologies so

00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:08,960
we

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,880
should always remember that the maps

00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,919
that we create

00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:15,200
are not just for people who know how to

00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,760
map

00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,640
it should also be for everyone maybe in

00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,760
the future

00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:24,720
the lgbt community would not need to map

00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:27,840
out lgbt safe spaces

00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:31,200
because in fact all spaces are safe

00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:33,840
maybe in the future the hiv community

00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,679
do not need to map out the hiv

00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:38,080
facilities in their countries

00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:39,679
because in fact it is already integrated

00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:42,960
in any

00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:45,039
mapping platform that all hospitals have

00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:47,360
hiv facilities

00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:48,080
all clinics in all cities have hiv

00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,440
facilities

00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:54,000
that cater to the hiv demographic i i

00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,880
and to that note i would hope that you

00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,200
guys

00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,720
would always remember that not all

00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,480
spaces are defined

00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,640
by straight lines and thank you very

00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:05,760
much for coming

00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,760
and i hope to see you soon

00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:14,840
okay thank you so much

00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:17,280
[Music]

00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,919
thanks yeah thank you so much from the

00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,400
map books

00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:21,039
presentation i am trudy i'm co-hosting

00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,919
with uh

00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:24,400
heather yeah so uh you could you can put

00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:27,600
your

00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,640
questions in the in the pad so that we

00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,080
can ask him

00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,919
yes i'll be reading some of the

00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,039
questions and he'll be giving us the

00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:36,240
answers

00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:37,360
so one person is asking do the things

00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,840
you map like

00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:42,400
subspaces change how frequently do you

00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:45,520
have to check the mapping

00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:49,280
um so so this is actually based

00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:51,039
on uh the number of nominations or

00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,559
places that are being mapped but

00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:55,120
currently we are

00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:55,600
mapped more than or less 50 to 60 places

00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,720
and

00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:00,720
we normally check it in in

00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,880
three months time so the mapping that

00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,919
we've done previously

00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,840
uh are already updated since some some

00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:09,200
stores some restaurants have been closed

00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:12,480
because of the lockdown

00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:15,760
so updating is really needed as well in

00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:18,960
in to adjust especially in the

00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,960
times yes

00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,720
okay thank you so another person is

00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,080
asking

00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:29,919
um are these maps circuit somehow as

00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,840
like are they really safe to be up in

00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:34,559
the open because authorities can use

00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:36,960
them to track down the community members

00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:39,200
um this is one of the fears that

00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,640
actually the lgbt community is very

00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,280
scared of

00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,480
because this then becomes public in life

00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:47,360
to everyone

00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,280
but then we from the community

00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:52,320
understand the risk

00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:57,600
of putting up this lgbt safe spaces

00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:57,600
and they themselves adhere and they can

00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,010
[Music]

00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,600
they themselves adhere to the idea that

00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,840
uh

00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,880
we can also adjust the location of this

00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:12,480
points

00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:14,400
to a proximal location nearby

00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,240
so there are some cases of lgbt

00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,320
organizations that they don't want to

00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,679
put the actual location but we adjust it

00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:23,039
a bit

00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:26,080
to it ideally this is

00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:29,280
one of the conflicts that we

00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:30,159
from mabec's struggle in the starting

00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,640
points

00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:34,159
because we also fear that maybe we can

00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:37,200
be targeted for

00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:39,760
hatred for bigotry uh

00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,320
and yet we still continue to do it

00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,799
because

00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:44,080
we would want to show or we would want

00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:47,279
to

00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:49,760
exhibit that courage that there is

00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:52,799
strength in numbers there is strength

00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:54,159
in being courageous about telling other

00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:56,559
people where we are

00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:57,679
uh we go to the point as well that me

00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:00,960
growing up as a

00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:04,000
lgbt kid uh i didn't know where to go

00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:07,279
so if if this school or this

00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,640
maps can help a young kid growing up to

00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:11,600
identify

00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:15,440
a whole heart who he is then i guess we

00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,440
have served our purpose for macbets

00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:22,320
yes

00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:23,919
okay another person is asking

00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:26,559
have you contributed during the hobby

00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:29,679
time and what what impact has matt

00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:33,120
matt bates had during this time

00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:35,919
so uh maybe two the hovid

00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:37,360
lockdowns uh i guess map vex was able to

00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:40,720
help uh hiv

00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:42,799
organizations and advocacies uh

00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:45,279
in ma with the data that we were able to

00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:48,640
have already to locate it to prepare

00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:50,159
for maps for the pl hiv community to

00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,960
know where the location of their

00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:54,000
medicines

00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:56,880
are so some people would be going to

00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,480
the hub or the hospital to where they

00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:01,039
can get the medicine and they'll be able

00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:04,400
to see if it's walkable it's bikeable

00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:08,400
or what uh another thing it also made

00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:11,600
more communities for the lgbt community

00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:15,520
to be more interconnected and be there

00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:17,679
for each other yes so i i guess

00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:21,039
an additional the map that we were able

00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:24,080
to share during the whole vid lockdown

00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:26,840
cornered 23 000 views from various

00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:29,840
uh people who need the map during that

00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,840
time

00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,520
thank you yeah so another person in the

00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,799
um

00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:37,520
is saying that we the community we are

00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:39,679
so few

00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,880
like the community is so few that we

00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:44,400
need a map of where

00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:46,080
all we live so can we find each other

00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,520
that's what he is asking can we find

00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,200
each other like he needs things like

00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,720
apps to find to be able to locate each

00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,240
other every time maybe they're maybe if

00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,919
they're in lukaku they can be able to

00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:57,440
fight together

00:25:53,919 --> 00:26:00,159
yeah um i guess uh

00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,799
that's what grindr is there for our

00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:03,840
tinder

00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:06,880
if you want to see the individual but uh

00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:09,039
in formatbacks we actually would want to

00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,520
focus on the lgbt organizations that

00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:12,960
provide

00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:14,400
support and guidance for growing lgbt

00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:17,039
kids

00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:19,360
so that if for example you're in luksaka

00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:21,120
we can also advocate in mapping areas or

00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:24,960
lgbt organizations there

00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:28,000
so that the right people can guide

00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:30,000
uh those who are pretty lost in

00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,919
in the in the journey of identifying

00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,159
themselves

00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,159
yes

00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:40,080
okay thank you so much another question

00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:41,120
which was that do you have any

00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,720
recommendations

00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,480
you would give to the liberty

00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,830
communities around the world including

00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,360
this place

00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:49,600
[Music]

00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:51,279
uh observing the map on open street now

00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,080
actually we've seen that there are a lot

00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:54,240
of lgbt

00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,440
spaces that already been met in europe

00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:59,760
in the united states

00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:03,039
in some parts of uh some parts of asia

00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:07,440
but i guess it la it focuses on the

00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:10,159
business business type of lgbt spaces

00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:12,640
where people can meet but uh what moving

00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:14,960
forward i guess we can also put in lgbt

00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:18,880
organizations on the map so that

00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:22,080
uh because not only

00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:23,919
i don't look for lgbt spaces just

00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,760
because they're restaurants in an area

00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:26,799
like i would like to meet other people

00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:30,240
like myself

00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:33,360
in another country uh with will

00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:35,919
that can support who i am right so so

00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,720
pretty much what one thing i could i

00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:39,919
recommend

00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:43,120
uh for the world rather the universe

00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:43,679
just kidding uh would be to let us help

00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,880
each other

00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:50,640
map out lgbt organizations as well

00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:53,279
uh all over all over our countries

00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,279
uh that's it

00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,880
yeah thank you so much uh you have a lot

00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,120
of people are

00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,720
commenting positively about the project

00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:05,760
and they really don't have

00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:07,200
a lot of questions i think we've asked

00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,000
all the questions we have not asked you

00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,039
a question

00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:14,880
you can let me know

00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:18,080
yeah what

00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:19,919
what's maybe we could ask you mikko so

00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,520
this is heather miko thank you so much

00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:23,600
for your incredible presentation and

00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:26,320
there's lots of comments in telegram

00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,760
um and i'm sure there'll be more um so

00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,279
if you were a young

00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:31,039
person just getting involved with the

00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:33,120
street map what would you recommend

00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:34,799
for like for this particular community

00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,200
like if you're like from a human point

00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,720
of view

00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,559
like so you've talked about the map you

00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,960
talked about the community what do you

00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:40,320
what do

00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,320
you need to do as a young person getting

00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:45,279
involved in openstreetmap what would you

00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:48,240
recommend for them

00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:48,240
i guess um

00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:54,640
one thing that i could recommend is be

00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:56,159
your genuine authentic self because

00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,960
everything will just shine out from

00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:00,080
there

00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,960
like i understood open street map as

00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:04,000
mapping i love

00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,960
mapping but merging it with what i am

00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,480
and who i am

00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:11,600
makes it more different and more

00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:15,600
at the core of my heart so that and

00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:18,720
i guess to all the lgbt uh kids who are

00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:22,799
uh finding themselves uh

00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:24,720
let this be a lesson that being lgbt

00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:27,440
you should be proud of who you are and

00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:31,120
you can make a big impact to the world

00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:34,880
uh and you can you could help save lives

00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:38,840
through mapping and that yeah

00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:40,240
that's that's what i think sorry i'm

00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:43,440
nervous

00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:45,200
you're doing fantastic and and honestly

00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,039
you know i hope that people are inspired

00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,559
by your comments as much as i am trudy

00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:54,399

00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:57,039
kyle how much more time do we have

00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:58,720
i've got another five minutes five

00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:00,000
minutes trudy do you have a question or

00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,520
anybody else do you have questions to

00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,240
put them in the hack pad and tree and i

00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,720
can help

00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,440
make sure that we verbalize it uh i

00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,159
don't have

00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:09,760
questions but i just i'm just fascinated

00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:11,679
with what he is doing he's really doing

00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,480
fantastic job a lot of people can't come

00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:14,799
out

00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,640
really in the even the oyster community

00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:18,320
but he has come out and he's trying to

00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,679
really make sure everyone is confident

00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:21,440
of who they are

00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:22,880
i just want to say thank you for what

00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,720
you are doing and i hope

00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:27,200
a lot of people in the community could

00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:30,159
stand up and be like you and come out

00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,480
and i think we shall save a lot of lives

00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:32,240
and

00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,440
because i've been doing some research

00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,120
because i have a lot of friends of mine

00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,600
who are in the liberty community in

00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,600
lusaka

00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:42,399
a lot of issues because of acceptance

00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,159
but if you can the whole community can

00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:47,279
embrace and be part of the project

00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:49,120
i think it will really help so much

00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:51,120
one of my friends is trying to commit

00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:53,039
suicide is so much depressed so we are

00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:55,840
trying everything to talk to him

00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:57,919
i think we shall uh save a lot of lives

00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:04,080
also when we really support each other

00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:06,720
i'm so impressed with what you're doing

00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:08,799
wonderful mikko all right so there's a

00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,120
lot of resources on the pad that nico's

00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:10,799
done

00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,720
and nico do you have any clothing class

00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:14,159
i think we have one minute left or so

00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,760
any other kind of closing things that we

00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:18,799
haven't talked about yet

00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:21,840
yes um i guess uh

00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:24,720
i would like to tell the world

00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,360
that you go out and map your lgbt safe

00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,760
spaces

00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,880
put it on open street map just be sure

00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:32,320
that uh

00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:35,760
the proper people would help you

00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:37,360
and uh don't be afraid don't never be

00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,200
afraid especially in times like this in

00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,840
here in the philippines we are fighting

00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,679
for

00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:43,120
a discriminating anti-discrimination

00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:44,240
bill that should have been passed so

00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:47,200
that we could get the

00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:49,279
same rights that we need we deserve

00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:52,240
don't be afraid of that

00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:53,440
and the world will definitely go be

00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,440
better

00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:57,039
don't don't worry if things will get

00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:00,320
better

00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:00,720

supportive and who trusts

00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:31,600

00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:55,840
think it's important to do it with the

00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:56,559
local communities in a safe way so

00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,960
