When people come to OpenStreetMap for the first time, their expectations are sometimes at odds with what the OpenStreetMap community is doing. If you have been puzzled by an OSMer telling you that OpenStreetMap is not a map, that openstreetmap.org is not aiming to compete with Google Maps, or by their stubborn refusal to remove a private trail from the map, then this talk is for you. It will explain the basic tenets of the OpenStreetMap community and how they apply in practice.

This talk will explain some of the often-heard but little-documented basic concepts in OSM, like

* we are not a map (but a database)
* the map does not matter (the community does)
* openstreetmap.org is not aimed at the public (but at mappers)
* we map what's on the ground (not what the government or the landowner wants)

Building on that, the talk will also outline why the OSM community is often skeptical about filling an empty map with data imports, about AI contributions, or about automatic edits, and why OpenStreetMap is not a business directory.

The plan is to explain the basic ideas and give examples of their effects for data users or for everyday mapping practice. Where the concepts are controversial or subject to discussion, these controversies will be mentioned but not followed in depth. This talk will focus on "traditional" values in OpenStreetMap because they are omnipresent. After hearing these explanations, newcomers will have a better chance of understanding where people come from when they say things like "we are not a map", and will be better prepared to form their own opinion.

graham

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,960
he will be giving the talk there might

00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,199
be a misunderstanding

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,320
so frederick will be speaking about some

00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,519
of the often heard

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,040
uh basic concept about osm

00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,640
one of them we are not a map for the

00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,200
database the map doesn't

00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,680
not matter the community does operate

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,879
map.org is not aimed at the public but

00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,600
at mappers

00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:45,920
we map that's on the ground and not what

00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,360
the government or the land owner wants

00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,320
so that's some of the points uh

00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,960
frederick will be speaking fred has been

00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,039
a long

00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,719
uh contributor in osm he's also

00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,719
co-founder of your fabric

00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,239
he wrote the first book of osn that is

00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,520
also available in english

00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:04,479
with his co-founder johann

00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,760
and he has been in no set of the maps

00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:08,080
but one

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,520
that he missed so let's welcome

00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,680
frederick he will be

00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,119
presenting this talk and something

00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,880
before i forget

00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,640
uh please start writing your questions

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,240
and answers during the talk

00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,320
don't wait to the end please because

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,080
otherwise i mean the time you write it

00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,280
will be kind of slower if you have a

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,520
question during the top

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,960
please feel free to write it in the path

00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,159
already thanks a lot

00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:33,079
welcome fred and hello i'm frederick

00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,560
and i am going to talk about common

00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:37,920
misconceptions

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,920
in openstreetmap

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,240
you might have heard any of the

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,399
following

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,680
being said about openstreetmap it's a

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:50,640
map of the whole world

00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,439
the openstreetmap website is a

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,520
competitor

00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:59,360
to google google maps

00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:01,600
you might have heard people say that

00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:05,439
government data or official data is

00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,439
being published on openstreetmap

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:11,599
or that big players like

00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,080
apple facebook or amazon are powering

00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:17,120
openstreetmap

00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,120
or even running it

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,640
you might have heard people say that

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,000
openstreetmap is mainly

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:28,000
a humanitarian project

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:31,360
or you might have heard people say that

00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,720
openstreetmap is a huge data set of

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,720
immense commercial value

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:42,959
all these things are wrong

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:46,400
or at least not

00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:48,879
entirely correct and

00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,879
i'm going to use my talk to explain a

00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:53,760
couple of these misconceptions or

00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:55,840
in how far these are wrong the first

00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,360
thing i would like to talk about is

00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,360
something that you frequently hear and

00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,560
that's we are not

00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,000
a map newcomers

00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,000
to openstreetmap would certainly be

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,480
astonished i think well i've

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,239
signed up to this to make a better map

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,120
so now people are telling me we are not

00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,400
a map

00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,519
what's that all about the we're not a

00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,239
map

00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,599
is often said in response to people

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,599
being concerned about

00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:24,159
how something appears on the

00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:26,560
openstreetmap website

00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,560
if you go to openstreetmap.org the map

00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,879
that you will see by default is the so

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,120
called

00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:35,599
openstreetmap carto map style and

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,360
any map style has to select certain

00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,680
things for inclusion in the map and

00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,280
others cannot be included those might be

00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,920
things with

00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,560
just too much detail like like opening

00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,680
hours

00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:51,200
of a certain shop or or

00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:55,599
the the exact voltage of

00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:58,720
a power line or it might be just

00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:01,439
too detailed like individual

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,920
trees or waste baskets or something that

00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,920
is just

00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,920
too small to show on certain zoom levels

00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,879
every map has to decide what they want

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:14,000
to show every map style

00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:18,239
but that should never deter us from

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:21,040
mapping it so we want to make

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:23,040
a detailed data collection that map

00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,280
producers can then use to select the

00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,759
stuff that they want to show

00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,600
another frequent thing that's also

00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:32,720
connected to this

00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,479
is people will say don't map for the

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,960
renderer the renderer is the software

00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:39,199
that

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:41,120
makes the map from the data and

00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,240
when mapping in openstreetmap you should

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,720
not

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,520
think too much about how the stuff that

00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,639
your map

00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:51,759
will appear on the map because that's

00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:54,880
subject to decisions by the

00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:59,040
map designers and

00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:01,680
sometimes people go so far as to

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,280
mismap things just so that they look

00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,960
nicer on the standard map and that's

00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,840
what we call mapping for the render and

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,720
you should

00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,080
by all means avoid that for example if

00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,400
you were to say

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,680
well i've mapped the footway here and it

00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,800
shows as a

00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,880
dotted red line on the map but i

00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,280
really like the blue lines more so i'm

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,120
going to map it as a cycle way

00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,600
just so that it appears in blue that

00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,479
would be mapping for the render

00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,360
yeah so we are not a map we are a

00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:33,520
database

00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,520
that can be used to make a map from that

00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,520
another thing that often comes up when

00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:41,560
discussing openstreetmap

00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:43,360
is that people mistakenly assume that

00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:46,080
openstreetmap.orgames to compete with

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,919
google maps

00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,680
you might be new to openstreetmap and

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:51,360
like it very much and recommend it to

00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,039
your friends

00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,960
and your friends might be using the

00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,080
openstreetmap website and say well you

00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,240
know

00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,240
it lacks this feature and that feature

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:03,039
and that feature

00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,319
it's not really what i would like to use

00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,919
and then you go back to openstream and

00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,960
say hey folks we should really improve

00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:09,039
all these things

00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,720
and then what you get back is well you

00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:13,199
know we're not

00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,199
really aiming to be an end user

00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:18,240
competitor to google maps so

00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:21,440
go away now

00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:24,400
what this is about is

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:26,720
not so much an elitist attitude where we

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:30,560
say well with great unwashed out there

00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:34,000
let them use google maps it's more

00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:36,160
open street map being realistic um

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,440
we lack a lot of lot of things that

00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,520
would be required to

00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,919
make a proper google maps competitor

00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,919
like for example aerial imagery

00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:46,560
we don't have our own source of aerial

00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:49,759
imagery we don't have our own source of

00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:52,800
traffic data we lack

00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:55,840
the computing resources to make

00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,840
enough service available for all people

00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,199
who use google maps to suddenly switch

00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,960
to openstreetmap

00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:04,319
and we also lack the human resources we

00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,960
don't have

00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:09,039
enough people to provide all the support

00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:12,639
and answer all the questions that would

00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:13,120
necessarily come when lots of people

00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,960
lots of

00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,960
end users were to switch to

00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,759
openstreetmap

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,319
so this is a little bit of a sour grapes

00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,919
thing

00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:26,479
we say that okay well we couldn't

00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:28,160
we couldn't handle it if everyone were

00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,319
to use openstreetmap instead of google

00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:33,440
maps so we don't even try

00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,160
what we often say is the openstreetmap

00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,599
website

00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:40,080
is mainly meant for mappers and

00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,720
of course it's also a showcase that that

00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,080
we can

00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:46,080
tell people hey look at our website

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,520
you can you can see how much data we

00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,720
have and so on

00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:53,680
but um we're not aiming to be

00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,360
a google maps competitor the website is

00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,960
mainly for people who

00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,800
have um a bit more

00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,120
interest in openstreetmap and who want

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,080
to sort of find out about the history of

00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,520
a certain object

00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:09,520
and so on so that's that's this

00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:13,840
we don't want to compete with google

00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,840
maps thing

00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,560
another frequent source of confusion is

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:24,720
when people assume that openstreetmap

00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:28,479
in some way publishes official or

00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:31,840
of government-sanctioned data this comes

00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:34,000
in many shapes and forms sometimes

00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:38,959
people assume that they could

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:42,159
upload government data to openstreetmap

00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:44,240
sometimes people are looking for ways to

00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:47,040
have data in openstreetmap that is not

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,480
changeable like when you say okay these

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,240
this is an official data set of

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,000
boundaries and there's

00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,160
no reason why anyone would ever change

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,080
that so can i can i somehow make this

00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:59,519
immutable

00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:02,560
um or other things that happen or

00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:05,279
people people say that

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,399
this is my private land and i want to

00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,560
decide which

00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:11,040
paths on my private land are shown in

00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:13,839
openstreetmap and which aren't

00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,720
or you might have people who say well

00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,120
the un

00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,800
has published this resolution about the

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,640
boundary between state a

00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,360
and state b so i request that

00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:26,800
openstreetmap follows that

00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:28,000
all these are in in some way based on

00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,200
the idea that there

00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,760
is some kind of official data that that

00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,360
is

00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:38,000
always right or someone has the ultimate

00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,519
say about something

00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,920
and this is not something that we do in

00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:44,959
openstreetmap

00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,320
when data goes into openstreetmap then

00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:49,120
we take ownership

00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,080
of that data and our mappers then have

00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,399
all the right

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,080
to make any modifications to the data

00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,920
that they want

00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,160
so you cannot really have data in

00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,000
openstreetmap that is immutable

00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,440
everything in openstreetmap is mutable

00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,279
and if it wasn't

00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,040
then there would not be any reason to

00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,920
have it in openstreetmap in the first

00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,839
place

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:11,920
because the whole openstreetmap database

00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,120
engine and the editors is all about

00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,160
being able to edit

00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:19,839
data and you don't can't edit it then

00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,839
why have it in openstreetmap anyway

00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:26,000
also when people say that oh this is on

00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,880
my private ground and i request that you

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,120
remove this

00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,519
or if people say that this is the

00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,399
official un boundary or something

00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:36,000
our response is usually well we don't

00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,880
care so much about the

00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,720
official or legal or whatever side of

00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,839
things we care about what is on the

00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,480
ground

00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,680
so our mappers look at the situation on

00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,680
the ground

00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:50,160
they might be using aerial imagery for

00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:53,120
that or other sources but in the end

00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,720
it's what's on the ground that counts

00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,920
and if there is a path

00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,600
then we will map that path and put it on

00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,240
the map

00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,320
if it's a private access path then we

00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,839
can map that also we can just add the

00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,160
information well this is

00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,920
this is private and you you can't use

00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,720
this path but it doesn't change the fact

00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,839
that a path

00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,600
exists and just because because the path

00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,920
is on your private ground doesn't mean

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,800
that

00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,519
you can dictate whether or not it is

00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:23,040
shown

00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:26,079
on our map something that should also be

00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:29,120
said here is that openstreetmap

00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,920
is not a business directory we are

00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,040
mainly

00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:36,079
a database of geographic facts

00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:38,640
and there is some room in there to

00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:40,640
record where a certain business is what

00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:43,040
the name and maybe the opening hours of

00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:46,720
that business are

00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:50,320
but that's about it

00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:53,360
we are not recording uh keywords

00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:57,279
or advertising copy

00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:59,839
and we did we often have to remove

00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:01,600
advertising that is added by businesses

00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:05,040
themselves or by

00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:07,760
seo companies thinking that

00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,600
it would somehow help them if they if

00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,720
they add something to open street map

00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,200
about

00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,560
your local trusted dentist in the region

00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,920
for over 20 years

00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,920
making people smile again

00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,200
this is these are not facts on the

00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,800
ground

00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:27,839
this is advertising and it's not welcome

00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,839
in open street map

00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,120
similar with uh the boundary situation

00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,959
you you might have situations where

00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,800
country a says oh but this part of our

00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:40,800
country has been illegally

00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:43,360
occupied by country b and um

00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,079
you're you're supporting their cause by

00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,360
showing it

00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:50,079
on the map as if it were true um

00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,880
what we usually show about boundaries is

00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:53,920
um

00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:56,720
the who controls something if

00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,680
someone if if some country controls an

00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,920
area

00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,519
um then that's what we show on

00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,240
openstreetmap because

00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:06,000
it doesn't help to show the situation

00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,480
that people would like to have

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
or the situation that might be ethically

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:13,440
or morally or whatever

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,600
legally right if

00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,839
someone controls an area then then

00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,800
that's what we tend to show so

00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:22,480
that's also and trying to apply this on

00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,839
the ground principle where you say this

00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,480
okay let's check

00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:28,240
let's let's see what's on the ground of

00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:31,440
course there are limits to that

00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:34,560
um if it's about

00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:37,920
borders on open c or

00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:40,079
the boundaries of protected areas

00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,600
or national parks that might not

00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:44,399
actually have a fence

00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:46,480
where where the boundary is it's

00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:49,600
difficult to verify them on the ground

00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:52,240
so yes we do sometimes rely

00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,399
on on data sets provided by third

00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:58,560
parties or governments

00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,560
but it's the exception

00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,959
depending on the region you're in your

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,959
first contact

00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:07,839
with openstreetmap might well have been

00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:10,240
in the humanitarian context

00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,440
maybe running some humanitarian

00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,839
map-a-thon or

00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:16,079
participating in a missing maps project

00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:20,320
or something like that

00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:24,240
but this this aid aspect is just

00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:28,079
a tiny tiny part of what openstreetmap

00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:31,120
is um it does receive

00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:34,480
a lot of press attention uh

00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:37,680
it also attracts much more funding

00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:40,880
than openstreetmap itself does

00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:43,040
so it can easily it can sometimes be a

00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:47,760
case of the tail wagging the dog

00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:47,760
and the humanitarian aspect being

00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:54,240
being thought as very important

00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:55,279
to openstreetmap openstreetmap has

00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,639
always had

00:14:55,279 --> 00:15:02,639
a an altruistic

00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:06,000
component but so

00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:09,440
but it was more people mapping for

00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,480
uh their own peer group like

00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,800
um cyclists getting together together

00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,839
and saying hey let's make the best cycle

00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,839
map

00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,760
and all contribute to openstreetmap of

00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:22,160
course every single

00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:24,160
every individual contributor does not

00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:27,519
only contribute for their own good

00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:30,399
but also to help others there's not

00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,519
so much the humanitarian work in

00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:34,399
openstreetmap

00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,519
tends to be um tends to be

00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:39,440
cross-continent

00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:42,639
like uh um privileged

00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,480
rich people in one continent helping

00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,839
underprivileged poor people in another

00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:49,759
continent by

00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:52,079
by giving them maps right so you have

00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,880
the givers of maps and the receivers of

00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:56,560
maps or

00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:58,079
map data and that's that's a kind of an

00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,000
exceptional situation in openstream

00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:00,959
that's not how openstreetmap normally

00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,079
works

00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:07,600
because the normal

00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:10,399
work in openstreetmap would be that

00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,920
you help yourself or you help your own

00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,880
peer group

00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,240
now the humanitarian mapping is slowly

00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:20,839
moving towards that

00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:23,680
and trying to get away from this

00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:27,600
okay college kids in north america

00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:31,440
map a city in

00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:35,279
africa somewhere slowly trying to get

00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:37,519
local people involved and thereby

00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:39,519
doing using the same principles that are

00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:40,320
used elsewhere in openstreetmap namely

00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:44,800
that no

00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:47,920
local knowledge is used to make the map

00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:51,600
but yes humanitarian mapping

00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:55,759
in its in its current or past form

00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:57,680
is is not the mainstay of openstreetmap

00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:00,000
is one aspect

00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:04,000
but openstreetmap is not mainly a

00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:06,079
humanitarian project

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,039
in the history of openstreetmap there

00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:09,919
have been many

00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:10,880
misleading press reports about

00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:14,319
openstreetmap

00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:16,880
being run by one company or another

00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:19,120
that might have been a cloud made or map

00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,120
box in the earlier days or might be

00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:24,240
facebook apple amazon or any of the

00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:27,839
other big names today

00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:29,840
all these companies have

00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,960
something to do with openstreetmap they

00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:34,480
have

00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:37,600
at various times and in in various

00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:39,600
sizes contributed money or even

00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,360
development work or mapping to

00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,440
openstreetmap

00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,360
but none of these companies is essential

00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:48,480
to openstreetmap

00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:50,720
they are contributors

00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,559
but openstreetmap could perfectly well

00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,559
work without them

00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:56,480
openstreetmap the mainstay of

00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:59,520
openstreetmap is the

00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:01,120
millions of hobbyists

00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,799
private individuals who contribute to

00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:06,240
openstreetmap

00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:10,000
and companies help us pay the bill

00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:13,440
for servers some of these companies even

00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:17,200
employ people pay people to map

00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:19,520
to contribute data to to the map but

00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,640
as i said it's not it's not essential

00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,720
it's not like

00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,160
these companies are running

00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,400
openstreetmap or in

00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:29,200
or in any way required to keep

00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:32,720
openstreetmap going

00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:34,559
it can even happen that corporate

00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:38,400
contributions to openstreetmap are

00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:39,120
viewed with skepticism by the community

00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,440
when

00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:45,440
[Music]

00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:47,919
when they work in non-standard ways so

00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,960
when they do not use local knowledge but

00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:52,000
instead

00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:56,000
employ people in one continent to map

00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:59,039
in another continent which often happens

00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,280
neither is openstreetmap run by the

00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:03,200
openstreetmap foundation

00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,960
the openstreetmap foundation owns the

00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:08,000
trademarks

00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:10,400
and the domain names and

00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,480
pays for the servers that run the

00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:16,640
openstreetmap database

00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:18,480
but the openstreetmap foundation doesn't

00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:21,600
call the shots in openstreetmap

00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,799
it doesn't tell people what to do the

00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:26,080
foundation's

00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:29,280
own goal is to support but not

00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:32,400
control the openstreetmap project

00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:35,600
continuing with that idea of company

00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:39,039
contributions to openstreetmap

00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:42,640
people might also say that openstreetmap

00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:43,520
is a huge data set of great value and

00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,480
that

00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:50,240
billions of dollars of revenue depend on

00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,240
openstreetmap in one way or the other

00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,320
now this billions of dollar figure has

00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:58,799
to be taken with a huge

00:19:54,320 --> 00:20:01,600
jar of salt because

00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:03,200
you arrive at figures like that by

00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,120
looking at all the businesses who use

00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:08,320
openstreetmap

00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:10,320
and then uh and then adding

00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,679
whatever revenue they they have and say

00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,120
oh there's billions of dollars of

00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:16,320
revenue depend on that

00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:18,480
of course they could just as easily use

00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:20,640
something else than openstreetmap and

00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:23,520
buy commercial map data

00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,520
from somewhere else

00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:28,640
when people say that the value of the

00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:32,559
openstreetmap database

00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:36,720
is huge it's not really correct

00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:40,080
because the actual value that we have

00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:42,080
is our community is the group of people

00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,640
who have collected all the data

00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:46,480
and who are willing and able to continue

00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,000
collecting the data and fixing it and

00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,880
curating it

00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,720
making sure that bugs are corrected and

00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,960
that if something changes in reality it

00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:57,520
also changes in the data

00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,400
if we were to just take the data now as

00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,640
a static

00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,159
data set as a database then our data set

00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:05,600
would become stale and

00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:08,880
uninteresting in a very short time

00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:12,480
so the actual asset that we have is

00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:16,720
the community of people that is what we

00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:20,080
what we really have it's also

00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,760
that also puts those commercial

00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:25,280
contributions that depend

00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:26,720
on paid mapping into into certain kind

00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:30,559
of context

00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:33,840
because paid mapping stops immediately

00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:35,760
when the flow of money stops whereas

00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,880
all the volunteer contributions that we

00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:40,640
have

00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:43,600
they will continue mapping

00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,559
they do not need someone to to pay them

00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,600
constantly or

00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:49,840
or make them nap in some way or the

00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,840
other

00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:57,120
this idea that the community is

00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,120
our actual asset

00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:04,080
also is the reason for

00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:07,200
many people being a bit skeptical about

00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:10,720
um large imports of data

00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:14,960
or um or the adding of

00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:18,080
of data that essentially is is

00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:22,720
generated from aerial imagery by

00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:22,720
artificial intelligence machine learning

00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:28,480
these processes can be helpful data

00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:32,880
imports can be helpful or

00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:36,080
ai assisted tracing can be helpful but

00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:39,200
proponents of these technologies

00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:40,960
often go so far as to say that the

00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,880
community becomes

00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,320
less important mappers become less

00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:48,880
important if we can only

00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:52,000
hook up our systems to whatever

00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:55,760
existing database of puis there is

00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:58,320
or something or government edited

00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:00,080
footprints building footprints if we can

00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:02,159
hook up our system to that then

00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:04,080
now we don't have to waste time mapping

00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:06,240
all that

00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,200
and this kind of misses the point

00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,679
because

00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,440
we want to engage more mappers to

00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:14,720
contribute their knowledge

00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:17,520
and adding

00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:19,760
just data into openstreetmap doesn't

00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:22,000
actually help us increase our value

00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,919
because our value is more mappers and

00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,320
not more data

00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:28,640
on the contrary it can happen that

00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,039
adding lots of data discourages mappers

00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,640
from

00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:34,000
contributing if they say well you know

00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:36,480
why should i contribute it's all been

00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,840
dumped into openstreetmap from some

00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:41,039
other source

00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:43,840
uh i'm feeling swamped um

00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:45,200
so these are there are sometimes issues

00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,440
with that

00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,600
we have to keep in mind that the most

00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:52,480
important resource we have is

00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,360
mappers and we need to keep them happy

00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:57,440
to

00:23:53,360 --> 00:24:00,640
continue contributing to openstreetmap

00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:04,640
that's it for my talk i hope that

00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:06,880
i was able to give you some

00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,799
context to things that you might often

00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:12,240
hear in openstreetmap

00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:15,279
and yeah i hope that you will continue

00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:18,559
having fun at this conference and

00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:20,960
with openstreetmap and i'm signing off

00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,960
for now

00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:35,600
okay ah thank you for uh attending this

00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:36,480
talk by frederickram so we have many

00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,480
questions

00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,760
uh i'm not sure if we'll have the time

00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,080
for going to all

00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:43,440
so we also have 20 minutes but um we

00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:46,320
will try for sure

00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,760
if not uh maybe fred can uh cover the

00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,880
rest of the questions and comments

00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,840
through a blog

00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,720
predator is great at writing so probably

00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,320
he can do that

00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,080
so let's start with the first question

00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:59,520
okay so first question is

00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:01,679
how to explain to a 6 million users

00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:03,520
openness boot map is not a map and the

00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:08,080
website where you see a map

00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:08,080
cannot be used as any normal map

00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,799
well the situation is that our website

00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,799
can be used

00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:15,840
as a normal map it's not when i say we

00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:17,919
are not a map

00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:20,080
of the or the oh the openstreetmap

00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:23,440
website is not it's not aimed at

00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:24,799
end users that's mainly because it lacks

00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,720
a lot of features that an

00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:28,320
end user mapping site would have like

00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:31,120
for example if you go to google maps

00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,520
you can switch to aerial imagery uh you

00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,279
can

00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,120
there's an integrated mymap feature you

00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:37,919
can draw on the map and so on

00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:39,679
and these are things that are some of

00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:40,080
them are available with openstreetmap in

00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:43,039
some

00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:44,640
fashion aerial imagery is not available

00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:45,440
in openstreetmap and will likely never

00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,480
be

00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,440
um so we cannot we cannot be a

00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:53,600
competitor to

00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:56,960
google maps so that's that's why i say

00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:58,880
uh we are not this website is not

00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,320
aimed at end users of course everyone

00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:03,279
can look at the map

00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:04,600
and can use what we have there but it's

00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:06,240
not the main purpose of

00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:08,720
openstreetmap.org

00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,320
to be a map site that the whole world

00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,720
can use

00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,919
okay thank you fred so the next question

00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,480
is how about

00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,600
alan moster's views any debate between

00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,640
you and him

00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:21,360
and there is a note also uh someone says

00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,400
i will look

00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:26,720
for a true debate on the versions of osm

00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:29,440
the project and community and if we

00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:32,559
could add some voices opinions from asia

00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:33,600
africa south america uh that would be

00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:35,120
great too so

00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,360
that sounds like a good plan i mean

00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:39,360
there is still some slots available for

00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:41,279
later today or tomorrow so that will be

00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:44,799
something that probably many people

00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:47,520
including me would love to see so

00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:49,440
about alan of course i saw seen his

00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:52,880
slides earlier this morning

00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:54,159
or earlier today and uh and yes i have

00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,480
been one of the

00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:57,200
many many people ellen has spoken to in

00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,240
forming

00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:03,120
his opinions and i

00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,159
sort of in some places i might have been

00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,640
able to sort of

00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:07,919
inform him in one way or the other in

00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:11,200
other places

00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:13,919
he's chosen to listen to other people

00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,600
that's quite normal if you like ellen if

00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:18,000
you if you are relatively

00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,640
new to the ecosystem and you talk to

00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,159
like

00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,799
i don't know what hundreds of people

00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:25,760
he's spoken to on phones and in sessions

00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:26,720
and i'm pretty sure that he has gathered

00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:30,080
input from

00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:34,799
all the continents um so

00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:37,919
yeah i think that he does a good job of

00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:40,960
um of trying to understand uh

00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:43,840
where we are and where we need to go

00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,399
okay thank you fred so the next question

00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,799
will be

00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:48,960
the data seems outside of the point

00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:52,080
google maps is a product

00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:54,480
with definite end users and identify uh

00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,360
goals we don't even have a consistent

00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,000
understanding

00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:59,279
of the users for the website isn't that

00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,159
what confuses people

00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:02,640
about osm how can we better communicate

00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:05,440
what

00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,799
osm is about that's the next question

00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:09,840
right

00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:13,279
yeah there's been long talk

00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:15,840
about changing our website to something

00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:16,799
that puts more focus on the community

00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:19,520
something

00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:20,960
where if you go to openstreetmap.org the

00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:23,520
first thing that you see is

00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:25,279
not a map but instead something that

00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,080
says that hey welcome to our great

00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:28,880
project

00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:30,880
here are some videos of people who

00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,640
explain how great it is to contribute to

00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:35,120
open street map here you can have

00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,720
some some you can see how the community

00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,880
works and how this project works

00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,240
and by the way we also have a map this

00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,720
is an approach that the

00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,159
german openstreeter website

00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:46,640
openstream.de has been

00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:47,440
having for quite a while and it has

00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,840
received

00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,360
mixed responses some people say you know

00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:53,039
i'm not interested in all this

00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:56,080
about community i want a map

00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:58,720
so yeah others say yeah this is this is

00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:00,080
what we should be doing yes i would i

00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,799
would also like that i would also like

00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:03,919
to

00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:06,960
uh to speak to talk more about

00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:09,200
the community and have the map uh

00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,880
also have the map there but with

00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,520
slightly less

00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:15,279
slightly less prominently but this is

00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:17,760
the discussion that that has been

00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:19,039
had in the project okay thank you for

00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:21,520
the answer uh

00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:22,720
fred so the next question will be uh how

00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:26,080
much of your talk

00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:29,440
is osm policy versus your personal

00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:31,679
opinions well

00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,799
so i'm i've been with openstreetmap for

00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:36,080
i don't know what

00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:37,360
couple since openstreetmap was two years

00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:41,919
old or something

00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:45,200
so um i i do not have the power to speak

00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:46,720
for openstreetmap and say uh okay

00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,120
because i'm the boss this is how we're

00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:51,679
gonna do it i can only say

00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,640
uh from my experience uh what the

00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:54,480
project

00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,159
what the correct characteristics of the

00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,720
project

00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:00,640
project have always been like um and

00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:03,600
there's always a question of

00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:05,120
you know tradition versus innovation

00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:07,679
maybe sometimes

00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,480
uh there comes a point where you have to

00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:10,480
throw

00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,000
the ideas of all people like myself

00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,080
overboard and say you know from now on

00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:17,600
we're going to do this differently

00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:19,360
and in other aspects maybe

00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:21,279
you shouldn't throw too much overboard

00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:24,880
because then you stop being open street

00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:26,399
map and you stop being that project that

00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,919
then you can use the essence of

00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:30,880
openstreetmap

00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:32,720
and finding that boundary between those

00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,120
areas where it makes sense to innovate

00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,080
and

00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:37,039
throw away some old ideas and those

00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,880
areas where you

00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:40,399
where the old ideas are actually that

00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,240
what makes openstreetmap

00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:44,880
this great project that has attracted us

00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:47,440
all that's not always easy

00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:49,039
and also a matter of discussion in

00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:51,520
openstreetmap i have

00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:52,720
apart from my role on the data working

00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:56,799
group

00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:58,399
i have no any kind of leading position

00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:59,840
in openstreetmap other than that that

00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:02,240
i've been with the project for a long

00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:06,159
time so

00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:08,320
what i say is not osm policy

00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:10,880
okay thank you fred so the next question

00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:12,720
will be has anyone ever seriously

00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,159
argued that osm should include

00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,799
promotional blur

00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:18,320
for businesses like the dentix example

00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:21,760
you gave

00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:24,799
um argued no

00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:27,919
but i've personally deleted

00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:29,200
thousands of such advertising verbs from

00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:31,919
openstreetmap

00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,559
so people are adding these advertising

00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:34,320
verbs

00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:36,640
they aren't coming to argue with us and

00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:38,240
say hey why well sometimes they do

00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,080
sometimes if you delete their stuff they

00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,440
say hey why have you deleted this

00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:43,519
and then you explain to them and say you

00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:45,120
know we're not for advertising and then

00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:46,399
sometimes they understand sometimes they

00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,559
don't

00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:50,320
most of the time people just dump their

00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:52,320
advertising into openstreetmap and we

00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,760
remove it and we don't hear from them

00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,440
again

00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:58,000
often these are people who create one

00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:01,200
single account for every poi they add so

00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,080
most often i guess seo firms who are

00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:05,600
paid

00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:07,120
to add this advertising to osm so yeah

00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:09,120
we don't have lots of discussions with

00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:12,240
these people but advertising blogs

00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:14,720
are there okay thank you fred

00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,720
so i i will go to a question that has uh

00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:18,640
two uh

00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:20,159
so have you ever visited a mapping

00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:23,600
community in africa

00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:26,640
south america asia that's the question

00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:30,399
um i have been well

00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:32,880
i've been to uh to two suttons in um

00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:33,440
in japan and i have been to one sutton

00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,640
in

00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:38,000
buenos aires so these are my these have

00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,399
been my contacts with

00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,919
mapping communities in these areas

00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:45,120
limited to a

00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:48,240
state of map travel okay

00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:48,960
uh thank you fred then the next question

00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,600
will be

00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,080
uh let's see why couldn't osm also be a

00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,559
business

00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:57,039
directory users need to know what is the

00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:59,600
dentist the grocery when it's open

00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:01,600
full success of uh the rest of earth

00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:04,320
during the coffee crisis

00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:07,200
uh admitted from numbers tax means you

00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:09,919
are more than just a map

00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,480
also question with some comments here

00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:13,840
yes

00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:17,120
um i was i was perhaps a bit uh too

00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:18,240
um to cross in saying not a business

00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,640
directory because

00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,519
yes if there is actually a shop on the

00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,440
ground

00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:25,360
and that shop has a name and that shop

00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,559
has opening hours and maybe a telephone

00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,159
number or something

00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:29,840
then that has valid information to

00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:32,559
contribute to openstreetmap

00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:34,159
however we also have lots of people who

00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:35,679
just want to contribute their online

00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:37,279
businesses to openstreetmap

00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:38,720
because they say you know if you are a

00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:40,159
business directory then

00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,760
and i have this online shop where you

00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:42,240
can order something i want to be on the

00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,519
map

00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,360
and then we say well you know do you

00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:46,960
have an office that is somehow visible

00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,600
from the outside because we only map

00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,840
stuff

00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:51,440
that is actually visible on the ground

00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,159
and then people say no i don't really

00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,720
have a sign

00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:55,840
on my i only do online i have a website

00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:58,159
and that's all i have

00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:59,760
and maybe i have a letter box with some

00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:01,760
mail forwarding or something

00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:04,000
and in these cases we have to say no no

00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:06,080
open street map is not a place for you

00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,840
there's also often conflicts between the

00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:11,119
interests of business owners

00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:13,280
and um and our attempt to um

00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:14,480
to map reality on the ground business

00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:17,679
owners can

00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:19,919
sometimes uh try to

00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:21,119
sort of describe their business in a

00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:23,040
more uh

00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:24,800
in a very creative way where a map is on

00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,720
the ground would then say okay well

00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,399
you know this hotel clearly only has

00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:31,599
five rooms and then the hotel

00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:35,040
says no we have 25 rooms because

00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:38,079
whatever um there is

00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:39,520
sometimes uh so you can add your

00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:42,800
business to open street map

00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:46,079
but you have to accept the supremacy

00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:47,520
of members who will decide what is

00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:49,760
what are the facts on the ground it's

00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:51,440
not you as a business owner

00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,359
and that's the case with most business

00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,960
directories you pay them

00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:56,480
to add your business and then of course

00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,960
you also get to say

00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,920
what they should include what keywords

00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,440
and so on

00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:03,280
whereas an openstreetmap it is us

00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:06,079
mappers who decide

00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,640
what it's added okay thank you for your

00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:09,839
answer

00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:10,480
fred so the next question will be why is

00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:14,160
there an

00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:16,880
us and them approach in how people uses

00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:18,000
osm whether it is civic tech or

00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:20,320
humanitarian

00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,320
surely there is just human engagement

00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:25,760
with the project

00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:29,359
yeah that's a very meta meta

00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:32,400
thing um it sometimes happens

00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:35,040
sometimes people come come to us with an

00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:36,000
us versus them approach to start with

00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,640
they say

00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,640
you are doing this wrong i know how to

00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,800
do it better and i'm going to tell you

00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:44,160
and that's basically establishing the us

00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,960
versus them from from the

00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,839
onset if someone comes to osm and says

00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,040
hey great

00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:50,800
it's great what are you doing i want to

00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:52,480
be a member of openstreetmap i want to

00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,000
participate

00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:56,079
and then even if they have differing

00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,079
opinions they will be able to influence

00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:59,520
the project in certain ways and then

00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:03,440
it's not us versus them

00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:05,200
but then it's a

00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,880
finding of this making of decisions

00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:08,640
inside the community

00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:11,040
i think personally i think that us

00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:13,520
versus them very much depends on

00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,160
how people approach openstreetmap if

00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,320
they

00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:18,400
if they say well we are building this

00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:20,000
small group of people here

00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,440
and we're doing something and then let's

00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,640
upload that into openstreetmap or

00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:25,119
something then there's

00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:26,160
inherently in us versus them because

00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:28,720
they are not

00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:30,160
fully interacting with openstreetmap but

00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:33,359
yeah these are

00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:34,560
these are often just small gradual

00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:38,079
different differences

00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:41,200
and every them can also become an us

00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:43,680
after a while all right

00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:45,200
um the next question afraid would be uh

00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:48,320
couldn't osm

00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:49,280
as a whole attract just as much or more

00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:52,640
funding as the

00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:56,960
humanitarian groups uh do except that

00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:56,960
osmf has not wanted this funding

00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:01,440
yes the openstreetmap foundation could

00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:04,960
probably

00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:09,119
attract more funding if they try to um

00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:11,599
they do not currently envision

00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:13,599
areas where they would spend that amount

00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:15,119
of money because once you start doing

00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:17,760
that

00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:20,079
you become beholden to those givers of

00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:22,960
money and you become dependent on them

00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:23,680
so in the humanitarian world you often

00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:26,640
have

00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:28,400
projects with uh with a well-defined

00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,480
lifetime so you say okay

00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:32,320
let's attract funding for this

00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,040
particular project which has a lifetime

00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:35,119
of two

00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,400
years and we're going to need five

00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:38,800
full-time

00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,760
staffers and then we we can run this

00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,680
project we need so

00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:43,200
much funds and please give us money and

00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:45,839
then it runs for two years

00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:47,119
and then it's over and then you do

00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:49,440
something else or you don't

00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:52,400
um openstreetmap cannot doesn't have

00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:55,520
this luxury where we say you know

00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:59,119
because we we we always need to

00:37:55,520 --> 00:38:00,560
continue we cannot kind of say oh no we

00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:03,119
don't have funding for this year so

00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:06,560
we'll just stop the database servers

00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:07,839
so that's that's slight difference

00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:10,160
between the osmf

00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:11,119
and and humanitarian organizations i

00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:14,560
guess

00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:15,920
but i think with the new board and

00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:18,640
the ideas that are currently being

00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:22,160
discussed um the osmf

00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:23,839
might change to a model where they

00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:25,280
use slightly more funding than they did

00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:28,079
in the past

00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:30,000
okay thank you for uh people uh we still

00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:31,839
have uh seven minutes but i don't think

00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,839
we are going to be able to cover all the

00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:36,160
questions actually six minutes now

00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:38,000
so if you see any questions that you

00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:39,520
really want to get answered we are going

00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,160
to be still having i think

00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:44,320
three questions maybe even four please

00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:46,640
add plus one plus two plus three so i

00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:48,880
can focus in those questions in the past

00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:50,400
otherwise um let's see fred can answer

00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:52,400
those after this talk

00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,160
so the next question i will be asking

00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:57,520
right now also will be having

00:38:54,160 --> 00:39:00,320
close to people uh asking is why

00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:02,400
did you go against the underground rule

00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:05,119
in crimea

00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,839
yeah that's um that's a very hard

00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:08,320
decision

00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:09,520
uh the uh the underground rule would

00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:12,480
actually dictate

00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:13,839
that crimea is mapped as exclusively

00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:16,640
russian territory

00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:18,240
because it is definitely occupied by

00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:22,240
russian troops

00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:24,079
um when this first happened

00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:26,160
people started when when crimea was

00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:29,280
invaded by russians

00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:31,119
we first um there was some edit warning

00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:33,680
going on and we said you know people

00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:34,160
let's just for for the time being let's

00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,320
just

00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:37,280
make premiere part of both the ukraine

00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:39,359
and

00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:41,920
russia so that you know there's not too

00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:44,079
much fighting and this has proven to be

00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:47,040
a compromise that

00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:47,920
uh in at least the russian community in

00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:50,400
open street map

00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:51,839
and the russian community the ukrainian

00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,359
community and openstreetmap could

00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:54,880
live with they weren't they both were

00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:56,240
not perfectly happy but it was a

00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:59,280
compromise and it was

00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:59,920
acceptable to both and it's a violation

00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:02,800
of the

00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:04,400
on the ground rule and then this boiled

00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,000
up again and people said yeah we really

00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,720
have to sort of change this and then we

00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,640
said okay

00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:10,480
yeah we have to change it exclusively

00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,760
russian and everyone was so unhappy

00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,839
about this and then

00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,880
the board decided to receive the data

00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:19,520
working group's

00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:22,960
decision and put back the old compromise

00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:25,440
personally i'm happy with that because

00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:26,960
it provides the most peace and the best

00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:29,119
peace in the community and i don't want

00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:32,079
the community to fight

00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:34,560
um it's not it's technically a violation

00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:36,560
of our on the ground rule

00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:38,720
but then again every rule can have

00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:41,119
exceptions and i think

00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:42,880
it proves that we are it's okay to be

00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:43,520
flexible now and then and say okay you

00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:45,599
know there's

00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:48,160
yes normally we have this rule but we

00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:50,960
also make an exception

00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:52,480
thank you fred for your answer so the

00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:56,640
last question i think i will be

00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:59,200
uh heading to uh fred is should the osmf

00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:01,839
been working with press to counteract

00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:06,079
business conceptions or at least attempt

00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:08,720
to have as much press coverage as hot

00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:09,760
i would very much like the osmf to do

00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:13,040
more work

00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:14,800
in the press and to to be more aware of

00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:16,720
uh what is being said about

00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,000
openstreetmap and then also get involved

00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,839
in the discussion

00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,240
i think it's probably just a manpower

00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:24,319
issue or a person power issue

00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:25,520
um we have a communications working

00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:27,760
group um

00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:29,280
and it would basically fall into the

00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,880
realm of the communications working

00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,520
group to start initiatives like that

00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,079
where they say

00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:35,200
well let's let's do a bit more let's see

00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:36,480
what people are saying about

00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:39,200
openstreetmap let's

00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:41,119
not only retweet stuff but also become

00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:45,119
involved in the discussions

00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:46,640
but that is an awful a lot of work

00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:49,680
and we currently just don't have the

00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:51,200
volunteers to do it

00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:52,880
thank you friends so i think that's the

00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:54,480
last question if uh

00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:56,720
fred you could put the rest of the

00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:59,359
questions in the past and

00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:00,800
write in some other way to communicate

00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:02,480
the answers that you have that would be

00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,880
great because we still have

00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:06,960
