Map Kibera has been working for the past two years with some of Kenyaâ€™s county governments to create maps of their primary features and funded projects. After implementing a Participatory Budgeting process, these counties realized that without good maps it was difficult for people to not only allocate resources, but to work with citizens to identify needs and prioritize funds. Map Kibera has been assisting counties to map key features and projects in OSM by working with youth from the local communities. The maps not only serve to connect citizens to the budgeting process and hold county government accountable for the funded projects, but, they have also become central to county functions in all areas. This talk will share all about the process used and outcomes.

Map Kibera has been helping communities map out their local projects by collecting data and creating digital maps that they can use for planning and decision making. The Participatory Budget Mapping project was conducted in 3 counties in Kenya: West Pokot, Baringo and Makueni. These counties had already been part of an annual process of participatory budgeting, with locals weighing in on how budgets should be spent in their counties. 

In early 2018, Map Kibera along with partner GroundTruth Initiative began working with the World Bank in Kenya to initiate Community Participatory Mapping, by training the local citizens on how to map their county-funded projects using OpenStreetMap, Open Data Kit, and Kobo Toolbox. The project also enabled citizens to track the progress and quality of those projects, allowing them to hold the government accountable for delivering what had been promised during the budgeting sessions. The results of the mapping are displayed on a dedicated website and printed maps for budgeting sessions, which often take place in rural villages.

The project has been able to:
1. Visualize existing and/or new government-funded (county and national level) development projects which will enable the counties to know which projects have been completed, which are in progress and the projects that are pending. 
2. Perform a needs assessment analysis through the Participatory Budget meetings where the counties engage the citizens and together determine the distributions of the projects.
3. Assist citizens to monitor progress of projects and hold the government accountable for delivering on its promises.
4. Transfer knowledge of mapping in OSM to county government representatives directly, in offices of M&E, GIS, ICT, and Budgeting.

Using OpenStreetMap and sharing the data with the counties is a huge milestone for Map Kibera as this will encourage more institutions and people using OpenStreetMap within both communities and county government. This session will share the process and tools being used in the project and early outcomes.

hello everyone my name is Erika Hagan

00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,490
and

00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,470
I'm gonna be talking to you about

00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:20,310
participatory budgeting and mapping with

00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:22,560
OpenStreetMap in Kenya that map Kibera

00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:25,410
and ground truth initiative have been

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:29,430
doing together over the past couple of

00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:31,619
years this right here is the I guess the

00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:36,120
male side of a participatory budgeting

00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:39,660
meeting in rural Kenya participatory

00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:42,570
budgeting is when people take part in

00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:44,339
deciding budget priorities for their

00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:47,339
community so they actually allocate

00:00:44,339 --> 00:00:55,379
portions of the government budget and

00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:56,309
help decide where it should go just a

00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:59,010
little background

00:00:56,309 --> 00:01:01,739
this is Kibera Nairobi is informal

00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:07,490
settlements where matka barrage ated my

00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:12,200
partner McHale and I started in 2009 and

00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:12,200
the organization still ongoing today

00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:23,310
back in 2009 13 youth from Kibera puts

00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:29,460
their community on the map using GPS

00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:32,070
devices paper and OpenStreetMap so the

00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:36,289
Chimera slum is home to around quarter

00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:36,289
of a million people in Nairobi and

00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:45,500
more recent appearance of Kibera on the

00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:49,850
on OpenStreetMap with a little close-up

00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:52,159
of some of the things mapped you can go

00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:56,740
ahead and have a look anytime it's kind

00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,740
of in the southwest part of Nairobi

00:01:57,939 --> 00:02:02,929
Kibera a news network

00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:06,069
also is part of map Kabara this is a

00:02:02,929 --> 00:02:10,190
video team doing media and reporting on

00:02:06,069 --> 00:02:13,370
issues of relevance to the camara people

00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:17,299
including issues that are demonstrated

00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:19,310
on the map as well and one of our

00:02:17,299 --> 00:02:22,160
principles is giving data back and

00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:24,200
information access this is my colleague

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:27,799
Lucy fondo who will be speaking in a

00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:30,380
moment handing out a school's map one of

00:02:27,799 --> 00:02:33,170
our sort of more important projects we

00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:34,940
feel that we've worked on lately past

00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:37,780
several years is mapping all the

00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:40,370
informal schools which there are many in

00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:43,880
Kibera and also other informal

00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:46,100
settlements in Nairobi these education

00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:49,489
providers cover when government isn't

00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:52,670
providing education as mandated to

00:02:49,489 --> 00:02:56,000
children in these areas so that's a

00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:57,500
schoolteacher in one of our schools we

00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,400
always work with community members

00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:03,920
directly and they do all of the work and

00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,780
train and then also we engage people in

00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,319
the community such as these school

00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:11,120
leaders who are trying to advocate for

00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:14,540
resources for themselves and advocate

00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:18,530
for what citizens want in challenging

00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:20,060
settings but what about in the rural

00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:21,739
part of the country so we've spent the

00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:24,739
better part of ten years working in

00:03:21,739 --> 00:03:29,269
urban environments primarily and mapping

00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:32,480
them and a couple years ago we were

00:03:29,269 --> 00:03:36,680
invited to work with the World Bank to

00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:39,109
map participatory budgeting allocations

00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:44,959
that is projects that people had decided

00:03:39,109 --> 00:03:48,250
on in rural parts of Kenya so now I will

00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,250
hand it over to Lucy

00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:55,490
hello my name is Lucy fondos and I've

00:03:52,640 --> 00:04:00,050
been working with math Kabira since 2009

00:03:55,490 --> 00:04:03,650
and on this project I happen to be one

00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:06,980
of the training trainers and for sure it

00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:08,990
was a great experience interacting with

00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:11,870
the different youth from the different

00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:16,340
counties and also interacting with some

00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:20,600
of the government officials yeah so to

00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:24,920
begin with as you can see from the slide

00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:27,860
we have the rural counties and map

00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:31,420
Kabira was privileged to work with some

00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:35,750
of the three counties that World Bank

00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:38,870
was able to shame the government

00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:41,120
officials on the public participation

00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:44,660
process for which they were to go back

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,400
to these counties that is a West pocket

00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:49,850
Marinko and McWeeny

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:56,960
to teach their local communities on the

00:04:49,850 --> 00:05:00,640
process of public participation from the

00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:03,530
picture we can see a group of women and

00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:07,580
they've attended a public budget

00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:10,850
participation meeting and we can see the

00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:13,280
women are discussing on their budget

00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:15,350
priorities they had to despair

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:18,229
discussing on the budget priorities

00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:22,040
since the county officials or

00:05:18,229 --> 00:05:25,930
authorities were were able to engage

00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:29,840
them in discussions so that they can

00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:34,610
prioritize the problem the projects that

00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:40,640
they want to be put across there there

00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:43,930
are County so with the mapping County

00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:47,690
projects weibull's to map projects lake

00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:51,620
Budda Budda sheds schools and water

00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:54,500
points so we were tasked with like going

00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:57,680
to the field and having the accurate

00:05:54,500 --> 00:06:00,620
information of this project since it

00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,800
will be it will help in tracking of

00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:04,560
these projects

00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:08,310
to identify whether their projects have

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:10,830
come are complete have day's stalled or

00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:16,379
their own grain so it was very important

00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:21,479
to capture this project very well in the

00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:25,919
next slide you can see the open data kit

00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:30,740
interface map chabela was called upon to

00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:34,490
do some data gathering since initially

00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:37,580
there it was hard to like have

00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:41,210
documentation of this project because

00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:45,539
read their residence or citizen

00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:48,360
dependent dependent on drawing the map

00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:51,180
on the ground and they had to like have

00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:54,830
a rough idea of where exactly these

00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:57,659
projects are so it is opened a packet

00:06:54,830 --> 00:07:00,750
interface it was a good platform for

00:06:57,659 --> 00:07:03,690
storing the data that can be used for

00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:07,620
future reference and also the county

00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:10,710
officials would use the platform to

00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:13,590
track some of this information apart

00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:18,690
from that it was also a platform for us

00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:23,810
for creating our project like coming up

00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:23,810
with questionnaires about the project

00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:37,130
after preparing the data that we did on

00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:40,860
open data kit we went ahead and did

00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:44,849
preparations on how to like go to the

00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:48,680
field and what happened was we had to

00:07:44,849 --> 00:07:51,509
like mobilize different teams every day

00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:54,150
since they are going to different

00:07:51,509 --> 00:07:59,130
locations and from the picture you can

00:07:54,150 --> 00:08:02,219
see we are trying to set up the phone

00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:04,590
since it was the one that we used to

00:08:02,219 --> 00:08:08,130
collect data from the field so it was

00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:08,759
very important for us every day to do a

00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:13,110
setup

00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:15,570
to avoid like doing mistakes on the

00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:19,470
field so that team as you see

00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:22,140
is about to go to their field hello

00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:25,110
again and Thank You Lucy here we're

00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:26,760
gonna play a short video showing what it

00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:27,160
was like to do the field mapping and

00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:31,570
then we'll come back

00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:34,250
[Music]

00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:37,370
after mapping projects and points of

00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:39,890
interest in what a McWeeny county map

00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:48,079
keeping a team headed to morning the

00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:52,459
second Ward Peter Lucy Zack and I the

00:08:48,079 --> 00:08:55,130
road to money was not good enough one

00:08:52,459 --> 00:09:01,550
and a half hours drive we arrived at key

00:08:55,130 --> 00:09:04,399
kima the sub would admin office Zack

00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:12,769
leads a recap session from the previous

00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:16,279
training exercise soon after I follow

00:09:12,769 --> 00:09:19,040
group 11 we take a pro boxcar towards

00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:22,279
the northwest mountainside in order to

00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:24,860
start from the farthest end going

00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:28,360
through the forest moving from school to

00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:31,820
school damn - damn

00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:38,000
sometimes it was easy sometimes it was

00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:41,120
hard sometimes it was cold

00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,570
sometimes it was warm sometimes we used

00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,570
the car

00:09:49,360 --> 00:10:02,300
sometimes we use the motorbike sometimes

00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:06,710
we just walked at the Moony we meet the

00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:14,690
chief seongun mapping is very essential

00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:16,690
to the area because I will do mapping it

00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:22,840
will assist very much

00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:26,450
we put identifying of the projects and

00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:30,730
we joined in now area people including

00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:30,730
school heads cooperated so well with us

00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:35,840
the two of the mapping

00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:39,620
I followed group six to map jicama

00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:42,890
projects and facilities day three it was

00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:52,060
serious editing at tsumugu hotel in

00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:55,790
water yeah I was in group in lemon I

00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:59,690
went with madam Ruth the food is good

00:10:55,790 --> 00:11:02,390
and we really enjoyed though we come up

00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:05,510
we come across some challenges which are

00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:11,360
obvious the terrain in bony is very

00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:15,620
stiff some areas to go the the yard

00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:16,390
steep so clapping those hills is not

00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:19,880
easy

00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:24,680
yeah it is it is surprising for me

00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:27,740
because actually a map in my home the

00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:32,060
people home I'm consulting with the

00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:34,630
projects are my people I know them I've

00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:39,860
been able to learn how to use the GPS

00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:45,560
how to use the hot DK and how to upload

00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:49,820
the to OpenStreetMap and do some editing

00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:51,410
the morning and the June 7 I would like

00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:53,060
to congratulate them protecting the

00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:55,430
youths especially the youths to

00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:57,140
undertake the course not the grown-ups

00:11:55,430 --> 00:12:00,290
because the youth are the future of

00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:03,080
tomorrow I just wish they would just map

00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:04,730
for the sub the watching McQueen and

00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:07,520
least for us to be in a position to

00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:09,650
locate each each each project in

00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:12,920
everyone there's been a nice experience

00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:15,500
a nice opportunity and given another

00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:24,320
chance and more training we can do it

00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:31,870
better map Kabira will be headed next to

00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:34,110
moringa County a winner Joshua cannon

00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:37,850
McWeeny

00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:42,420
[Music]

00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:46,290
after having this data it was a map

00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:50,519
Kabira again hard to put this

00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:53,040
information to a site and from this site

00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:58,110
we were able to have the different

00:12:53,040 --> 00:13:00,480
categories and also again the project it

00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:03,230
showed the status of the project and

00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:07,649
again the websites again would also have

00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:11,550
several like it had several categories

00:13:07,649 --> 00:13:18,420
so if you go on each category you could

00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:22,910
see for example we have a CDE and it has

00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:26,070
information about the EC de we have the

00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:31,560
opinion of the project is it excellent

00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:34,769
and is the project complete they are so

00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:37,880
this is the information that we are able

00:13:34,769 --> 00:13:42,779
to put on the website then we have

00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:46,170
details on there on water projects you

00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:48,839
able to see the opinion from the second

00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:54,149
clip be able to see that the opinion is

00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:57,269
puah so from here I hand over the next

00:13:54,149 --> 00:13:59,000
session to Erica again thank you Thank

00:13:57,269 --> 00:14:03,120
You Lucy

00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:06,209
so taking a look at the website here

00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:08,310
that was created to just kind of bring

00:14:06,209 --> 00:14:11,639
together at the data points so obviously

00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:14,160
an open street map we only had the kind

00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:17,130
of basics and then but we had also

00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:20,600
collected during the survey things like

00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:23,940
the project status and whether it was

00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:27,269
considered in good condition the quality

00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:29,790
level some notes none of that was

00:14:27,269 --> 00:14:31,199
included in OpenStreetMap so we had to

00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:35,250
create this kind of website to bring

00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:37,399
them together as you see here the blue

00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:40,110
dots are actually points of interest so

00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:43,980
alongside all of the project mapping was

00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:46,800
quite a lot of mapping of other features

00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:51,750
base mapping in OSM

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:52,050
I also wanted to mention that while we

00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,910
used

00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:58,320
odk for the data collection we used it

00:14:53,910 --> 00:15:01,110
through Kobo toolbox Kobo is has

00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:05,670
humanitarian version that's free for

00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:08,940
agencies like that and it's it was

00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:11,310
really great to use but there were some

00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:15,120
technical difficulties moving from ODK

00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:17,220
kind of style output up into jaws on and

00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:21,079
I'm happy to talk through how we worked

00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:25,230
through that and actually we are working

00:15:21,079 --> 00:15:27,510
right now with Kobo and a small open

00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:29,910
source development grant to help

00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:32,490
integrate those two systems better and

00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:36,360
make it possible to have the output from

00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:38,160
the ODK Kobo system really match better

00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:40,950
with what jaws um and the tagging system

00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:44,690
need you know SM so we're really excited

00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:46,680
about the potential to use this app

00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:50,730
another really exciting thing that we

00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:54,240
got to do was create this awesome

00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:56,610
offline data sharing initiative so this

00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:00,290
is actually bring gos map being painted

00:15:56,610 --> 00:16:03,810
on a wall in the capital of that county

00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:05,430
including the names of all of the

00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:09,540
different projects that the county has

00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:11,910
done and their status at the time

00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:13,800
whether they've been completed or not so

00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:15,660
anyone could come up and see this and

00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:17,160
check it out and see what the county's

00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:19,380
been doing and whether the things that

00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:21,149
they intended in their budget

00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:27,870
participatory budgeting sessions have

00:16:21,149 --> 00:16:30,240
been achieved and then we also created

00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:35,190
as we almost always do a print map

00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:38,600
version of that data so this is one of

00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:42,959
the words each word had a separate map

00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:45,779
this shows in green are the projects

00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:48,570
that are completed red is stalled or not

00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:51,089
yet started and all of the different

00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:53,070
sort of departments associated like

00:16:51,089 --> 00:16:56,579
whether it's a water project or a school

00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:58,830
projects or whatnot so this map was

00:16:56,579 --> 00:17:03,120
printed out and actually

00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:05,550
used in in participatory budgeting

00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,650
meetings to see where things were at and

00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:11,100
this is where we could see that the kind

00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:14,370
of process of using this data for

00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:17,670
transparency and accountability was

00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:19,230
really possible because at at any

00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:20,970
participatory budgeting meeting are

00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:24,630
certain officials that are tasked with

00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:26,850
overseeing those meetings and directing

00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:29,340
the process so they were there to

00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:32,130
specifically answer questions like you

00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:34,290
know why was this particular thing not

00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:37,740
done what's going on with the status of

00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:41,100
this project this one here you know

00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:42,450
isn't up to up to our standards or all

00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:45,870
of these kinds of questions could be

00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:48,300
also discussed amongst the community

00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:56,520
members and with relevant officials

00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:58,890
present yeah so let's see this is one of

00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:02,280
the more urban settings for a PV meeting

00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:05,580
with a lot of participants here so now

00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:09,630
on to couple of that text-heavy slides

00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:12,960
here but I think that this project has

00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:15,450
really shown some exciting opportunities

00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,280
for using OpenStreetMap in government in

00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:19,440
local government particularly a lot of

00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,540
times at least in Kenya we've worked

00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,540
trying to look at the national level of

00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:26,700
government because that was where a lot

00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:29,970
of the power was held but this process

00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:32,730
of devolution to the counties which only

00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:35,880
started around a decade ago and has been

00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:37,770
progressing since then has really

00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:40,050
created this kind of more local

00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:44,790
government agency and ability to

00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:47,040
actually develop and execute budgets so

00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:50,640
targeting those county leaders who are

00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:53,309
interested in mapping and in having the

00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:56,340
benefits of mapping has been really

00:18:53,309 --> 00:18:59,460
interesting we actually started out

00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:00,990
working just with the budget departments

00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:03,419
and the finance departments because of

00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:04,679
the PV process and they also had all of

00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:08,880
the data on the projects that have been

00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:10,169
allocated and so forth but as we began

00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,419
to work we realized that these other

00:19:10,169 --> 00:19:15,330
offices really need to be involved like

00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:18,269
planning and lands it where possible if

00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:19,759
there's a GIS person ICT was a common

00:19:18,269 --> 00:19:24,480
department M&E

00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:26,639
and as well as budgeting so we in our

00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,769
second phase of this work we actually

00:19:26,639 --> 00:19:34,169
started to work a lot more closely with

00:19:28,769 --> 00:19:37,619
these different departments and try to

00:19:34,169 --> 00:19:39,179
kind of integrate this method of mapping

00:19:37,619 --> 00:19:42,799
and it the benefits of open stream up

00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:45,840
into their kind of back-end processes of

00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:47,129
whatever they were doing which is a lot

00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,720
easier when you have governments that

00:19:47,129 --> 00:19:50,909
are kind of still just starting up

00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:55,259
processes and especially technology

00:19:50,909 --> 00:19:57,840
related things they are often still

00:19:55,259 --> 00:19:59,909
developing systems monitoring and

00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,769
evaluation using osm and citizen

00:19:59,909 --> 00:20:03,859
feedback together for like monitoring

00:20:01,769 --> 00:20:06,629
and evaluation was really interesting

00:20:03,859 --> 00:20:11,309
visualizing that status of each project

00:20:06,629 --> 00:20:13,200
and quality demonstrating that citizens

00:20:11,309 --> 00:20:15,769
can be partners to the government for

00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:18,749
mapping and data even when they are also

00:20:15,769 --> 00:20:21,840
doing feedback so that was another kind

00:20:18,749 --> 00:20:23,489
of cool pilot aspect of this was you

00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,379
know really demonstrating to those local

00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:27,359
government officials like what ways they

00:20:25,379 --> 00:20:29,820
can involve citizens they all are

00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:30,809
supposed to involve citizens there's

00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:33,779
this kind of public participation

00:20:30,809 --> 00:20:37,289
mandate they can do it the different

00:20:33,779 --> 00:20:39,090
ways the counties they often maybe don't

00:20:37,289 --> 00:20:40,529
do it very well so this is kind of

00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:42,450
demonstrating how it could actually be

00:20:40,529 --> 00:20:44,730
to their benefit so they don't have like

00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:47,609
budgets for doing mapping most of the

00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:53,580
time they don't have a lot of resources

00:20:47,609 --> 00:20:55,200
so having people take part we think that

00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:59,989
we demonstrated how that can actually be

00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:03,389
kind of efficient for them and we also

00:20:59,989 --> 00:21:06,629
showed we think how the citizens can use

00:21:03,389 --> 00:21:08,429
data to hold officials accountable for

00:21:06,629 --> 00:21:10,559
the status of these projects so really

00:21:08,429 --> 00:21:13,559
showing like those photos and the status

00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:15,629
and the kind of you know whether the

00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:20,669
people had remarked on it as poor or

00:21:15,629 --> 00:21:22,409
high quality was actually meaningful in

00:21:20,669 --> 00:21:24,779
this situation it wasn't just kind of

00:21:22,409 --> 00:21:26,160
abstract or wasn't just kind of people

00:21:24,779 --> 00:21:27,660
trying to show

00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,430
think to government but it was actually

00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:30,960
like the government really needed this

00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:32,220
information they have a monitoring and

00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:40,350
evaluation that they need to do

00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:41,670
themselves let's see and four challenges

00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:45,420
of course there's always a lot of

00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:47,190
challenges the government data literacy

00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:49,610
as you might imagine and technical

00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:52,410
literacy is tends to be quite low

00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:54,660
sometimes they have like an ICT person

00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:56,940
but they tend to hire junior staff for

00:21:54,660 --> 00:22:00,510
these roles it's changing but it depends

00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:01,910
on the county and the government one

00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:06,060
thing that we found a little bit

00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:08,670
difficult was that there was there's one

00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:13,530
positive kind of trend is to establish

00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:16,710
these GIS hire GIS officers use maps in

00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:19,710
general there was this push across the

00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:22,110
counties to create GIS offices but then

00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:24,750
those GIS offices time did to just be

00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:27,050
kind of like a set of computers in a

00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:30,270
particular room with maybe some junior

00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:33,390
GIS officers who are trained only in

00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:33,660
particular maybe ESRI and that was about

00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:36,810
it

00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:37,860
and if they've been exposed to osm all

00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:41,210
the better but a lot of them maybe

00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:44,610
hadn't or even just kind of in

00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:49,530
understanding broader concepts in

00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:52,020
geography and in data management that

00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:56,790
was not necessarily part of what their

00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:59,070
job was so but geo data being kind of

00:22:56,790 --> 00:23:00,450
siloed on almost like well we need a map

00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:03,630
for this we need a map for that we need

00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:07,440
to like create a you know a plan these

00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:09,540
kind of let manage lands and cadastral

00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,640
maps and things like that but not

00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:14,220
connecting that with maybe there are a

00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:16,980
many systems there data management

00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:17,340
systems not really being unified in any

00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:20,040
way

00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:22,500
another interesting challenge we had was

00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:25,950
that donors and organizations funded by

00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:27,810
those donors as well as direct support

00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:30,660
were often going to these counties but

00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:33,660
not in any coordinated way so there

00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:38,370
wasn't necessarily any incentive really

00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:39,500
to so for example like one foundation or

00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:41,810
NGO or

00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:44,030
donar country might pay for like a

00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:46,520
consultant to create an M&E system like

00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:48,320
a digital like just a computer somebody

00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:50,030
to program an M&E system and then

00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,500
separately we're working with the World

00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:55,820
Bank on the participatory budgeting

00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:58,310
mapping which also includes M&E data and

00:23:55,820 --> 00:24:00,370
these two things are kind of running

00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:03,230
simultaneously because the donor the

00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:05,420
donors are kind of not talking to each

00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:07,610
other and then those departments are

00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:10,580
kind of open to whatever wherever they

00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:12,170
can source funding they're kind of

00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:15,040
probably trying to source it because

00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:17,090
they are under-resourced otherwise so

00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:19,690
coordination in general even at this

00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:24,200
pretty local level was very difficult

00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:25,760
and another challenge is just you

00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,530
there's always a challenge explaining

00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:30,560
what the benefits of Open Street Map and

00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:32,150
open data in general will be for

00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,860
governments so I think that just goes

00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:36,770
across the board we worked with these

00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:40,130
pretty progressive counties so they had

00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:42,140
open government policies in place so

00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:44,810
they had this kind of idea that this

00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:46,940
should be a thing so maybe that was

00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:48,310
almost these were the easier ones but

00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:51,320
there's always individuals within that

00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:53,540
those apart those offices who might kind

00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:55,330
of not really agree with it so they

00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:58,670
might kind of put a little bit of a

00:24:55,330 --> 00:25:00,020
speed bump in the way for example so a

00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:04,450
lot of these are just common things to

00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:06,800
working with government and data

00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:08,720
citizens are not typically part of any

00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:10,250
of these processes certainly not data

00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:14,030
production but not necessarily even

00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:15,710
consumption of data so you know we

00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:17,240
really wanted to create this kind of use

00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:21,770
case that could show how this was a

00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:23,750
win-win situation really for the local

00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:25,700
governments you get data and maps that

00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:27,680
they wanted and for citizens to also be

00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:31,400
able to track was going on and plan

00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:33,110
better for their County financial

00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:35,290
management systems also don't

00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:37,880
necessarily exist or they're not digital

00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:40,490
this is all the digitization of

00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:45,380
government's just kind of happening now

00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:46,520
so working within that a challenge but

00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:50,660
um

00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:53,630
yeah I would welcome your questions now

00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:56,990
and right there on is the actual

00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:59,929
counties it's just on map chimera github

00:25:56,990 --> 00:26:02,000
right now this is still considered a

00:25:59,929 --> 00:26:03,350
pilot so we're hoping to progress as

00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
soon as we can but of course

00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:08,080
participatory budgeting meetings are on

00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:23,710
hold due to Kovan right now in Kenya so

00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:26,090
perhaps next year hi thanks so much

00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:30,650
Erica and Lucy for such a wonderful

00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:32,390
presentation really learnt a lot during

00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:36,710
that talk and can see that there's a

00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:38,750
little questions coming through so if

00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:40,760
you don't have the pod open if you go to

00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:43,040
the session description on the program

00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:46,100
then you can open up see other people's

00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:47,179
questions and add your own but I'm going

00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:49,850
to start walking through some of these

00:26:47,179 --> 00:26:52,660
now before doing that have to mention

00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:56,600
Erica so pleased to see the hat the

00:26:52,660 --> 00:27:01,370
symbol of state of 2020 has made it into

00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:04,309
this this session I'm gonna kick off

00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:06,260
with a question for you and then maybe

00:27:04,309 --> 00:27:09,950
if you can guide me to pass it around

00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:12,500
different members of the team after that

00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:14,570
if relevant and so the first question

00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:17,300
and that came through was a question

00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:18,020
around what software platforms that

00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:21,830
you've used

00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:24,020
besides OS m in your project so just

00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:28,520
women if you can kick us off by doing

00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:31,790
that sure um hopefully you can hear me

00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:33,670
yes I I thought I would bring this hat

00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:38,450
back

00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:39,920
for your enjoyment um so we as as

00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:42,950
mentioned later probably after that

00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:46,280
question was asked we use odk collects

00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:50,179
the actual odk collect app and then Cobo

00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:55,820
toolbox it's sort of like a front end

00:27:50,179 --> 00:27:57,830
relief or odk so yeah that's that's uh

00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:59,960
that's that's those are the tool that

00:27:57,830 --> 00:28:02,630
we've primarily used and then

00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:04,310
he also had to convert theta into

00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:07,580
something that osm could better

00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:15,980
understand after we took it out of OT k

00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:18,950
they also use Huck so proxy we got a

00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:21,200
little tougher time to turn kind of

00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:23,510
automatically translate our spreadsheet

00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:27,500
into something we could work with in

00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:31,940
jasm so then we use jaws own we used

00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:33,380
yeah I guess that's all the tools great

00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:34,910
um thanks for that and then there's

00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:38,540
another follow-on question that's kind

00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:42,650
of related which is just asking if

00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:47,020
you've had problems with ODK and if so

00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:47,020
how had you gone about overcoming those

00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:56,840
well yes that's I mean I think that Cobo

00:28:52,820 --> 00:29:01,610
the interface is really helpful for

00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:03,110
working more easily with odk but so you

00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:05,150
know we I guess we had the initial kind

00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:07,400
of trouble with like just getting odk

00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:08,840
started and working with it and then

00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:10,630
that kind of removed that trouble

00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:14,180
because it helps you to create surveys

00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:17,320
pretty easily and especially really

00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:19,610
complicated ones like we were doing so

00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:20,780
yeah those that was the main problem we

00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:22,340
had first head but then there was also

00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:24,710
the fact that it sort of speaks a

00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:28,790
different language than osm it's not it

00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:30,890
doesn't speak tags we had to really work

00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:32,900
hard at kind of getting the output to be

00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:36,500
as close as possible to what Jotham

00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:39,560
would be able to take in in terms of the

00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:41,150
tagging structure so I'm happy to like

00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:42,860
share with anybody how what we went

00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:44,780
through but that's why we decided to

00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:47,690
pursue this grant to try to actually

00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:49,160
make the integration butter and I'm also

00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:53,000
happy to talk with anybody about what

00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:55,910
we're actually planning to do there yeah

00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,920
so yeah it's channel it doesn't if

00:29:55,910 --> 00:30:00,650
you're not super techie it's not that

00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:04,670
easy to work with between the two and

00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:06,260
maybe even if you are but we we made it

00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:10,090
work and we're happy with it we've used

00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:10,090
it on other projects um since

00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:16,580
I'm great and thanks for that

00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:18,260
explanation I'm so I can see people

00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:22,160
still editing away questions if these

00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:24,770
keep continue adding them in another

00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:31,040
question which is come in from geo

00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:34,820
Donnie in Taiwan asking so is OSM better

00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:45,500
than Google in Kenya by now so turning

00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:49,580
that over to the team well yes I'm just

00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:51,230
gonna answer that one I would say that

00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:53,690
it kind of depends on what you're

00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:55,960
mapping so we've put a lot of effort

00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:58,940
into mapping certain parts of Kenya and

00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:00,380
specifically a lot of Nairobi a lot of

00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:04,070
the informal settlements and then these

00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:07,250
counties so it might depend on the place

00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:09,440
there are certain businesses that might

00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:13,220
be more likely to be found on Google map

00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:15,740
at this point in Nairobi for example but

00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:17,600
we are working on but so it depends what

00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:24,110
you're using it for but I would say in

00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:26,090
general yes perfect thanks for that so

00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:28,910
I'm just doing a time check of where

00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:31,970
we've got about ten minutes left in this

00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:34,970
session so still time to get through a

00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:37,070
few more questions so one of the

00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:41,780
questions that has come in from someone

00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:44,870
says you produce fantastic Maps how much

00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:48,890
training did people need to be able to

00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:51,740
create them and with any of your maps do

00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:57,620
you show financial or budget information

00:31:51,740 --> 00:32:00,110
on on the maps themselves well let me

00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:01,400
well I'll answer the second part and

00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:02,960
then I'll pass it so let me see for the

00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:05,150
first part just route the budget

00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:07,820
information actually we did integrate

00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:13,370
budget data into the participatory

00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:17,630
budgeting map sort of visual the the

00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:22,700
website so yes sometimes we do but not

00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:26,140
that information is not in OSM Lucy you

00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:26,140
want to talk about the training aspect

00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:51,620
can you hear us Lucy you're not sure she

00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:54,830
heard you there Lucy oh sorry I think

00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:57,290
the question was yeah talking about the

00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:59,480
tree yeah yeah how much training have

00:32:57,290 --> 00:33:01,580
you been providing to people in order to

00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:09,500
be able to create the maps that you

00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:13,940
showed in the presentation you're asking

00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:22,430
like how much training we've been giving

00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:27,830
to people yeah yeah okay it depends on

00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:30,620
the duration of the of the project most

00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:35,270
of the time we usually take like around

00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:41,060
three weeks yeah yeah three weeks is

00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:45,410
enough yeah depending on the duration of

00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:51,440
the project it can even take longer but

00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:56,200
it just depends yeah great okay so what

00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:56,200
a lot of them of training sessions then

00:33:57,790 --> 00:34:02,840
but I think that includes the mapping

00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:05,630
itself right Lucy like the training

00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:19,400
process is less classroom and more kind

00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:23,600
of go follow-up actually on this which

00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:26,810
is for example to create the maps in

00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:31,720
huges is that something your team does

00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:33,950
or you training new people to do that or

00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:36,110
yeah is that something you're doing or

00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:38,369
are you training others Oh for the for

00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:40,829
the print maps for example

00:34:38,369 --> 00:34:44,700
maybe that's what they need the the

00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:47,339
print maps have varied yes we we have

00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:49,950
team members who work with the data and

00:34:47,339 --> 00:34:51,869
queue just for example but that would be

00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:55,619
our like lead team members so they've

00:34:51,869 --> 00:34:56,999
been working on mapping for years so we

00:34:55,619 --> 00:34:59,640
haven't gotten to the point where we

00:34:56,999 --> 00:35:02,099
could train people in the field too much

00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:04,019
or just you know our typical mapper is

00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:06,690
learning how to edit in jaws um so

00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:10,619
that's already a big step and that's

00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:14,249
usually but connecting companies to

00:35:10,619 --> 00:35:17,460
learn more GIS and software is always

00:35:14,249 --> 00:35:22,859
always out there too for the really

00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:26,369
motivated these website you saw ground

00:35:22,859 --> 00:35:29,339
truth created that and mostly McHale

00:35:26,369 --> 00:35:36,059
created that we'd be basically pull in

00:35:29,339 --> 00:35:38,279
wherever you need the talent yeah so so

00:35:36,059 --> 00:35:40,170
I'm just looking at the time we probably

00:35:38,279 --> 00:35:41,969
have time for one more question before

00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:46,559
we need to switch over for the next

00:35:41,969 --> 00:35:50,339
session so I'm gonna ask a question for

00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:52,380
Lucy which says you mentioned that

00:35:50,339 --> 00:35:58,109
you've been working with map Cabarrus

00:35:52,380 --> 00:36:01,440
since 2009 so we wanted to alright how

00:35:58,109 --> 00:36:05,549
how have attitudes to osm changed in

00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:08,099
Kenya since 2009 and how have you got

00:36:05,549 --> 00:36:14,219
buy-in with local government for your

00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:18,440
projects come again please so the first

00:36:14,219 --> 00:36:21,809
bit was about how attitudes towards

00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:29,940
OpenStreetMap and have changed in Kenya

00:36:21,809 --> 00:36:33,089
since 2009 and then the do you want to

00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:37,589
answer that piece first yeah lemme

00:36:33,089 --> 00:36:39,509
answer that um yeah it's a it's a true

00:36:37,589 --> 00:36:43,430
that have been working with map Kabira

00:36:39,509 --> 00:36:47,329
since 2009 and from what I've seen since

00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:52,170
2009 we've been able to like involve

00:36:47,329 --> 00:36:57,270
different groups like making them

00:36:52,170 --> 00:37:00,480
be contributors on OSM and an example is

00:36:57,270 --> 00:37:03,600
that we've been able to recruit youths

00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:05,400
from different parts of Kenya and also

00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:08,550
outside Kenya and also we've been able

00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:13,260
to engage with different groups from

00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:16,110
different organizations yeah so from my

00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:19,050
side I can say that we've had great a

00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:25,650
big number of contributors contributing

00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:28,320
to OpenStreetMap yeah yes so the

00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:32,420
response has been great people have like

00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:36,750
been contributing more and more yeah

00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:39,540
great that's great here right so I'm

00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:41,580
just looking at the time we need to

00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:44,850
close the session now to leave some time

00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:46,590
to switch over for the next session so

00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:50,820
actually the next session is going to be

00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:53,400
so in this in this same in track 2 with

00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:56,580
Erica talking again about sustainability

00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:58,230
