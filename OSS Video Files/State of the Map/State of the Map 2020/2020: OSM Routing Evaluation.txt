Title: 2020: OSM Routing Evaluation
Publication date: 2020-07-18
Playlist: State of the Map 2020
Description: 
	https://media.ccc.de/v/sotm2020-4348-osm-routing-evaluation



This talk will present an evaluation of different OSM routing software and its impact on the journey. Several popular OSM routing software results will be evaluated on its route-cost (distance and or time) and different modes of transportation (from walking to motor-vehicle). Additional evaluation on the ground will also evaluate which route is a good (or bad) one and what may cause this impact.

There have been multiples OSM routing services that are available, from offline to online. While this situation gives people many options to choose from it may also confuse people on which service they should choose or use. 

This talk is an effort to evaluate these services on different modes of transportation. The evaluation is not only on the routing result but also on when the route is used in real-life scenarios. It tries to answer practical questions such as what is the routing service that provides the best result for walking? Or is it better to use Graphopper or OSRM for car navigation? Different OSM routing services will be evaluated using several start-end points and what do the results look like. How do different routing service results in shorter or longer distance/time and what may have caused it? Surely the journey in the real situation will be presented as well.  While the answers highly depend on several factors (such as road tag completeness, local road rules, and time of traveling), this talk will be a good overview for the audience that wants to know more about routing services in OSM. No technical knowledge is necessary.

hello

00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:14,400
so welcome back um

00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,880
and we're now going to start our next

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,760
talk

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:23,039
so this is antisa reviewing three of the

00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:26,400
routing engines of openstreetmap

00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:29,279
and their experience uh reviewing them

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,400
and the different use cases just to

00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,040
remind you if you

00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,719
click the link to the title of the talk

00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,800
and there's a link to the session pad

00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:40,000
where you can ask questions

00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:42,800
but hello everyone thank you for

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,239
watching this talk uh first i'd like to

00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,840
introduce myself my name is

00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:49,840
yantisa ahadi i'm from osm indonesia

00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,600
and currently i'm also work for kojec

00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,920
one of the biggest ride sharing in

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,960
indonesia and also in the region

00:00:53,920 --> 00:01:00,320
so in this talk i will focus more about

00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,120
how if you're using osm data what's the

00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,159
result

00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:06,560
of different routing engine

00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,000
using the same data using the same

00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,920
starting point using the same

00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:16,960
endpoint on different mode of transport

00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,960
like walking by car or uh by

00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:21,600
other modes of transport and also by

00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,720
area type so how i would like to do the

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,759
experiment

00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:28,799
uh first uh i'm choosing the routing

00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:30,720
engine itself that i'm going to test

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,159
the graph operator and i think it's

00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,880
already like pretty obvious choice

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,680
because both

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,000
of this routing engine is available in

00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,159
the main openstreetmap website

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,119
and i would like to add uh open route

00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,920
surface as well

00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:44,880
as a comparison and also alternative to

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,759
test

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,600
i think the quick reason of why i choose

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,759
these three because they have

00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,439
like all of them have like a really good

00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:57,759
interface that we can use

00:01:53,439 --> 00:02:00,320
and see how the routes looks like

00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:02,799
for the mod of transport itself i'm

00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:06,000
comparing between walking and by car

00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:11,039
i cannot add also

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:14,560
bicycle in it due to the it's

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:16,640
quite unsafe if i may say in jakarta

00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,640
in indonesia the area where i live

00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,599
because not necessarily all area have

00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,400
their own like

00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:23,599
bicycle lane and i'm also unfamiliar in

00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,879
riding bicycle

00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:28,080
uh to navigate in my own area usually i

00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:31,360
took a motorcycle

00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:35,120
or drive a car or

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:38,160
or even walks and i'm also

00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,560
thinking to add on testing this

00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:43,200
uh routing engine into different area

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,599
type not necessarily it's specific to

00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,400
urban only suburb only but it can be

00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,400
like mix

00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,319
between suburb countryside urban oregon

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,200
like three of them

00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:53,760
so before i start let me explain a bit

00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,080
of the

00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:59,599
technical bits here from the graph opera

00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,599
srm and open service because

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,440
to understand more about what's the

00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,319
background like the graph hopper

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,159
and all open route surface is developed

00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,400
using java programming language

00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:12,159
or srm it's the only thing that's

00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,280
different because it's developed and

00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:17,360
using c plus and from the version

00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,560
itself you can see like three of them is

00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,239
like pretty

00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,920
actively developed and then they also

00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,400
have like different

00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,440
features that you can explore more but

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,920
yeah i think this

00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,720
like some of the key highlights of the

00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,480
feature that

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:37,440
each of the routing engine have

00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,879
some feature may also similar with

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,239
others or like they have the same

00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,159
feature but not necessarily like the

00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:45,040
result will be the same as

00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,000
it will be proven by by my

00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,599
experimentation

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,799
on these tops so uh

00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,280
i'll i'd like to test sorry i'd like to

00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,640
test

00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,560
about uh how graph hover perform

00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,159
how each of the routing engine perform

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,840
in the

00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,439
three different types of scenario this

00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,159
is the first one that is daily commute

00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,000
because

00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:08,159
i am sure that this is like the type of

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,120
the traveling that

00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:13,120
you take the most frequent especially if

00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,599
you have like a fixed

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,759
workplace so this is like the route that

00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:20,320
you'll take daily

00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,600
so what can i say about the result of

00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,680
this the first one

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,199
is that the graph of retain the

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,080
coordinates so if you type in the

00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,520
coordinate then

00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:33,199
it will skip on the coordinates uh

00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:35,520
as it is so there is no like a geo code

00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:38,000
of the coordinate like if giving you the

00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:41,520
address no but it still give you

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,800
uh the chord the

00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,840
original coordinates and although this

00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,240
may

00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,080
be customizable like there may be a menu

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,880
and to change this but in the default

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,320
setting

00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,040
uh the only like this is the coordinate

00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:59,120
that's still

00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:01,120
being displayed and the second one

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,960
about the route itself i was thinking

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,639
that this is more of the route

00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,280
this is actually the route that i take

00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:10,960
every day this is a really good

00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,440
and short route i mean i can vouch for

00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,720
that

00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,360
but if i may say that this is also the

00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,600
route that

00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,440
requiring local knowledge so if you're

00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,120
new in this area this is not route that

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,080
i would suggest because

00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,120
this is really popular route so then

00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,400
it's pretty prac

00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:31,840
it's pretty packed like uh

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,800
there are so many cars and motorcycle

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,039
passing in the

00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,800
in this routes as you can see here this

00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,320
is like one of the snapshot and this is

00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,840
also like this is

00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:44,320
less traffic jam than the one that

00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,759
when i'm traveling so probably this

00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,160
different time of the day but

00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,360
as you can see here that the road itself

00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,720
is a bit narrow

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:56,880
in terms of that uh

00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:59,120
only one car uh or only two

00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,800
only one car can pass at one direction

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,639
it's hard to

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:06,479
uh for you to travel freely

00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,000
in this type of road and especially in

00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,600
the morning when there is also packed

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,440
with motorcycle as well as you

00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,039
you can you can you have like a bit of

00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:16,400
competition in this

00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:20,160
route but then and

00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:21,759
then how about in osrm in osrm

00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,199
interestingly it gives you different

00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,560
routes uh

00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,560
but this is the route that i would

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,160
recommend if you knew in an area because

00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,160
it takes major road

00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,840
and it's fairly easy to navigate because

00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,960
again in a major route you'll see

00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,080
lots of traffic sign and it's more

00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,680
coordinated

00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,319
in terms of in terms of the traveling

00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,400
itself

00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,919
so i i say that this is the route that

00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,479
is good for visitor

00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:48,319
and as you can see on the left side

00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:51,440
corner that

00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:53,520
the osrn convert or

00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,120
provide a geocode so it convert your

00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:58,639
coordinates into

00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:00,240
an actual address so

00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,479
i think this is really interesting in

00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,280
seeing that different routes but

00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,400
each have their own strength and

00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,800
weaknesses

00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,919
and this is the snapshot of the route uh

00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,960
pro

00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:13,280
produced by osrm so this is the route

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,919
that

00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,120
yeah it's major road so two cars can

00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:19,440
pass in each lane

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,520
and then there's there is like a

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,080
separator in the middle

00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,360
so it again this is like uh easy to

00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,840
navigate

00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,960
so then how about open route surface

00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:33,759
then

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,560
interestingly open route surface give

00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,520
you different

00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,199
again the third different routes so i

00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:42,000
say that this is like a combination

00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:45,440
between osrm and also graphopper y

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,440
because initially it also took the

00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:50,400
routes that is

00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,280
same with the graph hopper like it's

00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:55,440
taking like

00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,440
not really a road that is

00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,160
that is major road and then but nearly

00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,759
the end it takes the major route

00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,879
although i'm not really

00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:08,000
i'm not really familiar in terms of

00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:10,479
why uh open route surface use this one

00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,199
but this is interesting because i say

00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:17,039
that it tried to combine best of both

00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:18,560
uh result and

00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:21,120
open route surface also provide

00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,360
elevation graph i think this is really

00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,639
interesting as well to give you more

00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:29,280
understanding

00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:33,039
uh or more data about your

00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:35,919
route here and

00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:37,680
if we can summarize the com the

00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,719
comparison of three route then we can

00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,360
see that graph offer

00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:42,159
is the shortest one but i'll say that

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,600
osrm

00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:48,480
is the one that gives you the easiest to

00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,480
navigate route

00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,720
moving next and then the second scenario

00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,360
is more like

00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,399
entirely urban previously it's like from

00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,680
suburb to

00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:01,760
urban or and then the second one

00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,200
the second scenario is focusing more on

00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,279
the

00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,560
entirely urban scenario so as you can

00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,000
see the

00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,000
for example if i want to have lunch

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,680
meeting from my office i'm going to

00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,240
choose like oh there's a really good

00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,800
cafe

00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,839
chip and good coffee that i will take

00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,000
and then so

00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,279
this is the place that i would choose

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,720
and again

00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:25,440
the route that is produced by graphoffer

00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,080
it's it's taking the shortest one and

00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,440
this is

00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:31,120
also the walking route that i'll take

00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,560
but not necessarily i will take this

00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,279
route in the evening

00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,240
or at night why because some of the

00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:39,600
route

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,640
particularly in this area is not really

00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,920
well lit

00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:46,320
and yeah it's avoiding the major

00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,760
road but at the same time it gives you

00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,000
the shortest one

00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,160
but during the night uh this is not the

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,760
route again that i will offer oh

00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,839
before i continue this is also

00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:59,760
interesting to note that once you move

00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:02,880
the sorry once you move the

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:06,560
travel modes from car to

00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:08,880
walk and then it gives you elevation

00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,760
uh graph as well similar with the open

00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,680
drought surface

00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,760
so apparently graphite is pretty

00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,000
adaptive it depends if your

00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,760
if you drive a car probably you don't

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,640
really care about elevation but if

00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:23,920
you're walking then it can be like your

00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,920
main consideration

00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:31,120
so as you can see at the scenario

00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,920
two uh the route that's provided by

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,839
grapher

00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,480
is taking the road that is not really

00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:40,000
well lit

00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:42,560
and like there is no like a pedestrian

00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,519
a good pedestrian access so yeah it's

00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,880
not really safe

00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:51,120
to travel around especially during

00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,120
evening on or during the night

00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,320
and on this

00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,600
osrm give you again give you the safe

00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,600
route or give you like the route that

00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,079
prefers like major routes

00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,800
to be taken as you can see that uh here

00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,360
on the map

00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,480
that uh srm is giving a recommendation

00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,600
to take this

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:14,160
major road and then they'll delete you

00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,640
to your destination

00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,000
the reason of why this is more

00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,560
preferable and safer

00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,440
because as you can see this is uh there

00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:26,720
is a pedestrian

00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,880
on this pedestrian area on the side

00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,920
and then it will also provide you with

00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:33,200
the tactile

00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:36,320
paving for people with the

00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:40,160
visibility impairment so this is really

00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:43,440
a good route to suggest by srm

00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:45,360
by the open route service uh it gives

00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,480
you like exactly the same route as

00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:51,360
uh graph offer would suggest so it

00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,240
takes the most direct and shortest route

00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,440
available

00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,320
i don't know if this is also have

00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:58,959
something to do with that

00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,680
open route service also having the same

00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:04,399
or have

00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:04,399
or using the same code as grab power

00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:11,360
and there is a small difference in

00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,000
distance but basically it's taking the

00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,000
same routes

00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,639
and on the third scenario uh this is on

00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:21,839
the short gateway so this is like

00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:23,120
from the urban suburb and then to the

00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,240
countryside

00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,639
so on this route uh as you can see that

00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,639
the

00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,320
the graph hopper again choose the

00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:34,880
alternative

00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:37,519
routes meaning that it it makes between

00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,720
the motorway so this is like some of the

00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:41,760
motorway here

00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:45,120
at the beginning but then it takes you

00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:48,480
directly to the not immediate

00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:50,639
well i i'm not saying that this is the

00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,519
route that i may take because i prefer

00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,959
to take the

00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:56,000
highway or taking the motorway here on

00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:58,560
this route instead

00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,240
but yeah this is definitely true that

00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,440
this is the shortest but not necessarily

00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,079
this is the

00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,480
fastest route because the traffic and

00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:08,399
the

00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,399
road condition is not really

00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:15,760
optimal in this area while

00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:17,920
osrm interestingly provides you

00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:20,240
with the same route or a very similar

00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:22,079
route with the graphopper offer with

00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,279
there is a like different in the

00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:26,560
beginning

00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:27,519
and then it took also uh the non-major

00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,440
route

00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,720
but interestingly there is also

00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,279
alternative route here

00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,320
it's it's uh it's it's kind of being

00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:37,200
offered

00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,800
uh by osrm that alternatively we can

00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,399
also take this route because

00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,800
probably because due to the distance

00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,920
then then you'll have multiple options

00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,000
as well

00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,560
so this is the second one when i click

00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,440
that when i click the route it

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:54,800
highlights you and apparently

00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,920
they both have like the same traveling

00:13:54,800 --> 00:14:00,839
time

00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:03,839
but yeah the other is having longer

00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,839
distance

00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,639
and the third uh the third routing

00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,199
engine

00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,560
open drought surface it gives you like

00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:16,720
the same routes

00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:21,279
as the osrm which is taking like the

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:23,839
major uh road and taking highway

00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:25,360
but during nearly the end it took like

00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:29,839
different routes so it took

00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:32,000
uh longer to reach the destination

00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:33,360
it still gives you like this elevation

00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,600
as well

00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:41,120
on all types of travel

00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,720
and in summary uh srm is i think it's

00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,399
really interesting because it gives you

00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,880
like two options

00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,320
uh probably yeah if you prefer a

00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,880
shortest

00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:53,199
traveling then you can take this one

00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,560
even like shorter than graphover but it

00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:56,399
also gives you other

00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,639
intermediate options as well if you want

00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:01,440
to take major road like a highway for a

00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:04,160
more pleasant journey

00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,160
so in summary it's not necessarily that

00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:09,360
one routing engine will

00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:11,440
beat others

00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,560
entirely because i believe that each of

00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,639
the routing engine

00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,079
each it's having its own strength and

00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,320
weaknesses

00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:19,199
so the conclusion of this experiment is

00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,839
that the

00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:23,360
by using open data and then compa

00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,519
combine that with open source

00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,279
engine open source routing engine in

00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,759
this example and then

00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,560
also having they say the open license it

00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,920
gives you

00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:37,360
open possibility of traveling

00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:40,880
of having your own journey and

00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:42,720
it leads to there's a possibility of

00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,519
having routing profile based on the

00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,800
locality

00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:49,920
so because we know by uh

00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:51,920
by using the proprietary routing engine

00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,920
or like a map surface

00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,279
it gives you like the whole global

00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:58,959
profile so

00:15:55,279 --> 00:16:01,759
it's hard to adjust by yourself

00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:02,560
how the routing would go in each of the

00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,759
area

00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:09,040
but using open data open source

00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,360
technology it enables you to have your

00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,519
own

00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,399
routing profile that is specific for

00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,120
that area

00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:17,440
for example uh if you want to create an

00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:20,399
application that is

00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:22,720
uh directed uh to travel in the rural

00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:25,759
area if you want to

00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:28,560
explore the beaten path

00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:30,320
the unbeaten path then yeah you can do

00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,800
that and you can develop that routing

00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:36,000
profile specific for that purpose

00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:39,440
and again i mentioned purpose

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:42,079
because uh different purpose may

00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:44,240
may have like different types of routing

00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:46,079
or different types of profile

00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,759
and rotting profile is something that's

00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:50,720
pretty common in this graph hopper or

00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:52,880
srm and open route service you can

00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,759
develop your own or customize your own

00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,680
routing profile

00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,880
that would fit with your own purpose

00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,680
meaning that

00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,800
if i just come in an area then probably

00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,880
to

00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,319
and i'm going to have like business

00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,439
trade then probably you want to take the

00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:08,640
most effective

00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:10,720
or like the the easiest uh

00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,160
route available like the one that

00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,559
provides you with less hassle

00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,880
but if you want to you be if you want to

00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:20,000
be adventurous in aria then

00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:22,400
probably you want to take shortest but

00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,600
at the same time it takes route that

00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,120
most people wouldn't take

00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:27,439
but you see lots of thing that you won't

00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,080
see

00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:31,600
if you only take the major routes or the

00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,640
major

00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:36,400
highway for example but you blend in and

00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,880
you also traveling to place that

00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,320
local people used to take so i think

00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,880
that really highly depends on the

00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,880
purpose

00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:47,679
so i think this is really interesting

00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,480
possibility that we can have out of the

00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:51,600
combination

00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:54,240
of open data which is openstreetmap

00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,799
and then the open source routing engine

00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,280
and the

00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:57,840
open data and the license itself enables

00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,320
you to do

00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,679
lots of experimentation without having

00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,080
to worry that

00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,600
you need to pay half the amount of money

00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,679
so

00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,760
i'd like to thank you again for watching

00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:12,080
and you can reach me at the email

00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,760
and there's also the link to the slides

00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,919
that if you want to download and

00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:18,080
probably you want to have your own

00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:20,240
types of experiment of the route in your

00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:22,000
area feel free to do that then yeah

00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,360
surely we can discuss afterwards thank

00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:29,840
you and

00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:29,840
have a nice day

00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:42,080
hello so thank you yantisa for that

00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,200
presentation um i think there were a few

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,600
issues for people

00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,799
for our stream at the start but

00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,440
hopefully

00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:50,400
um from the talk you understood yantisa

00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,679
was

00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:56,000
um was covering uh

00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,880
free routing engines and evaluating them

00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,799
for

00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:05,520
driving and walking um so i think i'm

00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:08,720
joined by yantusa here now um

00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:12,240
if you want to say hi hello everyone

00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:14,400
uh yeah and i also saw at the

00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,559
pad there are several questions should i

00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:20,720
uh answer that or i

00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:22,960
um on the live yeah no i'll uh

00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,000
i'll read them out now and uh you can

00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,760
answer them um

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,480
so there's a question about the

00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,039
pedestrian ways and sidewalks which kind

00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,679
of

00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:32,240
asks i call them pavements alongside

00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,760
roads

00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:39,360
um yeah how well-mapped are they um

00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,360
in your area that you looked up

00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,480
so i guess the short answer it depends

00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,640
like

00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,600
in the metro area usually it's really

00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,919
well mapped

00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,240
like now government really put more

00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:52,080
emphasize especially

00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,520
on the business district like they

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,440
really improve the

00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,679
sidewalks like they also put like

00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:00,640
tactile paving as well so it's also

00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:02,400
help people with uh feasibility

00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,960
impairment to also navigate in an

00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,840
area like several of the public

00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,039
transport it

00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:12,080
also trying to accommodate that like the

00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:12,400
sidewalks is going to be improved as

00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,360
well

00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,559
for the pedestrian access but then again

00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:20,320
as you move

00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:23,520
uh outward of the metro area then

00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:25,520
the pedestrian ways and sidewalks is not

00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,720
really that good i mean even like there

00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,600
is cases

00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:31,039
uh there are cases as well like uh as

00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,360
you go outside

00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:34,640
it's not really like a well developed

00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:38,799
the

00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:39,840
the i mean the the pedestrian is uh not

00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:42,799
really well built

00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,520
uh there are like different elephant uh

00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:46,640
how do you say

00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:48,480
like uh the pedestrian is yeah

00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,320
short answer is not really good so i'm

00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,360
not really recommend like people would

00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,960
not take that

00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,960
usually as well so yeah

00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:02,559
cool um so yeah so it will vary i guess

00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:06,080
the results they get from the routine

00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:09,679
and then uh so open

00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:13,679
osrm um how does it prioritize

00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:16,640
uh road class so different types of road

00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:18,240
do you know how it ranks them

00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:21,120
differently

00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,720
yeah so it usually goes from the highest

00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:25,039
road classification

00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,280
and then goes down and down so like i'm

00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:30,559
taking example not from the osr arm

00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:31,440
because i'm not really experiment a lot

00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:33,360
with that but

00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,760
i do experiment a lot with like red

00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,840
popper and how it prioritized it

00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,440
it it takes like the highest class and

00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:42,159
with the highest speed profile

00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,799
is motorway or highway at all route i

00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,799
mean like

00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:46,159
the paid tolerance it's usually like the

00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:48,159
highest priority

00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:49,360
and then goes down lower lower and then

00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:53,520
lower so it's from

00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:56,960
like motorway and then goes to the uh

00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:59,039
turn sorry trunks sorry a motorway

00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,320
trunks primary secondary tertiary

00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:02,960
unclassified

00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,840
residential surface and yeah it depends

00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,960
also on

00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,360
your mode of traveling like if you're on

00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,440
car

00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,640
then not necessarily that tracks or

00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,760
patch will be used

00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:15,760
in the routing so uh it it

00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:18,000
yeah it is correct that you don't want

00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,640
to put yourself in a dust track because

00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,919
of a short

00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,480
distance again this is really

00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:25,120
interesting in if i saw like the

00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:27,039
tracks in the us or in the europe for

00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,080
example maybe different with tracts in

00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:30,159
indonesia

00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,159
so again we need to develop like a good

00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:34,799
speed profile or like good

00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:37,280
road classification that would really

00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:38,640
reflect the condition in our country and

00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,559
i think this is like the benefit of

00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,200
using the open source routing engine

00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,960
because

00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,039
you can make that kind of different

00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,840
differentiation rather than just depends

00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:47,600
on that

00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,039
one global class that should be

00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,360
applicable but

00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:52,400
in the reality it does not really happen

00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,159
so

00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,679
like for example it may be like in the

00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:59,760
country tracks um

00:22:55,679 --> 00:23:00,720
a motor uh like car can pass tracks but

00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,039
on the

00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,320
in indonesia not necessarily that that's

00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:06,960
like a right choice

00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,159
same things with uh like uh street a

00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,080
living street for example

00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:11,919
living street in indonesia it can be

00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,960
like quite narrow so it's not really

00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:16,320
recommended for

00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:18,240
uh cars so then again uh the routing

00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,280
engine itself needs to be adapted with

00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,440
the local condition

00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:24,240
so i think that's would be like the

00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,240
answer for that

00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:30,720
yeah um i guess that moves on a bit to

00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:32,400
someone nicely asking about what we can

00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:35,760
do

00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,559
yeah or was scarcely about the specific

00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,120
attributes

00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:40,720
that their specific attributes we need

00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:43,919
to put in that can improve

00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:45,520
the routing for kind of all the routing

00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:48,559
providers

00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:49,360
yeah so definitely the first the first

00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:51,360
thing first

00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,360
is the road classification because

00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:56,320
sometimes uh even i still

00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,760
often found like people attack uh

00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,520
highway equal route

00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,200
meaning that the highway does not have

00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,600
the road classification

00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,760
so and that's usually like uh the

00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,279
routing software will put it like in the

00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,600
lowest category because

00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:11,200
it's unknown what's the class if it's

00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,440
primary it can be assigned like for

00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,840
example 50 kilometers per hour for oh no

00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,159
no

00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,440
it should be higher like 60 or 70

00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:20,240
kilometers per hours

00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:22,480
and then for tertiary and then goes uh

00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,080
down below it will be reduced so the

00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,679
the lower the road classification the

00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,600
speed will be reduced so

00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:28,880
if the specific attribute i would say

00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,960
the first is like the

00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,360
road classification itself and then

00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:36,000
possibly also put like the maximum speed

00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,279
uh within that route i mean this is also

00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,080
interesting like some

00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:41,520
uh even like in the osm tagging itself

00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,360
it also accommodate that

00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:46,240
the speed profile can be different based

00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:48,960
on hour like if it's in the morning uh

00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,159
when people goes to work will be lower

00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:54,000
but

00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:56,000
uh asset time i mean

00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,520
but it will be different during midnight

00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,720
the speed profile can be really

00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:01,520
like uh really high because not much

00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,840
traffic

00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:05,440
so yeah definitely uh that would be like

00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,279
the attributes and i think there's also

00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,120
wiki page that i look uh

00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:10,640
like there is a specific page called

00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:13,200
text for routing

00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:15,360
that uh i can add that into the pad

00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,039
later for that i mean for additional

00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,720
information on how you can

00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:20,720
see more about the tags that improve

00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,960
routing

00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:25,039
great yeah so um so mainly getting the

00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:28,480
class and the speed in there is

00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:31,679
what's important um for that um

00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:34,960
someone's asked

00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:37,600
your company i think um yeah uh

00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:39,760
i'm not not sure if if that's connected

00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,760
to you speaking here or if

00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,880
if you're speaking as yourself but do

00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:46,000
they use um

00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:48,720
just go check use osm for routing

00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,400
which i think is a motorcycle taxi

00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,799
company

00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,440
uh yeah it's uh what do you call it it's

00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:55,600
a

00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:57,440
ride-hailing company so yeah it's it's

00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:00,799
similar with grab or uber

00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,600
in a sense so yeah uh for that question

00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:04,000
uh yes

00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,200
gojek is currently evaluating the use of

00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,960
openstreetmap

00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:10,799
and yeah we are also thinking of using

00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,400
graph offer for now because graph opera

00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:14,240
is pretty easy to customize

00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,640
and the development is really great and

00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,559
also in my slides also mentioned that

00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,640
open route surface is also developed

00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:23,679
develop based on graph hopper as well

00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:26,480
and so yeah we are currently evaluating

00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:27,120
on the use of openstreetmap within our

00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,880
platform

00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:33,919
so yeah cool brilliant um

00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,480
yes so that's uh kind of obviously why

00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,240
you

00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:39,520
one of the reasons you looked into this

00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:42,480
it's great

00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:43,760
yeah to bring in that knowledge and do a

00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:47,360
proper

00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:49,919
um kind of look at that

00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:52,640
okay and i think um that's probably a

00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:55,760
good amount of questions now um

00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:58,960
others aren't quite so relevant but

00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:02,000
you might want to write in answers or um

00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:07,840
or links you talked about

00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,840
um cool so we'll take another break the

00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,840
