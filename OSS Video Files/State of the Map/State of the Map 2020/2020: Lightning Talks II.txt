Lightning Talk session

## [Divide and map. Now.](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Divide_and_map._Now.)
*Jiri Vlasak* - [Website](https://www.damn-project.org/), [Slides](https://qeef.gitlab.io/talks/damn-lightning-talk/)

The damn project helps mappers by dividing some big area into smaller squares that a human can map.

## Mapping Historically Black Colleges and Universities in OSM
*Harrison Cole*

Historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) are schools that were established exclusively for Black Americans prior to 1964. As of June 19th, 2020, their campuses are disproportionately undermapped in OSM relative to institutions with predominately white student populations. After putting out the call to map these campuses, volunteers have come together to submit thousands of edits and ensure that the campuses are represented properly. In this talk, I give a brief overview of how far the effort has come, and what still needs to be done.

## DDD123-OSM: 2D and 3D render toolchain 
*Jose J. Montes*

Introducing the toolset we are building to generate 3D models from OpenStreetMap data, used in our under-development "racing in your own city" game, and sharing some pictures and videos.

## OSGeo + OSM
*Enock Seth Nyamador* - [Slides](https://enockseth.github.io/sotm-2020-osgeo-plus-osm-lightning-talk-enyamador/)

Quick introduction to Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo) and highlighting projects for working with OSM Data.

## Tasking Manager 4 Tour
*Wille Marcel*

The new version of Tasking Manager, released on April 2020, has a new completely redesigned interface. This talk is a guided tour on the main parts of Tasking Manager 4.

## Uses of Mapping for Community Care During the Pandemic
*Andi Tabinas*

How were we able to use maps for community care during the COVID-19 situation in the Philippines? Through this lightning talk, I would like to share about how our volunteer organization, Mental Health AWHEREness, has been using maps and OSM data for community care in the Philippines.

## OpenStreetMap Data Pacific
*John Bryant*

Interest in open geospatial is growing in Pacific Island countries, where budgets and data availability are big problems, but the OpenStreetMap community in the region is still small. This project aims to introduce Pacific "geo" people to OSM by providing a weekly extract of 14 countries in a GIS-friendly format, bundled with a QGIS project and enhanced with some basic cartography.

## Hikar.js - bringing Hikar to the web
*Nick Whitelegg*

Hikar is an augmented reality app which overlays OSM ways on the camera feed of an Android device, and was presented last year at SOTM Heidelberg. The past year has seen a surge of interest in the three.js and A-Frame based augmented reality library AR.js, which allows AR apps to be developed for the web. This lightning talk summarises efforts so far to port Hikar to the web using AR.js.

## [Mapathon Keralam](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Kerala_State_IT_Mission)
*Amitha K Biju*

Mapathon Keralam is being coordinated by the Kerala State IT Mission, with the concept of Let Us Make Our Map.

	00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:14,880
hi and welcome this is the second round

00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:18,720
of lightning talks which are quick five

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:22,140
minute talks we are going to go through

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:25,859
all of the talks first and then at the

00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:29,189
end we will take questions for any of

00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:33,120
the talk speakers so first off we are

00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:36,059
going to start with jury Vlasic who will

00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,980
be speaking about Divide and map which

00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:42,960
is a project to help mappers divide a

00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:45,300
big area into smaller squares hi my name

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,809
is it Iwasaki I will talk about divide

00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:51,739
in math now the demin project if you

00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:54,510
have a large either you would like math

00:00:51,739 --> 00:00:58,379
usually you divide it up two small

00:00:54,510 --> 00:01:03,090
squares and let my purse map and you are

00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:06,290
done if this sounds familiar then you

00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:09,990
probably know what tasking measure

00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:12,600
personally I don't like it matter they

00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:14,790
use proprietary software they don't

00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:17,520
listen to community and still therefore

00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:20,250
performance issues what would be the

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:24,930
better solution divide a functionality

00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:27,049
that would support multiple clients it

00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:31,020
would increase the develop rank

00:01:27,049 --> 00:01:36,900
developers and communication efficiency

00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:40,259
and it would make the thing simple I'll

00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:45,409
be concrete there is running instance of

00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:49,710
the dominant project its server there is

00:01:45,409 --> 00:01:52,860
web client for mappers there are there

00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:58,729
are two clients for managers the

00:01:52,860 --> 00:02:02,040
deuteron plugin and deployment guide

00:01:58,729 --> 00:02:05,790
because you don't need to be a developer

00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:09,360
to run your own bit instance and because

00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:13,650
I am very forgetful there is a

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:17,879
step-by-step guide how to run a

00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:22,409
particular tasks for deploy determine

00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:26,849
project I did a load testing for

00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:31,349
currently running instant and the result

00:02:26,849 --> 00:02:37,220
is that there is no error for 100 people

00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:40,730
on mapathon so the dam project

00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:40,730
kidnapping guys

00:02:53,160 --> 00:03:08,050
live next we have Harrison Cole who will

00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:14,020
speak about mapping historically black

00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:17,470
colleges and universities which are for

00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:22,440
those of you who are not familiar are a

00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:26,620
group of schools in the United States

00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:32,790
that were established cific Lee for

00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:35,650
black Americans and historically these

00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:39,070
institutions have not been as well

00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:42,010
mapped in OSM as they're predominantly

00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:48,940
white the institutions are predominantly

00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:50,890
white and there is an effort to hi my

00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:53,890
name is Harrison Cole I'm a PhD

00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:55,360
candidate at Penn State University I'll

00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:57,190
be talking about mapping historically

00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,860
black colleges and universities and

00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:02,530
OpenStreetMap as well as giving you some

00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:06,310
information for if you want to

00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:08,500
contribute to this work as well so HBCUs

00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:11,260
as they're also called our schools that

00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:14,440
were established prior to 1964 when the

00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:16,630
Civil Rights Act was passed before that

00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:18,730
most universities in the US had

00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:22,090
admissions policies that barred people

00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:24,730
of color from being enrolled so these

00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:27,220
tools were established in response to

00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:29,620
that a lot of them are still around

00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:32,370
they only comprise about ten percent of

00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:35,470
the total number of institutions of

00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:37,690
universities in the US but twenty-five

00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:40,600
percent of black Americans who graduated

00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:42,280
college did so through an HBCU so

00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:45,850
they're a pretty important part of our

00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:48,600
social infrastructure that being said

00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:52,990
the US has historically systemically

00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:54,820
neglected primarily black spaces whether

00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:59,250
they're residential areas or commercial

00:04:54,820 --> 00:05:03,380
areas and HBC's aren't immune to that

00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:06,620
extent to being mapped as well

00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:10,160
so most of them are in the South a few

00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:11,990
in the Midwest but that's primarily

00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,840
where they're they're located

00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:18,440
geographically this spreadsheet on the

00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:22,610
right that you can see this was created

00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:24,860
it has a list of HBCUs in the US this is

00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:28,940
pretty broadly defined depending on who

00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:31,580
you talk to in the illicit HBCUs might

00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:34,520
only include those that are still

00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:37,400
accredited or only are funded through a

00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:39,670
particular grant program but this list

00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:42,440
was deliberately defined very broadly

00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:44,570
because we wanted to make sure that all

00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:47,840
schools were accounted for or at least

00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:50,990
as many as possible it also includes

00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:54,230
information about the extent to which

00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:58,010
each campus is mapped it could be

00:05:54,230 --> 00:06:00,680
anywhere from being big Micro mapped it

00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:03,200
has all the sidewalks and pathways and

00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:06,590
parking lots and everything all the way

00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:10,250
down to just being a label maybe it has

00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:12,290
the outline of the university grounds as

00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:15,830
an example this is Grambling State

00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:18,710
University as you can see there's the

00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:21,110
track a few labels for like the gym and

00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:26,090
dining hall but that's kind of it

00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:29,630
and after a few days this is what it

00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:31,840
looked like there's most of the main

00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:34,160
buildings have been maps not all of them

00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:37,190
parking has been included a lot of the

00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:39,530
amenities so there's there's a lot of

00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:42,590
work that needs to be done on a lot of

00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:44,600
these campuses couple more examples this

00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:47,960
is Kentucky State University this is

00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:51,020
extra after a couple of people been

00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:53,180
working on it so a lot of the buildings

00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:57,920
that you can see here weren't there

00:06:53,180 --> 00:07:01,930
previously this is after a day or two of

00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:05,870
work this is miles College same thing

00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:08,350
almost nothing here is mapped you have

00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:10,880
the the main building near the

00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:14,390
northernmost part of the campus but it's

00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:17,100
kind of it now we have the sidewalks

00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:18,810
pathways buildings that

00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:23,000
aren't obviously part of the campus but

00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:27,120
legally still are have been maps as well

00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:31,500
so where do we go from here this is a

00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:35,520
great start but HBCUs need to be

00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:38,910
involved in those projects as far as I

00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:41,130
know right now there isn't anybody doing

00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:45,210
this work who is directly connected to

00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:47,490
an HBCU I could be wrong but I'm not

00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:51,390
aware of it so we need to make sure that

00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:54,090
they're involved in this process as much

00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:56,760
as possible and of course continue

00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:59,160
working there's still a lot of stuff

00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:01,710
that needs to be mapped a lot of micro

00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:04,440
mapping spoonies be done where certain

00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:07,620
like Statue locations are trees bike

00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:11,370
share stations things like that and then

00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:13,710
afterwards or simultaneously tribal

00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:15,780
colleges universities Hispanic serving

00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:19,020
institutions these are all places that

00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:21,930
also need to be mapped and similar

00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:25,880
lacing to have been neglected relative

00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:28,350
to other larger universities in the u.s.

00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:31,110
so if you want to contribute to this

00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:37,710
this is the URL that you can visit tiny

00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:39,960
dot CC / HBCU osm that's the spreadsheet

00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:42,570
that I mentioned earlier has a list of

00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:46,440
all the HBCUs in the US and you can just

00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:57,690
pick one and start mapping and that'll

00:08:46,440 --> 00:09:02,760
be it for me thanks live and next up we

00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:08,460
have Jose Montes with DDD one two three

00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:12,980
OS m which is a tool set for generating

00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:12,980
3d models from Open Street Map data

00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:30,550
welcome to this talk DDD OpenStreetMap

00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:35,199
to the MVD

00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:39,579
vendor to change how to do it well join

00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:43,660
it my name is Cosmo Montez misogyny from

00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:46,360
galicia paying the developer of the tool

00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:49,959
I'm introducing today

00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:52,380
I've been recently working on a tool

00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:54,640
that generates 3d models from

00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:57,250
OpenStreetMap data and they'd like to

00:09:54,640 --> 00:10:00,820
share some of the results and the status

00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:03,250
with you I was building this tool for

00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:07,510
our game intercity racing which is what

00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:10,480
you can see now on the screen and this

00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:13,000
I'll paint you racing game which will

00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:16,930
allow players to drag around cities base

00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:19,480
from OpenStreetMap data we plan to build

00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:22,300
several European American cities

00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:24,250
initially and in the future we'd like to

00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:28,690
allow players to choose any location

00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:32,980
level we plan to make the city racing by

00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:35,339
level for Linux Windows and Mac so did

00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:39,640
you like the idea please follow us on

00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:41,829
Twitter and for spread the news back to

00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:45,690
the story um a few months ago I was

00:10:41,829 --> 00:10:48,190
working a hobby project to which

00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:49,750
simplify the task of programming

00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:52,570
procedurally generated through these

00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:55,930
things when I meant to use this to

00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:59,290
generate very simple to these things for

00:10:55,930 --> 00:11:01,480
games like this one this was one of the

00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:05,440
first scenes produced as a proof of

00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:08,170
concept for a simple basic of game so to

00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,690
come for instance grab a CSV of the

00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:14,639
periodic table and could be programmed

00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:18,329
iteration of 3d thing like this one

00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:20,670
so this perience allow me to quickly

00:11:18,329 --> 00:11:23,399
prototype a generation pipeline for

00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:27,389
OpenStreetMap data and this is what I

00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:31,019
came up with and fast forward a few

00:11:27,389 --> 00:11:33,809
months and today these two set looks

00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:37,049
like like this at the bottom of the

00:11:33,809 --> 00:11:41,189
stack we have a studio 3d generation

00:11:37,049 --> 00:11:43,259
tool of DDD and it's a Python package

00:11:41,189 --> 00:11:46,860
built on top of well-known libraries

00:11:43,259 --> 00:11:49,160
such as mumbai safely and Ramesh among

00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:49,160
others

00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:59,939
so what can we do with it we tried to be

00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:02,160
quite representative of town level so

00:11:59,939 --> 00:12:07,309
this includes generating sidewalks with

00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:10,799
curves a regular ground park a gas I

00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:14,699
mean some other variety trying to align

00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:17,399
obvious like benches sensibly represents

00:12:14,699 --> 00:12:22,519
traffic signs traffic lights business

00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:22,519
signs our pros so

00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:28,310
currently or the stuff is procedurally

00:12:26,839 --> 00:12:32,379
generated which means that we can

00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:35,870
support tax likes surface materials

00:12:32,379 --> 00:12:41,240
title with for stuff like trees lamps or

00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:45,199
fences we also aiming to create correct

00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:47,300
is not simply tunnels and bridges so

00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:51,220
they can be effectively used for example

00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:51,220
in the context of a physics simulation

00:12:51,339 --> 00:12:57,439
we can easily style different elements

00:12:54,110 --> 00:13:00,860
in both to the 3d stages so this allows

00:12:57,439 --> 00:13:03,290
the DD to output vector or raster files

00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:08,649
with a 2d representation along different

00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:12,759
stages which you see here then then

00:13:08,649 --> 00:13:12,759
inspect the generated files

00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,810
the

00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,839
in full openness to map to 3d

00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:23,820
traceability so for every object where

00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:28,110
your piece of the opportunity we can see

00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:32,450
the metadata always same ID our same

00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:37,440
tags and also generation process data

00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:38,940
what value focuses and I like to show

00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,529
you a couple of examples of

00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:43,260
customizations to the pipeline that

00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:45,630
happen with with this channel the first

00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:49,589
one is the integration of photo photos

00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:52,380
using them as excuse laid on the surface

00:13:49,589 --> 00:13:54,899
surface area and the other chemically

00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:59,310
retreat from a WMS service and in this

00:13:54,899 --> 00:14:02,010
case used to replace floor textures and

00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:08,160
the next one is a map inner integration

00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:11,720
here we have a couple of steps here we

00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:16,430
have a few samples of a vector output

00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:16,430
first process with Inkscape

00:14:17,769 --> 00:14:23,499
so wrapping up this is the current list

00:14:19,779 --> 00:14:26,730
of features of the vidi OpenStreetMap

00:14:23,499 --> 00:14:30,730
pipeline so with this today

00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:34,540
well the subway is not quite mature

00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:37,809
enough the API is not critical system so

00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:40,059
I'd expected to change but I think that

00:14:37,809 --> 00:14:41,860
this tooling the paradigm may be useful

00:14:40,059 --> 00:14:44,290
in areas like infographics if

00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:47,709
engineering architecture games and

00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:51,040
simulators artificial intelligence so

00:14:47,709 --> 00:14:53,649
let me know one thing I do not currently

00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:55,629
have a patreon page but I do plan to

00:14:53,649 --> 00:14:57,489
look for patrons or parties interested

00:14:55,629 --> 00:15:01,029
in sponsoring this development and

00:14:57,489 --> 00:15:03,579
related services and how if we still be

00:15:01,029 --> 00:15:06,730
able to as soon as possible publish

00:15:03,579 --> 00:15:08,799
basic online viewer service that allows

00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:11,110
people to many at least a set of

00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:13,269
predefined areas and in the end I'd like

00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:16,389
to see an infrastructure with a global

00:15:13,269 --> 00:15:18,100
coverage following your city game

00:15:16,389 --> 00:15:23,079
twitter account or buying the game when

00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:26,170
it comes out also helps that's all thank

00:15:23,079 --> 00:15:28,709
you very much for your time and I hope

00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:28,709
you liked it

00:15:47,509 --> 00:15:59,669
I've so next up we have in excess niya

00:15:55,229 --> 00:16:03,749
mother who will be speaking about the

00:15:59,669 --> 00:16:07,109
open source geospatial foundation OS geo

00:16:03,749 --> 00:16:17,429
and their projects that are working with

00:16:07,109 --> 00:16:20,369
osm data hello and welcome to this quick

00:16:17,429 --> 00:16:22,919
lightning talk on OSU and wisdom

00:16:20,369 --> 00:16:25,049
my name is Enoch says my mother and when

00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:26,759
I was drew marketing committee in an

00:16:25,049 --> 00:16:30,019
open strict no contributor for the past

00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:32,519
yes from Ghana

00:16:30,019 --> 00:16:34,589
now this presentation is to get you up

00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:36,989
to speed about OSU and how it's

00:16:34,589 --> 00:16:38,789
connected to OpenStreetMap I know where

00:16:36,989 --> 00:16:41,069
some community is also connected to ways

00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:43,349
you so where you're simply is the open

00:16:41,069 --> 00:16:45,749
source geospatial foundation which

00:16:43,349 --> 00:16:47,909
leaves and promote free openness of

00:16:45,749 --> 00:16:48,869
organizing and it's a global community

00:16:47,909 --> 00:16:52,469
as well

00:16:48,869 --> 00:16:55,889
now OSU started way back in 2006 Yahoo

00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:58,349
SM was in existence in 2004 and and so

00:16:55,889 --> 00:17:00,719
community and driven by the need to

00:16:58,349 --> 00:17:02,069
organize and then navigate play around

00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:04,970
the growing field of open source

00:17:02,069 --> 00:17:08,309
geospatial projects for the members

00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:11,939
included G Dahl mapserver qgs grass and

00:17:08,309 --> 00:17:14,789
conscious this the initial offer was you

00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:18,059
yes summer was your project friends and

00:17:14,789 --> 00:17:21,209
family now well you project lava

00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:23,999
sanitizer no doubt and the fact Angie de

00:17:21,209 --> 00:17:25,980
which is one of the libraries er that is

00:17:23,999 --> 00:17:29,580
used in both conventional and open

00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:32,820
source software such as qgs and many

00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:36,869
others has out of the ball support for

00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:40,350
OS m data with their PBF air over same

00:17:36,869 --> 00:17:42,690
files and etc open layers and leaflet

00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:44,380
has over some support or SMB services

00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:48,970
use

00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:51,669
this such as a base map and for example

00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:55,149
is my bender which uses a OS ember as a

00:17:51,669 --> 00:17:57,460
base map and a PT routine which is which

00:17:55,149 --> 00:18:02,309
makes massive use of awesome data for

00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:05,259
its analysis and then for his process

00:18:02,309 --> 00:18:07,929
now when Sam is a source of love was jus

00:18:05,259 --> 00:18:11,019
project sir which is interesting and the

00:18:07,929 --> 00:18:14,139
most of our awesome data that we get

00:18:11,019 --> 00:18:17,409
into OpenStreetMap is reusing qgs and

00:18:14,139 --> 00:18:19,509
many other variety of ways your projects

00:18:17,409 --> 00:18:22,240
for analysis

00:18:19,509 --> 00:18:25,570
yeah osu membership is open free and

00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:27,070
there is over fifty five thousand six

00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:29,710
hundred members are registered on the

00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:33,909
wiki is a binary flag the rights number

00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:36,480
of actual membership down to is gonna be

00:18:33,909 --> 00:18:39,549
compared to OSM's

00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:42,250
membership that is registration from the

00:18:39,549 --> 00:18:46,029
statistics is quite old from 2019 maybe

00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:48,820
more than this and now and who is Joe

00:18:46,029 --> 00:18:50,740
has a chapter members which he elects a

00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:53,350
board of directors and this chatted

00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:55,480
members to become a chartered member you

00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:57,789
community members have done something

00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:00,279
which is worth mentioning and each other

00:18:57,789 --> 00:19:02,860
members also nominate she was what their

00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:04,480
local chapters over 30 M plus around the

00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:06,610
world and globally these chapters are

00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:09,490
organized regional conferences of foss4g

00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:11,139
coach intended also contribute to other

00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:12,940
projects as well

00:19:11,139 --> 00:19:15,669
local chapters are the connected to a

00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:19,179
Samia in Germany foss4g

00:19:15,669 --> 00:19:22,779
for zcv the local chapter osu ended of

00:19:19,179 --> 00:19:24,669
jamocha chapter for s MF n de- was

00:19:22,779 --> 00:19:27,940
telling you that a four-season USM is a

00:19:24,669 --> 00:19:30,309
good combination but different and maybe

00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:33,580
different interests but yeah is the same

00:19:30,309 --> 00:19:36,100
OS e OS m combination so they are

00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:37,899
phospho g which is a conference the free

00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:40,179
and open source software for you special

00:19:37,899 --> 00:19:43,690
conference that explicit and while the

00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:45,580
original is of combination of osm and

00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:47,620
osu yeah this conference room with a

00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:49,929
developed path talk about new features

00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:51,730
software XYZ and also talk about use

00:19:49,929 --> 00:19:52,920
cases often the most false for years

00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:57,930
about

00:19:52,920 --> 00:20:00,180
Oh Foss 4G tools using who is usm data

00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:03,650
for a use case as well and then these

00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:06,750
regional conferences also about OSU and

00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:08,310
OSF so it's a beyond software open

00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:11,130
source open data open standards open

00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:13,950
science and we sign moves that is a

00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:17,340
memorandum of understanding started way

00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:19,800
back in 2011 and understand by ICA and

00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:22,200
then the institutions as well a mutant

00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:24,690
map as forming part of the open signal

00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:28,590
community and many more yeah you might

00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:30,390
ask why doesn't Wesen sign the MOU yeah

00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:32,700
well Sam you know SM we don't do sign

00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:35,100
off on random of understandings and so a

00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:37,080
person falls within the category of

00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:39,690
like-minded organizations and then

00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:41,040
reference already Enrico Mattei and use

00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:42,750
same tools and we love each other's

00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:45,390
projects yeah where's your life which is

00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:49,830
a full-blown linear distribution based

00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:51,900
on Ubuntu is container or some data for

00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:54,570
whatever falls for this going to take

00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:57,390
place for the news release and you try

00:20:54,570 --> 00:21:01,290
it has a lot of tons of open source

00:20:57,390 --> 00:21:04,200
tools qgs and this is good interesting I

00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:07,140
try it yeah was you and USM is a great

00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:10,140
combination and let the force you to

00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:12,680
enjoy a set of the map 2020

00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,680
thank you

00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:47,250
and next up we have Willie Marcel who

00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:49,170
will be giving us a tour of the latest

00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:52,590
version of tasking manager tasking

00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:58,920
manager for which was just released in

00:21:52,590 --> 00:22:01,559
April hello a developer working for

00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:04,920
heart in many Italian cities map team

00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:08,490
and today I would do a little to the

00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:12,120
task manager for the task manager for

00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:17,040
was released in April this year with a

00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:19,920
new completely new interface and a lot

00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:24,420
of change from the API to make tasks

00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:28,320
measure perform faster here we have the

00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:31,320
list of projects and each project has a

00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:35,190
card with some information and we can

00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:39,990
also interact with the map and filter

00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:42,179
here a project least we have some

00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:45,630
possibilities of other filters like

00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:50,190
filter by campaigns by organizations or

00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:54,950
by locations here we have the project

00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:59,460
overview page with a little new mark

00:22:54,950 --> 00:23:02,550
that shows it tasks with a different

00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:06,270
color free treaty status we have some

00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:08,790
information about the project like the

00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:12,540
elements that needs to be mapped and

00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:14,550
some stats about the project we have the

00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:19,080
description of the organization that is

00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:21,470
coordinating definitions comments list

00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:24,960
of contributors and the timeline

00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:28,800
clicking on the contribute button

00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:31,679
we had lectures to that page where we

00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:35,990
have the instructions on how to map the

00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:41,220
project also the same map with a legend

00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:44,730
but means it Cola on the map so we have

00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:48,269
a task list that allow us to interact

00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:52,080
with tasks we can do that interaction

00:23:48,269 --> 00:23:57,000
both clicking on the map or selecting

00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:59,909
the tasks on the task list one new thing

00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:04,289
is that you can select Wipro tasks for

00:23:59,909 --> 00:24:10,289
validation by just clicking the blue map

00:24:04,289 --> 00:24:15,029
on the boat asks so another new thing

00:24:10,289 --> 00:24:17,730
that we have is that we can use the ID

00:24:15,029 --> 00:24:20,870
editor inside the test measure so you

00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:23,990
don't need to go out to the map website

00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:28,919
to map or validate a project

00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:33,929
so here the ID editor intimated we ask

00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:38,159
you manager you can map as you do it

00:24:33,929 --> 00:24:42,929
when they oxygen up website so let's map

00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:51,389
here a new building and that is just

00:24:42,929 --> 00:24:54,600
beauty so let's save that edit and after

00:24:51,389 --> 00:24:59,129
save it and select if the task is

00:24:54,600 --> 00:25:01,200
completed mapped or not I can submit it

00:24:59,129 --> 00:25:05,820
in that case I could not matter

00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:11,759
everything so I say no and submit the

00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:13,160
task so update the status of the top of

00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:16,490
the task

00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:22,070
and showing Morrisania futures that we

00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:25,070
have here in the my stats page you can

00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:27,080
see some statistics about the

00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:30,640
contributions of the user or task

00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:34,130
manager like the number of hours spent

00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:40,040
the number of elements mapped but I'm

00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:41,930
lying somebody starts some formation

00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:46,310
about the location of the projects that

00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:48,800
the user has contributed we have a lot

00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:51,560
of change as well how we manage the

00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:55,490
projects we have added the scenes and

00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:58,520
randomizations that makes it possible to

00:25:55,490 --> 00:26:02,320
a group of users manage a project and

00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:04,640
also handle better definitions with

00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:09,620
create teams for the users and

00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:13,580
association with to the project so I

00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:16,280
invite you to make a try or marking on

00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:18,670
task manager and help us map for people

00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,670
in need

00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:54,970
and next up we have uses of mapping to

00:26:51,669 --> 00:26:57,990
assist community care during the COBIT

00:26:54,970 --> 00:27:04,419
19 situation in the Philippines

00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:06,159
presented by Andy tabbing us this is how

00:27:04,419 --> 00:27:07,779
mental health and the Philippines looks

00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:11,200
like according to the latest available

00:27:07,779 --> 00:27:13,720
data which was from way back in 2016 and

00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:16,480
this is how the current Colvin 19

00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:18,340
situation here looks like the World

00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,260
Health Organization and public health

00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:23,230
governments and services around the

00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:26,529
world are acting to contain the kovin 19

00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:28,390
outbreak however this time of crisis is

00:27:26,529 --> 00:27:32,320
generating stress throughout the

00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:34,270
population in any epidemic it is common

00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:36,909
for individuals to feel stressed and

00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:39,250
worried and as a corona virus pandemic

00:27:36,909 --> 00:27:42,340
has swept across the world it has

00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:45,010
induced and still induces a considerable

00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:47,679
degree of fear worry and stress in the

00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:49,419
population at large these are normal

00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:51,669
responses to our perceived or real

00:27:49,419 --> 00:27:54,490
threats or when we are faced with

00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:57,130
uncertainty or the unknown so with

00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:59,740
Colvin 19 the main psychological impact

00:27:57,130 --> 00:28:03,820
to date is elevated rates of stress and

00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:05,919
insight geospatial scientists and civil

00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:08,409
servant here in the Philippines and I'm

00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:11,679
here to share with you how our volunteer

00:28:08,409 --> 00:28:14,740
organization which is one of the hot OS

00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:17,860
and my grantees for 2020 was able to

00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:22,510
utilize maps and osm data to provide

00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:25,059
community caring we have been a

00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:27,399
community quarantine since mid-march and

00:28:25,059 --> 00:28:30,159
although restrictions to movements have

00:28:27,399 --> 00:28:31,990
been a bit East now movements are still

00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:33,789
limited and most of us are still

00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:37,029
physically distant from friends and

00:28:33,789 --> 00:28:38,919
family as advocates for mental health we

00:28:37,029 --> 00:28:41,230
know it is important to do our part and

00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:43,840
reminding everyone to look after our

00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:46,899
mental health as matures as our physical

00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:49,059
health so together with other groups and

00:28:46,899 --> 00:28:51,880
individuals we organized online

00:28:49,059 --> 00:28:53,860
activities and shared information aimed

00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,610
to provide community care during the

00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:56,080
pandemic

00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:58,419
how did we do it

00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:01,240
and how significant are maps and osm

00:28:58,419 --> 00:29:03,279
data in doing so but first what is

00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:05,620
community cares committing to being

00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:09,070
there for others and intentionally

00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:11,110
showing compassion community carriers

00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:13,120
like the goal of Society approach so

00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:15,220
well they are need to be focused

00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:17,230
interventions with specific objectives

00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:19,120
and target groups mental health and

00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:21,070
psychosocial support needs a whole of

00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:23,260
society approach and this is where

00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:25,330
community care comes in the whole

00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:26,769
society approach requires addressing the

00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:29,679
mental health and psychosocial support

00:29:26,769 --> 00:29:32,019
needs of the entire affected population

00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:35,169
regardless of their affiliation race

00:29:32,019 --> 00:29:37,450
gender or age but the smeary volunteers

00:29:35,169 --> 00:29:39,850
and citizens at home we had to do our

00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:42,580
part to support others so for mental

00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:45,070
health awareness we develop mapping

00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:48,429
platforms that could encourage people to

00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:50,860
share their stories and be there for

00:29:48,429 --> 00:29:53,740
others would need someone to listen to

00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:57,570
them to fight their mental health here

00:29:53,740 --> 00:30:00,190
here and mapping emotions and we used

00:29:57,570 --> 00:30:05,289
OpenStreetMap data as base map suffering

00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:08,200
these maps over here here people could

00:30:05,289 --> 00:30:10,720
add the pin to the location near to show

00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:12,669
where the nearest help is and same with

00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:15,220
mapping emotions who they could add a

00:30:12,669 --> 00:30:19,179
pen to share their locations to show

00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:23,889
people that mental health occupy space

00:30:19,179 --> 00:30:27,760
and we also use these platforms to help

00:30:23,889 --> 00:30:30,039
students gain access to online learning

00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:32,500
because we know that not everyone can

00:30:30,039 --> 00:30:34,269
afford internet nowadays but most of the

00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:37,029
classes are done online because of the

00:30:34,269 --> 00:30:38,649
pandemic so we did a contest that

00:30:37,029 --> 00:30:41,169
encouraged students to share their

00:30:38,649 --> 00:30:44,830
stories while here here and mapping

00:30:41,169 --> 00:30:48,970
emotions and we selected the best

00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:51,429
entries and the winners received mobile

00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:54,210
loads that they may use for mobile data

00:30:51,429 --> 00:30:57,010
to join their online classes we also

00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:58,990
emphasized coordination and shared

00:30:57,010 --> 00:31:03,340
knowledge and expertise through

00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:06,039
collaboration with other groups so we

00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:08,679
recently had a map of an ant workshop

00:31:06,039 --> 00:31:09,520
which encouraged everyone to take care

00:31:08,679 --> 00:31:12,210
of their mental

00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:14,710
health and stay socially connected

00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:19,800
despite being physically distant from

00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:22,060
each other and we have these other

00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:23,980
programs of collaborations with other

00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:25,690
groups contests and social media

00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:30,010
campaigns to promote mental health

00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:32,560
awareness and of course to support our

00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:34,090
goal in mental health awareness to map

00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:37,480
mental health services in the

00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:39,250
Philippines the lead for the map

00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:41,950
existing mental health and psychosocial

00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:44,560
support during this pandemic we did map

00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:46,870
offense in the workshops it encourages

00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:48,850
mental health volunteers to add the data

00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:51,820
to our list of mental health services

00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:54,820
and resources which are separated by

00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:56,850
region and then map these services if

00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:59,710
they know their location on

00:31:56,850 --> 00:32:03,990
OpenStreetMap via our platform on map

00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:07,360
contrib so yeah that's how we use the

00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:10,710
mapping and osm data for mental health

00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,710
awareness thank you

00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:27,550
standby live and next up we have John

00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:33,220
Bryant who is going to talk about

00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:39,490
extracts cific Lee of Pacific Island

00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:40,900
countries from OSM I want to tell you

00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:43,390
about a small project I recently

00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:44,980
completed developing a resource for GIS

00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:46,600
users and lawmakers in the Pacific

00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:48,520
Islands with the aim of exposing more

00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:50,740
people in this region to OpenStreetMap

00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:53,350
and hopefully helping the local sm

00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:54,910
community to grow I'm not a resident of

00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:57,730
the Pacific Islands I live in Australia

00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:59,170
I grew up on Vancouver Island in Canada

00:32:57,730 --> 00:33:01,120
which is technically an island in the

00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:03,280
Pacific but when we talk about Pacific

00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:05,080
Islands in Oceania what we usually mean

00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:06,790
is the Pacific Island countries and

00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:09,490
territories in the best region between

00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:12,880
eastern Asia Australia New Zealand and

00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:14,650
Hawaii so I'm not necessarily qualified

00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,200
to speak with any authority about issues

00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:18,370
facing mountain a KERS in this region

00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,900
but over the last two and a half years

00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:22,780
I've been involved with organizing

00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:24,130
foss4g state of the map Oceania and I've

00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:27,040
made a few friends in Pacific other

00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:28,600
countries last November I was fortunate

00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:30,700
enough to participate in the 4d

00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:33,340
statement Oceania conference in New

00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:35,890
Zealand and the Pacific GIS and remote

00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:37,090
sensing conference in Fiji and I had the

00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:42,490
chance to listen to the stories of

00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:44,530
Pacific GIS users some of the stories

00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:46,360
were but the problems mapmakers faced in

00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:49,300
this huge extremely removed and

00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:52,150
economically challenged region problems

00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:54,010
like limited budgets limited

00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:57,820
opportunities for technical learning and

00:33:54,010 --> 00:33:59,290
a difficulty of funding cut data in

00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:00,670
light of these difficulties is not

00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:02,710
surprising to find that people are very

00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:06,010
interested in open geospatial software

00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:07,600
and data there's already some osm

00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:09,940
community action in the Pacific for

00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:11,679
example in French Polynesia we're a very

00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:14,020
active group of people is engaged in

00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:16,210
community mapping projects and certainly

00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:18,200
many of the GIS people have spoken to in

00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:20,210
the Pacific are interested in or cure

00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:22,190
about the project but generally speaking

00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:27,409
the OSM community is very small in the

00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:28,970
Pacific and usage is quite low so if

00:34:27,409 --> 00:34:32,300
it's some houseful why isn't it getting

00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:34,339
used more one possible reason is maybe

00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:38,030
Pacific mappers are used to a more Jo

00:34:34,339 --> 00:34:40,730
centric workflow if so the question this

00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:43,520
project aims to address is some people

00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:45,679
are accustomed to a GIS paradigm what if

00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:47,149
there are Pacific focused data resource

00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:50,510
that made it easier for them to start

00:34:47,149 --> 00:34:52,760
using over send data I've spent much of

00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:54,859
my career as a joyous user and map maker

00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:57,349
downloading data sets based on themes

00:34:54,859 --> 00:35:00,500
like buildings roads and waterways and

00:34:57,349 --> 00:35:02,869
using them as layers to build Maps when

00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:04,790
I first encountered osm extracts I found

00:35:02,869 --> 00:35:06,589
them hard to use because I had to filter

00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:08,839
and symbolize them using an unfamiliar

00:35:06,589 --> 00:35:10,310
tag schema which can be difficult to

00:35:08,839 --> 00:35:13,640
adjust to if you're used to a different

00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:15,500
way of working we thought maybe we could

00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:16,910
create a simple system that would do

00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:19,310
some of the preliminary work for the

00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:21,290
filtering and symbolizing and provide

00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:24,230
GIS users with something in a more

00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:26,300
familiar format we hope this project

00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:28,819
will help map makers over the initial

00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:30,349
hurdle of working with osm data so they

00:35:28,819 --> 00:35:32,750
can discover not only how richly

00:35:30,349 --> 00:35:34,790
detailed it is but also where the gaps

00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:38,180
are and maybe inspire some of them to

00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:39,710
become OS m editors and fill the gaps it

00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:42,200
could provide a catalyst for people to

00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:44,599
join or start their own Niccolo sm

00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:46,359
community and develop tagging guidelines

00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:49,190
that are relevant to their own lives and

00:35:46,359 --> 00:35:51,589
potentially immerges members of the

00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:56,780
global sm community reaching the project

00:35:51,589 --> 00:35:57,730
with their unique perspectives so how

00:35:56,780 --> 00:36:00,170
does it work

00:35:57,730 --> 00:36:02,420
technically it's fairly simple project

00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:04,460
using scripted workflow to fetch and

00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:07,130
process extracts from geo fabric and

00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:10,240
line polygons from fosters resulting in

00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:12,770
a set of user-friendly data resources

00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:15,190
projects generates bundles of resources

00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:17,450
automatically updated on a weekly basis

00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:20,089
there's a bundle for each of 14

00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:22,250
countries plus one for the region with

00:36:20,089 --> 00:36:25,370
small file sizes for low bandwidth

00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:26,960
varmints each bundle contains a jewel

00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:29,570
package with pneumatic data layers

00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:32,930
familiar to address traditional desktop

00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:34,960
GIS users a huges project and layer file

00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:37,670
with some basic photography and

00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:42,590
documentation about OpenStreetMap how to

00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:44,240
use the data and how to edit osm the

00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:46,670
data is updated every week and the

00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:48,620
latest data is available here for the

00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:51,440
whole region the pacific environment

00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:53,780
portal for each country as a single

00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:56,960
bundle 14 countries specific data

00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:58,730
portals the project is being launched in

00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,740
the coming days and Rieger to find out

00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:02,870
if it helps increase the use of US and

00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:04,460
the Pacific we'd love for you to check

00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:07,720
it out and let us know what you think

00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:07,720
thank you very much

00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:10,530
you

00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:25,330
and life and next for those of you who

00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:27,640
were estate of Matt last year you might

00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:31,000
have seen the presentation about the

00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:34,180
hiker app augmented reality app for

00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:39,580
hikers and now Nick white leg is back

00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:42,940
with a hiker Jas hi my name is Nick

00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:46,480
white Lake and I am a lecturer at Sony

00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:49,390
University in Southampton in the south

00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:52,330
of the UK I'm also a long time

00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:55,960
long-term OpenStreetMap contributor and

00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:59,740
I'm here today to talk about my car Jas

00:37:55,960 --> 00:38:03,100
bringing my car which is my augmented

00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:06,280
reality app to the web so a bit of

00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:09,190
background well hi car is an Android

00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:11,890
based augmented reality app for walkers

00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:13,900
and hikers and what it does and you'll

00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:17,410
see it some screenshots in a moment is

00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:20,200
it overlays OpenStreetMap data on the

00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:22,330
camera feed of your phone so you can use

00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:24,130
that to help you navigate in the

00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:26,200
countryside because it will show you the

00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:28,720
footpaths the hiking trails and where

00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:30,730
they go and furthermore as you'll also

00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:32,980
see in a minute it shows virtual

00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:34,960
signposts and virtual notice boards on

00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:36,700
the camera feed and I actually did talk

00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:39,790
about this last year at state of the map

00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:45,010
in Heidelberg and also at FOSDEM

00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:46,900
in 2019 as well ok so just some

00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:50,980
screenshots of the hike our Android app

00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:54,280
you can see four screenshots here so the

00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:56,800
left to left screenshots were taken

00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:59,080
climbing the highest peak in Northern

00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:01,270
Ireland and you can see that the

00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:04,030
OpenStreetMap data is there in orange

00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:07,540
and blue orange and green sorry and you

00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:09,880
can also see these virtual signposts

00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:13,300
pointing the way to nearby points of

00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:15,340
interest on the right hand side what

00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:18,370
you've got is a screenshot taken in a

00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:20,530
local park and it's showing you a

00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:23,089
virtual notice board now these virtual

00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:25,249
notice boards can be added by users

00:39:23,089 --> 00:39:28,460
it's telling you to be aware of the

00:39:25,249 --> 00:39:30,739
blue-green algae in the lake around 80

00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:34,039
meters ahead of you we did have that

00:39:30,739 --> 00:39:36,200
problem last summer and you can also see

00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:38,329
there's a real footpath there that sort

00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:40,789
of concrete path and you can see the

00:39:38,329 --> 00:39:43,700
OpenStreetMap way is overlaid there in

00:39:40,789 --> 00:39:45,469
green and then the bottom right that is

00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:47,960
in the local National Park than you

00:39:45,469 --> 00:39:51,289
forest and it's showing you the routing

00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:53,150
functionality of my car and it's routing

00:39:51,289 --> 00:39:56,539
you to the nearby town of Brockenhurst

00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:59,359
so the sort of a yellow color is the

00:39:56,539 --> 00:40:01,489
route that is calculated and again you

00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:04,150
can see in the distance there a virtual

00:40:01,489 --> 00:40:07,940
signpost

00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:10,579
okay okay so allowing me to port hi car

00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:14,119
to the web and making use of a library

00:40:10,579 --> 00:40:16,759
called a Ras so ARS is an exciting

00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:18,710
project to bring AR to the web making

00:40:16,759 --> 00:40:21,099
use of HTML and JavaScript it was

00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:25,069
started by a guy called Jerome Etienne

00:40:21,099 --> 00:40:30,190
and has recently been led by another

00:40:25,069 --> 00:40:33,529
developer Niccolo Carbon Yoli and it's

00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:37,369
essentially three GIS and a frame based

00:40:33,529 --> 00:40:42,559
so as you may well know 3GS and a frame

00:40:37,369 --> 00:40:45,349
are standard ap eyes for doing 3d web

00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:48,849
development so web development with 3d

00:40:45,349 --> 00:40:53,630
graphics and they both essentially wrap

00:40:48,849 --> 00:40:54,829
WebGL so the recent developments in ARS

00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:59,359
from late last year

00:40:54,829 --> 00:41:03,460
so a rjs was originally a marker based a

00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:06,729
our library but recently location-based

00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:11,029
functionality has been added to it so a

00:41:06,729 --> 00:41:13,940
rs3 now supports location-based AR as

00:41:11,029 --> 00:41:16,940
well as market-based AR and that makes

00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:20,749
it very exciting very useful for hike

00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:23,749
are a great thing about a Ras is it very

00:41:20,749 --> 00:41:25,940
has a very active community and a lot of

00:41:23,749 --> 00:41:30,380
contemporary interest and here you can

00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:33,230
see here is its github repository which

00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:36,140
you can take a look at down

00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:38,720
okay so it seems to me you know a very a

00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:42,080
very likely way forward is actually to

00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:44,540
port high car to the web making use of a

00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:47,090
Ras so currently high car works on

00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:48,800
Android only which is a bit of a

00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:51,320
limitation because there's no support

00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:56,330
for iOS or indeed any other mobile

00:41:51,320 --> 00:42:00,880
platforms also as I've just said they

00:41:56,330 --> 00:42:04,640
are an Android away from the AR core

00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:08,720
official effort which is quite heavy

00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:10,970
weight and cloud based there's not much

00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:13,850
development going on in terms of

00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:18,200
independent purely open source projects

00:42:13,850 --> 00:42:21,619
on Android a ojs is very different as I

00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:24,050
said very active community and if I port

00:42:21,619 --> 00:42:26,300
high car to a rjs it means there's

00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:28,880
already at this community which could

00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:32,900
attract new contributors to the high car

00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:34,550
project okay so what is the progress so

00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:36,619
far well there is a working demo

00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:40,369
actually available on the web at high

00:42:36,619 --> 00:42:44,720
card org slash web app this will only

00:42:40,369 --> 00:42:46,609
work in Europe and the non-european

00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:49,880
parts of Turkey from the whole of Turkey

00:42:46,609 --> 00:42:55,460
and the reason why that is is that my

00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:56,930
server only hosts OpenStreetMap data in

00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:58,910
those areas Europe in the whole of

00:42:56,930 --> 00:43:02,570
Turkey however if there is a lot of

00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:05,420
interest I can add other small areas on

00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:08,000
request so the working demo is

00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:10,010
equivalent to high cardinal point one in

00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:13,100
functionality in other words it does

00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:15,520
show RSM OpenStreetMap ways with

00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:18,380
different colors for roads and footpaths

00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:20,600
but the functionality for virtual

00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:23,119
signposts and virtual notice boards is

00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:24,859
not yet present I would strongly

00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:26,810
recommend that you use Chrome if you're

00:43:24,859 --> 00:43:29,359
testing it out as there are some quirks

00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:34,820
and Firefox that is actually a known

00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:36,500
issue with a Ras as a whole so what are

00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:38,330
the future plans well the obvious future

00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:40,940
plan really is to make the hike our web

00:43:38,330 --> 00:43:42,740
app equivalent and functionality to the

00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:45,080
Android app in other words to add

00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:46,130
signposts and virtual notice boards and

00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:50,360
also routing

00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:54,400
to a final destination now because web

00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:56,900
development is such a ubiquitous thing

00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:59,360
and there are lots of people involved in

00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:02,750
web-based projects that will actually be

00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:06,080
significantly easier to add than for the

00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:08,540
Android the native Android app because

00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:12,320
there is a library available geo Jason

00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:14,990
Pathfinder which actually does Dijkstra

00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:20,000
based routing and not just reading but

00:44:14,990 --> 00:44:22,790
also graph generation using geo Jason so

00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:26,030
my own web api already provides

00:44:22,790 --> 00:44:28,940
OpenStreetMap data into you Jason so I

00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:30,890
can convert that to a graph and then use

00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:34,370
geo jason Pathfinder to do the routing

00:44:30,890 --> 00:44:39,980
and again is the github repo for that

00:44:34,370 --> 00:44:41,600
and one of my future plans for hike are

00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:45,410
which have already mentioned in previous

00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:48,770
talks is to use computer vision a better

00:44:45,410 --> 00:44:52,490
placement of rotifer paths and Li the

00:44:48,770 --> 00:44:54,770
trails and there is I do feel that

00:44:52,490 --> 00:44:58,520
because there is a strong AR Dodgers

00:44:54,770 --> 00:45:01,460
community anyway that's likely to lead

00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:04,720
to developments in this direction across

00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:08,830
a Ras as a whole

00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:12,590
ok so thanks for that so any questions

00:45:08,830 --> 00:45:18,280
my email is there and that is I've also

00:45:12,590 --> 00:45:25,030
provided the github repository for the

00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:25,030
web version of hi car ok thanks

00:45:32,570 --> 00:45:43,250
and now finally we have a Mesa Bijou

00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:46,290
with a talk on mapathon column which is

00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:51,510
being coordinated by the kerala state IT

00:45:46,290 --> 00:45:54,120
mission hi I'm Amelia Basu and

00:45:51,510 --> 00:45:56,280
undergraduate civil engineering student

00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:58,710
from Kerala India today I'm here to

00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:59,580
share my experience on awesome and

00:45:58,710 --> 00:46:02,460
awesome

00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:04,140
I suppose in my state I mean SS

00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:06,780
volunteer most of them don't know what

00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:08,550
is NSF and it is a National Service

00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:10,950
Scheme which was initiated by our

00:46:08,550 --> 00:46:13,890
government to promote volunteerism among

00:46:10,950 --> 00:46:16,050
our students and youth mrs. Frederick we

00:46:13,890 --> 00:46:18,180
the orchestra of NSF our College he

00:46:16,050 --> 00:46:20,190
Canada workshop based on awesome and

00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:22,860
through him Holly I understand the basic

00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:24,420
concept of oil sir but I couldn't

00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:26,100
continue my work because of the

00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:26,730
unavailability of the resume like laptop

00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:29,010
or computer

00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:31,890
he only plotted some major parts of our

00:46:29,010 --> 00:46:34,500
College and it's on October 2019 but

00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:37,530
after the panic was widespread and the

00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:41,280
logged on worsley player our NSF's team

00:46:37,530 --> 00:46:43,770
desired to restart the OSM project as a

00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:46,530
program for ionises so we make a team of

00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:49,070
25 to 30 like the many people who likes

00:46:46,530 --> 00:46:53,430
mapping and we start to map as a team

00:46:49,070 --> 00:46:55,530
after that it becomes a interesting like

00:46:53,430 --> 00:46:57,570
that we combat ourself and it also

00:46:55,530 --> 00:46:59,910
become a power cylinders as a way to

00:46:57,570 --> 00:47:02,580
kill materials days and I'm also excited

00:46:59,910 --> 00:47:04,440
for developing a new skill for me this

00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:08,370
make it collaborative with my 7cr

00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:10,920
approach and after that that where the

00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:13,680
all NSS groups among the see this chart

00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:16,080
to make a group for the mapping and then

00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:18,000
start to map from April onwards then the

00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:20,070
coalition team of the mapathon kala they

00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,260
contacted me and informed me that I am a

00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:24,810
leading position among the NSS boulder

00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:27,300
community come get excited then only I

00:47:24,810 --> 00:47:29,310
know that all those NS activities are

00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:31,620
undertaken as a part of a larger program

00:47:29,310 --> 00:47:33,510
by the kala intimation that with the

00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:36,120
motto nomicon Dakar numbered approval of

00:47:33,510 --> 00:47:38,340
colleges may come on now I'm not super

00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:40,830
excited all these initiatives of the

00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:41,780
Kait mission came across due to a series

00:47:40,830 --> 00:47:45,290
of natural

00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:48,290
mitties like we are into that from 2017

00:47:45,290 --> 00:47:50,930
onwards we have all key the cyclone 2070

00:47:48,290 --> 00:47:54,170
we have flooding 2018 and 19 and now we

00:47:50,930 --> 00:47:56,960
have covered during its 2080 19 times

00:47:54,170 --> 00:47:59,510
our Kayla or the state is immersed in

00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:02,330
water for 4 to 5 days that's a positive

00:47:59,510 --> 00:48:05,630
situation more than 600 were died more

00:48:02,330 --> 00:48:08,870
than 35,000 of another evacuated and

00:48:05,630 --> 00:48:11,120
many of the lower livelihood this event

00:48:08,870 --> 00:48:13,370
was brought a realization that climate

00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:15,260
exchange mitigations and also that

00:48:13,370 --> 00:48:17,180
rethinking the development model is one

00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:19,070
of the important cell for Kayla future

00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:21,560
development the important step to

00:48:19,070 --> 00:48:24,710
mitigate the disaster is having a proper

00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:26,810
spatial data information and also having

00:48:24,710 --> 00:48:29,000
a plan system based on the spatial data

00:48:26,810 --> 00:48:31,610
so this requires a lot of data

00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:34,540
generation here comes the importance of

00:48:31,610 --> 00:48:37,160
or the foundation mapathon keller

00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:41,000
mapathon Kayla it was launched by the

00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:42,920
chief minister or in October 2009 G & G

00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:45,140
was coordinated by the Kayla state IT

00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:48,980
mission with a concept or just make our

00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:51,920
map this are using this the project

00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:54,200
involves mainly crowdsourcing and they

00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:56,450
are using that option of crown sauce

00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:58,640
with the government and they use and

00:48:56,450 --> 00:49:01,550
generate open data they are also

00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:03,520
mobilizing local community and making a

00:49:01,550 --> 00:49:05,750
partnership with citizen and state

00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:08,210
during the call with the map without

00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:12,380
attracted more than 2000 volunteers or

00:49:08,210 --> 00:49:13,700
2000 mappers and we plot more than 220

00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:15,800
thousands of buildings

00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:17,840
eighteen thousand five hundred forty

00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:19,670
kilometers of stray network more than

00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:22,280
eight thousand kilometers of road

00:49:19,670 --> 00:49:24,470
network and more than two thousand t7000

00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:27,920
file of assets it is one of the biggest

00:49:24,470 --> 00:49:31,310
achievement that the that the voice of

00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:33,800
or the mapathon have now also the Kait

00:49:31,310 --> 00:49:35,930
mission contact us or mendez are all the

00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:38,600
boilers including me and they teach us

00:49:35,930 --> 00:49:40,850
the new tools like joseph because they

00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:44,360
want to share this knowledge to everyone

00:49:40,850 --> 00:49:46,520
and make a larger map a community so I

00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:48,350
also kind of that my small deals can

00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:50,780
make huge difference in the society

00:49:48,350 --> 00:49:52,730
expression the most challenges face a

00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:55,440
situation humanity now that is the

00:49:52,730 --> 00:49:57,480
common scene so I'm happy that I am a

00:49:55,440 --> 00:50:33,440
voyeurism and pardonable don't gala

00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:38,130
thank and now we will move on to the Q&A

00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:41,760
so if you are in our hackpad you will

00:50:38,130 --> 00:50:45,950
see that some of our speakers are in

00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:53,579
there and have been answering questions

00:50:45,950 --> 00:50:57,539
so a question for divided and map by

00:50:53,579 --> 00:51:02,069
jury the the question was why did you

00:50:57,539 --> 00:51:07,470
pick Postgres instead of MySQL and the

00:51:02,069 --> 00:51:12,240
answer was due to the Postgres GI of the

00:51:07,470 --> 00:51:19,559
post GIS extension because a lot can be

00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:25,319
done just by the query for DDD one two

00:51:19,559 --> 00:51:31,020
three OSM there has there's been added

00:51:25,319 --> 00:51:40,520
some information about how to get

00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:45,809
involved with that project and there

00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:51,869
will perhaps be in the future an online

00:51:45,809 --> 00:51:57,779
map but global coverage is pretty far on

00:51:51,869 --> 00:52:03,569
the roadmap with respect to hot tasking

00:51:57,779 --> 00:52:06,779
manager for somebody asked do users need

00:52:03,569 --> 00:52:08,359
to allow third-party cookies and the

00:52:06,779 --> 00:52:11,839
response is

00:52:08,359 --> 00:52:15,650
it is optional to allow cookies the data

00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:18,769
from the cookies is used only to provide

00:52:15,650 --> 00:52:22,339
hot wood stat statistics about the usage

00:52:18,769 --> 00:52:25,009
of the tools and they use their own

00:52:22,339 --> 00:52:28,849
analytics instance so no data is shared

00:52:25,009 --> 00:52:37,430
with third parties but you can turn that

00:52:28,849 --> 00:52:40,460
off if you want for hike are there the

00:52:37,430 --> 00:52:47,599
question is if there is a f-droid

00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:52,849
version planned and answer is the native

00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:59,230
Android app could go on F Droid but the

00:52:52,849 --> 00:52:59,230
talk is related to a browser-based app

00:52:59,769 --> 00:53:16,609
and then there is some further

00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:21,009
discussion about sub sick I issue z'

00:53:16,609 --> 00:53:26,359
that people are encountering in testing

00:53:21,009 --> 00:53:29,799
testing that out so if you have

00:53:26,359 --> 00:53:32,619
questions for our speakers i know that

00:53:29,799 --> 00:53:36,559
with the lightning talks we have

00:53:32,619 --> 00:53:38,480
speakers from all parts of the world so

00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:43,339
many of them are probably not awake

00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:47,839
right now you can post your question in

00:53:43,339 --> 00:53:52,599
the hack pad and the speakers hopefully

00:53:47,839 --> 00:53:56,779
will be able to respond in the document

00:53:52,599 --> 00:54:02,119
and thank you for joining us everyone

00:53:56,779 --> 00:54:06,400
we're now going to a meal break and we

00:54:02,119 --> 00:54:06,400
