Humanitarian Openstreetmap Team (HOT) is an international team focused on humanitarian action and community development through open mapping. Since 2010, the organization has managed activations to attend multiple events such as understanding hazards, public health, refugee response, among others. However, when we think about organizing large-scale efforts it can be complex, due to the necessary logistics, volunteers involved, and also assuring that the data collected is meaningful. MapCampaigner, is a tool which monitors progress, view metrics on the quality and completeness of collected data and users engaged. The goal of this talk is to present the latest features included in the latest update of the tool, the goals that MapCampaigner accomplishes and many humanitarian and non-humanitarian examples through a demo.

When we talk about a mapping campaign, it generally has specific characteristics:
Desire to collect geospatial data for a purpose.
Define an area of interest.
Define a set of features and attributes to collect.
The period of time of the campaign
Group of people to collect the data. Could be highly trained staff members or volunteers.

It would sound simple. However, it is possible to find challenges in difficult places. For instance, how to crowdsource precise locations and specific attributes of every school in Barranquilla, Colombia? Because some locations are inaccessible, it becomes difficult and costly to deploy people to the area to collect and validate the data. Many tools have been developed to address these challenges remotely, like OpenMapKit and Maps.me to collect data and do some quality assurance with JOSM, for instance. Despite this, these tools do not have the property to monitor specific features/attributes, define current status of the mapping campaign, or validate people contributing in an area.

Putting these challenges in mind, HOT designed the MapCampaigner tool. Users can track and measure the quality of many features such as schools, buildings and cafes at the same time. This mapping campaign will report users involved, missing tags, and percentage of completeness in an area for each attribute collected. Also, MapCampaigner has integrations with apps such as Maps.me and OpenMapKit

In this talk, I will walk through the tool, how it is used, and seek input for enhancements. Will show new features included in the latest user-centered redesign using  live demo. The schedule of this talk is the following:
Introduction and problem statement (5 minutes).
MapCampaigner features (5 minutes)
Examples and demo (5 minutes)
Conclusions and future work (5 minutes)

00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:13,840
am glad to welcome jorge so jorge

00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,200
martinez will be speaking about a map

00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,240
campaigner redesign

00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:21,199
the data quality monitor for osm

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,880
so let me read a few words about jorge

00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:26,560
jorge has contributed for

00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,680
foss since 2014 and he has a master and

00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:31,039
a bachelor in

00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,960
electronic engineering from unisa del

00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,360
norte in barranquilla colombia

00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,960
and his research was focused in the

00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,840
development of computer vision

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,840
algorithms

00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,040
to track and recognize objects and

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,719
actions in videos

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,120
right now he is working with hot

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,399
especially in tasking manager so let's

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,559
welcome jorge

00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:49,520

thank you everyone

00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,399
uh one moment uh so one suggestion is

00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,360
that we have this path in the one you

00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,600
can be adding

00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,640
questions and answers please do not wait

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,320
at the end of the talk

00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,480
to write your answers your questions

00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,720
sorry please during the top you can

00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:07,360
start writing your questions so we have

00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,159
all them already kind of aligned for the

00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,200
end of the talk

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,640
so you can start writing as long as you

00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,080
are watching the presentation thanks a

00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,119
lot

00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:19,520
okay so let's get started um

00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,240
first of all thank you for watching this

00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,080
video

00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,000
and this is the first time i make a

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,759
presentation at the state of the map

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,320
and also this is the first time i make a

00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:30,960
presentation remotely

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,960
i know the the organizers that are doing

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,240
a great effort to make this happen

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:38,000
so also i want to thank them and yeah

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,880
i'm going to talk about map campaigner

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,799
which is

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,640
the data quality monitor for mapping

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,320
projects it's a tool developed by the

00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:48,960
humanitarian street map

00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:52,079
tech team and yeah i'm jorge martinez

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:55,360
and first of all i want to talk about me

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:57,119
i joined the hot tech team last year

00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,920
first of all working on map campaigner

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:03,200
then migrated to task manager

00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,920
i recently joined on march

00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,000
the war food program gis unit and doing

00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,720
some work in geonote

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,319
my background i'm a bachelor and master

00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,800
in electronic engineering

00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:17,040
my thesis or research project was

00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:20,480
relating computer vision

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:23,120
and i'm from barranquilla colombia

00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,239
so the agenda the first thing is an

00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,879
introduction

00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,760
and then we move to what is a mapping

00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,480
campaign

00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,400
and the third thing would be what is my

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,879
campaigner the tool itself how it works

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,480
i'm gonna

00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:38,400
show a brief demo and then um

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,599
some black tech explanation on how it

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,920
works

00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,800
and finally the questions and answers

00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,680
which is

00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:49,040
uh i suppose are going to be held in the

00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,040
qa session at the conference

00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:54,480
so over the years there have

00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,400
we have seen like different projects

00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,560
related to mapping

00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,800
we have seen like a group of people that

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:04,159
gather together and start

00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,640
collecting or updating data related to

00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:08,080
some

00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:11,280
particular topic or some specific

00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,560
uh yeah some specific topic for example

00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,200
you can i show

00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,280
i'm showing you here a screenshot of

00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,640
media mappers

00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:23,440
which is an application that shows um

00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,879
basic information related to where to

00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,519
find

00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:30,159
supermarkets or where to find pharmacies

00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:33,200
or drugstores

00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,799
also there is an application a

00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,680
collaborative tool

00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:39,360
where people update and collect data

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,799
related to health facilities

00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:45,519
which is health sites so

00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,000
uh the basically these two applications

00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,159
would have

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,200
in common is like there is a group of

00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:52,720
people

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:54,720
and that working together they are

00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,040
like uh collecting data or obtaining

00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,680
data for some specific topic

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,120
and you can find in the open stream of

00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,799
wiki like different

00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:07,360
uh different like projects or yeah

00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:09,360
projects or mapping projects that are

00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,280
related for a certain topics

00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,120
so for example accessibility there is a

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,560
project that you can find

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:19,759
related to finding

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:23,040
buildings or finding a shops that have

00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:26,160
like the wheelchair accessibility option

00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:29,759
also related government history

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:32,639
infrastructure and so on

00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,440
so yeah and what is a mapping campaign

00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,160
in general

00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,440
uh is a collaborative effort by people

00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,360
with common interest

00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,680
to map a particular territory or to

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,240
improve mapping for a particular topic

00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,600
this is a definition that i found in

00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,400
openstreetmap wiki

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,919
and i found it like really nice because

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,880
it's really short and it's straight to

00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,320
the point

00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,000
that is like a group of people that got

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,479
it together and start

00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,160
collecting data basically geospatial

00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:01,360
data and that data

00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:05,600
has some particular topic

00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:07,440
and yeah so

00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,199
in general like a mapping campaign where

00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,720
a mapping project involves like

00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,440
following characteristics

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,960
so the first one is to define the goal

00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:18,880
the goal or the purpose

00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:20,639
of of making this

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,160
then like define the set of features and

00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,520
attributes to collect what

00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,919
what what if we want to collect

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,720
buildings or if we want to call it roads

00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:30,720
or what would be the topic of the

00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,199
campaign

00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,960
also the region or the area of interest

00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,000
and the range of dates when we want to

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:40,240
collect the data

00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,240
and finally the contributors

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,120
but it would sound easy but there could

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,240
be like

00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,880
common issues at the beginning for

00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,840
example

00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,840
is there data publicly available i mean

00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:02,240
it's possible to find data on the region

00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:05,360
that it fits for our needs

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,039
or which are the tools to run a mapping

00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,000
campaign for example do we need like to

00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:10,960
make surveys

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,440
or do we need to download some specific

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,720
tool

00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:17,680
or software uh also has the region all

00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:20,560
the features and attributes we need

00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,720
uh is how is is there going to be like

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,600
coverage tracking in qa how do we

00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,800
measure

00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:30,960
if the data collect this perfectly

00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:34,479
fits our needs or is remote mapping

00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:36,560
uh possible which means like

00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:39,680
we would do we need to deploy people to

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,680
the area or not

00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,800
so based on those issues there could be

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,720
like challenges

00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,639
for example related to the data public

00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,560
available uh

00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,639
who is contributing like is there any

00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,759
organization doing that or where is the

00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:55,759
organization

00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:58,880
or is the data perfectly for our needs

00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:02,160
or is something missing

00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,680
or related related to if the region has

00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:07,759
all the features and attributes

00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:10,800
sometimes uh data could be like sparse

00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:12,800
sometimes could be messy and the local

00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,960
knowledge could be like missing

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,639
because we don't know if the people that

00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,120
collect there knows that

00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,479
the place and also sometimes it's hard

00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,919
to measure the high quality

00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:26,240
of the contributions made and

00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:27,919
related to remote mappings if we need to

00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,599
deploy people to the area

00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,599
there could be like associated cause for

00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:33,680
example transportations

00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:35,280
and sometimes uh related to the

00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:39,440
complexity of the area

00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:43,199
uh it would not be possible to

00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:46,160
collect all the area all the information

00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,160
for all the area

00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:53,599
now based on that

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:57,039
hot developed a map campaign which

00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:58,000
in general terms is a monitor to it is a

00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:00,639
tool that monitors

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,759
the progress and the data quality of

00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,919
mapping

00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,360
mapping projects or mapping campaigns

00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,560
i'm going to show you right now a brief

00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:12,560
demo so

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:13,039
if i go to campaigns.osm.org and this is

00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,319
the place

00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:17,520
this is the web page that it shows and

00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,400
first of all i'm going to create a

00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:23,840
campaign so i need to log in

00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:26,160
go to location then

00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,360
you can log in using osm credentials so

00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,400
you don't need to create your own

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,000
account

00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:35,599
you just need to create your osm one

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,479
and then i'm going to create a campaign

00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,440
so the first it involves a series of

00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,080
steps

00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,560
the first is uh what is the project name

00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,320
i'm going to

00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,839
create for example buildings in my city

00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,480
barranquilla so

00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,440
valencia buildings will be the pregnant

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,080
also

00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,200
the range of dates so today is 19 so i'm

00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,160
gonna start

00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:58,800
yesterday i'm gonna end i don't know

00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,800
this sunday

00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:04,399
and the description is uh collecting

00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:12,080
buildings

00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:14,240
hit next and the next step is to draw

00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,760
the rf interest so

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,519
the first there are two options the

00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,880
first one is to upload a file which

00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:23,120
could be a

00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:25,680
polygon geo json or a polygon shapefile

00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,640
also the other option is to draw on the

00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,680
map so

00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:33,360
let me go directly to my city

00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,360
it's over here it's ghosts

00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:40,320
i'm gonna map this area the collector

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,320
data here

00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:48,240
yep it's okay and i confirm

00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,279
then i go next and the next step is the

00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,640
features

00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:54,080
to select the features we want

00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,480
to add a feature there could be like

00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,120
three options the first one is to use a

00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,160
template

00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,360
so we can get a map campaign comes

00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,560
already with

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,839
all set of templates for features and

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,680
attributes

00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,120
also there is a custom form so we can

00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,480
create a feature name

00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,800
and what is the feature we want to

00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,600
collect the geometry of it

00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:18,320
and also all the attributes that are

00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:21,360
going to be checked

00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:25,360
and the third one is a jumble editor

00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,959
which uh sometimes when you have like

00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,640
you want to collect the same data for

00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:31,680
different campaigns

00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,040
uh it would be like it's not hard it

00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,839
would be like tedious

00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,640
to start uh writing one by one for each

00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,720
campaign

00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,760
so at yama editor you can store all the

00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,000
features and

00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,440
tags you want to collect and then you

00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,800
just need to copy that

00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:50,320
jumbo jumbo file or sorry jamal

00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:52,160
yeah you just need to copy the text into

00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:55,279
the other campaigns so it would be like

00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,279
easier and faster

00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:00,079
so for this case i just want to

00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,760
collect buildings so i just select

00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:04,640
buildings

00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,760
and finally are the settings so the

00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:09,360
first one

00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:11,839
the option is to select the managers

00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,760
where the users are going to be managers

00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:16,000
the viewers

00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,279
if we want to to monitor some specific

00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,399
contributors

00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:21,920
and also if we want to add base maps so

00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:24,000
yeah if i press submit

00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,600
i can get the status of the campaign so

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,920
it's going to be a

00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,519
a series of tasks and it's going to take

00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,839
time sometimes so

00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:34,959
i'm going to use a previously one

00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:38,000
selected so i'm going to

00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:40,240
show you shops in pogota

00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,839
it's another example and this is the

00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,839
dashboard so you can get here

00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,720
the total features that were collected

00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,720
from from shopsy bagota

00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,800
the features type monitor which is shops

00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:55,760
already the number of contributors

00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,600
and the featured completeness then

00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,480
you're going to hear all the details for

00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:03,200
all the features

00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:06,240
and you can get here the status of it uh

00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:09,120
who is the user that last aided the

00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,000
the feature the date the attributes

00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,600
found and the attribute

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,480
is not found so yeah let's select the

00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,720
features

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,720
and i go to shops

00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:24,160
and then i see the map

00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,079
and it shows the area that i selected

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,240
and i see all the points that are

00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:32,160
related to shops

00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:35,680
so this is a list of points

00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:38,320
that shows some shops and also

00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,600
shows information in a specific color

00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,880
which is the completeness of the

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,000
attribute

00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:48,320
so it means that if it's red at least

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:51,040
two 25 or less than 25 percent

00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,760
doesn't have these features so this is

00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,480
like the

00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,440
the completeness measure basically it

00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,760
checks

00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,560
if all the features sorry if all the

00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,800
attributes

00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,160
for a given feature are within the

00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,160
feature collected

00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,399
so in this case we don't have it so we

00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:09,920
can get a red one

00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:13,120
but you can get for example over here

00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:15,120
this green one uh you can get all the

00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:18,959
features that for example the name

00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:21,600
of the shop the opening hours and the

00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,480
the the order types or sorry the other

00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,399
attributes

00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,160
so it means that what it has like 100

00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:30,800
percent which is

00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:32,880
uh okay for this of completeness

00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,320
so yeah in general this is what map

00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,399
container is

00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,760
basically it collects data from

00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,480
openstreetmap

00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,120
so we use overpass to collect data and

00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:45,040
then

00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:47,519
based on that we measure we measure the

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:50,000
number of attributes for each feature

00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:53,920
that are completed or not

00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,920
so it's it's basically a monitor because

00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,839
for example if we know here that these

00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,079
regions do not have

00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,120
or some tags are missing or if we have

00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:03,600
local knowledge

00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,560
we know that there could be also other

00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,720
shops here

00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,600
we can go directly to osm for example

00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,279
here

00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,560
and if i press edit it goes directly to

00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:15,680
openstreetmap

00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:17,120
and we can use this ao this the aoi that

00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:20,000
we created for the campaign

00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,120
as a gpx in os openstreetmap and then we

00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,959
can go directly

00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,160
and we can update the data that is

00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:27,760
missing

00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:28,480
so it's it's uh this is like the real

00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,199
goal

00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,480
like to measure or to monitor the

00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:36,639
quality of the data

00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:39,839
and we can check before doing deployment

00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:41,760
if it's necessary or not we can check

00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,360
the amount of features or the amount of

00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:47,680
attributes that is that are missing

00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:50,399
in some specific region so yeah this is

00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:52,880
in general turns map campaigner also we

00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:56,000
can get the contributor details for

00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:57,680
the features so you can check here the

00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,880
ranking of the users that are

00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,839
contributing most for

00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,959
that given area so we can show the

00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,880
rankings we can

00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:06,480
because we are not i i'm going to select

00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:12,000
to monitor specific users

00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:15,120
there are not a contributors monitor

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:18,240
uh yeah

00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,240
let me go back

00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:28,160
so

00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,839
so map campaigner in general fulfills

00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,920
two general milestones

00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:34,000
the first one it facilitates the chrome

00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,639
mapping by engaging contributors because

00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,240
we know

00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:40,720
in the area which are the users or

00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,920
who is mapping and what is mapping that

00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,839
user

00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,839
and also accelerates mapping campaigns

00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:46,639
because it includes like coverage

00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,800
tracking

00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:50,160
and also we can review and make quality

00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,079
assessment assessment of the data

00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,240
collected from oneself

00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:56,959
and all it's it could be done all most

00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:00,079
of all could be done like remotely

00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:03,120
and this is the the techie part which is

00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:04,720
uh in general map container it has like

00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,320
a storage when we store all the

00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,040
campaigns a server

00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,160
when we hit request and also a list of

00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:13,440
uh of stack of

00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:14,320
functions or contributions so when we

00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,639
create a campaign

00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,839
we send from the server the metadata of

00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,720
the campaign which is

00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:22,240
the features we need the aoi also we

00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,360
need the

00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:28,560
the um um the range of dates the name

00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:30,959
description and so on and

00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,920
also it starts computing at least a

00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:34,480
function

00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,279
this is like a a way a kind of way of

00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,560
serverless

00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:40,880
architecture because when we start

00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,000
executing the compute campaign it makes

00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:45,040
a request

00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,160
to overpass using the aoi we read from

00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,759
storage dioi

00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,759
and then we execute an overpass function

00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,839
which reads the data and then we store

00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:55,519
all the data from osm

00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:58,880
then the featured completeness function

00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:00,639
is invoked by the overpass one it starts

00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,000
getting the data the osm data that we

00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:06,000
collected previously

00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,520
and start computing the completeness

00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,120
and all the features and all the

00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,760
attributes and how completed

00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:13,679
each one is and then generates such a

00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,360
json features which is then stored and

00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,280
showed in the map

00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:19,600
so it starts like a series of functions

00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:23,039
that is are invoked one by one

00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:24,720
and then we finally get a list of

00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:26,400
functions that are executing one by one

00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,360
and surplus architecture so we don't

00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,320
need

00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,720
um we don't need like a kind of server

00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,559
to

00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,080
make the these functions that are

00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:35,919
running

00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:38,880
are they are like run every time so we

00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:40,000
can every time we need to update we just

00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,000
press a button and then

00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,160
we start updating the data so this could

00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,240
be run also in scheduled time

00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,559
so which for example 30 minutes or each

00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,240
hour or week of each two hours

00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:52,480
you can like update the status of the

00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:55,600
campaign

00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:59,440
so that's some

00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:02,400
general explanation how how it works and

00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,440
yeah i think that's all what i wanted to

00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,480
show

00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:14,640
what my campaigner is and

00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:16,400
yeah thanks thanks for all

00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,080
thanks a lot jorge uh for the

00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,400
presentation

00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,440
happy day yeah thank you yeah i'm here

00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,600
okay perfect

00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,039
so okay yes i hear you thanks for

00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:28,400
presentation about

00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:30,240
mac campaigner uh great to see this tool

00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,679
so where i have questions and that's

00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,039
because during the talk people was

00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,720
already excited about

00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:36,400
asking a few questions so i have them

00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:39,120
right here with me so

00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,600
if we're ready we can start so first

00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,640
question

00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,520
is this a new tool and the person said i

00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,720
discovered

00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,360
it this morning but found out a lot of

00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,559
issues

00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,559
some are already described

00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,320
uh well the the tool is a word that was

00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,200
developed

00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,480
last year it was in december last year

00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,919
and

00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,760
i think most of the issues that are

00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:04,400
found are related to

00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,600
the ioi that is collected and also i

00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:09,120
think is related to

00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:10,480
the option to like edit the campaign so

00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,160
it's a progress that was developed last

00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,679
year but uh

00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,520
we haven't like continued working on

00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:18,400
that but i know there are

00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,919
there are issues and and we we should

00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,600
work on it

00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:23,360
okay thank you jorge so the next

00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,360
question is uh we will like

00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,360
uh we will use it in a whole region or

00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:30,160
country for example france

00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,600
will make map campaigner don't accept

00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:35,919
large areas

00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:38,080
so what's the plan for that jorge well

00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:40,080
basically the the aoi restriction for

00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:42,080
large areas are because

00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,360
uh overpass we're limited to overpass

00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,360
because uh

00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,679
we cannot collect uh we kind of make a

00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:49,919
request of like big geometries to

00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:51,679
to to overpass because it will drop

00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:55,120
better so

00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:56,559
we are we can we can limit or we can

00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,280
construct like multiple campaigns from

00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:00,640
now

00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:02,400
and one possible work is to like er

00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,400
a campaign we can split a campaign to

00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,000
like separate ones separate aois

00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,240
and then start making requests one by

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,799
one then we collect the data and then we

00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,919
merge everything into one so that's one

00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:14,640
idea we're having

00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:16,640
and we're we want we when we can discuss

00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,559
it further

00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,400
okay great to hear that jorge and the

00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,039
next question is uh do you plan to

00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:25,520
display

00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:27,600
a percentage also by attributes

00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:30,559
percentage also by address i mean like

00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:32,559
uh the number of attributes collected

00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:34,240
uh the number of attributes collected

00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:36,400
given a a feature

00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,000
or can repeat the question please yes i

00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,600
will repeat it but in case it's not

00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,240
clear we can ask this person

00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,880
uh to elaborate more and we can leave it

00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,120
for the end

00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,559
uh so okay i'll repeat the question now

00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:50,799
do you plan to display

00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:50,799
a percentage also by attributes

00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,520
so per attribute there is a percentage

00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:58,000
of completeness

00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,720
so this this percentage of completeness

00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,480
is based

00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:04,000
on the number of attributes that aren't

00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,520
that are found within the feature that

00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,640
is collected

00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:10,000
uh but uh i don't have like really

00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,440
creative questions so if you can

00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,120
elaborate a little bit more don't worry

00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,880
i mean we can ask the person to lower it

00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,559
a bit more and we can come back uh

00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,000
at the end of the questions so the next

00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:21,600
question will be uh what is the

00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:24,320
frequency of overpass queries

00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:26,640
so right now the scheduler is we have we

00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:29,440
have everything in in aws

00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,400
so there is a scheduler that is aws

00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,640
cloud watch

00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,760
and it's done per hour per two hours so

00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,919
each two hours

00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,280
uh i think it's two hours it collects

00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:40,000
data

00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:42,080
but we're planning to like ex to like

00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,960
modify map campaign in order to

00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,880
be like user user input so if the user

00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,360
wants to like update the campaign

00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,000
uh the user needs to like press button

00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,320
and then

00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,039
it should it starts like running

00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:57,039
rerunning all the tasks

00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:58,480
okay thank you for the answer uh jorge

00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,960
so i have another one right here

00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,840
uh it's hot using map campaigner

00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,000
currently

00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:06,000
or did you create it mostly for other

00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,120
users

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:12,720
so uh in in areas for making deployment

00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:15,679
is is currently is currently user uh

00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:17,919
mostly in like in other areas uh not not

00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:20,559
that by the technical team itself

00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,679
but other uh dependencies of hot are

00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:24,880
using it for like

00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:26,320
making data collection okay thanks for

00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,240
the answer uh

00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:30,640
and let's see uh there is one comment

00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,559
already uh they said this is an amazing

00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:36,480
tool thank you for sharing

00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:38,640
and and let me see i think the person

00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,919
uh just came with some more comments

00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,520
regarding

00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:43,760
the previous question that we were not

00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:47,360
able to answer uh this person is saying

00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:50,320
uh i want to know of many uh

00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,120
example names are set for all the osm

00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:55,840
objects

00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,840
in the campaign

00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,880
yeah i'm confused too so regarding the

00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,600
question do you plan to display a

00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,080
percentage

00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:06,080
also by attributes the person is

00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:09,120
complementing the the question saying

00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:12,400
i want to know of many example names

00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:14,000
are set for all the osm objects in the

00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:17,919
campaign

00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,919
same thing for another attributes

00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:24,640
okay i suppose he's referring to like

00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:28,480
a attributes that are like a by

00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:30,240
created by users so i guess that that's

00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:33,360
what's his referring so

00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:35,039
basically a smart computer starts

00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:37,280
collecting data based on the

00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,480
on the configuration that you set when

00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:41,440
creating the campaign so

00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,799
if you don't add like the user input uh

00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:46,720
the user well the the

00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:50,000
the the attribute given by the user

00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:52,320
uh it won't collect it so you can you

00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,400
can specify it within within the demo

00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,600
or because in the templates we are not

00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,640
using those

00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:01,360
uh user based uh tags

00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,640
so yeah it depends on what you're like

00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:05,440
specifying within the

00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:07,360
yaml file okay thank you for the answer

00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,880
uh there is someone else writing another

00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,440
answer and probably this would be the

00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,480
last one

00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:15,360
uh so we can move to the next uh talk so

00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,840
one second uh okay it says what is the

00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:19,520
link

00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:22,640
to the project you are demonstrating

00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:24,240
oh so right now projects are like are

00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,760
like private so

00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,480
well they are not private so we're

00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:31,679
showing only a campaigns
