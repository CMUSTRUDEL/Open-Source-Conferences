so our first speaker is a keynote is the

00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:17,570
keynote speaker there won't be a Q&A

00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:20,730
session but he does have a session later

00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:25,470
if you want to ask questions

00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:27,960
it's alum mustard who is the he's the

00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:30,840
chair of the OpenStreetMap foundation

00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:33,780
and he's been talking to a lot of people

00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:36,980
over the last year virtually and in

00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:39,540
person so if he's got love insight into

00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:42,570
OpenStreetMap where it's come from and

00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:47,280
what's changing so going to hear from

00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:48,350
Alan on winds of change filling my

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:53,760
technical team

00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:56,070
well since being elected first to the

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,480
OSM Foundation Board of Directors and

00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:59,520
then chairman of the board last

00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,680
September I spent a great deal of time

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,629
on the telephone Skype and various

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,519
conferencing apps listening to members

00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:07,979
of the OSM community going all the way

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,810
back to Steve coast and forward through

00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:11,760
a mix of old-timers heavy mappers

00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:13,860
software developers working group

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,610
members local chapters and communities

00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:19,920
and advisory board members I also kicked

00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:22,049
off a SWOT analysis on the OSM wiki a

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,659
survey of strengths weaknesses

00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:26,520
opportunities and threats to hear from

00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:29,189
the broad osm community what it thinks

00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:31,229
about the state of OSM I'd like to share

00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:33,540
with you some conclusions I have drawn

00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:36,090
from these conversations and the SWOT

00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,560
analysis I want to underscore is that

00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:39,630
what you were about to hear is my own

00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,700
assessment based on 32 years of

00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:44,250
management experience 20 of them in

00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,810
senior leadership roles this assessment

00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:49,020
does not necessarily reflect either

00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:49,979
official osm foundation policy or the

00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:54,079
views of the board

00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:54,079
or any other of its members

00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:01,780
the OSM foundation is responsible for

00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:04,050
supporting but not controlling open

00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:04,050
street

00:02:04,119 --> 00:02:08,179
raises funds and generally creates an

00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:10,250
operating environment that allows

00:02:08,179 --> 00:02:12,350
mappers to map and data users to use the

00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:14,990
data the board does not tell anybody

00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:16,880
what can map or how to map the content

00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:18,350
of the OSF database is up to the mappers

00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:21,560
themselves and the local communities

00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:23,360
made up of those mappers the data

00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:25,190
working group ensures that data conform

00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,959
to our copyright rules and helps the

00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:29,360
community enforce its other rules as to

00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,970
what the map database and its associated

00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,260
wiki should contain the foundation's

00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:35,120
mission statement lists several

00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:38,540
responsibilities that board carries and

00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,880
among them is this the OSF OS MF board

00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:44,300
and board members define a strategic

00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:46,160
vision that vision has clearly been

00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:47,900
lacking for the last few years in part

00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,880
because of dissension on previous boards

00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:51,830
and in part because of dissension among

00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,750
members of both the foundation and the

00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:55,370
OSF community some of whom have

00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:57,890
historically objected to the notion that

00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:59,480
the board should make any decisions the

00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:01,610
idea of the foundation board making

00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,980
decisions has been condemned as not the

00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:05,450
OSM way and in some corners of the

00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:06,890
community the view continues to be

00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:08,989
advanced that all decisions should be

00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:11,180
made collectively this has led to

00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:13,670
paralysis and thus many needed decisions

00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:15,380
were not made and my conversations with

00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:17,660
community members since the start of the

00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:19,010
new year only one person has insisted

00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:21,260
that the board should continue not

00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:23,120
making decisions all others have

00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:25,220
expressed fatigue with the paralysis and

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,870
suggested to me that it is time for the

00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:29,060
board to start making decisions that do

00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:30,680
not affect how anyone Maps but which

00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:32,930
will ensure the health and stability of

00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:35,810
our infrastructure and will protect the

00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:37,489
community's intellectual property and

00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:39,590
make no mistake about that last point

00:03:37,489 --> 00:03:41,930
our intellectual property is valuable

00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:45,350
it's now used by Apple which combines a

00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:48,380
data from TomTom for Apple maps in 2010

00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:51,320
excuse me 2019 Facebook switched a

00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:53,000
hundred percent to osm data not because

00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:54,920
it is free but because it is the

00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,260
highest-quality global cartographic data

00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:59,570
set available the user base is enormous

00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:02,380
and ranges from big corporations to a

00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:05,480
very long tail of small users at one end

00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:06,230
Microsoft's Bing uses osm data and so

00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,299
does essary

00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:10,700
and then there's a humanitarian angle

00:04:08,299 --> 00:04:12,680
exemplified by hot the humanitarian osm

00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:14,569
team which over the last 10 years to

00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,940
save lives by creating maps needed by

00:04:14,569 --> 00:04:17,630
rescuers and medical personnel all with

00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:19,790
osm day

00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:22,040
but that's only part of the picture it's

00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:24,380
not just the big guys using OSM it's

00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:26,810
thousands of map creators everywhere for

00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:29,030
whom osm is crucial and millions of

00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:31,070
users of the maps that they create from

00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:33,260
small companies like maps with me to

00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:37,100
individual cartographers from Maribor to

00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:39,320
Manila from Krakow to Cape Town a map of

00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:41,390
the world that anyone can use has

00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:43,580
spawned an ecosystem of commercial and

00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:46,820
humanitarian organizations that don't

00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:51,800
merely use our data they need it they

00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:53,270
live by it between the SWOT analysis and

00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:56,210
the many conversations with stakeholders

00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:58,490
in the OSM community I have identified a

00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:01,580
set of opposing viewpoints that in their

00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:03,980
extreme forms cannot be reconciled this

00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:05,750
means that ultimately the community will

00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:07,760
have to make some decisions about which

00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:10,340
way to go in terms of a strategic vision

00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:11,840
or direction this slide shows perhaps

00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:13,790
the most obvious of the opposing

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,800
viewpoints I've heard or read with

00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:20,060
traditional osm views shown in red and

00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:21,590
advocacy for change shown in blue who is

00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:23,720
supposed to arbitrate between these two

00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:24,920
sets of opposing viewpoints this

00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,140
arbitration is the board's

00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:29,660
responsibility and as a board member I

00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:32,150
have a fiduciary responsibility to our

00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:33,920
foundation and through it to its members

00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:36,860
they protect the usm community's

00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:38,630
interests that means that I as a board

00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:40,550
member must pull the community and

00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:42,410
through that process must discern what

00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:45,530
decisions the majority of the community

00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:47,870
supports by law I really do not have a

00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:49,820
choice the board has to make decisions

00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:52,010
but the decisions we as board members

00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:54,110
make must reflect what the community

00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:56,090
wants osm to look like there's a very

00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:58,670
simple reason for this without the

00:05:56,090 --> 00:06:00,290
community there is no osm and aboard the

00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:03,170
diverges from the community will

00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:05,180
endanger OSM's future osm is the

00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:07,160
community and our map depends solely on

00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:11,120
the contributions of data from that

00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:13,340
community I will not lead you through my

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,990
analysis of the SWOT here simply because

00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:17,240
I cannot do that in the time allotted

00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:19,520
you'll have to visit the wiki and read

00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:21,530
the SWOT for yourself if you want to

00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,290
read my analysis of the SWOT send me an

00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:25,550
email and I'll send it to however I

00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:26,960
would like to lead you through some

00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:28,700
highlights drawn from both the SWOT

00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,529
analysis and my more than 40

00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:32,569
conversations with representatives

00:06:30,529 --> 00:06:37,549
of various factions within the USM

00:06:32,569 --> 00:06:40,069
community the cognoscenti widely

00:06:37,549 --> 00:06:42,679
recognized the demand for osm services

00:06:40,069 --> 00:06:44,119
including tiles geocoding and geo data

00:06:42,679 --> 00:06:45,559
has outstripped the current

00:06:44,119 --> 00:06:47,449
configuration of hardware and software

00:06:45,559 --> 00:06:49,749
and is straining the volunteer labor

00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:51,709
force particularly the sysadmin

00:06:49,749 --> 00:06:53,359
according to the operations working

00:06:51,709 --> 00:06:57,769
group this demand is growing at an

00:06:53,359 --> 00:06:59,389
astounding rate 50% year-on-year our

00:06:57,769 --> 00:07:01,819
current configuration of hardware

00:06:59,389 --> 00:07:04,399
software and human beings operating and

00:07:01,819 --> 00:07:06,799
maintaining hardware and software is not

00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:08,989
sustainable something has to give

00:07:06,799 --> 00:07:10,999
if the system will implode at some point

00:07:08,989 --> 00:07:13,519
or the OS MF will take action to ensure

00:07:10,999 --> 00:07:15,949
that the platform remains reliable this

00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:17,389
is the rub those who are screaming that

00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:19,249
the OS MF board should not make

00:07:17,389 --> 00:07:21,439
decisions seem not to recognize that the

00:07:19,249 --> 00:07:24,439
world has changed and the demand for OS

00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:25,189
m data is straining the de system to the

00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:28,339
breaking point

00:07:25,189 --> 00:07:30,019
the cognoscenti also widely recognized

00:07:28,339 --> 00:07:32,599
that the operations working group has

00:07:30,019 --> 00:07:34,279
collapsed which they see as symptomatic

00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:37,219
of the increased demands placed on the

00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:40,069
hitherto 100% volunteer duoc recei

00:07:37,219 --> 00:07:42,229
though not universally held the view

00:07:40,069 --> 00:07:44,809
that OS MF should begin to hire staff to

00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:47,059
augment the volunteer labor particularly

00:07:44,809 --> 00:07:51,139
said bins in a software developer to

00:07:47,059 --> 00:07:52,969
maintain the API is widespread notably

00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:54,769
individuals responsible for maintaining

00:07:52,969 --> 00:07:57,259
OS m infrastructure specifically

00:07:54,769 --> 00:08:00,439
expressed that sentiment interestingly

00:07:57,259 --> 00:08:02,269
enough resistance to this notion appears

00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:03,799
to come from people not involved in

00:08:02,269 --> 00:08:07,309
operations or maintenance of

00:08:03,799 --> 00:08:09,079
infrastructure multiple old-timers made

00:08:07,309 --> 00:08:12,079
comments to the effect that quote nobody

00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:13,729
envisioned OS m success unquote or as

00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:15,979
one of them put it o sm shouldn't have

00:08:13,729 --> 00:08:19,099
worked but somehow it did with lots of

00:08:15,979 --> 00:08:20,899
time effort emotion and pride one

00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:23,509
respondent commented that OS m provides

00:08:20,899 --> 00:08:26,509
maps to two billion users per day yet

00:08:23,509 --> 00:08:29,749
has only two sysadmin to maintain the

00:08:26,509 --> 00:08:31,399
hardware several remarked that OS m has

00:08:29,749 --> 00:08:33,860
outgrown the model of democracy that

00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:35,959
carried it this far and opined that it

00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:37,610
needs a new management model one

00:08:35,959 --> 00:08:39,379
respondent highlighted the disconnect

00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:42,139
between casual mapping and the size of

00:08:39,379 --> 00:08:44,360
the project as it is today and noted

00:08:42,139 --> 00:08:46,160
that having grown from a smaller project

00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:48,560
and not especially geographically

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:51,769
diverse osm today requires greater

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:54,140
commitment another set more structure

00:08:51,769 --> 00:08:56,660
and more governance is required just

00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:58,910
because it's used more extensively put

00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:00,589
another way a respondent said growth and

00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:03,070
success have led it past the type of

00:09:00,589 --> 00:09:05,630
individuals who started it

00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:08,000
countering that one respondent commented

00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:10,519
the catch-22 of OS M is that actual

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,829
mappers want a smaller OS MF and don't

00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:14,600
want dependence on outside money one

00:09:12,829 --> 00:09:17,240
respondent perhaps captured this dilemma

00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:19,579
best super organization isn't necessary

00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:24,860
but anarchy is not an answer

00:09:19,579 --> 00:09:26,690
neither the conversations reveal the

00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:28,399
desire for better communications between

00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:30,680
the board and the communities various

00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,450
tribes including working groups which

00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:34,190
can only be satiated by making the

00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:37,040
effort to reach out the schedule calls

00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:38,570
and then just a call local communities

00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:42,040
and chapters in particular would like

00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:44,000
better communication with the board

00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,470
geographic coverage of the current

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,160
outreach effort remains a work in

00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:48,140
progress

00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,209
that said I must point out that the

00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:52,519
board has begun reaching out to local

00:09:50,209 --> 00:09:54,709
communities and perhaps more important

00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:56,930
has begun working harder to process

00:09:54,709 --> 00:09:59,930
local chapter applications more quickly

00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:02,029
than before the board is also inviting a

00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:04,149
local chapter each month to brief us at

00:10:02,029 --> 00:10:07,310
the end of each board meeting

00:10:04,149 --> 00:10:09,380
surprisingly a desire for vector tiles

00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:11,480
came up 12 times in conversations tying

00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:13,850
for second place with community outreach

00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:16,339
some respondents merely see in vector

00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:18,290
tiles assign the progress that OS M is

00:10:16,339 --> 00:10:20,240
keeping up with Google but others see in

00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:23,899
them a solution to desires such as

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:25,730
multilingual standard Maps while the

00:10:23,899 --> 00:10:27,380
tech wizards asserted that OS MF

00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:29,570
hardware is adequate to host vector

00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:31,790
tiles at least initially surprisingly

00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:33,709
not one respondent could quote a solid

00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:36,079
cost estimate for shifting from raster

00:10:33,709 --> 00:10:37,519
to vector tiles nor could any respondent

00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:40,070
describe in brief a course of action

00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,480
needed to carry out such a shift time

00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:44,360
estimates range from a couple of

00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:46,130
weekends to six to eight weeks one major

00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,600
issue appears to be who would control

00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:49,699
the style sheets that determine which

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,140
vector maps are displayed and some users

00:10:49,699 --> 00:10:53,959
in the commercial sphere expressed

00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:55,370
concerns that OS MF sponsored vector

00:10:53,959 --> 00:10:58,110
tiles would compete with their paid

00:10:55,370 --> 00:11:00,720
services in short though there is a

00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:03,450
strong indication that vector tiles are

00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,399
desirable there is a lack of consensus

00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:08,149
either as to how much would be too much

00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:10,500
and how much it would cause one

00:11:08,149 --> 00:11:13,050
respondent noted that there is nothing

00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:14,610
to stop local chapters or others from

00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:16,620
hosting vector tiles if they wanted to

00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:18,269
and suggested urging local communities

00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:20,790
and chapters to experiment with vector

00:11:18,269 --> 00:11:24,829
tiles before the OSM f decides on the

00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:24,829
solution should have decide to do so

00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:30,720
respondents widely view the board as

00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:33,810
having failed to take responsibility for

00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,820
issues that have arisen one respondent

00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:38,760
asserted the board has taken exactly one

00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:41,430
significant decision since 2010 the

00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:43,350
change of license to Odin VL one

00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:44,790
consequence of this is that third party

00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:46,950
is unaccountable to the community at

00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:48,450
large have filled some vacuums the

00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:50,310
board's conscious decision to take a

00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:52,529
hands-off approach to development of the

00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:53,820
ID editor in particular is a flashpoint

00:11:52,529 --> 00:11:55,980
in this regard

00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:58,140
while some welcomed development of a

00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:59,760
user-friendly intuitive editor even if

00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:02,279
by a third party not under community

00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,529
influenced IDs tagging precepts have

00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:06,360
ranged concerns about perceived lack of

00:12:04,529 --> 00:12:09,329
community input into development

00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:11,010
decisions as one respondent put it key

00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:14,190
technology should be OS em f's

00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:16,949
responsibility this is why the board has

00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:19,079
undertaken an effort to establish a

00:12:16,949 --> 00:12:20,579
software governance model for ID that

00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:23,370
will allow community input on

00:12:20,579 --> 00:12:25,079
controversial aspects of ID development

00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:27,269
the surface and to be taken into account

00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:29,310
without stifling the innovations that

00:12:27,269 --> 00:12:32,399
have made ID such a fantastic editor and

00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:35,720
yes I'm showing my bias here I use idea

00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:37,649
I use it a lot and I absolutely love it

00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:39,390
another respondent viewed this

00:12:37,649 --> 00:12:41,370
abdication of responsibility as a

00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:43,740
preload to long term death of the USM

00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:45,829
community as it pays the way for

00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:48,089
backdoor corporate takeover of osm

00:12:45,829 --> 00:12:49,740
another respondent said bluntly that

00:12:48,089 --> 00:12:51,899
board weakness creates a power dynamic

00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:54,570
with outsiders who can pay workers and

00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:56,040
then control it one respondent noted

00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:57,480
there is room for the board to be more

00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:59,339
assertive because of the threats out

00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:01,230
there the need to meet threats and

00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:03,779
challenges volunteers cannot do it

00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:05,339
themselves we're the board to begin

00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:07,079
making substitute decisions in the

00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:08,610
opinion of some respondents another

00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:10,890
weakness would quickly become apparent

00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:11,990
as one put it the board has no real

00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:13,970
ability to put con

00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:16,490
that's in place to implement decisions

00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:20,230
the board this person said must either

00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:22,580
build capacity or let Outsiders do it

00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:24,500
another issue is the board's failure to

00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:26,660
enforce its policies such as tile use

00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:28,850
policy which has led directly to a

00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:30,440
massive overload of OSM's tile servers

00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:32,390
which according to the operations

00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:36,070
working group that peak loads respond to

00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:38,030
nearly 400,000 tile calls per second

00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:39,680
respondents raised protection of the

00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:41,290
trademark a few times and thought that

00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,670
previous boards had neglected it

00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:46,460
additional issues include failure to

00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:48,200
pursue Community Development a bias in

00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:50,630
favor of European points at new and

00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:54,350
failure to demand attribution for use of

00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:56,390
osm data however two prominent computer

00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:59,950
community members asserted the board

00:13:56,390 --> 00:14:02,420
inaction is quote the OSM way unquote an

00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:04,970
indicator to desire to see the OS MF

00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:06,500
board as immigrant figurehead existing

00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:09,560
solely to fulfill requirements of the

00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:11,720
Companies Act 2006 and nothing more as

00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:13,640
one put it the board is to do the

00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:15,500
minimum necessary to keep OS em running

00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:17,720
another expressed fear that a future

00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:20,870
board could quote go in a bad direction

00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:23,080
unquote and thus the precedent of the

00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:25,340
board's making decisions could bode ill

00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:27,500
the community will need to reconcile

00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:29,020
this divergence and attitudes one way or

00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:31,090
the other

00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:33,320
shifting to the diversity question

00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:35,450
communities outside Western Europe

00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:37,190
generally welcomed the board's recent

00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:39,110
adoption of a diversity statement and

00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:41,930
formation of the diversity and inclusion

00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:43,880
special committee one community went so

00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:45,710
far as to say it was long overdue but

00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:47,780
still is not enough because local

00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:50,030
communities avoid speaking up out of

00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:51,770
fear of very vocal and hostile community

00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:54,590
members and other geographic areas

00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:56,150
shouting them down one respondent said

00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:58,310
bluntly with the diversity and inclusion

00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:59,990
special committee quote needs a space

00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:02,720
for discussions without being attacked

00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:04,340
unquote and cited a tendency to

00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,710
intimidate on the part of other

00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:08,600
community members in that regard

00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:10,730
multiple respondents called for a code

00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:13,190
of conduct of some sort to moderate

00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:17,390
dialogues and reduce the here fear of

00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:18,980
hostile responses respondents in Africa

00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:21,170
and Asia underscored the cost of

00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:23,030
volunteering noting that in lower-income

00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:25,580
countries the cost of Internet access

00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:27,830
and the need to work more than one job

00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:30,290
supporter family constrains time devoted

00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:33,440
to volunteer mapping this is an obstacle

00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:35,270
to geographic diversity respondent see

00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,700
the fee waiver program for foundation

00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:39,680
membership positively in theory but in

00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:41,990
many minds its impact remains to be seen

00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:44,180
data users were surprisingly supportive

00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:46,760
of diversity because they see it as a

00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:48,710
source of data quality as one respondent

00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:50,960
put it quote mapping as somewhat

00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:53,240
subjective unquote so diverse mappers

00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:55,820
generate more diverse that is more

00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:58,520
complete data than does a white male

00:15:55,820 --> 00:16:00,110
dominated mapping community many

00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:02,660
respondents complained of special

00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:03,980
interests steering or dominating issues

00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:07,490
to the detriment of the broader

00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:09,740
interests of the USM community as one of

00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:11,870
them put it if you let the loudmouths

00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:14,390
direct strategy nothing will happen

00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:16,190
another put it slightly differently use

00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:19,820
of the project is imperiled by a few

00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:21,380
loud voices on the other hand one

00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:23,330
respondent in Europe criticized the

00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:25,400
board for focusing on political

00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:29,440
correctness by publishing the diversity

00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:29,440
policy informing the special committee

00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:34,940
the sixth most raised issue revolved

00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:37,220
around artificial intelligence and

00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:39,020
machine learning with those in favor of

00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:41,870
incorporating them under human approval

00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:43,730
processes represented in Asia Africa and

00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:46,430
among the corporate members sponsoring

00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:47,900
those technologies opposition to

00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:49,700
artificial intelligence and machine

00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:51,830
learning seems to be concentrated in

00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:54,680
Western Europe where it is viewed as of

00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:56,420
little utility support is found in

00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,940
Geographic locales facing daunting

00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:00,530
obstacles high Internet costs low

00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:02,900
internet penetration and low

00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:05,510
volunteerism the latter too often rooted

00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:07,699
in economic circumstances as one

00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:09,230
respondent put it bluntly our country is

00:17:07,699 --> 00:17:11,240
vast and we don't have enough volunteers

00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:13,880
to map all the roads and waterways by

00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:15,949
hand mappers in such circumstances

00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:19,030
appear to welcome AI tools as a way of

00:17:15,949 --> 00:17:21,800
increasing craft map of productivity

00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:23,540
interestingly the corporate members

00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:25,820
underscored the critical importance of

00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:28,010
local knowledge whereas one put it a I

00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:31,310
can draw a road but only a local mapper

00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:33,130
can name it you and I might add certify

00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:35,840
that it's a road and not something else

00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:37,640
another non corporate respondent noted a

00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,290
growing proportion of data cannot be

00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:41,050
collected by armchair mapping

00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:43,250
we need on-the-ground knowledge

00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:44,810
corporate users who profess keen

00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:47,060
interest and improve data quality

00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:49,220
highlighted the role of AI and rapidly

00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:50,900
detecting vandalism so that the data

00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:53,720
working group and local mappers can

00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:55,790
react quickly while application of AI

00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:57,980
and machine learning is not a board

00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:59,570
issue strictly speaking but rather one

00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:01,400
squarely in the laps of the local

00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:03,080
communities each could be side within

00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:05,540
the framework of organized math and

00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:11,720
guidelines its importance to certain

00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:13,430
local communities with striking as I

00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,990
start to wrap up this presentation I

00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:16,370
want to share some quotes that seem to

00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:19,430
strike a middle ground between the two

00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:23,200
extremes I showed you earlier the last

00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:25,880
quote hit me right between the eyes in

00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,470
researching the work of past boards in

00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:29,270
the low level of decision-making for the

00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:30,830
past decade it became apparent than in

00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:32,810
many cases the board shied away from

00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:35,390
making decisions that were expected to

00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:37,130
attract vocal criticism even if the

00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:39,350
number of critical voices itself was

00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:41,720
small just like there's no healthy

00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:43,070
democracy without a free press critical

00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:45,620
voices had their place in a healthy

00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:47,690
community while some might suspect such

00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:49,430
voices to simply seek to impose their

00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:51,220
own views they can also have their

00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:53,930
fingers on the pulse of the community

00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:55,910
but the expectation of criticism even

00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:57,650
fierce criticism should not lead to a

00:18:55,910 --> 00:19:00,350
failure to make decisions on the part of

00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:01,790
the board as long as those decisions

00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:03,260
reflect the interests of the community

00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:05,270
as a whole and what's critically

00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:08,720
important of the OSM project more

00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:10,820
generally anarchy is not healthy for any

00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,830
organization and it is my firm opinion

00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:14,930
with the elected board of directors in

00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:16,940
the USM foundation must make decisions

00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:19,610
that will ensure the continued health

00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:21,740
and stability indeed the very future of

00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:24,080
the OSM movement all the while not

00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:26,380
telling anybody what to map or how to

00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,380
map

00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:32,090
these are the core values of OS m is

00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:34,940
posted on the OSM foundation's wiki I

00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:35,860
invite you to read them now and I have a

00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,820
request

00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:39,800
translate them into your native language

00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:42,590
if it isn't English I post them on the

00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:44,750
USM wiki if we bear them pearly firmly

00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:46,400
in mind we can more easily come to

00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:47,690
agreement on the decisions the community

00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,610
and the board are going to have to make

00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:52,280
over the next year the next two years

00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:54,980
the next decade we want to make the best

00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:56,690
map data set of the world we want the

00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:59,030
data to be available under a free and

00:19:56,690 --> 00:20:01,310
open license to everybody we want it to

00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:04,130
be powered by its community we want the

00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:06,800
data to be used as widely as possible we

00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:09,260
favor objective ground truth over all of

00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:11,060
the sources and we want for you to map

00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:12,710
the things that you care about and we

00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:20,330
want to be able to ensure that you have

00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:22,100
the freedom to do so based on the core

00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:23,930
values these are examples of the types

00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:26,480
of questions the board needs to ask the

00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:28,790
community in my opinion if we're going

00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:32,690
to live up to our core values board

00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:34,130
needs answers in most cases however the

00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:36,200
board will leave the answers to the

00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:38,660
local chapters and communities to the

00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:40,970
degree possible I agree that osm should

00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:42,320
govern itself and that local communities

00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:44,000
in the volunteer working groups should

00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:46,970
decide what works best for them and for

00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,920
the project but when it comes to

00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:51,710
existential issues such as maintenance

00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:54,020
of infrastructure such as expanding osm

00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:56,540
into spaces where it is not such as

00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:58,490
protecting our intellectual property the

00:20:56,540 --> 00:21:01,610
board must act if it is to live up to

00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:04,190
its responsibilities demand for osm data

00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:05,990
is growing 50 percent year-on-year we

00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:07,970
need more money to ensure stability of

00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:11,240
our platform where will the money come

00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:13,940
from what risks do we face and how to

00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:15,680
regard osm against them do we need to

00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:17,870
invest in a project to render vector

00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:19,880
tiles for example should we even do that

00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:22,550
or should we leave it to someone else to

00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:24,800
a local chapter to a third party if we

00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:25,970
should do that should we limit access so

00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:28,850
we don't compete the commercial

00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:30,440
providers in the ecosystem the community

00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:32,420
is divided on these questions so the

00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:34,310
duly elected board has to decide based

00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:37,280
on a combination of community input and

00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:40,430
the board's own assessment of what is in

00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:41,510
OSM's best interests not merely for

00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:43,130
survival

00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:49,300
in order to thrive into the next session

00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:52,490
I encourage you to make your voice heard

00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:56,120
join the OSM foundation you can do it

00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:57,740
online once a member then join the OSM

00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:59,510
talk mailing list and start sharing your

00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:01,090
expertise and ideas for making the

00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:05,350
ascent better and better for everyone

00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:05,350
thank you for your attention

00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:28,600
okay so that was the keynote from alum

00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:35,800
mustard and I see you've been doing

00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:38,400
stuff in the Q&A there so Alan as

00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:41,680
keynote isn't there isn't a Q&A session

00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:46,090
but he does have a self-organized

00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:48,670
session that's at 7:00 p.m. 1900 hours

00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:51,130
so you can go to the website look at the

00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:55,990
self-organized sessions there and join

00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:59,050
him he's doing a Q&A as chair of the

00:22:55,990 --> 00:23:02,620
board which that talk kind of pushed

00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:04,420
some big questions on there you get to

00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:05,050
see him face to face and that'll be

00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:08,890
alive

00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:11,800
kinda chat we'll make sure he can see

00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:13,780
those questions so that he can maybe

00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:18,190
answer some of them there but I think

00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:22,510
he's opening up any questions that you

00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:24,850
might have also on that talk you talked

00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:27,670
a lot about the history about

00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:31,180
OpenStreetMap and the project you might

00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:34,810
be interested that it's 5:15 this

00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:39,610
evening so 1715 Frederick Graham's

00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:42,670
talking about misunderstandings in the

00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:45,730
history of OSN that I think might bring

00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:47,680
some context to some of the things or I

00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:52,570
don't some of the things that Frederick

00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:56,010
talked about in that talk now this is

00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:58,960
track one of states of the map 2020

00:23:56,010 --> 00:24:00,820
track two is about to start I think

00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,820
they're just trying to work out some

00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:08,130
technical difficulties but there's about

00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:10,390
two minutes there until that starts and

00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:13,480
yep you've got your questions there so

00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:19,530
and as I said we're talking on social

00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:23,650
media there's twitter the hashtag Sutton

00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:24,960
2020 there's the telegram group we're

00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:29,020
using the old ones

00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:30,210
SOT em 2018 because lots of people are

00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:35,429
there

00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:39,570
and there's IRC as well so I think we

00:24:35,429 --> 00:24:42,860
are just about ready to start our next

00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:47,100
talk so there will be a Q&A after this

00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:50,730
but this is leap Lunas she's talking

00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:53,909
about what she's doing what she's been

00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:58,769
doing with drones the various uses of

00:24:53,909 --> 00:25:01,200
them and some disaster to do more so

00:24:58,769 --> 00:25:04,610
make sure you ask any questions in the

00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:09,110
session pad that you have for her and

00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:09,110
we'll stop that talk about now

00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:25,970
