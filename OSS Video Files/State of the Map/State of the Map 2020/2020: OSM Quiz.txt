okay so

00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,719
welcome back um and we're going closer

00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,599
to the end of the

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,080
program for state of the map 2020 but

00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,160
something

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,359
a little bit different this year and

00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,400
exciting

00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:23,680
is the open street map quiz so i'm going

00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:27,199
to hand over to

00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,199
india to explain that

00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,880
so hello uh hello everyone

00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,840
i'm elizabeth and this is like the last

00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:40,800
talk of the conference

00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:44,160
almost so oppositional quiz

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:47,840
uh we decided what to do

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:50,480
so you will have like several

00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,320
interesting trivia questions about stuff

00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:57,199
that you didn't know about openstreetmap

00:00:52,320 --> 00:01:01,440
or did know but not quite sure

00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:04,640
and the idea is that you try to answer

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:08,240
as many questions as possible

00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:11,520
so what do you do now right now

00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:16,880
you go to this website myquiz.com

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,880
let me show you it a bit closer

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:24,720
so you see it here

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,640
you go to myquiz.com right now on your

00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,920
phones on your web browser

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:34,159
on whatever and you enter

00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:37,680
these these six numbers in the

00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:43,040
quiz number field so do

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:46,640
do that like go to myquiz.org.org sorry

00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:49,840
it's myquiz.org

00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:52,399
and enter these numbers

00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,799
uh while you're doing that i will tell

00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:58,960
you what what will happen

00:01:54,799 --> 00:02:02,000
so there will be like 24 questions

00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,880
for each question you will have 50

00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,719
seconds

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:10,959
to answer i think that's plenty time

00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,959
i will read each question out loud

00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,599
when you answer a question you'll wait

00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,920
till

00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,040
everyone answers and then there will be

00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,879
20 seconds

00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:27,680
when i explain the correct answer

00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:27,680
so 50 seconds per question 20 per answer

00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:34,560
if you choose correctly you

00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,560
win some points

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:41,360
when uh

00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:45,440
when multiple people

00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:48,879
answer uh no let me let me start from

00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:51,680
from the end so when we get to the end

00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:53,360
of the quiz

00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,040
if there are multiple people with the

00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,159
same score

00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:03,280
whoever fastest wins

00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:06,640
so it benefits also to answer fast

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:10,239
uh one rule

00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:12,480
don't google like please

00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:15,040
like half of these questions can be

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:18,159
answered easily by googling

00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:20,400
but it's just not great please don't do

00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,400
that

00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:29,519
and yeah all you had have to do now

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:30,879

and we will start like in

00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,480
when we have at least 50 users i guess

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,840

00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:45,280
go on connect uh

but

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:05,120
in the process i will return to myself

00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:47,360
these questions

00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:51,280
so let's start the game you can still

00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:54,400
join i guess

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:57,759
but i'm not really sure so

00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:00,880
51 let's wait one minute more if you're

00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:04,639
thinking of joining or not joining just

00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:06,800
go to myquiz.org like right now

00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,919
and enter these six numbers because i'm

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,680
not sure you can

00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:16,000
join after that

00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,000
uh we got half a minute left

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,919
myquiz.org that's one thing you need to

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,080
remember

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:27,199
questions will be very hard like i spent

00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:31,280
all day coming up with them

00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,280
54 users that's really cool

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,600
do join right now

00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:44,720
and okay one more user

00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,720
and we're starting the game

00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,840
and come on come on

00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,639
okay i think everyone's here so let's

00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,720
start

00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,479
so which of these cities hosted an

00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,840
international

00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:21,840
state of the map conference carlsore

00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:21,840
denver london or toronto

00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:26,319
and that's obviously

00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:33,440
gender well for some reason

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:36,800
uh london is also counted as okay which

00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:39,840
is weird so carl

00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:43,759
uh denver hosted it in 2011

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:47,680
and everybody other cities didn't

00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:49,840
that's all you need to know so how many

00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,759
non-local state of the maps they have

00:06:49,840 --> 00:07:03,680
been in africa

00:06:51,759 --> 00:07:07,039
two three four or five

00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,840
and this is really weird but correct

00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:10,000
answer is

00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,919
three they had been stated in map africa

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,840
in 2015

00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:17,759
17 and 19. and there might have been

00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,880
an international conference in africa

00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,160
this year but

00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:24,479
as they have been years but if there was

00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:28,400
international conference

00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:32,160
what where would have it been

00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:34,880
what it would be the venue techno park

00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:37,360
river club university or breakwater

00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,360
campus

00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:45,840
and the correct answer is university of

00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,840
cape town

00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:53,840
well you should know if you read the bid

00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,639
and state of the maps are usually

00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:59,520
usually

00:07:54,639 --> 00:08:03,199
happen in universities

00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:05,759
so uh sponsors the only company to ever

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:09,120
sponsor state of the map conference and

00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:13,360
tungsten carbide level was

00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:16,319
mailbox cloudmate sr or mapquest

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,479
this is like the super level invention

00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:21,120
specifically for this company

00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:23,280
and some of you very few of you know

00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:27,759
that it was map quest and it was

00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:30,720
really long time ago in 2011 in denver

00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:33,120
they asked to make a special like level

00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,120
for them

00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:40,959
now we're switching to project history

00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:43,039
and the simple thing most of you know

00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:45,279
when is the official birthday of open

00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:47,839
statement

00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:48,959
it's in august everyone knows it but is

00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:55,839
it 5th

00:08:48,959 --> 00:09:00,160
9th 12th or 16th

00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:03,200
48 answers awesome yeah

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:06,160
most of you know it's 9th of august

00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,399
but it's almost always floating because

00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,600
of

00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,800
big days and each of these days means

00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,440
something like 12th

00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,279
is first commit to svn ninth is domain

00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:19,760
registration

00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:19,760
uh 16th is website

00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:26,080
so it's april 2009 you have been happily

00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,480
contributing to openstreetmap for years

00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,480
but suddenly the website won't let you

00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,920
upload edits anymore

00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,399
what do you need to do agree to license

00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,440
change

00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:39,519
disable an anonymous editing or become

00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,880
member of osmf

00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:46,480
okay it doesn't work

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:49,680
so you had to disable anonymous editing

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:52,640
because that would have changed in april

00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,640
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:01,440
the osm api we have currently version

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,480
0.6

00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:10,240
but what introduced version 0.5

00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:10,240
ways change sets segments or relations

00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,640
so it were relations and lot of you know

00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,640
that

00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,760
and waves have been introduced in point

00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,800
three

00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:27,680
and change that introducing 0.6

00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,000
and segments were well they were removed

00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:33,839
in

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,839
api 0.5

00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:42,720
so who did not write a book

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:46,160
on openstreetmap is it steve cost

00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:49,440
frederick ram michael maron or jonathan

00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:53,040
bennett there are actually three books

00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,040
on openstreetmap in total

00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,959
and most of you know that michael maron

00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:02,320
did not write a book

00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:05,120
what's interesting thing is that uh

00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,920
two books were written like more than 10

00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,160
years ago

00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:10,880
and one book is just interviews so there

00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:15,120
is no current book on open seat networks

00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:17,920
for technical people

00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:20,000
according to a recent publication by

00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,959
usaid consulting firm

00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,839
the total value of open state map is

00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,839
approximately

00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:34,800
350 million yes one half four or seven

00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,320
oh i see lots of you have read the

00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:42,560
article yes

00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:45,760
exactly it's 1.5 billion u.s dollars

00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:48,880
which we think is pretty low

00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,320
because some countries cannot be met

00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:53,760
with that money if you pay

00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:55,040
everyone for the job open statement

00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,839
board

00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,720
who of these women did serve on their

00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:02,079
7th birth

00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:04,720
first like who was the first of them

00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,279
kathleen danielson either lesson kate

00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:10,639
chapman

00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:13,680
or emily frey

00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,320
and actually it was emilia but it would

00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:18,959
have been

00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:22,560
kate chapman as well if she

00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:26,079
won the first election emily uh

00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:27,600
served in 2010 and kate also stood for

00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:33,839
election that year

00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:33,839
but become board member only in 2013.

00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:40,079
where is the first node currently it has

00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,880
been jumping a lot

00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:44,240
so is it a greenwich prime meridian or

00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:48,240
is it a tree

00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,240
or a radio tower or a restaurant

00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,959
and if you opened you would know that

00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,920
it's

00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:59,920
it's radio tower in central italy but

00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:02,480
recently it had been a memorial

00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,240
in greenwich prime meridian which is

00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,920
actually not there

00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,680
and for a long time it was a tree in

00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,880
peter's backyard so all these four

00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:12,320
options

00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,320
they were node number one

00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:17,120
which is the largest proper building in

00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,519
open street map

00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,440
is it ladder car factory in russia

00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:24,959
boeing everett factor in the us

00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:27,760
pictured general motors car factory

00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:30,480
or just a country border with a building

00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,240
equals yes

00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,519
and the biggest building is actually

00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,720
ladder car factory

00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:40,480
in the russia because it has size of

00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,480
almost one square kilometer

00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:45,120
general motors comes close second and

00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:48,079
every factory is

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:50,320
actually not the in largest buildings at

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,320
all

00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,079
which of these popular public transport

00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:57,199
values like

00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:58,639
tags public transport equals what are

00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:01,600
least used

00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,720
all these values are popular but we the

00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:07,360
least used

00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,360
stop area group station poll or stop

00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,839
and it is actually stop and it's

00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:15,120
i know that's not like hard to

00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:17,279
understand

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,760
there is no this tag actually in the

00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,760
schema

00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:27,360
so yeah most of you chose top area group

00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:31,680
it used quite a lot

00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:34,639
5 000 and so on

00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,600
what are these lines in atlantic ocean

00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:38,240
are they

00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,720
this is a picture from asm inspector uh

00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,600
other

00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,399
gps tracers from regatta or deepsea

00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,560
cables or

00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:46,560
fairy lines what what are they

00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:51,120
yeah most of you know it's really deep

00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:53,600
sea cables

00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,120
and congratulations to mckenna for being

00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,920
the first now

00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:00,240
and declare the loon second and daniel

00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,240
third

00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:08,000
yeah it's really great so yeah there's

00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:10,720
a lot going in the ocean

00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
in january this year an edit was

00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,120
reverted that has added

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,880
names over a thousand countries these

00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:22,160
names were in which language

00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:22,160
esperanto klingon emoji or his hedissimo

00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:30,800
this one was fun because it's emoji

00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,480
uh we have names in esperanto and they

00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,680
were not reverted that's a proper

00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,800
language

00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:39,519
and i'm not really sure about klingon

00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:43,199
there's a possibility it's also an open

00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:43,199
situp but emoji is not languish

00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:51,680
so our website how is called the code

00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,560
that runs it is it the whale the rail

00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:56,720
sport

00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,720
the spaghetti dish or the rubicon

00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:05,279
i guess most of you know this it's

00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:08,079
the railsport like two-thirds of you

00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:10,079
know what it is

00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:13,920
and i see the list of winners like

00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:13,920
shuffles itself quite a lot

00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:24,480
so the next in technology

00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:26,160
which of these editors were recently a

00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:29,199
vibrating micro grant

00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:31,399
for improvements is it potash 2 is it

00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:34,839
with pushy street complete or

00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:36,959
360 editor for editing the same using

00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:40,480
panoramas

00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:45,040
all four of them applied for microgreens

00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,040
and yeah street complete actually won it

00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:51,839
but obviously we would benefit from

00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,839
either of them

00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:57,279
because this year flash is

00:16:55,199 --> 00:17:00,880
plugins are going to be disabled and

00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,880
potlatch will cease to be

00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:07,439
which of these is not a renderer

00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:09,919
is the smarender mapnic maputnik or

00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:14,000
cosmos

00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:14,000
three of these are renderers and one

00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:22,160
isn't

00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:25,280
and a lot of you know it's maputnik

00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:28,480
it's a editor of map style but not

00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:32,000
renderer cosmos is what became of

00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:35,919
my periodic it's also surrender and

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,919
you know osmarinder and mapnik obviously

00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:44,000
and follow-up question about osmorander

00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:44,000
in which language osmorander was written

00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:51,120
so there are python ruby pearl

00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,120
or xml

00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,480
and this is really funny because it has

00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,000
been written

00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:05,440
in xml precisely in xslt

00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:08,480
basically is a rule that converts

00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:11,760
osm xml file into svg

00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,720
xml file it was very weird and i guess

00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:16,559
it won't

00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,559
work with current amount of data

00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:23,840
how precise open system map can be

00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,960
like how precise can you map things it's

00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:28,160
up to one millimeter

00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:30,799
one centimeter half a meter or two to

00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,799
five meters

00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,160
and yeah you should have chosen like the

00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:42,000
maximum precisions

00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:45,280
precision of one millimeter because uh

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:48,080
coordinates have uh seven decimal digits

00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:50,160
and that's one millimeter if it was six

00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:53,440
it will be centimeter

00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:56,559
and half a meter is usually a precision

00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:58,720
of imagery that you have

00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:00,880
under which license osm tiles are

00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:04,799
currently published

00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:10,400
is it cc by s820 cc by 40

00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:12,880
or dbl or there is no specific license

00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,919
there was a osm blog post recently about

00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,679
that

00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:18,480
and it told that from first of july

00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:22,000
there will

00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:24,000
be no specific license on the same tiles

00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,640
it's published under audible produce

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:30,240
work terms that are implied

00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:33,200
by the opposite map data used to do it

00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:35,760
but yeah there are no specific license

00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:38,240
portals

00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:40,160
numbers game what was the record for

00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:43,200
daily mappers recently

00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:46,320
again this was in the blog

00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:48,880
it was six thousand seven thousand or

00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,880
five thousand

00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,720
and yeah given this super street map you

00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,559
should have chosen like the biggest

00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:00,400
number there is

00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:03,440
it was 7 200.

00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:05,520
and pascal d

00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:08,000
nice did some research and found out

00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:10,000
that many people were mapping in peru in

00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:14,480
botswana in south africa

00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:16,880
so africa again for the win

00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,640
who invented craft mappers i got craft

00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:22,720
mapper t-shirts

00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:26,240
so i couldn't not ask was it frederick

00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,240
michael ben or rob

00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:32,840
and this term craftmappers come from

00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:36,159
article by michael mcgurskin

00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:38,880
2016 called

00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:40,880
open street map robots crisis and craft

00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:44,640
mappers

00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:49,840
when he told the basically craft mappers

00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:49,840
why opposite map is not progressing

00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,880
who published the article in how to sm

00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,080
block

00:20:54,880 --> 00:21:02,799
why woman and mapping matter

00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:02,799
is it nathalie hawa adrinani

00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:14,640
and it was true d she published this

00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:18,320
article like two years ago

00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:21,760
and it is pretty fun and

00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:23,039
by by now i believe everyone must know

00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,760
that

00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:27,440
representation on the map matters it's

00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:30,720
basically half of the token

00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:34,000
conference for about representation

00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:38,159
so the quiz is over and congratulations

00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:42,000
to nakaner for the first place and to

00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:45,360
michael for close second and to rory

00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,400
for the third well it's weird i think

00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:49,520
everyone

00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:51,120
is from eastern europe and there's sarah

00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:54,159
and exam

00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:57,679
so i hope this has been

00:21:54,159 --> 00:22:00,720
interesting uh

00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:04,480
and you have fun so thank you

00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:07,600
and are passing the road to gregory

00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:09,600
thank you alia that was fun i'm a bit

00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,640
worried about some of my answers i think

00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,840
the speed

00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:18,159
struggled and i was 16th

00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:21,280
place um so i think we're just gonna

00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:24,400
pause for a few seconds and then

00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:27,039
we'll um we'll be back with the

00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,919
closing session and a few exciting

00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:30,960
things
