We outline methods for a) extracting the geometry of street blocks in urban centres using
OSM and remote sensing data, b) generating approximate cadastral maps of a
block given contained building footprints, and c) quantifying residents’ ability to navigate within
blocks through topological analysis of cadastral maps. This topological metric, termed “spatial
accessibility” and denoted k = 1, 2, 3, ..., determines whether areas of a city are informal
settlements, as blocks where k &gt 2 contain cadastral parcels without direct access to formal road
networks.  We analysed 1 terabyte of OpenStreetMap data for 120 low and middle income (LMIC) countries.

Determinations of whether a neighbourhood is underserviced depends greatly on local concerns, however topological analysis of building footprints in relation streetlevel access offers a pathway to near-universal criteria for determining whether a neighbourhood is potentially a slum or urban informal settlement. With a topological approach, it is possible to determine the number of building parcels a streetblock inhabitant must cross to access a potential services bearing street, i.e. one that enables for example access to emergency services, sanitation and piped water.  Focusing on topological invariants allows us to analyse cities without respect to the specific morphology of their street network [1]. To create a global index of these under-serviced neighbourhoods, we extracted open-source data on building footprints and street networks and applied a topological analysis to each extracted street block to characterise the level of spatial accessibility. Using these techniques, we analysed 1 terabyte of OpenStreetMap (OSM) data to create an index of street block geometry, cadastral maps, and spatial accessibility calculations for 120 Low and Middle Income Countries (LIMCs) in the Global South. These results highlight the developing world’s most spatially inaccessible communities, enabling prioritisation of infrastructure investment and further study.
The primary data universe for our work involves three entities: 1) administrative boundary polygons, 2) building footprint polygons, and 3) street network line-string collections. The administrative data boundaries were sourced from the Database of Global Administrative Areas, while building footprints and street networks were sourced from OSM. Since OSM does not provide direct downloads, the data under consideration was obtained from a mirror of OSM hosted by GeoFabrik. This data reflects a snapshot of OSM as of July 2019.
Starting with the initial road network, the geometry of the street network can be extracted via the well-studied process of polygonization. In polygonization, the self-intersections of the street network are determined in order to define the block geometry. Most GIS software packages offer a polygonization feature (e.g. ST_MakePolygon from PostGIS). In implementation, however, we found a set-theoretic approach to be more stable and performant [2]. 
            By buffering the one-dimensional line-strings comprising the street network with a small buffer radius, we obtain two-dimensional polygons capturing the outline of the street network. We then find the set-theoretic difference between the administrative boundary polygons and the buffered road-network polygon; this renders the negative area between the road network geometry as a collection of polygons. These negative areas are precisely the street blocks we are trying to extract. 
            With each building’s access to the formal road network - or lack thereof -  analysed, we can also provide suggestions to the local community about ways to connect each building to the existing road network while respecting existing building footprints. This process, known as re-blocking, is in general, NP-hard. In contrast to previous algorithmic re-blocking efforts involving stochastic graph search [3], we approach the problem using Steiner tree approximations to the optimal road network. 
            To frame the universal access network as a Steiner tree problem, we segmented the building parcel boundaries to create “non-terminal” nodes at each segment boundary, and create a “terminal” node for each building parcel lacking direct street access by placing a node on the non-street parcel boundary closest to the building. We then construct a complete subgraph of all the terminal nodes, where the weight of each edge is the Euclidean distance between each pair of terminal nodes; each existing road segment has zero weight. Solving the minimum-spanning tree problem on this subgraph, and then recovering the original path segments, gives us the optimal new road network. 
In the short future, we hope to repeat our analysis on denser sources of data on footprints and street network data from other providers (such as private satellite imager

innovation at the university of chicago

00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:45,920
and his research interest lies at the

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:49,120
nexus of poverty

00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:51,360
place and politics and uh focuses on

00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,960

00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,120
especially the creation

00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,879
and the use of digital mapping tools

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,039
affect communities and populations

00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:03,039
living in marginalized neighborhoods

00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,799

a special thanks to the openstreetmap

00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,680
community and especially missing maps

00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,440
volunteers

00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,720
who have and continued to map and

00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,239
improve the data our project is built on

00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,840
we would also like to appreciate the

00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,560
communities and practitioners on the

00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,120
ground

00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,879
especially in venture and free time who

00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,879
indulges challenges

00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,720
hold us accountable and remind us that

00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,760
we need to do this work together because

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,280
knowledge production

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,440
is a collective and collaborative

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,519
endeavor and that our work must be

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,280
usable for them to drive impact

00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,920
transformation and action in their

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,920
communities

00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,840
i will kick off our talk today with a

00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,760
brief video to introduce our institute

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,480
in the million neighborhoods now

00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,640
i will then move on to contextualize our

00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,519
work within urbanization in sub-saharan

00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,280
africa

00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,760
and then the contribution of our work in

00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,440
terms of methods and application

00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,200
the inspiration of this work comes from

00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,440
our previous engagements and experiences

00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,920
with communities in sub-saharan africa

00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,280
and india many islam and informal

00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,560
settlements communities

00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,560
including those affiliated to

00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,319
slumbrillas international have been

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,040
developing and refining

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:30,720
processes of labor reorganization called

00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,200
blocking out or re-blocking

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,920
to improve accesses create public open

00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,360
space

00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,840
and improve security in their

00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:41,840
settlements

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:44,480
we found existing models and processes

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,720
of re-blocking often time consuming

00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,400
approached in piecemeal costly

00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:52,400
and even disruptive socially to the

00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:54,640
community we wanted to develop a general

00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,920
i beg your pardon we wanted to develop a

00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,920
generalizable

00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,040
and systematic method that could help

00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,360
identify

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,159
at scale at the block level in cities

00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,080
where the most

00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,159
underserviced neighborhoods are and

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,000
develop tools and methods for analysis

00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,599
to support local communities

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,120
and their governments to improve and

00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,319
transform conditions in poor

00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,080
neighborhoods

00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,840
the foundational scientific research

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,840
using topological analysis

00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,040
was done by christa brownsford taylor

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,040
martin johan

00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,199
and louis bettencourt at the santa fe

00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,600
institute i will include links to these

00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,520
papers at the end of this presentation

00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,000
the expansion and real world application

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,320
of this work has since september 2018

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,960
been led by the wish breton court and me

00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,880
here at the menswear institute the

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,040
research and computation

00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,800
and therefore full credit to enable a

00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,479
more universal application

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,639
with the minimum data model that is

00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:47,040
openly available

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,840
was developed and implemented by satesh

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,080
soman

00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,720
cooper neighborhood nico marchio and

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,720
annie yang

00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,160
the menswear institute for urban

00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,600
innovation is a new institute at the

00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,240
university of chicago

00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,639
it's dedicated to studying the processes

00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,000
that create and sustain cities

00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,600
when you go to developing cities the

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,120
city is still farming and you'll find

00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,199
many places where people have settled

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,720
and don't have streets coming in to

00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,120
deliver electricity

00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,639
or sanitation and it's critical to

00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,520
create all these services that allow

00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,080
people to make

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,320
good lives the million neighborhoods map

00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,000
uses this premise of connectivity and

00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,600
seeing how well connected

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,120
are different neighborhoods across the

00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,560
city

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,160
say for example i'm the mayor of

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,600
monrovia and

00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,759
we look at this map together with our

00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,160
communities and what we will see on this

00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,720
map

00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,759
is two places that light up bright red

00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,000
are west point

00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,280
and escada and so already there we know

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,560
that these are neighborhoods that are

00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,039
under service and

00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,360
in need of infrastructure access and

00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,320
then this can help elicit a dialogue

00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,639
between the city

00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,080
and the communities being able to

00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,560
collectively engage

00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,680
around what this evidence means and how

00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,800
we could move into actionable

00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,120
intelligence within

00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,319
within our city researchers at the

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,880
university of chicago have

00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,680
one of the longest traditions of looking

00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,080
at cities

00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,039
in terms of neighborhoods when you look

00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,600
at any city

00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:10,720
you will find that it often to work at a

00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,120
larger scale

00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,000
and this is sort of the human touch the

00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,560
human need

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,319
and the idea of the millionaire map is

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,199
to stop mapping cities in this way

00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:23,039
to have a whole vision of the world so

00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,360
in putting it all together we can

00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,720
see change and learn from examples of

00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,240
success in places

00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,240
and at the same time adapt those

00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,080
solutions to new contexts

00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,000
like eliminating extreme poverty

00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,479
creating good urban services

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,890
everywhere improving people's health

00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:41,970
everywhere on earth for everyone

00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:41,970
[Music]

00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,160
it is expected that by 2030

00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:49,840
approximately two out of eight people

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,800
will live in urban slums and urban and

00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:56,080
formal settlements across the world

00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,440
in 2010 294 million people lived in

00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,000
sub-saharan

00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,240
african cities and towns in the next

00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,680
decade the sub-region's urban population

00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,599
will grow to a projected 621 million

00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,000
according to u.n data

00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:12,080
while mega city lagos and the other big

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,599
two kinshasa and greater johannesburg

00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,120
will continue to grow

00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,120
according to analysis by david

00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,880
satterweight in 2017

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,520
the most substantial proportion of the

00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:24,080
urban population in sub-saharan africa

00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,120
do and will live in small and

00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,199
intermediate

00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,199
size urban centres where local

00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:31,199
governments lack

00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,039
responsive urban governance structures

00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,000
suffering adequacies in the provision of

00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:36,160
basic services

00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,400
and have very little capacity or funding

00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,160
to fulfill the responsibility

00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,240
for providing good liberal conditions

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,080
and good health for their residents

00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,560
human development in terms of life

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:49,039
expectancy education and income

00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,599
in sub-saharan africa remains at the low

00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,960
end

00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:54,800
below 0.550 out of 1.4

00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,039
and it is going to require massive

00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,599
collective and coordinated action

00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:01,280
and as we dare to advocate recognizing

00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:03,120
and seizing the opportunities these

00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,560
cities and their neighborhoods present

00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:08,720
for sustainable and equitable

00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,720
development over the next 10 years

00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,800
there has been an unprecedented effort

00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:15,039
to exploit remote sense data

00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,120
street view images machine learning

00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,840
advances in field work and scientific

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,840
methods

00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,840
and special data technologies to detect

00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,680
and understand house lisa growing

00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,240
and where slums and informal settlements

00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,879
or infrastructure deficits are

00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,240
among these are the work of kits and all

00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,399
kohli and all

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,680
women talbon book and the seto lab at

00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,080
yale

00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:38,240
our contribution uses vector data the

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,320
topological analysis of folding

00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,440
footprints in relation to the existing

00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,519
street networks

00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,480
as a pathway towards near universal

00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,080
criteria

00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,240
for determining whether a neighborhood

00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,920
could be an informal settlement

00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,360
with a topological approach it is

00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,480
possible to determine the number of

00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,279
building parcels

00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,480
a street inhabitant must cross to access

00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:58,240
the street network

00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,320
and therefore access for emergency

00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,000
services or connection to sanitation and

00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,480
water

00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,600
to measure street access a k index or

00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,000
block complexity

00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,360
which falls on a non-zero positive in

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,480
the integer scale

00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,320
has been defined when the k index is

00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,080
equal or smaller than two

00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,519
it means all buildings in the block have

00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,560
direct access

00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:22,399
to the streets values greater than two

00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,480
reflect blocks that are incrementally

00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,480
less accessible

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,160
the k index may be interpreted as the

00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,200
number of buildings a person would have

00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,519
to pass

00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,480
as they move from the least accessible

00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,120
building in a block

00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:37,040
to the nearest external street axis

00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,120
computationally the k index is the

00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,959
number of weak deal graph interactions

00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,200
required to cover all buildings in a

00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,080
street block moving from buildings along

00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,200
the street edge

00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:49,200
to the innermost building focusing on

00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,040
topological invariants allows us to

00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:54,080
analyze cities without respect to the

00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:56,480
specific morphology of this treatment

00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,680
to create a global index of under

00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,440
service city blocks

00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,959
we extracted open data on building

00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,880
footprints and street networks from

00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,959
openstreetmap

00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,560
and apply the topological analysis to

00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:08,560
each extracted street block

00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,839
to characterize the level of spatial

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,959
accessibility

00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,160
in addition we use administrative

00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,519
boundary polygons

00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:19,680
from the database of global

00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:21,519
administrative areas

00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,360
starting with the initial street network

00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,360
the geometry of the street network can

00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,279
be extracted via the well-studied method

00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,440
of polygonization

00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:31,360
in polygonization the self-intersections

00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:34,240
of the street network are determined

00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:36,959
in order to define the block geometry

00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,760
most gis packages offer a polygonization

00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,880
feature

00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:42,640
for example sd por estimate polygon from

00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,480
postgis

00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,399
in implementation though we found a

00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,760
theoretic approach to be more stable and

00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,680
performant

00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,440
by buffering the one-dimensional line

00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,120
strings comprising the street network

00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,120
with a small buffer radius

00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,480
we obtained two-dimensional polygons

00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,519
capturing the outline of the street

00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,040
network

00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,200
we then find the say theoretic

00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,399
difference between the administrative

00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,640
boundary polygons

00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,920
and the buffered street network polygon

00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,399
this renders the negative

00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:10,399
area between the street network geometry

00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,399
as a collection of polygons

00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,000
these negative areas are precisely the

00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,480
street blocks we are trying to

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,480
extract

00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,040
in browser and all's initial attempts to

00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,240
apply clay index calculations to

00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,560
neighborhood analysis

00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,240
cadastral maps were readily available

00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,440
but this is not the case for everywhere

00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,279
in the world

00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,279
to scale the analysis a method for

00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:32,880
approximating cadastral or parcel maps

00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:34,880
was needed

00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,640
we use the voronoi decomposition of the

00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,480
street block geometry with features of

00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,720
the building footprints as inputs

00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,720
to the voronoi algorithm to approximate

00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,959
building plaster boundaries

00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,440
in a classical decomposition of street

00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:50,079
block polygons with folding footprint

00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,800
footprint centroids often results in

00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,800
cadastral

00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,240
boundaries that intersect the building

00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,519
footprint polygons

00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:59,440
ca this is of course not an accurate

00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,240
reflection and finding optimal routes to

00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,839
each building

00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,680
that can access requires faster

00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,120
boundaries that do not intersect

00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,200
building footprints

00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,440
to guard against these intersections we

00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,320
instead generate a voronoi decomposition

00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,399
of the street block

00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,360
polygon using the building footprint

00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,959
vertices

00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,440
and regularly spaced samples of

00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:19,360
footprint boundaries as input points

00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,279
each resulting voronoi cell whose

00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,000
centroids are vertices of the same

00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,760
building

00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,200
are they in union together to provide a

00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:28,000
cadastral approximation

00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:31,839
that does not intersect the building

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,839
footprints as demonstrated in b

00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,120
with either exact or approximate

00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,800
catastrophic delineations

00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,320
the topographical approach to under

00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,000
service neighborhood or informal

00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,320
settlement identification

00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,440
can be applied to every extracted street

00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,680
block in the city

00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,519
as shown here for free time the

00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,760
cadastral parcels are taken as the

00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,839
initial phases of the clanograph

00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:56,160
this planar graph structure has a weak

00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,839
deal a corresponding graph formed from

00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,160
connecting the centroids of each

00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,480
adjoining parcel centroid

00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,560
we turn the structure a weak dual since

00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,639
incomplete phases are discarded

00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,760
and so taking the weak deal of the weak

00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:11,040
dual does not

00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:13,279
restore the original graph instead

00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,160
successively taking the weak duel of the

00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:17,680
weak deal

00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:19,600
forms a sequence of planar graphs

00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,680
every sequence of planar graph weak

00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,519
deals will converge to a trivial graph

00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,200
in the form of a tree

00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,959
the number of weak yield operations

00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,360
required to achieve a trivial graph

00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:31,360
or the length of the weak till sequence

00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,040
forms the k index measuring spatial

00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:36,639
accessibility

00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:38,399
this approach has two advantages

00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,160
it reduces the problem of dealing with

00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,120
varied morphologies and building block

00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,240
densities

00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:46,480
across cities street blocks to simpler

00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,560
comparisons of scalars

00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,680
this approach locates precisely what a

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,000
street block

00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,680
where the least accessible areas are by

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,240
examining the parcels nearest to the

00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,839
final trivial crops

00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,600
the graph above shows the summary

00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,519
distribution of block complexities in

00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,199
freetown sierra leone

00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:06,000
we can see that the largest number of

00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:09,040
blocks do not fall within the higher

00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
k index ranges i.e many of the blocks in

00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:14,720
the city

00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,720
are more or less accessible at low k

00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:19,680
complexity with targeted investment and

00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,440
community participation

00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,959
the city could probably move a large

00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,240
number of residents towards more

00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:26,399
equitable access

00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,760
to services provision making gains while

00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,320
developing pathways

00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:32,160
for the more complex city blocks what

00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,279
may appear like an insurmountable

00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,199
problem before

00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:37,760
now shows up as probably quite

00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,760
manageable

00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,480
more on methods to convert the cadastral

00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,399
maps to a planar graph

00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,320
each cadastral parcel's boundary is

00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,320
decomposed into finite segments and

00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,839
aggregated into a collection

00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,320
while keeping track of the original

00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,680
parcel to which each boundary component

00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,279
belongs

00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,120
the elements of this collection are

00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,240
compared pairwise where adjacency is

00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,160
established between

00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,920
two parcels if any of their boundary

00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,760
components overlap

00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,600
for small street blocks this is not a

00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,199
severe computational bottleneck

00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,440
but it becomes intractable for the

00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:13,279
larger street blocks in our dataset

00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,199
to get around this we build the spatial

00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,560
index of edge components and compare

00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:19,360
each boundary component

00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:21,199
to the end closest components that do

00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,279
not belong to the same parcel

00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,959
rather than comparing each component to

00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,959
every other component

00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:28,800
we find that n100 is more than

00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,720
sufficient to accurately

00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:34,880
represent the adjacency and

00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,880
connectedness of observed planar graphs

00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,120
the spatial index implementation we

00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,800
choose is an artery

00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,480
which is a variant of a b tree whose

00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,880
nodes have a fixed number

00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,959
of m objects and contain information

00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,320
about the bounding box of each node's

00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:51,440
objects

00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,240
an archery of node capacity m has insert

00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,480
complexity

00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,560
proportional to e so building the

00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,000
archery for c boundary components has

00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,639
overall complexity

00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,639
o and c

00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,560
with the arche both the planar graph

00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,320
construction requires a constant number

00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:09,440
of comparisons per

00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:11,440
component in c so the index construction

00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,480
implementation is linear in the total

00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,360
number of boundary

00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,399
components of the street blocks process

00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,079
the trader for this

00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:20,399
improved performance is the increased

00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:23,040
memory requirements of maintaining

00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,480
the spatial index i.e computational

00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,240
power

00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,519
with the adjacency structure of each

00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,040
panel determined

00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:31,360
the construction of the weak jewel is

00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,240
straightforward for each parcel we

00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,720
construct

00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,000
an edge from that parcel centroid to the

00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,120
centroid of each adjacent

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,800
parcel then the collection of edges is

00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,160
traced to determine the polygons that

00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:46,000
will become the faces

00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:46,000
of the current graphs weak dual

00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:50,959
now on to application and to bring us

00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,959
full circle back to

00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:55,199
what we discussed right in the beginning

00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:56,959
around re-blocking and how we are hoping

00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:59,519
that this work can help support

00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:01,120
communities and local governments

00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,959
with each building's access to the

00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,039
formal street network or lack thereof

00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:06,480
analyzed we can now provide suggestions

00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:08,079
to the local community

00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,600
about how to connect each building to

00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:11,360
the existing street network

00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:13,600
while respecting the existing building

00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,959
footprints with potentially minimal cost

00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,919
and disruption

00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:19,439
the green lines represent a re-blocking

00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:22,880
proposal for kibera

00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:24,880
inaugurally in this iteration of the

00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,720
re-blocking algorithm we abandoned the

00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,600
efforts involving stochastic graph

00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,679
searches

00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,120
and approach the problem using synergy

00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:33,919
approximations to gen

00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:35,120
generate the optimal street network to

00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,360
frame the universal

00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,039
access network as a steiner tree problem

00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,080
we segmentize the building parcel

00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,919
boundaries to

00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,160
create non-terminal nodes at each

00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:46,160
segment boundary and create a terminal

00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,600
node for each building person lacking

00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,840
direct street access

00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:52,720
by placing a node on the non-street

00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:54,960
parcel boundary closest to that building

00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,160
we then construct a complete subgraph of

00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,919
all terminal nodes

00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,600
where the weight of each edge is the

00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,799
euclidean distance between a pair of

00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,880
terminal nodes

00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:04,480
each existing tree segment has a zero

00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,840
wave

00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,760
solving the minimum spanning tree

00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:10,000
problem on this subgraph and then

00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:12,840
recovering the original path segment

00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,280
gives us the optimal new strength

00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:17,600
network

00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,520
our approach of course has limitations

00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,600
one already mentioned

00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,120
is that we do require exceptional

00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:26,320
computational power

00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:29,679
to do the back end work however

00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:32,799
the map is fully available online and

00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:34,400
even on your mobile device

00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,160
other limitations include false

00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,080
positives for example

00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,840
street blocks where lack of public

00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,520
access is intentional for example

00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:45,200
embassies or universities

00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:48,000
military bases or enclaves may show up

00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:50,320
as informal settlements

00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,039
as it does here with the u.s embassy in

00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,039
monrovia

00:18:54,320 --> 00:19:01,760
it is also possible for a well-known

00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:05,520
um slum like nasa in mexico city

00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:07,440
um to show up as a well-connected

00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:10,080
neighborhood because it has relatively

00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:12,320
like high levels of street access

00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,919
therefore street level access alone is

00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,000
not a complete determinant of

00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,039
informality or slumness in within the

00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,760
urban fabric

00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:22,240
and other core services may also be

00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,240
lacking

00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,600
all results of our project are available

00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,080
on our meridian neighborhoods

00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,480
website and we invite you to visit us we

00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:35,600
invite you also to contact us

00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:38,240

researchers and our code is available on

00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,880
github

00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,480
as promised the original scientific work

00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,160
that was first developed by browsefit

00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,400
and all

00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,760
are available at these links and we look

00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:53,440
forward to engaging

00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:56,640
with you on our data and also to build

00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,640
this map further

00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:00,480
all computation was performed on the

00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,440
university supercomputer known as the

00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,280
midway

00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,280
with technical support from the research

00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:08,000
computing center

00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:09,039
we have a suggested data citation and we

00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,960
also ask that you

00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:12,480
please credit the openstreetmap

00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,440
contributors and the university of

00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,120
chicago

00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:18,720
when using and distributing our work

00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,720
thank you very much for your attention

00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,960
and we look forward to engaging with you

00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,840
in the questions and answer section and

00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,440
beyond

00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:35,840
please follow us at mi urban chicago

00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:35,840
thank you very much

00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:10,559
for uh this interesting uh talk um

00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,720
and thanks of course to all your

00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:15,840
co-authors i think it was a quite

00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:17,919
uh technical talk for sure

00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,120
that's why it's in the academic track i

00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:22,159
think

00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:24,400
but i think uh that we all agree that

00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:25,919
uh what we are speaking about is

00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,440
actually possible because we are

00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:29,200
speaking about a data set that is of

00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:33,679
course openstreetmap that

00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:36,240
is so um high scale and so

00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:37,440
detail that actually allows this kind of

00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,440
analysis so makes

00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:42,080
really those analysis possible and

00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:44,000
that's really uh of course it's it's uh

00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,520
let's say granted for all of us because

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,640
we are the osm community but it's

00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:49,919
something that we should

00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:53,280
always uh remember to acknowledge um

00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:54,000
having said so um there was a lot of

00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,400
activity

00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,039
in the in the pad uh there are comments

00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,360
more than

00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,720
uh questions but i'm happy to go through

00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,960
the comments because i

00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,400
and i would ask annie to clearly reply

00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,600
and provide your feedback to the

00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,240
to the comments um as well so the first

00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,520
one

00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,400
uh is these um if those cadastral maps

00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,039
that you mentioned

00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,840
ever leaked to the community they would

00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:17,360
go nuts

00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,919
hey that's my land you gave it to

00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:22,559
neighbor c etc

00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:23,520
um do you have any comment here any on

00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:25,600
the use of

00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:41,760
cadastral maps that you mentioned in the

00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:45,039
in the talk

00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,039
andy i think you are muted

00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:50,240
okay please

00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:53,280
[Laughter]

00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,000
okay i'm sorry about that um is that the

00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,480
zoom disease

00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,919
right to be muted while you talk um i

00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,760
just wanted to say thank you to everyone

00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:00,240
who took the time to join our talk and

00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,159
to

00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,080
who stayed until sort of like right to

00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,960
the end of this of the conference to

00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,400
hear us and

00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,080
and uh thanks for all the comments

00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,559
already i'm i'm excited

00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:12,320
for this discussion yeah i think that

00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:14,960
the um the cadastral map

00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,440
um for us like sort of it's sort of a

00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,440
back

00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,720
back end application at the moment

00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,720
because it is really

00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,080
more of a heuristic or it is a way that

00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:25,280
we need to

00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:27,520
um to get to um uh

00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:29,520
doing the rest of of of the work which

00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:32,400
is to try and find this optimal

00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,600
optimal path so um the cadastr i think

00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,640
that that is something that

00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:38,000
of course you know if the um there might

00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,000
be of course uh

00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
um in the future there might be interest

00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,440
from communities or cities to sort of

00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,039
have a look at this to see if there's a

00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,840
possibility to equally

00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:48,080
you know equitably distribute land um uh

00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,600
in

00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,919
formal settlements but this is not our

00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,240
goal to sort of it is more sort of for

00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,960
us

00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,559
um the generation of this cadastre um is

00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,440
really to understand

00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:00,000
how um how the land is is allocated

00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,279
around

00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:06,159
around um around the building footprints

00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:07,760
and of course this is not uh this is

00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:08,960
really sort of uh like you mentioned

00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,159
before it's a highly technical

00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,720
application and

00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:13,919
um we are aware of the of the of the

00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,559
social implications

00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:18,080
i.e and the social anthropologists on on

00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:20,640
the team so um

00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:22,480
yeah it's it's more of a part of the

00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:26,159
method to sort of determine

00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:28,720
um where the the how how dense blocks

00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:29,600
are and accessible they are and also

00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:33,840
then in the future

00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,840
how we can propose

00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:37,919
ways to expand the street network so

00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:42,000
that all the buildings in a particular

00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:42,000
block are connected as best as possible

00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,760
thanks a lot annie for the for the um

00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:51,279
detailed answer

00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:54,320
we have another question from serena

00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:58,240
that asks if you can comment on informal

00:24:54,320 --> 00:25:01,679
settlements detected in south africa

00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:05,600
ah yeah so um our map

00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:09,440
absolutely depends on um on uh

00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,840
um uh data available in in openstreetmap

00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,200
and

00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,039
this particular data set that is

00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:16,400
available now on on

00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:19,200
on on the map um on our site um is from

00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,960
july 2019 so there's also a bit of a lag

00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,720
um in terms of what is available but

00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,039
because the data especially

00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:27,440
it depends on building footprint data

00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:29,600
and the street network how well that is

00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:33,120
that is mapped and documented

00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:35,200
and um we have seen in places where um

00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,159
for example if the data doesn't exist we

00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,799
probably can't

00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:40,240
you know we can't detect we can't detect

00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:42,240
the informal settlements and this is

00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:45,039
also why we're sort of really

00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,960
encouraging um the community and and our

00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:50,080
partners that we work on the ground with

00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:53,120
to sort of really get into mapping

00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,720
um their their their their regions on

00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,000
openstreetmap because the only way we

00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,320
can improve the map

00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,440
and show sort of a better picture of the

00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,760
reality on the ground

00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:03,440
is um if we have the data which is

00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,400
coming from openstreetmap so if there

00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,400
are

00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,600
places missing that you know there are

00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,720
informal settlements

00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:12,400
then please we encourage you to to set

00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:15,360
up a missing maps

00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,480
mapathon and map away and organize your

00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,279
community around getting those

00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,480
structures

00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:20,480
um into open street map

00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,400
thanks a lot annie for the for the

00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:28,400
answer um

00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,840
there's another question uh which is a

00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,799
bit long i'll try to

00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:34,400
uh i'll try to read it uh very carefully

00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:35,600
for all the audience so you discussed

00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,000
re-blocking

00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:40,320
and in your paper you show how we

00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,039
observe that new infrastructure segments

00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:45,440
typically appear as a dead end street

00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:47,200
as the minimal edge set needed to

00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,480
connect a collection of nodes will

00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,440
always yield

00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:54,080
a tree graph but a street network of

00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,679
dead end streets is notoriously harmful

00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,559
to walkability

00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:59,600
as in usa suburbs and will result in

00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:01,600
residents

00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:03,760
having to take long network distance

00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:05,360
walks when the absolute distance of

00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:08,880
their trip is short

00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:11,279
how can help ensure these will not

00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,960
be used to design neighborhoods that are

00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:14,960
difficult to walk in

00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,799
thanks for your fascinating talk and

00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:20,399
this is from taylor and thank you

00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:23,440
for the detail but i think clear

00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:24,880
question and comment yeah thank you very

00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,279
much taylor for your question

00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:29,679
um of course the we we are fully aware

00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:32,159
of the of the cul-de-sac problem and

00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:32,960
um uh both cooper and satish i know they

00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:35,440
are working

00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,240
um continuously to try and figure this

00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:39,840
out

00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,840
what the open reblog um

00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,559
it's merely a proposal so this is not

00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:47,200
what we're trying to say this is how

00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:48,080
um how the community should organize

00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,960
what we really

00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:52,960
what we really want is for communities

00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,760
and the city governments and anyone who

00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,240
has a stake

00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:58,480
in in the neighborhood to be able to use

00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:00,640
this map just as a starting point as a

00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,520
as a as as the beginning of of their

00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,360
discussion

00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:05,039
so our primary goal was first of all we

00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,000
wanted to be able to get everyone on the

00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:08,399
same map

00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,720
and then these maps should be iterated

00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:13,520
with the community so really um

00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:15,279
uh cooper is in the process of of

00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:18,640
developing a

00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:19,120
a um a plug-in for for qgis which we

00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,440
started

00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,240
uh working on when we were namibia

00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,080
recently and

00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,480
before cover started which would

00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:29,600
actually allow people to

00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,000
um to manipulate the map themselves so

00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,720
that they

00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,559
can move so that we can do it uh avoid

00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,480
exactly these kinds of issues

00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:37,760
um that you mentioned is that we are not

00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:41,279
saying that this

00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,919
is the um this is the the map that you

00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,520
should use

00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:45,200
to to organize your neighborhood saying

00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,600
this is a proposal of how you could do

00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,360
it

00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:49,520
and we really want people to interact

00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,799
with it and and the great thing i think

00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:53,520
about it is that if you have

00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:54,559
different different um segments of the

00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,240
community

00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:57,919
working on the same map and coming up

00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,679
with different ways of how they want to

00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:01,440
organize the streets and the roads and

00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:03,600
and accessibility

00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,919
then um i think it opens up the space

00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:08,080
for more voices to be included and so

00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:10,000
it is not to say this is the way it's to

00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,799
say this is a proposal how do we come

00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,720
together

00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:14,799
and make it the best for our community

00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,559
and so we have a very strong

00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:18,000
engagement with with our community

00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:19,600
partners on the ground as we're building

00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,180
it so that we're not giving them the

00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:24,269
answer

00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:24,269
[Music]

00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:29,679
thanks a lot annie uh we have another

00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:32,159
question um

00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:32,880
uh i i i just read it so maybe this is

00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:35,600
off topic

00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,480
regarding the above example in one month

00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:39,120
busy park

00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,720
uh city planning wise how would their

00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:43,840
situation be improved

00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:47,039
for example in regard to accessibility

00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:49,600
um oh thank you very much um i'm not

00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:50,399
i'm not familiar with uh monroe busy

00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:53,840
park um

00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:57,120
exactly um but i think that um

00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:59,679
as i was saying um earlier is that the

00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:01,279
the the millionaire neighborhoods map

00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:02,159
and and the open reblog algorithm is

00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:04,480
really sort of

00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:06,080
um the first steps and initiating steps

00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,760
in getting a discussion going with the

00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,000
community and local government and i

00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,480
think

00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,320
that the complexity of upgrading the

00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:15,200
complexity of life

00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,520
um in the city i think is something that

00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,000
we

00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:19,600
we have we have a lot of respect for and

00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,760
this is why we

00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,799
we are not we are not trying to present

00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:25,440
a solution

00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:26,799
we are trying to present um the

00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,679
beginning of a discussion

00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:31,679
around solutions and not just one

00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:33,919
solution so i think this is sort of

00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:36,000
um where we really try to ground our

00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:38,720
work is that although it is sort of

00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,520
um highly technical in the sense as i

00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,320
said earlier

00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:43,679
the connection for us that it is

00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:45,360
actually cities and

00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:47,520
their communities who should be using

00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:49,279
these maps um for their own local

00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:51,039
development that is the key that we want

00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:54,480
we don't want to elicit the dialogue

00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:54,480
with with the work that we're doing

00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,960
thanks a lot danny for this uh uh answer

00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,720
we have another question that i it's a

00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,399
kind of a follow-up of something that

00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:05,120
you have previously said

00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:06,880
that the model actually depends on the

00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:09,279
availability and the completeness of the

00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,960
of the data of course um the question is

00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:12,640
is it possible to assess

00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:16,559
or compare the quality of the

00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,559
settlements with the osm boundaries

00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:23,760
oh okay um

00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:25,279
let me just um it's um thank you very

00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:27,120
much sorry i just want to make sure that

00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:30,640
i i have the question correctly

00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:32,480
is this um boundaries that is um within

00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:35,120
within openstreetmap

00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:37,200
um what we have what we have been doing

00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:39,919
is we have been looking at

00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,640
uh we were very lucky to have um digital

00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:43,440
global

00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:44,320
maxar as they're known now um who have

00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,600
um

00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:50,559
given us access to to a couple of of

00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:52,159
of of cities where they have um um

00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:53,279
building footprints generated from high

00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:54,880
resolution data

00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:56,799
so what we've been able to do is to

00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:00,000
compare for example

00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:03,200
the um to run the to compare the the

00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:06,480
coverage um of of of footprints

00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:07,120
um and then also to um how should i put

00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,039
it to see

00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,880
how you know based to compare the two

00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:13,120
datasets but also to see how

00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,799
where the gaps are um in in the

00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,679
openstreetmap data or in the in the

00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:19,840
other data

00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:22,399
but for us really the goal is to to

00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:24,080
to use right now just the building

00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:27,360
footprints and the street

00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:29,519
um street bound street um networks

00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:31,600
and then the boundaries for the for the

00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:35,840
cities for example we took from the

00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:37,600
from the um oh the big database let me

00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:40,799
just quickly

00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:43,279
um the administrative database of um

00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:44,559
that's available um online and that is

00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:47,120
access database

00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:50,640
for um of global administrative areas we

00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:52,559
use that as boundaries for the cities

00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:54,799
thanks annie and i hope that this

00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:57,039
answered the the question i hope so too

00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:58,799
if it doesn't please please um get in

00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:02,080
touch and we'll be happy to

00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:04,159
to to answer it more fully

00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,600
thanks uh there's another question that

00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:08,399
is actually uh from me

00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,679
um and uh it's about the software so

00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:11,679
which software did you use

00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:13,679
to perform the work or to run the model

00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:15,679
in general and also a question on the

00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:17,679
source code is that available

00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:21,120
in in the interest of the

00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:23,440
reproducibility of this research

00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:25,120
thank you marco okay the software the

00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:27,600
highly technical question i think

00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:29,039
uh i i would not venture to say what

00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,600
what the guys used i know they're also

00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:34,880
reversant in python i know that they

00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:37,440
um using using normal sort of gis

00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:39,120
uh software ran into ran into trouble so

00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,480
you you can't sort of do these these

00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,240
computations i think they

00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,840
sort of sort of wrote wrote the code

00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:47,200
themselves all the code

00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:49,840
um is available on github um if you go

00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:51,440
on to on to on to the mansuetto

00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,080
institute github site all the code is

00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,320
there

00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,760
um especially interesting i think that

00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:58,559
we've had comments around the

00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:59,360
the the making of the cadastral map um

00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:01,279
sort of the

00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:02,480
modification of the usual voronoi

00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:05,120
algorithm so that

00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:08,320
it's all there so please um engage with

00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:10,240
it um help us improve it

00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:13,599
it's a it's a community tool and we want

00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:13,599
to to build it with everyone

00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:21,919
thanks a lot andy um actually we still

00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:24,480
have a yes some more comments about the

00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:26,000
cadastral maps uh i would like to thank

00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,839
the person who's still writing in the

00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,119
chat unfortunately

00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:31,119
we don't know that the name of the

00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:31,440
person but there's a lot of discussion

00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:34,320
that

00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:36,000
of course because it's uh yeah i think

00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,280
we can potentially go on and discuss

00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,520
about this a lot

00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:40,879
i can just maybe quickly read the

00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,919
additional comments and maybe if you

00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:45,440
have a quick feedback

00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:47,280
and you can to give one um so

00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,639
um again coming back to the previous

00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,960
discussion uh even

00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:52,800
uh real cadastral maps are sensitive

00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,159
usually due to not being aligned

00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,560
precisely even that

00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:57,920
it is a source of endless arguments even

00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,760
slightly out of date

00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,320
real cadastral maps are destroyed by

00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:05,040
governments to avoid misunderstandings

00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:07,040
no matter if there is big warning not a

00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:08,880
real cadastral map people will take this

00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:11,359
that's the real thing

00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:13,920
um all the buildings i trace from

00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:15,839
imagery are skewed several random meters

00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:18,960
thanks to being etc i hope you have

00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:21,920
better grasp of real wgs 84 location and

00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,320
yeah i would like to thank uh gi danny

00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,960
for

00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:27,040
these uh set of uh i would say

00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:29,760
interesting uh comments i i

00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:32,000
i agree that we could potentially stay

00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:34,079
here and discuss forever about kadasha

00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,040
but i would leave maybe a final

00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:38,400
statement

00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:39,200
to comment on this um thank you very

00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,680
much udari

00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:43,359
um this is i mean it is a it is a very

00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:45,119
important discussion and i think that

00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:47,119
as marcus says we can discuss around

00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:49,359
this forever i think um

00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:50,400
uh erica also yesterday in her talk you

00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:52,800
know she started out

00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,960
and saying how you know the the map in

00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:56,320
africa right was divided in in europe

00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:59,760
like the power of maps

00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:01,760
and and i think um again we are not

00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,200
proposing a cadastral map i think this

00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,800
is this is really important it is a

00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:09,280
heuristic for us to

00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:11,839
to try and get um to get uh

00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:13,359
a proposal for for street level access

00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:16,000
um i think with the

00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:16,800
with uh but i also think that there have

00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,839
been

00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,400
amazing projects like um the stdn

00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:23,440
projects

00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,320
um that uh uh unhabited has been running

00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,880
sort of in

00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:28,320
in uganda where once you start doing

00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,760
sort of a more communal

00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,440
communal and community based

00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,440
understanding of land

00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,640
and how land is owned and distributed

00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:37,839
the tenure of this

00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:40,400
of land when it becomes not a dictation

00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:42,560
but an engagement with communities and

00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,920
i think this is where for me the agency

00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:47,359
of mapping is so powerful

00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:49,040
is that you actually put the power of of

00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:50,640
of mapping and of of determining what

00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,960
the map looks like in the hand of

00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:55,040
uh in the hand of of of of the community

00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:58,880
who lives there and i think that

00:36:55,040 --> 00:37:00,640
we shouldn't i always try to to say that

00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:02,079
even in these hard discussions like

00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:04,320
around cadastral maps

00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:05,920
instead of trying to see all the all the

00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,440
problems that are that they that they

00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,079
present just to see what are some of the

00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,480
opportunities

00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:12,720
that we can engage with within those

00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:14,480
contexts i know for example in liberia

00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:16,000
um there's land that's owned by people

00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,280
who left liberia

00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,520
during the civil war and have never

00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:21,280
returned and and the government

00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:23,200
or the local community can't access that

00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,320
land so i think it's more for us to

00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,839
start a conversation

00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:28,560
around these things and see how do we

00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:31,280
engage the different stakeholders

00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:32,880
because at the end of the day um we need

00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,119
to engage these questions in ways that

00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,280
are

00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:36,400
that are equitable and just to say that

00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:39,280
uh um

00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,599
we have to to not have this discussion i

00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,240
think

00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:43,440
is is not good so i think that you know

00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,920
with every

00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:47,359
every attempt to try and show something

00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:49,040
