all these speakers had to adjust from

00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,439
they proposed their talks when

00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,600
um we just thought that the conference

00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:15,759

they've all done great um some of them

00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:20,799
hang to learn more than others to record

so we'll be cutting up the live stream

00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:25,200
and putting them on the website

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,360

and it's not that frequent the

00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,800
newsletter so i'm sure you'll be happy

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,680
with that

00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,920
um we don't have a group photo this year

00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,120
i

00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:23,599
started to do this but if you want to

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,599
join in i think maybe people will help

00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:28,160
put together a group photo so

00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:29,440
that's cape town and it's made up for a

00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,680
number of you

00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,519
um on twitter people have started

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,440
sharing their photo of

00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,640
them in front of their computer in front

00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,760
of the stream

00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,720
with the hashtag sotom 2020 pic so we

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,000
can

00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,040
find those easily so while you're still

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,040
on the stream now

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,280
get you know get your camera take a

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:54,239
selfie a view on the screen and

00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,239
tweet it with sutton 2020 pick

00:02:54,319 --> 00:03:00,720
um and again thanks for being here

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,159
so i think we averaged about 200 viewers

00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,040
during the conference and

00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:06,319
it reached over 300 people at one point

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,319
yesterday

00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,239
um i think we'll be looking into those

00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:13,040
stats in more detail

00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,480
um as a team but i think with it being

00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,400
different time zones

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,239
um maybe some of you have joined at

00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,480
different times and

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,400
um hopefully you share the videos as

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,200
they come out and the ones you like were

00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,840
people that couldn't be up or couldn't

00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,400
be on the computer at a weekend

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,280
um every year we asked for your feedback

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,799
we'd love

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,599
to know what we did well um for us or

00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,879
anyone else

00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:40,640
that runs virtual conference we do as an

00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:43,040
organizing team we help

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,480
other groups that run states of the

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,120
state of the map

00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,959
for their region or their country so if

00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,400
you put some feedback there it will

00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:54,000
help us know how we did um and

00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,840
we can kind of share that and think

00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,040
through it um some of those things we're

00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,879
aware of but

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,360
there might be things we didn't quite

00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:04,720
notice

00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,400
um and thank you for taking part i mean

00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,920
that's really made the conference

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:12,560
and really made me happy um

00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,519
to see all the communications trying to

00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,920
keep hold of them

00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,759
i'm glad i wasn't on the info desk at

00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,639
any point but i tried to keep track of

00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:22,240
these so

00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:26,240
there were 59 users i believe on irc

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:29,199
um over 463 people in the telegram group

00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,600
these numbers i actually took um i think

00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,800
about

00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:35,840
six hours ago so back then there were

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:39,440
1400 messages um

00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:42,240
2 000 tweets and retweets and they seem

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:45,360
to be from 300 different locations

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:48,080
um as far as twitter could tell us so

00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:51,120
that's cities and countries

00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:54,160
you can still tweet as i said um

00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,320
you can still use telegram and irc

00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,759
um there's even some organized sessions

00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,680
still going on so

00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,360
do go on those channels and continue

00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,440
chatting um

00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,880
and telling us what you liked about the

00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,800
conference it might

00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:10,560
be easier to digest some of that now

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:12,479
that it's not all happening um

00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,639
so there's a little picture we did of

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,759
some of the tweets and the messages

00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,560
going there and

00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,000
and lots of things and uh and yeah i

00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,560
love picking out words like

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,240
great and watch and join as people ask

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,320
to do that

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,720
and what's online and everything that's

00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,720
happening

00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:35,919
um thank you to our programme committee

00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,800
um so that's the names listed there they

00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,120
help select

00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,080
the talks which they put a lot of effort

00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,880
into

00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,639
um reading through i think we got about

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,880
200 talks there

00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,840
um and we had to narrow them down to

00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,880
just a few

00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:53,360
um and even then there were lots um lots

00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,360
of great subjects

00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,520
we did have some poster entries so i've

00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,039
put the pictures here but if you go to

00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:02,160
that website address

00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:05,120
um or to the website and click posters

00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,199
you can go and see them so everyone just

00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,880
people doing posters of maps or

00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,520
information or just sharing their

00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,680
project there's a lot of variants there

00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,680
it's another way you can hear about the

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,720
project understand what's going on

00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,560
different things in openstreetmap

00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,120
it's not quite the same we can't walk

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,120
around and see these on boards but

00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,319
um i'd certainly encourage you to look

00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:30,400
at those and you can

00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:32,800
tweet about them um

00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,440
so yeah and thank you for the academic

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,280
track

00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:40,400
so the proceedings of those

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:42,880
talks of the the papers um

00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,000
are already on that website address

00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,759
there

00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,680
if you want to read the detail and the

00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,440
references

00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,199
i want to thank you the programme

00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,759
committee that put a lot of work into

00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,080
there

00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,680
and have the connections and know how

00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,319
that happens to bring a

00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,800
a different type of community into our

00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,360
greater

00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,880
community so it's great um that that's

00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,199
happened and it's really great that

00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,120
that's been going for a few years now

00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,560
um one of those things that i really

00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,280
enjoy so thank you

00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,680
you guys for reviewing your submissions

00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:16,160
and

00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:17,919
um and for making that happen

00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,000
thank you to the scholarship committee

00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,720
that looked at scholars we could help

00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,360
come

00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,560
so i think that information isn't going

00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,960
to be wasted i think

00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,560
we've got the reviews we can look at um

00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,240
but they put in a lot of work

00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,160
to try and get people that we could get

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,919
to the conference and

00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,160
i'm not quite sure what what will happen

00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:38,960
next but we really value their work

00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,720
um and i think they had done some

00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,360
communication with the scholars their

00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,639
say

00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:48,319
they continued to be a key part of

00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:51,840
a state of the map helping that happen

00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:54,479
and that's the um the conference

00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:56,479
is the open street map foundation's

00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,560
official conference

00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,000
so we thank them for supporting us the

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,520
organization

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,560
um for giving some madora fears time um

00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,840
to help us run things um i think you've

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,759
probably heard a lot

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:14,400
about the foundation already um

00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,120
some things um some of the talks about

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,960
that like

00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:22,160
alan mustards gurney

00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:24,400
so you can join the foundation

00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:28,080
um and show your support you can find

00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:29,759
him more information on that website

00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,080
and then i've got some really exciting

00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,039
news now it's normally really fun to do

00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,399
this in person

00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:38,800
but um but we can't do that quite

00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,800
at the moment um i want to thank the

00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,360
czech republic and they've become the

00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,080
latest

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,360
local chapter of the open street map

00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,360
foundation

00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,959
um so we didn't manage to arrange it to

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,600
have them on this call

00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:52,080
but um they are now part of that and you

00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,920
can

00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,680
go to the foundation website to

00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,839
understand what that means

00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,920
um i think they started arranging this

00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,680
and getting improved in february and

00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,839
the paperwork's just come through the

00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:06,160
pace so uh we welcome them in

00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:08,000
amongst the local chapters of open

00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:11,920
street map foundation

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,000
um and the connections we have with that

00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,959
and thank you to our sponsors they're

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,120
all listed there

00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:18,080
they continue to support us as a virtual

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,160
conference

00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,080
so that helps where we've had some costs

00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:25,920
of hosting the virtual conference

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,480
and running things um and it also helps

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,480
us

00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,839
run this in future years and in future

00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,080
ways um

00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:34,000
to just have that financial backing for

00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:37,120
things that cost money and

00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,519
and media front um and also that helps

00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,080
the

00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,600
openstreetmap foundation generally so it

00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,920
will help run the servers

00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,000
um and things like that the various

00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,800
costs and some of the grant programs as

00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,839
well

00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,120
um that we have running as the

00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:53,360
foundation

00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:56,399
so thank you thank you very much for

00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,399
that um

00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:01,040
and we have the video team um listed

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,720
there so thank you

00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:06,160
to them um and i know it's been

00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,360
particularly difficult learning new

00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,200
technologies

00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,480
um and getting involved in this as

00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,680
volunteers

00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:16,399
um particularly when they signed up

00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,079
um i think most of them as thinking this

00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,720
would be in person which makes some

00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:22,320
things

00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:24,279
easier um but they all all got really

00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,200
stuck in there were lots of

00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:29,440
communications um

00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,040
so that they could yes so that they

00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,279
could get things working sometimes

00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,800
things needed to be restarted

00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:37,040
which you never want to do in the middle

00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,560
of a conference especially not an online

00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,480
only one

00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,839
but they did great work and they they

00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,880
kept us going

00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:47,760
um through that

00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,160
um i want to say thanks to the local

00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,279

00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:57,040

christine kind of oversees it all and

00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,079
bernal did a lot of

00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,079
as great team lead and i think everyone

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:29,680
on the team just changing

00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:30,560
um for being um an in-person conference

00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,680

00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,079
so i think i've got a few more names

00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,120
here

00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:40,800
um these were people that um helped in

00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,680
different ways as well

00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,720
um sometimes just getting the website uh

00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,200
into gear and

00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,320
connecting things some people stepped in

00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,279
and and did

00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:53,600
um session hosting uh where we needed

00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:57,600

the day before um so we've collected a

00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,120
few

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,839
