What are the perspectives and challenges around the new wealth of building data in OpenStreetMap?

OpenStreetMap (OSM) is constantly expanding into emerging fields, particularly around building datasets. Through its participatory character, OSM provides an incomplete, but global coverage of buildings, nowadays already outnumbering roads. Their distribution and properties are the best indicator to population density, economic activity patterns, and risks of natural hazards. Thus, OSM constitutes a perfect base to provide answers to many related questions of various stakeholders from communities, governments, private sector and research.

We present an overview of how worldwide building data is used and will be in the near future. We will guide through our latest projects, reaching from the creation of risk models, via automated building extraction from satellite sensor data to building completeness estimates, and set these developments in context with other community-driven activities. We report on the challenges of managing global building data, and combining attributes from other open and public domain big datasets towards rich handling of building data in and around OSM. A special focus is on the ways how this new information can be made useful to support mappers to achieve higher completeness of building data.

buildings are the new streets

00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,080
uh it will be presented by danielle

00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:15,759
ishorlemel

00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:18,400
and felix the latter so let me

00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,359
give you a representation from them so

00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,320
they are coming from the science

00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,160
community

00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,080
and they will be speaking about the use

00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,359
of opening street map especially the

00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,439
buildings in it

00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,039
so discussing with felix a bit earlier

00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,920
at the presentation

00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,719
before we used to be um at the beginning

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,000
mapping uh

00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,760
streets that was kind of the most

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,079
important thing and now

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,160
is has becoming buildings the new thing

00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,079
that is really important in osm so felix

00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,879
and daniel will explain a bit further

00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,760
regarding uh this topic daniel is

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,399
seismologist

00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,440
and felix is information technologist

00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,600
and they are working

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,800
in the german research center of

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,000
geoscience

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,719
so let's welcome them for the talk

00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,840
buildings

00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,840
are the new

00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,080
hello and welcome to our talk about

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,240
buildings in openstreetmap

00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,280
i'm daniel and i'm working at gfc the

00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,200
german research center for geosciences

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,400
within the section of seismic hazard and

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,320
risk dynamics

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,000
i'm leading a group working on a global

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,040
dynamic building model

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,880
with focus on earthquake risk

00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,520
hi i'm felix and i'm part of daniel's

00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,880
team for our work we fundamentally rely

00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,680
on openstreetmap

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,840
we use and process its building data for

00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,759
a new approach in our research

00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,280
if you're interested in this topic

00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,680
please make sure that you attend

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,640
daniel's talk tomorrow about earthquakes

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,640
and openstreetmap

00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,680
in this presentation we will be talking

00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,600
about global building data sets

00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:57,439
what is so special about them and how

00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,439
openstreetmap plays an important role

00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,880
why is an open database with all kinds

00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:05,040
of geographic data called openstreetmap

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,799
the name already suggests that in the

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,200
beginning it was primarily about

00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,440
orientation and movement

00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,040
no wonder because in the first decade of

00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,520
the 2000 nurse

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,440
when openstreetmap was initially built

00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,640
computer-supported routing was

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:23,280
the new innovation digital maps were

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,440
mainly focused on roads and contained

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,840
only landmarks or very important

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:31,120
buildings

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:34,800
back then they started with applications

00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,720
based on routing first

00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,360
car navigation systems started to

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:42,160
replace the big stacks of paper maps

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,160
and traveling

00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,080
then with the rising distributions of

00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,400
smartphones

00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,239
personal map apps that provided digital

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,840
maps and navigation aids

00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,840
became available to everyone

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,280
also analysis of movement traffic public

00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,239
transportation accessibility to jobs and

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,840
leisure

00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:07,760
etc started being recorded and assessed

00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:10,000
by researchers and development agencies

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,680
and the data has been used early on for

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,840
disaster response

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,680
again with a focus on roads and maybe

00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,440
bridges to understand

00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:21,120
which of them became impassable

00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,280
the level of road coverage in

00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,000
openstreetmap was growing rapidly

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,319
not only due to dedicated mappers who

00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,519
use gps devices to map their

00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,680
surroundings

00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:34,239
and remote locations using satellite

00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,239
imagery

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,440
small scale activities were accompanied

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,360
by large-scale data imports

00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,799
most notably the tiger data in the

00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,959
united states

00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,799
which provided a complete set of roads

00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,319
even if they were of relatively low

00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,560
accuracy

00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:52,560
other countries followed this example

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,640
and in most regions of the world we can

00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:58,400
consider now the coverage of public

00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,400
roads to be relatively complete

00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,560
of course it was welcome from the

00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,720
beginning to map more than just streets

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,599
and roads in open street map

00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,280
however in the area of buildings mostly

00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,439
prominent buildings or important

00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,879
buildings such as train stations

00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:18,639
airports town halls hospitals

00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,639
etc were mapped

00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,000
the mapping of points of interest and

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,080
addresses

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,120
which in turn are useful for navigation

00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,960
point of view

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,639
was the next step before the complete

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:32,240
mapping of buildings became more and

00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,240
more popular in the last 10 years

00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,919
buildings are increasingly coming into

00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,800
focus they represent the location of

00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,800
people

00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,720
they are representatives of economic

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,800
development and activities

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,919
and they help to understand the economic

00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,919
status

00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:50,160
movement patterns and distributions of

00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:52,479
people

00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,000
humanitarian organizations such as

00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,400
doctors without borders

00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,840
use building data not only to plan how

00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,320
to get to people

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,880
but also how many people are likely to

00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,800
live

00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,800
in which part of the country and which

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,080
settlement to ensure that they

00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,680
distribute well

00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:11,600
medicines and vaccines similarly the

00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,440
distributions of buildings is important

00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:17,039
for understanding the potential impact

00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:19,759
of natural hazards on people and values

00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:21,919
rough but globally homogeneous estimates

00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,520
were made possible by global coverage

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,759
with satellite images

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,280
and processing techniques to detect the

00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:31,360
signature of buildings

00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:33,199
or build up areas global but also very

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,080
general data sets on population

00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,840
distribution

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,400
and distribution of buildup area were

00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,320
produced

00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,160
although they are rather inaccurate

00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,039
approximation of the distribution of

00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,880
buildings

00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:47,919
they have proven to be very useful in

00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,919
many applications

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,560
i would like to highlight two data sets

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,479
for global building coverage the first

00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,000
is the global human settlement layer

00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,199
which is funded by the european

00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,800
commission

00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,120
it was created by automatic

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,199
classification of satellite images

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,120
and is currently renewed every five

00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,880
years

00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,800
the second is the high resolution

00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,639
settlement layer which was created by

00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,680
columbia university together with

00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,440
facebook

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,720
they used a combination of computer

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,199
vision techniques

00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,840
to classify blocks of optical satellite

00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,960
data

00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,240
of the entire planet whether or not it

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,120
is populated

00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,960
which means it contains buildings and

00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,720
then they enriched it with census data

00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,280
to assign population chairs to

00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,360
settlement

00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:35,520
areas recently there have been

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,120
remarkable advances in the automatic

00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,039
recognition of map features from

00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,039
satellite or drone images

00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:43,360
based on processing of statistical

00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:44,720
models which is often referred to as

00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,840
machine learning or

00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,199
artificial intelligence using complex

00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,199
calculations

00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,520
it is now possible to produce actual

00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,880
building footprint estimates for entire

00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,039
countries

00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,479
for example last year i was involved in

00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,639
a project with microsoft and the

00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:03,120
humanitarian openstreetmap team

00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,560
and we created open data sets for uganda

00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,479
and tanzania

00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,160
and i'm sure it's only a matter of time

00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,759
before global data sets of building

00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,360
footprint predictions

00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,759
are conducted and hopefully made

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,520
available to the public

00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:18,160
there are already several companies

00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,160
working on this

00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,280
luckily we do not need to rely on big

00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:25,199
companies to produce building data

00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,120
this video shows the development of

00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,960
building data in openstreetmap for the

00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,960
city of berlin

00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,240
the video moves forward in five day

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,639
increments

00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,720
and within each of these five days any

00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:39,759
building that has been added or changed

00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,840
is lighting up you can clearly see how

00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,960
everything started with adding landmark

00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,039
buildings

00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,039
and then activities of volunteers in

00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:50,240
their neighborhood

00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:52,240
moving everything into the downtown

00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,440
area from there into the suburbs and

00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,599
then finally

00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,599
trying to complete the building data set

00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:00,240
of the city

00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,879
and in the later days you can only see

00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,960
how

00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:05,039
single buildings and various points of

00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,599
the city have been updated

00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:09,120
just to keep the data as fresh and new

00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:11,039
as possible

00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,720
nowadays many projects and many more

00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,720
volunteers are actively working on

00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,240
mapping buildings in openstreetmap

00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,240
the number of buildings has reached

00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,160
almost 400 million and is growing at a

00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:24,879
staggering rate of about 150

00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:26,960
000 per day or actually two per second

00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:29,280
so something special is happening here

00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:32,400
osm is becoming the most verified global

00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,400
data set for buildings

00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,680
until now building footprints have been

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,479
either used

00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,440
very locally or in aggregated form and

00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,200
globally

00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,200
but now it's time to take the precision

00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,839
of local analysis to a global level

00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,160
and osm is the key it offers the great

00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,760
value of responsibly incorporating human

00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,440
mapping and open data sets

00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,760
and having them check for quality and

00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:57,760
legal approval by the critical community

00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,959
itself this is a potential quantum leap

00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,200
for many applications

00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,240
previously worked with very general data

00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,000
aggregates

00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,160
such as the aforementioned settlement

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,080
layers and more importantly

00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,680
it opens the door for many more new

00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,279
applications of building data in the

00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,040
future

00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,320
in openstreetmap there is an obvious

00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,560
interest in buildings

00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:19,120
that has grown in recent years the

00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,959
ability to render 3d buildings from osm

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,800
began to make it interesting to describe

00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:24,160
buildings in more detail

00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,760
i believe we'll see more and more

00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,040
motivation to add more detail to

00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,200
buildings as we map them in

00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,880
openstreetmap

00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,120
within our research group we are working

00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,640
exactly on the edge of aggregated data

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,399
being the state of the art and we

00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,240
improve these methods significantly by

00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,360
using openstreetmap's global building

00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,200
data

00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,880
we process the data and then conduct our

00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,880
research on top of it

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,560
we see this huge potential for all kinds

00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,480
of topics and want to offer our work to

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,160
the public to use and eventually to team

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,760
up with us

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,440
therefore we are creating the open

00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,040
building map

00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,959
it can be considered a window to open

00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,240
street map a building focused version of

00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,640
osm

00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,360
it consumes continuously data from osm

00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,519
cleans it up

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,120
processes additional building attributes

00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,760
and makes the resulting data set

00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,760
available

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,320
as open data exports and web maps to

00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:12,560
inspect building information

00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,720
in the open building map we are cleaning

00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,880
up and consolidating some osm tags in

00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,480
order to make the data set consistent

00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,760
for example we estimate the number of

00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,720
stories from the building height in

00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,360
meters

00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,680
or we fix typers and attacks to make the

00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,360
data more useful

00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,920
or we look into building types in their

00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,680
usage this is not always the same think

00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,519
about a church building that is nowadays

00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,360
partially used for housing

00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:37,120
in osm there are several approaches to

00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,120
tagging this and by analyzing the data

00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,560
we try to catch different concepts apply

00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,600
them to attributes

00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:46,160
that are unclear data structure and then

00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,760
we do additional calculations these are

00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,360
heavy and might take over a year with a

00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,959
decent server to calculate

00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,560
we add them to the buildings and make

00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:54,240
them available

00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,440
we define the position of a house in

00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,839
relation to neighbor houses

00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,480
we calculate the size of the ground area

00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:04,000
of each and every building

00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,399
in the second step we calculate the

00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
floor space which is generally speaking

00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,800
the building footprints ground area

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,480
multiplied by the levels

00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,800
based on more complex rules among

00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,000
several osm tags we attempt to define

00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:20,079
the occupancy

00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,079
following the standard building taxonomy

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,440
for our calculations we assume a grid of

00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,480
the world and to prefer more complex

00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,160
calculations

00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,519
which are enhanced by the details

00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,640
derived from the building data and

00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,399
openstreetmap

00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,880
it is useful for us to understand the

00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,720
degree of completeness in openstreetmap

00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,240
it's perfectly okay if these data

00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,880
estimates but we're interested in

00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,480
worldwide coverage

00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:45,279
we use a combination of two different

00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,200
main sources and approaches

00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,200
as a general fallback for the world

00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,959
coverage of build up areas with remote

00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,079
sensing techniques in comparison with

00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:54,000
osm data

00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:55,120
for this purpose the global data sets

00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,720
already mentioned

00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,800
can be used for global population

00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,560
estimation in addition

00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,000
we are experimenting with the classical

00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,320
remote sensing techniques

00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,680
with open radar data from sentinel one

00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,279
and combine them with the machine

00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:10,800
learning prediction data set

00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:12,320
from facebook roads

00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,880
there's nothing better than the human

00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,639
eye but going through all the many many

00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,040
tiles just to get started is a lot of

00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,120
work

00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,720
however for regional areas of interest

00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,000
where we want to improve the quality of

00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,839
our calculations

00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,440
we are working with mapswipe to obtain

00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:27,200
from people mainly us

00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,880
a sense of completeness when viewing

00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,880
satellite images and osm data

00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:36,000
our software stack has become what it is

00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,440
over time and we are happy to take a

00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,639
step back now

00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,399
we want to reconsider the

00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,079
implementations we want to clean up

00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,360
everything and then release it as free

00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:45,120
software

00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,040
we want to make this a collaborative

00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,959
process and invite everyone to take a

00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,959
look at our repository

00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,000
in the upcoming weeks and months we will

00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:54,959
release the various

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,120
components there besides the building

00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:59,200
database the system is a tile-based

00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,519
geographic information system

00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,600
and all our grid calculations are

00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:07,120
actually based on tiles

00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:09,360
which we index then with the quad tree

00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,279
the calculation engines will be based on

00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,720
generic processing pipelines

00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,800
which might be interesting for more

00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,560
people doing extensive calculations on

00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,639
global data sets especially around

00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,079
openstreetmap

00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:22,000
the implementation is done with

00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:24,959
asynchronous python we use

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,560
async io and web sockets to communicate

00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,800
the processing stage to connected

00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,639
software components

00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,399
last but not least we are redesigning

00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,399
our website to offer building data

00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,639
extracts for download and to make the

00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,720
web map fun and fast to load

00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,720
by using vector tiles instead of heavy

00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,279
raster tile layers

00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,279
we are pleased to move to an open source

00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:47,920
code and data principle

00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:49,120
within our research institute according

00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,839
to the maxim

00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,279
public money public code we want to

00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,959
contribute something useful to

00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:59,440
openstreetmap and we are looking for

00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:59,440
collaboration on code data and knowledge

00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,519
please pay attention to our website and

00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,480
code repositories in the coming months

00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,480
if you like

00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,000
you can follow us in the fatty verse

00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,959
this is the cool and free twitter

00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,720
alternative

00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:12,160
and there you get all the small updates

00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:16,160
on our project

00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:18,480
and you can get in touch with us

00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,600
and of course please contact us if you

00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,720
have questions

00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,560
comments ideas or suggestions

00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,760
we hope to see you all in person on next

00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:31,839
year's state of the map

00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:31,839
thanks again and bye bye

00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,959
thank you felix thank you daniel for

00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,360
presentation it was very interesting how

00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:42,880
you are showing importance of having

00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,720
buildings also in osm

00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,560
and how everybody can take advantage of

00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,560
this data available right there

00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,160
so we have many questions i'm super

00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,079
happy to uh start with

00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,360
this so do you have any comments before

00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:57,120
we start with the

00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:58,959
questions felix or daniel

00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,880
well i guess you can just shoot with the

00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:04,079
questions already

00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:05,440
okay perfect all right so

00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:08,320
let me look through this screen right

00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:11,440
here so i can read the path

00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,639
okay uh first question is if you had to

00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,839
make a prediction

00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:17,040
when do you think building data will be

00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:20,000
mostly map

00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:21,680
one year two years or more that's the

00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,959
first question we have

00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,600
okay uh that's a difficult one first of

00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,440
all we don't

00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:30,240
know how many buildings there are on

00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:32,079
earth uh from the extrapolation

00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,079
in countries that are more or less

00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:37,040
completely mapped we see

00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:37,759
roughly a factor of four between the

00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,519
buildings

00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:41,360
and the number of people living in the

00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:44,480
country which would

00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:46,800
hint to something up to 2 billion

00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,839
buildings on earth currently we have 400

00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,320
million

00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,360
and as we said in the talk we're getting

00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:55,040
about 150

00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:56,160
000 a day i still think we're many many

00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,839
years away from

00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,839
that goal so one or three years will

00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:02,320
certainly not make it if it's you know

00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:03,759
mapping by hand if there are large scale

00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,959
imports it could of course

00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:07,680
uh speed the process up but i would not

00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,279
think that

00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,279
within the next five years we will ever

00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:14,880
reach this point yeah

00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:17,360
all right alex anything you want to add

00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,079
no i'm taking the next question okay

00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,440
good

00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:24,560
so next question is have you considered

00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:28,000
this week's release of uk government

00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:31,600
uh ids uh the name i think is

00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:35,040
upr ends for every property as

00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,959
open data yeah

00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,880
i think i would like to take this

00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:40,399
question more towards the direction of

00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,880
like generally importing

00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:44,399
or combining open data sets with

00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:47,120
openstreetmap data

00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:49,600
and so far our goal is to get things

00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:52,480
into openstreetmap and then consume it

00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,480
instead of mixing different data sets

00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,639
they're open or not

00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,320
why because we appreciate openstreetmap

00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,959
we think that openstreetmap does an

00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,720
excellent job on verifying on building

00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:06,079
the best data out there

00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:08,000
so why should we try to um to come to

00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:10,640
yeah to mix them in later on

00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,679
so the short answer is in particular to

00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,439
this data is that

00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,039
let's get this into openstreetmap it

00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,640
makes sense and then it will be also in

00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:19,679
the open building

00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:21,760
okay thank you felix so next question is

00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,120
could you talk a bit more on how you

00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:26,480
estimate building

00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,480
occupancy from the data

00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:32,320
yeah okay um we are um

00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,480
making basically a three-step approach

00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:37,600
the first one is

00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:40,240
we check what land use the building is

00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,200
located in this is sort of our very

00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,720
basic

00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,559
assumption if we have no further

00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,400
information we will take that one

00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:48,080
then we look into the building tag so it

00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,000
could be built in apartments building

00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,600
train station building hotel building

00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,600
church or something

00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:56,320
that overrides of course the land use

00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:59,520
tech and then we're looking into pois

00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:01,919
say shops doctoral offices restaurants

00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,720
coffee shops etc that are located within

00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,760
that building

00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:08,400
and from that based on you know

00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,520
local knowledge which is co codified and

00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,000
rules

00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:15,760
we estimate or give a best guess of the

00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:18,400
occupancy type of a particular building

00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,679
okay thank you daniel so next question

00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,720
is uh privacy

00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:24,799
is a concern of many have you

00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,880
considered this is there a way for

00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:29,280
people to say i don't want my building

00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:32,880
listed uh or a way to say let's use

00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,880
but anonymize it

00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,280
yeah um i think that we are taking here

00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,960
the luxury

00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,799
position that we say this is something

00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,679
we have to deal out in the community of

00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:43,679
openstreetmap

00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,799
we are not taking any different approach

00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:48,000
to this

00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:51,120
um we definitely we

00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,600
have like concerns or questions for

00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,400
ourselves like the more we add data to

00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,320
buildings and

00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,559
especially guests data whether it makes

00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:02,080
sense to republish this or better

00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:04,400
to hold it um for only our researchers

00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,360
um but in principle it's really the

00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,960
question towards

00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,120
two or two for the community for the

00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,360
openstreetmap community

00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,320
like i would like to give it back to

00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,960
everyone here

00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,160
um in the room in the virtual room to

00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,000
say hey

00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,840
how do we do it how do we deal with

00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,960
buildings that people or in general

00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:24,640
think

00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:26,559
people don't want to be mapped but

00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,679
yeah and i think there's a comment from

00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,080
someone else in the

00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,720
in the chat uh this person is saying but

00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,799
they are

00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,840
satellite data so there is no personal

00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:35,600
data so

00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,200
it's a comment i think regarding this

00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:40,400
question they put it in the path

00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:43,760
so next question is uh from in the

00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,720
bio this person said i am interested in

00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:48,240
metadata

00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:51,120
energy juice water use water harvest

00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,320
or green energy potential from roof area

00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,880
when does this become

00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:56,559
a privacy issue i don't know but this is

00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,960
a feedback i have received

00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:58,960
before

00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,760
can you repeat the first part of the

00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,080
question sure

00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,440
if it's not clear we can ask this person

00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,960
to

00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,640
elaborate more and we can come back

00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,679
later so i will repeat it right now and

00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:15,200
if it is not clear

00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:18,400
we can come back it says i am interest

00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:21,760
in metadata energy use water use

00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:23,039
water harvest or green energy potential

00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:26,000
from roof area

00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:28,000
when does this become a privacy issue i

00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,799
don't know but this is a feedback i have

00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,799
received before

00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:36,880
okay well that goes

00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:37,360
yeah definitely way beyond what we're

00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,640
doing

00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:42,880
um uh

00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,880
for what for our purpose we're looking

00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,679
uh only under like what is the roof

00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,320
shape

00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:50,080
and we try to understand what type of

00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,960
building we actually have but we are not

00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,360
making any

00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,760
estimates of you know what would be the

00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:58,559
energy content that could be collected

00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:00,080
through such a roof this of course if

00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:03,679
you compute this

00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:05,360
would become a privacy issue but then i

00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,880
go back to exactly what felix said

00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,400
that's something that's a broader

00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,159
discussion that goes

00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,679
definitely beyond what we're doing that

00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:14,000
doesn't community decision

00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:16,159
are we allowed to map something like

00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,240
this or should we be doing it

00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:20,000
okay thank you daniel for the answer so

00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,480
the next question will be uh

00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,440
what do you consider a building for

00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,240
example

00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,200
are temporary makeshift informal

00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,679
settlements

00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,919
or buildings under construction consider

00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:35,360
a building

00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:38,720
uh currently we we orientate this at the

00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:43,039
along the building tag itself so

00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:46,320
the major data we collect or actually

00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:48,240
process uh the polygons

00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,000
that contain the building tech but we

00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,840
are of course also looking

00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,679
for some other purposes that might talk

00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,880
tomorrow about the earthquake stuff also

00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:58,000
into bridges

00:21:54,880 --> 00:22:01,280
and other things but a building is

00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:04,080
what is tagged as a building

00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,880
equals something in openstreetmap maybe

00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,720
i can just

00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,480
quickly add to this because i think the

00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,640
question was also about like

00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,760
what could potentially be a building and

00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,240
for our work

00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:16,159
it is not doesn't matter so much because

00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:19,600
we are complementing

00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:20,480
um the like the incomplete osm building

00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,840
data

00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:25,200
with um like the other calculations we

00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,000
are doing that daniel is going to talk

00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,240
about

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,679
so we we are not considering that the

00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,760
data set is perfect

00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:33,679
so we are flexible anyway so we are

00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,080
we're definitely doing calculation that

00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,720
our

00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,760
approximations to something and this is

00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,919
why we can

00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:43,200
comfortably say we just rely on open

00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:45,679
street maps criteria for buildings

00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,039
okay perfect thank you felix also for uh

00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:49,760
complementing the answer

00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:50,080
so the next question will be uh what was

00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,039
the

00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:54,960
thinking behind hosting your code uh in

00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:58,080
debian salsa

00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:59,440
uh is it debian related um so

00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:02,240
another comment is great to see people

00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,720
using it yeah i'm happy to take this

00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,440
question

00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,440
actually um

00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:11,440
no i think we wanted to host and git um

00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:13,280
github and gitlab were no options for us

00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,960
because we have colleagues in iran we

00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,760
have friends in cuba and they cannot

00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,600
access

00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:20,240
we think that those platforms are not

00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:23,120
really suitable for collaboration

00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,880
um so we looked into what are like open

00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,640
and free alternatives that are really

00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:29,039
inclusive for everybody

00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,240
and there are not so many unfortunately

00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:33,520
and um

00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:36,159
and salsa.debian.org is an established

00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:38,880
community so we can have collaboration

00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:39,360
it is open source it is reliable and

00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,080
it's not

00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:43,039
blocked by any countries that are not

00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,799
liked so much

00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:48,559
by other countries so it's just open um

00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:50,000
it the code that we are doing is not

00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:52,880
strictly debian related

00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,080
and salsa.debian.org says actually every

00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,720
code is welcome

00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:58,720
which could potentially end up in debian

00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,600
so it must be open source which is our

00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,760
code

00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,120
and um yeah it was the best platform we

00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,159
could find to actually have

00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,960
collaboration

00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:08,559
in a really open environment yeah and um

00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,480
of course we were really looking for a

00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:13,200
platform that is

00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,679
sharing our ethical principles in this

00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,159
and

00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:16,720
github and gitlab or not yeah great to

00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:19,120
hear that

00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,240
danielle and felix uh so the next

00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:23,360
question i have is

00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:26,480
um hold on one second uh yeah

00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:28,400
you say that you detect tagging errors

00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:33,200
have you thought about giving this back

00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:36,480
to mappers so they can fix it

00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:39,440
um yeah we are thinking about this and

00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,240
how to do this best but there's of

00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:44,000
course

00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:46,159
um often a conflict if we say okay we

00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,960
will change this tag into something

00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:49,600
because we make an interpretation of a

00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,679
building

00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,760
that maybe the mapper or even a very

00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:54,559
local community may not be happy about

00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,760
this because

00:24:54,559 --> 00:25:00,480
their specific tag may indicate

00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:02,480
something that on their level is very

00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,320
important but on a global scale as we

00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,880
operate is not so important and we

00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,919
better

00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:11,039
you know unify these things so

00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:13,440
that's why we don't do this

00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:17,200
in writing it back and overriding other

00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:20,799
people's tags the other thing is the

00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:22,080
the typos that's something

00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:25,200
i think we should actually start a

00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:27,200
discussion if particular typos

00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,799
that are very common should just

00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,679
automatically be changed

00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:32,559
whether through a josem plugin or on the

00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:36,240
server side

00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:39,279
where there is an agreed list of what

00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,320
should be changed so that the data set

00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:43,039
just

00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:45,279
has a higher quality at the end but you

00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:47,520
know unless this is

00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:49,520
already implemented so we have to do it

00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,279
ourselves but we're not trying to

00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:53,360
override other people's data that's why

00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:56,240
we keep this change for us

00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,799
okay i think one one thing to add here

00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,440
um

00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:01,039
too is um a lot of the building

00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,960
information that has been mapped

00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:04,960
in openstreetmap started when there was

00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,279
a visualization of it so when 3d

00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,640
buildings came out like a possibility to

00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:10,159
render them

00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,840
people started actually putting like

00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:12,880
heights on buildings because they could

00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,279
see it

00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,400
um on our website openbuildingmap.org

00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:18,960
you can actually

00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,919
look at the different um data that we

00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,799
produce

00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:23,360
and you can inspect it and we um hope

00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:25,279
that's

00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:27,840
like looking at this data being able to

00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:30,320
visualize it motivates people to

00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:33,279
add more information and to fix

00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,279
information of course

00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,720
okay there is one comment i'm not sure

00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:38,320
if it's from the person who did the

00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,600
question or someone else because there

00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,919
is no names here

00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:45,279
uh it says uh you can give back the

00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:45,279
errors not the fixes

00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:51,679
yeah that's two points um thanks

00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:54,000
in processing 400 million buildings and

00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:55,760
it's difficult to

00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,600
send the errors back to the single

00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:01,120
members yeah i can't imagine that

00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:02,480
okay there's a good way to do this yeah

00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,799
i mean let's see if more people won't

00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:07,039
participate in supporting the project i

00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:08,720
mean why not i mean maybe they can

00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:10,080
they can see what can be done regarding

00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:13,120
this this topic

00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:15,679
uh the next question i have uh is

00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,720
canada was trying to map all uh is

00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:19,039
building in osm

00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,760
by 2020. do you know if this was

00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:24,559
achieved

00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:24,559
or it will be finished uh in the year

00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,559
canada yeah i don't know anything about

00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,520
this

00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:34,000
story okay all right so okay we don't

00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:35,039
have the answer um maybe someone else in

00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,480
the community

00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:38,799
can add something to the path if they

00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:41,840
know the answer so

00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:43,440
um what else okay i think that's

00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,120
the last question i have right now i

00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,440
have a couple comments i can read and

00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,360
then

00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,480
we should move forward to the next

00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:51,279
presentation too

00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,399
so one of the comments is expect big

00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:54,480
resistance

00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:57,039
many buildings in certain countries are

00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:59,120
actually illegal according to local laws

00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:00,960
so will be quite embarrassing that's one

00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:04,320
of the comments we have

00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:08,080
um the next comment uh is

00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,080
uh two links uh

00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:15,039
can.github.io slash factory

00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:16,080
underscore data these are examples of

00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:18,159
osm based

00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,360
illegal building reporting sites for

00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:21,279
taiwan

00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,799
but even the government uh compare

00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:25,440
satellite changes

00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:27,039
to no results so that's also one comment

00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,760
no question here

00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:31,919
and the last one is glad you are putting

00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:35,279
buildings in the right place

00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:37,360
i hope they said in parentheses uh for

00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:40,240
me doing it by hand in id

00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:42,880
the offsets due to misaligned imagery

00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,159
are many meters

00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,799
so that's one of the comments too and

00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:47,279
somebody else uh compliment the comments

00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:50,399
saying

00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:52,640
which one only finds out years later

00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:53,840
we id mappers just can't tell which

00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:57,279
imagery is correct

00:28:53,840 --> 00:29:00,159
bing maxar etc flip a coin the comment

00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:00,159
comes from taiwan

00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:04,720
okay okay i think uh that's that's it

00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,919
for the talk uh that's for the questions

00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,279
of the comments we received

00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:08,720
thanks a lot for your time thanks a lot

00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:09,679
for your talk it was really interesting

00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,159
to see how

00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:12,880
osm has been changing over the years and

00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:15,440
now

00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:17,440
buildings is the new goal horizon so

00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,320
thanks a lot for your presentation felix

00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,000
and daniel

00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:27,840
and see you around in the next

00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:27,840
presentations take care and

00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:32,240
