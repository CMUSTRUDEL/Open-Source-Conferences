Title: 2020: Meet an OpenStreetMapper

OpenStreetMappers are a diverse group of people. This short segment will introduce you to another person that makes the project what it is.

Enjoy this little break from longer talks and get to know a conference delegate that you can talk to at the conference. As OpenStreetMap is made by us all, it's important to get to know each other and this can form a nice ice-breaker or give you suggestions on conversation starters.

Gregory has two unique OpenStreetMappers for us to meet and chat to. One has only been a member of the project for a couple of years, getting involved due to a call from the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team(HOT) but also some local projects to map solar panels. The other OSMer has been involved for more years, and has started running out of new things to map in her local area so helps the project in other ways.

for our last

00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:16,560
talk today i'm introducing gregory mada

00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:19,600
gregory has been the subject of

00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,439
some news when he moved

00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,000
many years ago he moved to durham and he

00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,920
said that no there's not much of

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,840
any map on openstreetmap here in this

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,720
area i'm going to try and navigate

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,199
by that little bit of map i have and

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,559
improve

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:37,760
it while i'm doing so um and

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,360
in so doing basically single-handedly

00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,200
created the map of durham and

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,559
openstreetmap

00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:47,840
today he is not the subject

00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:49,120
of people talking but he has invited a

00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,480
couple of guests

00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:55,920
a couple of mappers to talk about

00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:59,840
their job their work in openstreetmap

00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,840
let's go ahead

00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:10,560
hello i'm gregory um

00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:14,320
and i've enjoyed going to space the map

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:16,159
conferences for a number of years um

00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,159
i'm sure you know open street map is

00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,960
about the people that make it

00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:23,119
um in various different ways and those

00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,840
people involved in industry map

00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:27,119
we often call them open street mappers

00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,400
um

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:32,079
and so we can chat to people normally in

00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,960
the breaks it's a bit different this

00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:36,560
year

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:38,880
of course um so i thought

00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,840
i'd have a chat help you meet some

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:45,040
mappers by speaking to a couple

00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,479
of um people that have been involved for

00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,680
a different

00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,240
number of years um and to just ask them

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,040
some

00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,520
questions some friendly chat rather than

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,560
about

00:01:53,520 --> 00:02:01,280
a specific subject

00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:09,840
so i've got uh not too far away for our

00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:09,840
first construct um

00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,720
examiner ian which is one that i've had

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,560
for a long long time

00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,760
and it's one i've kept you know on

00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:26,000
twitter and things like that as well

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,599
so despite the lockdown they're not that

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,800
far down the road from me

00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:32,160
wherever about are we we're in the

00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,160
beautiful city of durham

00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,280
i feel that uh cathedral cities are a

00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,560
bit of a thing there because i was

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,480
actually born in ripon which is another

00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,560
beautiful little cathedral city

00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,599
um but we are in in sunny durham at the

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,239
moment and

00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,879
uh on either side of it really aren't we

00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,800
so one i

00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:49,120
one i'm on one side you're on the other

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,400
basically

00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:55,280
um onto the first mapping question uh

00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,319
what's the first mapping you did in

00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,599
openstreetmap

00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:02,000
how did it where what did you start with

00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:03,680
oh a lot of my mapping actually has been

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,879
the humanitarian open

00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:10,000
street map stuff the um the hot osm

00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:12,159
uh response to crises so i think the

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,400
first one i did was the

00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,400
um

00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,239
refugee camps uh in africa

00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,720
um where they were going across the

00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,879
border from i think sudan south sudan

00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,000
and those ones where we were mapping out

00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,440
so they could see where

00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,760
where people were at how many people

00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,080
were there the changes over here over

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,360
the

00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,680
uh the time in which people had been

00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,879
coming across the border and so

00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:39,120
but they could then get relief in as and

00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:41,360
where it was needed you know so

00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,640
i think that was it most of my hot osm

00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,360
stuff actually has been in africa

00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,840
strangely

00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,799
other things other projects have been

00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:50,080
elsewhere

00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:53,040
um so it started with hot um

00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,040
how does that start

00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,680
um when well yeah how to do more how to

00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,120
get into smacking at

00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,720
home after here in the uk

00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,319
well do you know it's it's the quarterly

00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,879
projects that that get me going on that

00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,159
one and

00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:08,400
the the biggest one i think i was

00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:11,680
involved with was the the one to map

00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,959
solar panel um

00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,000
distribution around the around the

00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,959
country so we'll do our little bit

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,959
wherever we're at and that was a

00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,400
challenge because i think in the end

00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,079
everyone in the car when we were driving

00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,759
along was oh look there's one over there

00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,960
oh there's some over there don't forget

00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,560
that one over there

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:28,479
and so we had um almost a family

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,560
family fun thing trying to spot them all

00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,919
you know but that was that's the biggest

00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,199
one i've got involved with and other

00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:35,840
things have been just little bits and

00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:38,639
pieces here editing buildings names

00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,520
around my local area um just keeping the

00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,800
map up to date

00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,040
pretty much like what you do as well

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:47,040
isn't it um

00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,919
yeah so you've been here for a couple of

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,120
years

00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:52,550
at the start what got you into mapping

00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,400
and um

00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:57,199
[Music]

00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:59,120
um well actually greg it was actually an

00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:02,320
invite from you wasn't it so we were all

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,440
uh yeah we had that we had this uh this

00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,840
meeting

00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,039
at the the church building down the road

00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,080
uh where we meet

00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:12,880
and uh it was a request wasn't it to get

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,560
involved in things so we all

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,240
sat in one of the upstairs conferencing

00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,840
rooms a bit like i don't know a gaming

00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,360
cafe thing everyone had a laptop in

00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,320
front of them and we all got on with

00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,199
uh mapping out that first i think it was

00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,759
a hot same

00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,960
thing the uh the one of the relief camps

00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,479
um

00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,400
i can't remember now is it two years ago

00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:33,520
something like this

00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,240
yeah uh about two years um so you've not

00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,160
been to a

00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,840
state of the map conference before and

00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,840
you watch the live feed

00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,360
one or two from last year um there was i

00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,880
i think

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,440
because i only started getting involved

00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,960
maybe two years ago i i watched a few of

00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,840
the conferences on

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,639
especially on connected with the solar

00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,759
panel

00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,319
um energy mapping project i watched that

00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,000
one

00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,360
i didn't i didn't dip into all of them

00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,919
and probably less than i should have

00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,440
done but

00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,680
that was that was an interesting one to

00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,720
pick up on because i've been involved in

00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,960
it in some way and

00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,240
developed part of the the mapping and

00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,639
actually it's quite interesting because

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,560
on that video i could actually see

00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,080
the specific bits and pieces around the

00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,120
country where i was probably the only

00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,600
one mapping because

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,360
it was so remote and dotted around in a

00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,479
very particular place i thought you know

00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,199
there's no one else actually gone up

00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:25,039
there um so it was it was nice to feel

00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:28,639
connected in that way

00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:32,479
yeah nice so thanks

00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,479
um so yeah

00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,919
and now i'm joined by hannah so i'll let

00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,120
her

00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,120
introduce herself

00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:48,759
um yeah so uh i'm hannah i'm from

00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:54,479
uh from germany cologne and i'm

00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:57,599
a mapper since 2012.

00:06:54,479 --> 00:07:00,800
yes cool

00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:02,960
and how did you contribute to

00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,240
how do you transfer concrete map and

00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,280
perhaps how's that

00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:10,560
changed since you started um when i

00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:13,759
began i started as a

00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:17,039
kind of heavy metal so i was

00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:18,319
really mapping i think yeah almost every

00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:21,360
week or

00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:23,680
yeah something like that um when i

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,720
finished my studies or my studies became

00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,479
a

00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:31,280
bit more serious then

00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:33,520
that got a bit less um but not my

00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:38,160
activity in open street map because

00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:38,160
uh at the moment i'm quite um

00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,680
doing quite a lot for the local chapter

00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,240
in germany

00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,000
at the moment i'm also one of the board

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,280
members

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,400
and i'm also quite in organizing

00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,879
conferences

00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,479
and yeah some mapping parties are

00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,840
organized as well

00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:02,879
and um yeah did a lot of uh yes

00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:06,639
stuff around uh openstreetmap and not uh

00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:09,919
so much mapping anymore right

00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:13,680
so um do you also

00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:15,599
do some new work i think um

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,199
somewhat to help new people in urban

00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:20,960
street now

00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:22,000
uh yes uh that was also one of uh one of

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,120
the parts that i

00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,479
uh yeah i focused a bit on that was

00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,680
especially uh

00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:30,080
the documentation in the wiki and also

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,599
the

00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:36,719
communication with communities which was

00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:39,919
also related to my local chapter work

00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,880
because it was very uh yeah i found it

00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:43,839
quite interesting

00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,040
how um how different communities

00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,760
communicate

00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:49,519
um and uh that there are a lot of

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,480
differences for example in the

00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:54,399
uh german um the german local chapter

00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,440
communicates a lot with

00:08:54,399 --> 00:09:01,120
with emails and with the forum

00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,160
and for other communities this does not

00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,040
work this good

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,839
and i think that also leads sometimes to

00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:10,080
problems that

00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:13,360
the uh german uh the german community

00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:16,720
often writes a lot of uh emails on the

00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:19,600
osmf uh mailing lists for example or on

00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,880
tagging or whatever and then it looks a

00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,880
bit like that these

00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:28,240
um yeah um these discussions are

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:31,120
a lot uh yeah yeah there are a lot of

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,959
german activities and also uh european

00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,279
activities because it's our main

00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:36,080
uh our main general for communication

00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,399
but

00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,600
this of course does not represent all

00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,560
other communities

00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,560
in open street map

00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:51,839
yeah um

00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:59,500
[Applause]

00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,959
chapter that you

00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:16,079
um we have our own conference which is

00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:18,800
um yeah a bit different than the um

00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:20,320
then this autumn because it's more uh

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,160
focused on

00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,160
business also it's more business

00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,880
conference than the mapper conference

00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,760
there's also some mapping activities but

00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:33,839
this is just

00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:33,839
one part of the um of the conference

00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:47,519
yeah we also have our

00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,240
monthly meetings and so on like i think

00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,440
most

00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,839
other um chapters in germany

00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,600
i think that's uh that's quite something

00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,519
that's a bit different about the german

00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,160
local chapter that we are

00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,440
uh have also a part that is very focused

00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:06,200
on business

00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:11,360
with openstreetmap and with cartography

00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:11,360
um business connections

00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:18,720
so why should people um go to these

00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,720
events

00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,959
i think uh they should go there because

00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,240
um

00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:28,720
yeah you can meet their others

00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,760
that also participate in the osm

00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,800
community

00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:36,240
and i think it's always best to speak

00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:38,640
uh face to face and see really

00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,160
that there are persons behind these user

00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:44,160
names you sometimes see in

00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:47,360
uh discussions or in um

00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:49,920
yeah or in the change sets um and

00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,360
i think it also solves a lot of um

00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,760
conflicts and problems

00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,600
uh and it's also a lot of fun uh just

00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:59,040
yet to meet others

00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,920
because um yeah i think openstreetmap is

00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:03,519
some kind of

00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:06,399
um yeah do it on your own hobby

00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:08,000
and um yeah sometimes the uh the

00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:11,040
communication and also

00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:15,200
the yeah meeting others was a

00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,200
bit less than in other hobbies

00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:25,839
yeah it is fun um

00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:50,720
yeah i think when i mostly

00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,000
explain openstreetmap then it's to

00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,320
someone who never heard

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,360
about it and then i often say something

00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,639
like that but it's

00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:02,240
um yeah an alternative to um

00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:03,440
yeah to uh yeah maps like google maps or

00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,639
something like that

00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:09,120
um because there's a community behind it

00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:12,399
that is collecting uh these data

00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:15,040
and um uh of course it's always a

00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,600
bit tricky to explain it because so when

00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,000
you

00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,279
don't have any uh experience with this

00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,000
topic then it's

00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:28,000
yeah sounds a bit weird to collect

00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:30,880
data and theories and all this stuff

00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,000
yeah that's but i think that's how i

00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,000
mostly explain it

00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:54,240
yeah so um i think uh in

00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:57,519
germany uh that's quite a quite a meme

00:13:54,240 --> 00:14:01,279
uh that these um

00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:04,320
uh yeah uh vending machines for uh

00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:07,040
yeah i don't know how to say for dark

00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,040
bags also

00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:14,320
i don't know what's the what's the

00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:16,079
the good uh um yeah english word for it

00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,000
that these are also mapped in open

00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:20,079
street map and quite a lot and

00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,480
uh i think there are um there are a lot

00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:26,000
of uh people that are doing this because

00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:28,240
uh in bigger cities the uh uh the map is

00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,199
already quite full with a lot of peris

00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,920
and i think that's

00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:32,720
uh that's quite of uh amazing that the

00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,120
um

00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,160
that the detail level in open street map

00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,760
is now so high

00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,560
uh that i think in uh in cologne for

00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,720
example

00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,480
there are not so many of these vending

00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,320
machines that you can map anymore

00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:49,440
because they are already

00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,000
yeah yeah amazing what people are

00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,440
mapping

00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:56,000
back to map um so

00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,040
you've uh you're now documenting the

00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,800
wiki a lot and

00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:03,199
updating that would you say your local

00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:05,199
area cologne is it is the map complete

00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:07,279
there

00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:08,720
of course of course it's not completely

00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:11,839
mapped i think that's

00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:15,199
impossible but uh

00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:19,040
we have um a lot of uh

00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:22,079
very very ex er yeah extreme mappers

00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:24,079
uh here in my region is for example one

00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:27,360
that's uh called the trostova

00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:30,480
uh yeah um and he's i think mapping

00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,160
every day and uh his uh yeah his

00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,959
district or his um yeah

00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,360
his town uh is already mapped with all

00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:39,360
the

00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:42,399
uh lam lamps um in the streets and

00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:44,320
everything so and

00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,079
of course he's also mapping a lot in

00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,120
cologne and especially in the district

00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:50,480
where i live

00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,680
um so of course there's always something

00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,320
to do

00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,600
every day i think a shop in a big city

00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:59,120
like cologne is closing

00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:01,360
and another was opening so um or

00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,880
some opening hours changed but yeah it's

00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,959
uh

00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,000
at the moment it's not so interesting

00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:09,360
anymore for me

00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:13,440
uh to map so i'm more uh thinking about

00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:18,800
um yeah the um uh yeah organization

00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,800
and uh yeah doing there a lot of things

00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:26,160
um yeah so that's great thanks uh

00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:28,160
for answering those questions here um

00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,320
and it's good to have an insight uh for

00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:36,000
me to see further the uk

00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:38,560
to germany um say thank you

00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:10,079
conferences going on

00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,959
um use the different social media and

00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:13,839
the chat

00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:16,160
features just to talk to people

00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,839
particularly following a talk would be

00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,839
good

00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,839
um

00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,039
for a long time or just anymore

00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,640
there's lots of interesting questions

00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:42,320
you can ask and chat to people

00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:44,559
um and as i said um

00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:47,039
lockdown can be more relaxed for

00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:50,080
different places for me in person

00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:51,679
um some of those events the big ones the

00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,799
local ones will

00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:56,720
start scanning um but yeah if you want

00:17:54,799 --> 00:18:01,039
to start from the station

00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,039

00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,720
people

00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:29,840
as the conference continues on as well

00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:29,840
oh thank you

right thank you gregory ian

00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:51,440
and hannah for that

00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:55,600
interview that those two interviews

00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:56,160
um the situation on the pad in terms of

00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,039
questions

00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:01,200
is sort of developing into details of

00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:03,840
the map in cologne

00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,520
because uh you mentioned that anna

00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:09,039
someone would like to know

00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:11,039
whether there are lots of cell towers

00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,799
mapped in cologne and whether they are

00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,880
disguised and

00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:17,120
whether there are deletion wars where

00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,520
some people delete stuff that they found

00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,640
find unnecessary maybe you can sort of

00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,960
just

00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,679
say a few words about your mapping

00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,240
experience in cologne as a very densely

00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,919
nuts

00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:33,760
city yes so of course it

00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:36,400
is very densely mapped it's uh yeah

00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:38,320
it has more than a million um yeah

00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,360
people living there so there are a lot

00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,400
of details

00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,960
um i think the house numbers and streets

00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,160
they are

00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:50,000
um yeah they are complete uh

00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:53,840
in cologne it's uh at the moment uh the

00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:57,520
local government is starting using

00:19:53,840 --> 00:20:00,160
openstreetmap as their database

00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:02,159
and they are uploading also a lot of

00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:06,240
poes and stuff

00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:08,640
they need for their maps and um

00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,640
yeah so it's it's very high densely

00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,760
mapped um

00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:16,559
i i don't know about uh cell towers

00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:21,280
and something like that so yeah i

00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:24,480
haven't looked this up

00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:26,080
yeah i think that's the situation in

00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,559
cologne at the moment

00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,200
there's another question that deals with

00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:32,559
your work

00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:35,039
in the hostess board um it's

00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:35,600
by an irish member who says that they

00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:39,120
have

00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:41,760
just created an organization themselves

00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,679
and i would like to hear about the

00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:46,960
german local chapter how

00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:50,000
actually what the board of directors do

00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:52,720
and how how the breakdown is between

00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,760
practical work and project planning in

00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:58,960
the board of fosters

00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:02,080
um so we have a

00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,400
bot consisting of four members so we

00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,520
have

00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:07,120
the head the second of the vice

00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:10,320
president

00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:14,080
the treasurer and mia is the secretary

00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:16,240
and um i think so of course we

00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,200
are organizing a big conference at the

00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:21,440
moment

00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:24,720
we are thinking about having

00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,919
more than 600 people for the next

00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:29,760
conference so this

00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:33,520
is taking a lot of work during the year

00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:37,200
we also organized two hug weekends

00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:37,840
that's of course us also something that

00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:42,320
takes

00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:45,360
a lot of time and i think

00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:46,080
besides this activities uh we are

00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:49,840
working

00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:53,360
um yeah let's say a lot of

00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:56,799
stuff that is coming up um so

00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:57,360
we are um we are more focusing i would

00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:00,720
say

00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:04,640
on the um uh yeah for

00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:07,760
um yeah on the work um yeah

00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:11,919
um on the organizing work so there's

00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:15,280
uh i think not so much uh

00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:18,480
practical it's more writing emails and

00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:22,000
uh we also have our own uh

00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:24,799
micrograms programs that also

00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,799
take some time

00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,039
right there's another question that has

00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,919
come in

00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:33,600
um because you you in your previous

00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:35,679
answer you mentioned that

00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,600
uh that the local government is actually

00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:41,520
using open treatment data

00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:44,640
um there's a question that asks whether

00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:46,880
they are using osm uh in a in a

00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,240
cadastral sense or whether they still

00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:52,320
have their own

00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:55,919
more precise holy government data

00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:59,120
um so at the moment um they still have

00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:02,240
uh their own uh database um but

00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:06,480
for roads and buildings uh they are

00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:09,440
they want to use only openstreetmap

00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,720
because they notice that the data is uh

00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:14,880
yeah is better

00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:18,080
um than their own uh their own database

00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,799
and uh at the moment um there there is

00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:22,000
this uh

00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:25,760
big process um that they are adding

00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,919
uh some uh yeah some roads and uh some

00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,640
tags uh that are missing for them so

00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:31,679
it's

00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,799
a lot of very special um taggings uh

00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:36,000
that they are um

00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:39,600
doing there um for example

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,559
um there was some issue a couple of

00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,919
months ago

00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:47,039
uh with um graveyards and how to

00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:50,159
um how to map the ways and parcels uh

00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:53,120
there on this yacht uh there um

00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:54,799
which is an open street map uh not not

00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:57,360
tagged because um yeah

00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:58,480
you just yeah it's the just say it's a

00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:01,919
gravel road

00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:04,480
and um yeah so but i

00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,520
think uh when i'm right they are

00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:09,039
thinking about

00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:11,120
uh uh yeah um going

00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:12,720
open street map only for roads and

00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:15,520
buildings quite soon

00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:17,120
uh i think they before corona they were

00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:22,240
thinking about this year but

00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:22,240
i don't know uh how it is at the moment

00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:27,760
right going back to to the interview

00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,720
that you did with

00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:32,400
with gregory um and this is actually a

00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,120
question to both of you to hannah and

00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,679
ian

00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,159
um are there any things that that you

00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:38,720
kind of

00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:39,440
felt that that would have been obvious

00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:43,279
that he should have

00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,919
asked but hasn't uh that you would like

00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:46,159
to add

00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:47,760
to the questions that he went i mean

00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:49,600
that's for both of you that's

00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,600
a little bit in the past that you

00:24:49,600 --> 00:25:01,840
recorded these things but

00:24:51,600 --> 00:25:01,840
there anything you would like to add

00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,840
okay

00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,320
which was about what's the most

00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:25,360
interesting thing you've seen

00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:28,080
uh which we should say that i think

00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:29,120
uh there's there's some things which i

00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:33,760
ended up doing

00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:36,159
um especially in the um the the

00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:38,080
mafuto there was a there was a military

00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:40,880
base in the middle of town

00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:42,000
um and this i mapped all all the

00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,520
buildings all the

00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,440
all the roads all the entrances all this

00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,400
business and um then afterwards i

00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,320
thought

00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,000
perhaps i shouldn't be doing this maybe

00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,520
it's a bit sensitive but then i think

00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,559
someone else went in and blanked over

00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,520
the whole lot of it but i didn't

00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:55,840
remember what i've done

00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,840
so it's

00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,080
of the difference between

00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:11,840
people with money

00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:25,440
um and only you know

00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:27,440
one or two comes away

00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,799
there were people living in the side of

00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,279
the road and these and i thought that

00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:33,440
was quite

00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:34,960
uh a kind of poignant thing it

00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,360
made me think of the relevance of

00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,880
mapping and putting people on the map

00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:41,279
and in whatever their circumstances

00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,279
could be

00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,720
maybe that's a question

00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,360
very good so i'd say we

00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:52,080
i'd say we closed this now there's a

00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,799
couple

00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:57,520
more questions about the details of the

00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:59,760
postures organization on the path but

00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:01,200
i think crosstast releases yearly

00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:04,320
reports even in

00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,520
english so uh probably not something

00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,559
that we need to

00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:11,440
discuss in this session um

00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:12,960
i'd like to thank all of you gregory ian

00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:16,240
and hannah

00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:18,240
to have the stamina to to

00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,520
still be available at this time of the

00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:23,360
day

00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:26,640
and i'd like to close

00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:35,840
this first saturn 2020 day

00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:35,840
with that thank you and bye bye

00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,679
