	https://media.ccc.de/v/sotm2020-4350-the-map-in-360





Mobile mapping is the process of collecting geospatial data from a mobile vehicle using a 360º camera, laser scanner, GPS/IMU positioning system, and other sensors. Mobile mapping is a time and cost-effective way to conduct asset inventory, monitor road infrastructure, and map street furniture. However, the high cost of acquiring mobile mapping equipment, such as professional 360° cameras and laser scanners, inhibit the ability of local OpenStreetMap communities to leverage mobile mapping technologies. With advice from Mapillary, low-cost devices that are accessible to communities make mobile mapping possible on a wider scale.

360º cameras may be used in different vehicle types: cars, bicycles, quad bikes and also on foot. With a 360º field of view, these cameras capture everything around the sphere. Where flat frame images can limit the map editing workflow, 360º images bring panoramic viewing to OpenStreetMap editors for a more comprehensive understanding of the space and place. The Mapillary photo overlay supports panorama view on OSM ID Editor and JOSM.

After images have been captured and uploaded to the web, Mapillary creates a reconstruction of the scene in 3D using an open-source Structure from Motion library (OpenSfM). This helps to improve the image GPS positions, based on the overall consistency of the 3D scene. Next, the objects in the imagery (such as traffic signs and other types of objects) are identified by computer vision. Combining detections of an object in several images and the aforementioned 3D model allows us to calculate the position of the detected object in the world. 

Overall, this talk will examine the recommended 360º cameras, discuss data collection and benefit of street-level imagery collection with 360º cameras, review strategies for uploading 360º images, comparing different 360º camera models, and highlight how OpenStreetMap communities around the world are using 360º images to improve local maps with Mapillary.

hello everyone

00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,280
i'm side from mapuri in this talk i'm

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,039
going to talk about

00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:20,320
alternative approach to mobile mapping

00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:23,039
which is the map in 360.

00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,680
this springs operation to use 360 images

00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,519
which can be accessible on id editor

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,640
or mapreduce and plugin for

00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:32,960
openstreetmap community

00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,160
before moving to topic i'd like to

00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,280
simply

00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:39,360
explain what's mapley platform mapping

00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,920
is a street level imagery platform that

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,120
scales

00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:46,239
and automates mapping mapping exact data

00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,920
still needs human intervention for the

00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:51,440
verification and validation

00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,440
before adding to openstreetmap

00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,120
mappler is a scalable way to create map

00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,520
data faster

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,680
cheaper than legacy methods and make

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,159
this data available for everyone

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,240
key enabling technologies are computer

00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,560
vision and ai

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,479
what i mean with the legacy solution is

00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,040
the data collection with mapping ones

00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:14,640
and manual map data collection these

00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,080
methods are not scalable

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,920
and not efficient for map data

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,159
collection mapping makes

00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,680
data collection globally scalable and

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,880
automated

00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,960
users can capture images with any camera

00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,680
and map data is generated fully

00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,439
automated pipeline by mapillary this map

00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,479
data is available instantly

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,479
in all integration

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,360
maple derives map data from geotagged

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,320
street level imagery

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,200
and automatically position features like

00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,240
street sign

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,799
fire hydrants street signs and many many

00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,840
others

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:52,560
on the map images upload to maprear

00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,000
initially tag with the gps position and

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,280
time step obtained from

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,520
the sensor of the capturing device

00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,040
after upload our system generates

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,640
reconstruction of the scene

00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:08,239
in 3d using multiple overlapping images

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:10,560
in the same location open source

00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,520
structure from motion library is used to

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,920
build

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,000
these 3d models from the overlapping

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,319
images

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,120
next our computer vision technology

00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:21,840
identifies

00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,680
object in the imagery using object

00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,319
detection algorithm

00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,879
combining detection of the objects in

00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:29,440
several

00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:31,120
images and the 3d model allows us to

00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:37,840
calculate the position of the

00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:37,840
detected object in the real world

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,000
mobile mapping is the process of

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,440
collecting

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,519
collecting geospatial data from mobile

00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,879
vehicle using various sensors such as

00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,720
360 camera

00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:55,200
laser scanner gps imu positioning system

00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,879
and some other sensors this is one of

00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,480
the most time and

00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,239
cost effective methods to collect

00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:03,599
geospatial data

00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:06,800
but it's required expensive equipment

00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:07,599
and managing and processing its data is

00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,599
quite

00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:14,720
difficult and also for the sometimes

00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:16,319
you need manual uh annotation for the

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,200
street level

00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:22,480
uh imagery in order to extract map data

00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,239
from the street level imagery

00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,920
the most important advantages of mobile

00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,280
mapping you can generate map data with

00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,200
high accuracy

00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,879
and attach wide range of sensors like

00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,840
lidar radar

00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,840
to mapping one

00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:39,519
the mapping 360 literally is generating

00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,560
map data from 360 imagery

00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:46,000
and enriching openstreetmap

00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:49,440
and equipments are low cost

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,080
and it's very easy to upload 360 imagery

00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,519
and it require very short processing

00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,000
time

00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,519
and you can keep your data update

00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,840
periodically

00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,840
and maple extract map data for you

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,920
flat frame image can limit the map

00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,720
editing workflow

00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,239
360 images bring panoramic viewing to

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,640
openstreetmap editors

00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,479
for more comprehensive understanding of

00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:20,079
the space and place

00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:22,079
it's no surprise 360 images

00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,600
and high precision positioning capture

00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:27,040
images truly increase

00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,560
map data accuracy and 3d reconstruction

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,720
abilities

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,120
instead of capturing a frame of street

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,080
level imagery in different direction

00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,360
360 camera can capture an entire scene

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,840
simultaneously

00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,800
it saves time and energy for data

00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,560
collection

00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,240
mapley recommends these following

00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:50,000
cameras which

00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:53,919
price range starts from 200

00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:58,960
to 5000 on the first one you have

00:04:53,919 --> 00:05:01,840
lg 360 cam which is around 200

00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:04,479
and the gopro fusion one of the most

00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:07,840
used one from our community

00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:11,039
and the gopro max and also you can see

00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:13,520
instead pro 360.

00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:15,120
360 street level imagery provides more

00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,360
comprehensive understanding

00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,960
of the map space and more accurate

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,320
machine generated map data for

00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,320
openstreetmap community

00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:28,160
we're also testing nozek 360 camera

00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,039
which is dedicated to street view

00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,400
capture with

00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:34,240
real-time kinematic gps we have already

00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,840
some images from prague

00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,840
and i would like to invite you to take a

00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,840
look uh 360 carriage in prague

00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:45,039
there are also some great multicam

00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,800
setups on mapleri with setting

00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,400
regular cameras in for a different

00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,759
direction and

00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,479
mapre app web app gives you smooth

00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,960
transition

00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,080
when you are panning uh to another

00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,199
direction

00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:02,800
as you can see on the left left

00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:04,840
gif uh you can pan different direction

00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,560
and then it gives you very smooth

00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,960
transition

00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,240
in this setup for sony hdr action

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,720
cameras are used

00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:15,680
but this can be replicated with any

00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,680
other action camera

00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,639
so let's talk about uploading workflow

00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,840
for 360

00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,560
images uploading 360 images can be

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,720
sometimes

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,000
challenging based on which camera you

00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,120
are using

00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,759
after capturing 360 images these images

00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,639
need to be stitched before uploading

00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:38,319
garmin virb

00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:42,080
and gopro max do stitching on device

00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:45,199
so no need to stitching before uploading

00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:48,160
however gopro fusion and

00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,360
some other 360 cameras might not have

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,639
this capability

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,160
stitching on device so these

00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,800
images need to be stitched before

00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,599
uploading once you completed stitching

00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,039
process

00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:05,039
you can easily upload those images using

00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:08,160
web uploader mapping tools or

00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:10,800
mapping desktop uploader and

00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,680
with the mapper desktop uploader you can

00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,319
basically just

00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,800
drag and drop all the files on the

00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:19,599
desktop uploader and desktop uploader

00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,599
going to do the job

00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:34,960
uh this is mappilyweb app interface

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:38,800
where you can filter 360 imagery

00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,759
as you can see there no white carriage

00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,880
of

00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:47,120
360 imagery

00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:50,720
so if you have any 360 equipment

00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:53,759
you can easily use map360

00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:56,560
uploading workflow and bring your images

00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,560
to mapillary

00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:04,400
here we have uh id editor

00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,680
interface i would like to show you where

00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,879
you can

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:12,800
uh enable mapping

00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:15,199
imagery overlay here as you can see

00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,479
you can enable maple overlay and then

00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,680
you can also

00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:23,199
filter flat photos and panoramic

00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,199
photos on id editor

00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:29,360
we have also mappery josem plugin

00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,760
you can use street level imagery and map

00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:37,839
extracted map data

00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:40,800
uh on josem the latest version of

00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:42,000
maple plugin you can filter username and

00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:45,680
organization

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,640
also you can see you can filter

00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,279
start and ending date of the imagery and

00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:53,040
then

00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:54,560
also how fresh you want to use this

00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,800
street level imagery

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,560
as you can see this filter on the right

00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:01,440
side of the screen

00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,240
and uh in the upcoming session upcoming

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,120
version of

00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:07,279
mapreduce and plugin we are going to

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,839
support 360

00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,839
viewer as well

00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:19,120
so these are available data

00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:22,320
on mapillary and you can see all the

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,600
available data on openstreetmap open

00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,560
request

00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,120
and then traffic signs are already

00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,160
available

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,839
globally so if you would like to map any

00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:36,000
of those features you are

00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:39,920
welcome to send requests on id editor by

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,240
filling up the form and we are happy to

00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,480
enable those map features for your local

00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,480
map

00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:52,959
also i would like to share some of the

00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:56,000
accuracy comparison uh

00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:58,240
from different devices we have done some

00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,399
we have done some field testing to

00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:03,920
investigate the impact of

00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:05,600
capture equipment on generating map data

00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:08,079
we capture images in the

00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,120
same area with various cameras here you

00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:12,079
can see the

00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,200
list and we compare positional

00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,600
accuracies

00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,760
and positional queries are determined by

00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,079
comparing mapper generated generate map

00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,800
data

00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,600
in ground truth as you can see in the

00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,760
list

00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,360
in the table map data can be generated

00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,000
with 1.2

00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,600
meter positional error which is

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,480
satisfactory for

00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,120
enriching openstreetmap and all this

00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,920
data

00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,360
needs humor intervention before adding

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,079
to openstreetmap

00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,440
so extracting map data helps editors to

00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:44,839
save time

00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:47,839
and energy during the map editing

00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:47,839
workflow

00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,480
now let's talk about some of the common

00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,600
use cases

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:58,959
how community use 360 images

00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,959
for mapping efforts

00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,200
are there diversified examples of

00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:06,240
mapping 360

00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,760
to enrich openstreetmap in the community

00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,160
we are going to highlight different use

00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,480
cases shortly at the following

00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,200
one of the most common use cases mapping

00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,640
cycling

00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:19,440
cycling infrastructure the first example

00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:21,839
is capturing 360 images to map cycling

00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:25,519
infrastructure in france to improve

00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:28,120
cycling routability in france by geovelo

00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,839
definitely recommend you to check out

00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:33,680
jovelo.fr

00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:37,040
the website for the inspiration and

00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,839
diabolo is one of the contributor to

00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:42,160
mapluri

00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:43,440
and then he has extensive 360 imagery

00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:48,079
coverage

00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:51,519
in france and there is another example

00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:52,720
one of the community member capture with

00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:56,160
the gopro vision

00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,519
in rural area for mapping utility poles

00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:01,519
to understand

00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:04,959
where power lines are

00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:10,079
built also to find the shortest way to

00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:13,600
build a fiber optic infrastructure

00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:17,120
and here you can see walkthrough

00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:20,160
of how you can use mapleri

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:24,480
map extracted feature and 360

00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:27,200
imagery for mapping utility poles

00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,240
map3map features helps you to show where

00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,760
the possible

00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:34,959
map feature is located and then

00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:39,120
here you can use 360

00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:42,320
imagery for validating if this

00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:46,399
object is exactly there

00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:49,200
and then after you can easily map this

00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,200
utility pole

00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,079
here you can see how 360 and maple

00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:56,800
generated

00:12:54,079 --> 00:13:00,560
map data can help map editing workflow

00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,560
and save time and energy

00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,120
and another great use case of 360 street

00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,160
level

00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:12,560
imagery poi viewer

00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,360
this tool is developed by tan crew one

00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,720
of the

00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,880
metric contributor from japan this tool

00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:22,160
gives you a better understanding of

00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:23,920
pois on openstreetmap currently it

00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,720
doesn't support editing

00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,760
and contributing openstreetmap but there

00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,600
is a tool

00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:33,680
there vista for editing openstreetmap by

00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,560
using

00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:38,160
level imagery there are also some other

00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:41,120
cool imagery use cases

00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,639
from mapley community and i would like

00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:46,639
to invite you to take a look at

00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:50,639
our blog where you can see more cases

00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:53,120
where our committee is 360 images

00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:55,199
so thank you for listening in this talk

00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,079
uh we reviewed the workflow of data

00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:59,519
collection

00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:02,880
with 360 cameras and how to upload

00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:04,639
360 street level imagery to mapillary

00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,560
and compare the impact of different

00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:10,000
camera models in terms of

00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:12,160
map data extraction and also

00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,720
i share some of the good example of

00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:17,040
using 360 images

00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,279
i hope this presentation may inspire

00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:22,800
some of the openstreetmap communities

00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:25,360
to coordinate their uh own street level

00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,800
data collection and then improving their

00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:30,399
local maps

00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:33,519
thank you thank you

00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,519
cool and you're live

00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:38,720
okay okay thank you i hope you enjoyed

00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:40,160
this presentation from syed

00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,000
so i will be reading some of the

00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,720
questions i have in the past

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,920
so the first question i have is what are

00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,560
you most excited

00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:51,040
about now that my pillary is part of

00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,040
facebook

00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,000
hey we don't hear you say it

00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:01,360
say it i think you're in it sorry

00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,440
yeah yeah hello everyone thanks for

00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:06,320
watching my presentation

00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,440
uh when it comes to a question so i'm

00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,839
really excited that

00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,920
uh maple joined facebook and most

00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:14,560
importantly facebook build

00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:16,160
great tools for a mapping community like

00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:19,839
rapid editor

00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:21,760
and also developing machine generated

00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:25,199
web data by

00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:27,519
validating this data but

00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:28,959
thanks to community so i think

00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,519
developing better tools

00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:33,360
for the community uh with using ai and

00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:36,320
machine generated tools

00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,920
uh will uh scale up uh mapping efforts

00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:41,279
globally in the world

00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,680
i think mapler will be also great tools

00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,959
to

00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:49,120
validating machine generated data

00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:49,120
so that's really excites me

00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:56,079
ah thank you said uh so i have uh let's

00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:59,360
see i think it's more like a

00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:00,720
comment and this it says uh one should

00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,440
mention a problem with

00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,600
armshare mappers use photos without

00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,759
having all knowledge of the place

00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,680
you can demotivate local mappers and

00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:12,320
write them away from osm

00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:14,800
if the armchair mappers use outdated

00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,800
photos

00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,120
why they didn't mention this in your

00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:22,000
talk

00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,040
yeah that's a great input so definitely

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,399
like

00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:29,440
we rely on local

00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,320
mappers contribution but still state

00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:34,399
level imagery

00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:37,440
uh can be great tool and also we are

00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:39,279
informing users that so these are

00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,519
the street level imagery which are

00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:44,720
captured during the specific date

00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,279
so if you have better information about

00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,800
this

00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:49,120
place locally so please just ignore and

00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,120
map

00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,759
according to your local knowledge but

00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:57,360
it's always better than having data

00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,360
than having nothing on the map

00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:05,039
okay thank you

00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:06,559
hi guys if you think and you need more

00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:07,760
clarification in any of the questions

00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:10,160
please feel free to add

00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,799
in the past i will be reading the path

00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,640
over

00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:18,400
this q a session so another question i

00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:22,079
see here is uh are there any downsides

00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,079
to be part of facebook

00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:26,480
uh it's actually too early to um comment

00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,200
uh

00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,840
for this question it's very early and we

00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,520
just

00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:36,400
joined the facebook so so there is one

00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:38,240
concern we hear from the community

00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,360
regarding privacy so

00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:44,320
we will do our best to improving

00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:46,080
and respecting privacy and complying all

00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:49,200
the gdpr rules and

00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:52,799
that kind of stuff that kind of stuff

00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:55,840
so but it's too early to talk about this

00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:56,720
at the moment okay thank you so i have

00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,600
another question

00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,559
it says uh is it possible to increase

00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,840
the position

00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:06,640
of the photos using the elements present

00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,640
in the photos

00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,240
um this is not very clear why do you i

00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,120
don't know

00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,880
if yeah this person can a little bit

00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,320
clarify the question

00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,559
yeah and also they'll have the name of

00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,559
the of the people writing in the past so

00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:22,000
uh could the person uh of this question

00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:24,640
would elaborate a bit more

00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,600
so we can have an answer from syed

00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:29,039
please

00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:32,240
that would be great yeah also i'm more

00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:35,440
happy to have a question on

00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:38,320
my you know presentation

00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,280
rather than on the current news so this

00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:43,760
will be more

00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:46,320
productive discussion

00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,960
okay there is one person writing a

00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,120
question

00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,360
one second because this person haven't

00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:56,480
finished yet one moment please

00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:59,200
yes sure

00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,240
okay so the question is uh can we remove

00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,840
our photos

00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:07,200
now so facebook can have them

00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:10,160
uh yes sure uh the community reserves

00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:12,240
can request deletion by contacting the

00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:15,039
support at mappler.com

00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:17,679
and then within a following week so we

00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:18,559
will remove all these uh images and all

00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,360
the

00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:23,360
metadata which are stored on mapping

00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,200
cloud

00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,880
okay thank you and i see another

00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,600
question here are there

00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,400
any plans to include point clouds for

00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,360
example

00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,360
lidar data

00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:40,480
um actually like we have um

00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:43,280
open source library open structure from

00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:46,880
motion where community members

00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:50,480
can generate their point clouds from the

00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:53,760
imagery uh which are exist on mappilory

00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:56,960
but at the moment uh as far as i know

00:19:53,760 --> 00:20:00,240
uh there are no plans for uh having

00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:02,880
a lighter support in our platform

00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,799
but we are happy to hear more feedback

00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,000
regarding supporting lighter so if there

00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:08,559
will be any need from

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,280
openstreetmap community by using lighter

00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:11,600
data

00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,640
so really appreciated to hear this

00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,520
feedback

00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:17,360
uh and then bring this discussion with

00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:20,559
the team and the production team

00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:22,960
product team

00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:24,080
i think you said so there's still a

00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:29,280
couple people

00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:29,280
writing questions so let's see uh

00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:36,400
one moment please yes sure

00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:48,640
okay uh i think the person who uh asked

00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:51,919
before about the position of the photos

00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:55,440
right now it's terrifying yeah

00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:57,600
okay perfect uh so again the question uh

00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,559
so we have the full context uh it says

00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,400
uh

00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:02,159
i have you here but here i have my other

00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,559
computer within the question

00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:06,000
so don't worry that's that's all i'm

00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,280
chatting or doing something else okay

00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,760
i'm reading here

00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:11,760
okay it says is it possible to increase

00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:14,960
the position of the photos

00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:17,360
using the elements present in the photos

00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,360
the clarification is in the sense of

00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:22,559
creating a photogrammetric

00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:24,559
approach with a 360 images to create

00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:25,919
a point cloud that's the complete

00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:29,520
question

00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:32,640
uh yes this is uh some of the

00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:35,679
product which which we were working on

00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:38,159
but at the moment like there are no

00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:39,520
option where you can measure uh or

00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:43,600
having a height of the

00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:45,679
element uh in the photo so but

00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,960
feel free to develop your own point

00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,880
cloud using open

00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:51,280
structure from motion and then i know

00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:54,640
like there are a couple of developers

00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:56,080
from community they are um visualizing

00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,799
360 imagery

00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,520
and open street map data map data and

00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,840
then

00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,640
where there are also some options some

00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,720
um

00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,000
a prediction about the height but at the

00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,919
moment like uh

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,880
mapleri doesn't have any product where

00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:14,080
you can measure height of the element

00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:16,400
if i get this question clearly

00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,360
but uh one thing which i would like to

00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,760
clarify

00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:22,480
so we are already using this photo

00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:25,600
photoremetric approach while we are

00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:29,360
generating uh map feature data like

00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:32,400
if they're overlapping images

00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:33,760
by using this over overlapping images we

00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,679
generate a 3d

00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:38,320
reconstruction of the area and then

00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:40,640
where we extract map data

00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:42,000
so i hope uh this helps for this

00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,000
question

00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,120
yeah perfect thank you thank you so i

00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,159
have more questions now

00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:49,280
uh i also have uh two comments uh

00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:52,000
related to

00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:54,240
the question before regarding if people

00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,200
can remove the photos from another

00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,640
facebook uh

00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,559
so they can have them so there are a

00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,720
couple comments uh the first comment

00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:02,240
says uh facebook could use them before

00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,720
they acquire mobility

00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,840
because you granted an open license and

00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,760
the second comment is

00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:10,159
this will be a silly thing to do as a

00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:12,320
granted an open license that's so

00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:13,360
no question just comments i mean that uh

00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,679
yeah

00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,720
so i just want to highlight our

00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:19,280
commitment to

00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,320
openstreetmap so our commitment as a

00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:23,039
mapley will be

00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:25,039
stay still remaining the same and the

00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:27,679
data will be available publicly

00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:28,720
so no one needs to worry about uh if

00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:30,880
this data will be

00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,960
gone somewhere so this data will be

00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:36,159
still open and accessible

00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:39,760
by anyone publicly

00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:42,080
with the open license okay thank you

00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,039
uh okay another question will be uh is

00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,720
there any plan

00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:48,720
to snap photos to highways uh

00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:48,720
semi-automatically

00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:56,559
um i don't know like as far as i know

00:23:52,880 --> 00:24:00,720
um i mean we had an approach to

00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:02,960
uh fleet um in back so i don't know like

00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,159
uh what will be the future approach to

00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:07,440
snap photos

00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:09,919
to highways automatically but this is

00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,640
uh definitely like um i mean would be

00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:14,080
great like

00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:16,480
instantly um imagery will come into

00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,679
mapli platform and then maprey could

00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,720
manage to extract

00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:21,600
map data uh more frequently than the

00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,240
data

00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:26,960
which is generated will be much more

00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:29,919
fresh so this is very well deserved but

00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,559
uh we don't have any plan at the moment

00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:32,480
like

00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:34,000
to snap photos uh to highways

00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,880
automatically at the moment

00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,760
okay so i was in my knowledge so okay

00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,080
all right

00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,799
okay uh we still have some minutes uh so

00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,720
i will

00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:44,880
take uh probably two more questions and

00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,400
then if we don't answer everything here

00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,919
maybe they can contact you directly

00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,559
because we have a net stock

00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:51,120
in a bit more than 50 minutes okay yeah

00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:54,559
sure

00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:55,200
so um my email was in the presentation

00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:58,400
but i can

00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:00,960
uh still um share my email here

00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,240
so site mapping.com feel free to reach

00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:05,440
me out also you can

00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:08,480
reach me out on twitter um handle

00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:10,240
as trucks over so feel free to reach me

00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,240
anytime so i can

00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,840
do my best to help you thank you let's

00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,440
go for two more questions and then we

00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,679
close uh this path

00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,279
uh are the computer vision models you

00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:21,120
use open source

00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:23,520
uh this person said would love to try

00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:26,720
them out

00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:30,720
um actually i'm not very closely

00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:34,000
working with the computer vision team

00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:37,600
but definitely like the extracted data

00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
is completely available so this person

00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,159
can

00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,840
reach out the computer vision team for

00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:45,120
accessing

00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:48,400
the according to his needs

00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:49,200
or her needs so we have a computer

00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,760
vision

00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,960
uh team and i can also share their

00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,279
contacts with you

00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,159
for further further discussion but we

00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:58,960
are

00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:00,480
supporting any kind of uh research in my

00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,720
knowledge so

00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,600
they will be happy to help help them out

00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:07,520
to

00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:10,320
if there be any uh development uh plans

00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:12,159
okay perfect thank you uh the last

00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,200
question uh what are the most

00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:16,960
comfortable

00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:19,760
effective 360 camera setups for hiking

00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,240
uh capturing imagery on trails or pads

00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:24,159
if there are

00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:28,000
any um yeah i could uh

00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:31,039
definitely suggest uh garmin verb 360

00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,520
or gopro max or gopro fusion so they are

00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:35,679
quite

00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:39,200
light cameras and uh with the decent

00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:42,320
uh power um power adapter

00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:45,679
uh portable power so they can

00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:48,640
go very long uh capture time so

00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:49,679
they can be very comfortable for using

00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,679
during the hiking

00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:54,240
so while you're hiking probably you want

00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:57,679
them to be light and you can just

00:26:54,240 --> 00:27:00,559
uh not attach them to your um

00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:01,520
your back so these cameras can be

00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:04,000
considered

00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,880
for hiking as well like garmin burp and
