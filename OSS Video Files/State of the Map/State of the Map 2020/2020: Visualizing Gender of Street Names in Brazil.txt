How I used OSM data to visualize gender disparity in street names for all of Brazil. The result shows how women are underrepresented in street names in the country, and raises questions on who is chosen to be commemorated in street names.

Using OSM road data and a database of gender popularity for names, I created a map visualization to show gender disparity in street names in Brazil. Streets named after women represent only a small proportion of the streets in Brazil. This proportion is even smaller when we consider the length instead of the number of streets.

In Brazil, streets are typically named after prominent historical figures, including politicians, business people, military, religious figures, artists, and academics, among others. The small representation of women among these reveals who is chosen to be regarded as prominent, and thus commemorated in a street name, and who isn't. 

Another interesting aspect is that the map allows up to see certain areas and neighborhoods where female street names predominate. Upon quick visual examination, these appear to be usually in neighborhoods at the periphery of large cities. More in-depth research could indicate if there's a spatial pattern here and if it is related to other social phenomena.

The interactive map was based on the Road Orientations Map by Vladimir Agafonkin. I used Mapbox and mbtiles for the map visualization. To process the source data, I used Geofabrik extracts of OSM data and Postgres / PostGIS scripts.

The interactive map is here https://medidasp.com/projetos/genero-ruas/#12/-23.5617/-46.6469 and the github repo is here https://github.com/bplmp/genero-ruas-mapa

very first is by Bernardo rail so Sao

00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:20,779
Paulo and he works as a data journalist

00:00:17,849 --> 00:00:23,279
data analyst that was more company there

00:00:20,779 --> 00:00:26,609
has been using Open Street Map for quite

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:31,800
a while and he is now going to talk

00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:35,070
about gender of street names of gender

00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:47,190
of people who are used in naming streets

00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:49,710
all over Brazil hi I'm Bernardo Laura

00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:52,100
and I'll be presenting visualizing

00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:57,629
gender of street names in Brazil and

00:00:52,100 --> 00:01:00,420
state of the map 2020 so first a little

00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:03,930
bit about me I am an urbanist

00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:07,320
by training I'm also a data analyst and

00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:09,780
developer and most of my projects are at

00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:13,619
the intersection of these fields so

00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:17,189
anything dealing with urban issues also

00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:20,670
data data visualization and mapping as

00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:24,149
well it's where I like to do my work

00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:29,280
I am the founder of Modena Sao Paulo

00:01:24,149 --> 00:01:33,450
which is a data vis lab here in Sao

00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:37,130
Paulo Brazil where I am from and today

00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:40,469
I'll be talking about street names in

00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:45,450
Brazil my home country where I'm talking

00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:47,280
from also so I know this may be

00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:50,159
different in other countries but streets

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:53,460
in Brazil are often named after people

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:58,319
usually historical figures and these

00:01:53,460 --> 00:02:00,659
people have genders so just to give you

00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:04,409
a little background on how street names

00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:06,450
are chosen in Brazil usually cities are

00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:08,910
responsible for deciding street names

00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:12,569
and I'll bring up the example of some

00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:14,550
Paulo but it's probably it's quite

00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:17,040
similar in other cities so in Sao Paulo

00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:19,250
that is the City Planning Office that

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,620
decides the city

00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:24,080
council members and citizens can make

00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:27,980
suggestions when there's a new street of

00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:30,320
what name that should be given if it's

00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:32,540
free is named after a person it doesn't

00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:34,640
have to be as we'll see but if the

00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:37,430
street is named after a person that

00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:40,430
person has to have died you can't name

00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:44,000
the street after someone who's living

00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:46,850
still living and if you were to make a

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,550
suggestion of a person to name a street

00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:52,430
after you need to take that person's

00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:54,020
death certificate so you need to make

00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:56,410
sure I mean let them know that they

00:02:54,020 --> 00:03:00,440
actually died and bring the small

00:02:56,410 --> 00:03:04,670
biography to the city and that biography

00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:07,220
gets attached in an archive to that

00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:11,150
street ease name definition so you can

00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:13,700
always go back and check why what was

00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:18,260
the biography of that person who's being

00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:20,989
celebrated in that street name so here

00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:24,860
is is an avenue in San Paulo called

00:03:20,989 --> 00:03:27,110
Avenida Brasil so Brasil Avenue as I

00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:29,660
mentioned they don't you don't have to

00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:32,120
name a street after a person this is a

00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:35,090
pretty common name for streets in Brazil

00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:40,190
you see many Brazil avenues and many

00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:41,959
cities across Brazil this is another

00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:46,250
interesting example

00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:51,100
so this elevated highway was used to be

00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:56,690
named after a general who was a military

00:03:51,100 --> 00:04:00,739
dictator and just recently it was that

00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:04,160
the name was changed to president a

00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:08,180
president Ron Goulart who was the

00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:13,360
president who was thrown out of power by

00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:18,169
the military coop so yes it's it's not

00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:20,570
common but street names can change and

00:04:18,169 --> 00:04:24,650
then the city has this website where you

00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:26,690
can look up the history of the person

00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:28,610
like I mentioned that small biography

00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:31,060
and here they talk about when it changed

00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:34,310
in 2016

00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:37,129
because it was a change from the

00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:40,189
military dictators name who committed

00:04:37,129 --> 00:04:43,520
crimes human right crime so they

00:04:40,189 --> 00:04:46,009
actually got to change that name and

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,199
just a few more examples so this is

00:04:46,009 --> 00:04:50,449
Anita Garibaldi Street and he's like

00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:54,620
everybody was a woman

00:04:50,449 --> 00:04:59,599
and a revolutionary then there's another

00:04:54,620 --> 00:05:03,020
smaller Street here the doctor glad to

00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:04,879
Joe country so she was the first that's

00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:07,340
what the biography says it's a small

00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:12,889
street but she was the first nurse to

00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:16,550
get a PhD in Latin America and then here

00:05:12,889 --> 00:05:20,419
we have another street Virginia of this

00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:23,089
de Miguel a small street in the east

00:05:20,419 --> 00:05:25,370
side of San Paulo and the biography is

00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:27,610
interesting it's a little more prosaic

00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:29,779
so not always they have to be like

00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:31,879
historical figures but it could be

00:05:29,779 --> 00:05:34,310
someone who was important to the

00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:38,240
community where the streets at so it

00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:42,259
says here Virginia was born October 24

00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:45,349
1929 teen 25 in the city of dion montina

00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:47,479
Minas Gerais outside of Kampala she

00:05:45,349 --> 00:05:50,360
moved to this region and lived there for

00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:53,270
over 20 years where she had an excellent

00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:57,319
heart and always helped the the neediest

00:05:53,270 --> 00:06:01,310
and she distributed food medicine and

00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:04,729
clothing and she died in 1966 so you see

00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:07,099
not always you have to be like a

00:06:04,729 --> 00:06:10,839
notorious historical figure it could be

00:06:07,099 --> 00:06:14,629
someone who's relevant to that community

00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:16,699
so anecdotally I knew that women were

00:06:14,629 --> 00:06:19,279
underrepresented in Brazilian street

00:06:16,699 --> 00:06:21,830
names but I wanted to be able to

00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:24,560
quantify and to visualize this to prove

00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:27,979
this point with data and with

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:31,370
visualizations so for that I needed the

00:06:27,979 --> 00:06:33,589
data basically what I needed was the

00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:35,960
geometry so the the drawings were on the

00:06:33,589 --> 00:06:39,500
streets in Brazil I also needed the

00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:42,169
names for the streets and I needed to be

00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:43,969
able to attribute to determine a gender

00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:47,209
for a Brazilian gift

00:06:43,969 --> 00:06:50,629
name which is not as easy as it sounds

00:06:47,209 --> 00:06:54,349
as we'll get to that just to give you a

00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:58,429
quick sneak peek the final result looks

00:06:54,349 --> 00:07:01,939
something like this so here we have on

00:06:58,429 --> 00:07:05,599
the left the streets in Brazil that are

00:07:01,939 --> 00:07:09,409
named after someone who was female in

00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:11,959
the center for males and and in the

00:07:09,409 --> 00:07:14,629
right hand side streets that are not

00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:16,519
named after person so that there are no

00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:21,019
gender or at least we couldn't create a

00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:22,909
gender so bringing it back to the data

00:07:21,019 --> 00:07:26,649
so where could I get all the geometry

00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:29,709
and all the names for streets in Brazil

00:07:26,649 --> 00:07:33,439
and here is where OpenStreetMaps

00:07:29,709 --> 00:07:38,089
OpenStreetMap comes in so if you go to

00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:39,619
open street map you can see you know

00:07:38,089 --> 00:07:42,709
here an example we're looking at a

00:07:39,619 --> 00:07:45,139
street in Sao Paulo the geometry one of

00:07:42,709 --> 00:07:47,389
the parts of it is highlighted and on

00:07:45,139 --> 00:07:49,610
the left you can see the tag with the

00:07:47,389 --> 00:07:51,529
name of that street this this street was

00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:55,339
named after a person called Theodotus

00:07:51,529 --> 00:07:57,199
umpire so it's hua street the other

00:07:55,339 --> 00:08:00,259
awesome pile so here I can get the

00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:03,259
geometry and the name from OpenStreetMap

00:08:00,259 --> 00:08:06,139
so that's two parts of the data I needed

00:08:03,259 --> 00:08:11,899
and the other part was how do I

00:08:06,139 --> 00:08:15,009
attribute this name to a gender and it

00:08:11,899 --> 00:08:17,509
turns out you know this there's not a

00:08:15,009 --> 00:08:20,869
definite answer to that's not a you know

00:08:17,509 --> 00:08:26,179
you you can it's uncommon to you know

00:08:20,869 --> 00:08:28,249
for example have a man named Maria but

00:08:26,179 --> 00:08:30,889
it is possible so this is not perfect

00:08:28,249 --> 00:08:34,279
but we could use Brazilian census data

00:08:30,889 --> 00:08:37,779
to look at popularity of names by gender

00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:37,779
and and that's what I did

00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:42,979
so yeah this doesn't achieve perfect

00:08:40,819 --> 00:08:48,110
results but it's good enough for this

00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:50,629
purpose so the the Brazilian census has

00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:53,949
this website where you can look up your

00:08:50,629 --> 00:08:56,569
name and you can see how popular it was

00:08:53,949 --> 00:08:57,190
across decades so how many people were

00:08:56,569 --> 00:09:00,149
named

00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:03,730
the same name across decades and it also

00:09:00,149 --> 00:09:07,449
you can look at rankings of name

00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:10,990
popularity by gender so we see here that

00:09:07,449 --> 00:09:14,620
Maria was the most popular name in the

00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:17,079
latest census 2010 followed by Anna then

00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:17,850
Francisca then Antonio so on and so

00:09:17,079 --> 00:09:20,889
forth

00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:22,930
so this this was the data I need it

00:09:20,889 --> 00:09:26,259
because you know if I could have the

00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:29,589
popularity I could compare say Maria how

00:09:26,259 --> 00:09:32,769
many person female persons are named

00:09:29,589 --> 00:09:35,379
Maria and Brazil versus male and whoever

00:09:32,769 --> 00:09:39,550
the most popular was I would say that

00:09:35,379 --> 00:09:42,160
that's the gender for that name but I

00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:46,199
needed to download this data and this

00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:49,480
wasn't available on the website but as

00:09:46,199 --> 00:09:53,259
you know it frequently is you can

00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:55,600
usually look what kind of requests the

00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:58,839
website is doing and find where that

00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:01,720
data is coming from so I actually found

00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:05,230
that this was taking those data it was

00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:07,800
consuming it from an API so if you've

00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:10,810
ever done something linked around with

00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:15,670
Chrome Google Chrome's or any other

00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:17,560
browsers network tab you can see that I

00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:19,540
will see what kind of requests your

00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:22,329
browser is making as its loading the web

00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:24,670
site what kind of data it is pulling and

00:10:22,329 --> 00:10:27,819
here you can see that actually that

00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:32,769
popularity ranking is being pulled from

00:10:27,819 --> 00:10:35,829
an API and this is this is the data I

00:10:32,769 --> 00:10:37,930
needed right so the name the frequency

00:10:35,829 --> 00:10:41,110
how many persons were registered with

00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:45,309
that name and with that specific gender

00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:47,740
so F for female and for male so

00:10:45,309 --> 00:10:50,170
basically what I did to get this data

00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:52,350
they didn't set any limits on this API

00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:55,240
so I could just download everything

00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:59,259
transformed into a CSV file which I

00:10:55,240 --> 00:11:02,050
open-source put it on github and so you

00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:03,970
can see they're the same data in a CSV

00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:09,490
file format which is easier for people

00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:10,070
to use so that's the last part of the

00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:11,720
data

00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:16,190
so with this I could attribute the

00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:18,440
gender for given names just you know

00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:20,329
just a making small parenthesis here

00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:22,759
this data have been used in other

00:11:20,329 --> 00:11:25,459
projects beside this one so an

00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:28,459
interesting project was this one where

00:11:25,459 --> 00:11:30,680
the researchers looked at the share of

00:11:28,459 --> 00:11:34,959
properties and Sao Paulo there are more

00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:37,699
owned by women and you can see that in

00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:40,190
the center this is this map that shows

00:11:37,699 --> 00:11:42,350
the municipality the city of San Paulo

00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:45,500
towards the center of the city the share

00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:47,300
of women owned properties is greater and

00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:50,360
towards the outskirts it gets smaller

00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:53,089
and smaller where the income is also

00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:55,399
lower and if there have been other

00:11:53,089 --> 00:11:58,069
projects that uses this data that I

00:11:55,399 --> 00:12:00,680
scrape it's a census database but I

00:11:58,069 --> 00:12:02,329
scraped it and other people might not

00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:04,579
scrape that using their own means

00:12:02,329 --> 00:12:06,560
anyways but just thought that this was

00:12:04,579 --> 00:12:11,420
interesting what other kinds of projects

00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:13,490
you could do with this okay so now we

00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:18,850
have the data now what's the process of

00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:24,920
turning these data into a visualization

00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:28,010
which for my purposes was a map so first

00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:29,720
I needed to download the OSM data I'd

00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:33,290
gotten the census data already

00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:35,360
I needed to from the OSM data to clean

00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:38,420
the street names so I needed to remove

00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:41,050
street types from the name so anything

00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:44,029
that started with Street Avenue alley

00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:47,089
highway I needed to remove that so I

00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:50,300
would get the next thing and determine

00:12:47,089 --> 00:12:53,839
if that's the first name so you know if

00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:57,380
it was rua my RIA something I needed to

00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:59,720
take the Rua out the street out and just

00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:03,589
look at Maria and then tell if that's me

00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:05,420
or a female I also had to remove titles

00:13:03,589 --> 00:13:07,689
and professions so you know maybe you

00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:11,930
have a street that's called rua

00:13:07,689 --> 00:13:16,430
professor maria something and i needed

00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:20,269
to remove that or use that to determine

00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:21,779
the gender then with the first name

00:13:20,269 --> 00:13:23,970
extracted

00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:27,540
join that to the census popularity data

00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:31,439
determine if it's male or female export

00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:33,839
this database and visualize it - just to

00:13:31,439 --> 00:13:36,689
give you a quick look again a sneak peak

00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:38,639
on what the result looks like this is

00:13:36,689 --> 00:13:42,329
the city of Sao Paulo and the streets

00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:47,129
are collared here by gender so red is

00:13:42,329 --> 00:13:49,740
female blue is male grey is no gender

00:13:47,129 --> 00:13:54,959
and white is missing data as streets

00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:57,990
that didn't have a name filled out yeah

00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:59,910
so back to the process how to do this

00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:03,079
so the first step like I said was

00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:07,920
getting the data I used geo fabrics

00:14:03,079 --> 00:14:09,930
extract so they'll generate extracts

00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,730
from osm data there are other many other

00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:14,339
ways of downloading it with some data

00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:16,559
but I found this to be the easiest for

00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:18,660
me because I could get just all the

00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:23,509
streets for Brazil and one go this was

00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:28,110
very handy so yeah Thank You Gia fabric

00:14:23,509 --> 00:14:30,089
then to clean the names and do the

00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:32,910
joining and do all the processing I

00:14:30,089 --> 00:14:35,759
loaded the OSM data into a database

00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:39,500
intuit Postgres database and this is

00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:44,040
just a SQL script that you know takes

00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:47,129
removes the street type looks at if

00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:51,870
there's a profession there like dr.

00:14:47,129 --> 00:14:57,120
something and and does that part of the

00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:59,670
of the data cleaning and then the next

00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:02,399
part joining it to this is to the census

00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:06,689
data and and basically saying well if

00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:08,189
there are more more people more women

00:15:06,689 --> 00:15:10,350
named maria than men

00:15:08,189 --> 00:15:12,860
then I guessed his name is female than

00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:16,529
this street called Maria something is

00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:20,819
named is female was named after someone

00:15:16,529 --> 00:15:23,910
with a female name like I said there

00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:25,800
there there many possible issues with

00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:28,410
this approach some you know some streets

00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:30,389
you determine as being a gender and then

00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:32,970
you look at it in detail you see they're

00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:35,130
not named after a person I'll get into

00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:38,370
that later but it's good enough for

00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:40,860
this is again so has the data cleaned I

00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:44,940
had a general tributed and then I

00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:50,190
exported this to a Geo JSON using OTR to

00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:52,560
ogr and I had now a really big geo JSON

00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:59,640
that I wanted to visualize it on a map

00:15:52,560 --> 00:16:02,400
so I use it MB tiles for this NB tiles

00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:04,620
are basically well ways of tiling map

00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:09,290
data and it's good because it's really

00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:14,370
compact so there are essentially a SQL

00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:18,090
database and and then I used this tool

00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:24,770
by map box to turn the geo JSON into MB

00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:27,720
tiles so I had it ready to visualize and

00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:31,500
do an interactive map and I decided to

00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:35,430
use matte box and mostly because I saw

00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:37,590
this map done by this map Hawk show by a

00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:42,030
flat mirror arc funkin called road

00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:44,370
orientations map where you'll see this

00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:47,880
is New York and on the top right hand

00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:49,560
side it's showing the orientations of

00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:51,600
three two if they're north south east

00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:55,410
west and i found it really interesting

00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:58,770
that that chart got updated very quickly

00:16:55,410 --> 00:17:01,620
based on the data you see on the map so

00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:07,589
I was like oh maybe I can use this to

00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:09,510
display Street lengths so in my map

00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:11,459
which you see though of our chart on the

00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:14,880
right which updates when you move the

00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:18,720
map shows the the lengths of streets you

00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:20,459
are seeing grouped by gender so back

00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,520
here you know we're looking at mostly

00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:26,189
blue there because it's mostly male but

00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:28,920
if you do zoom on a portion of the map

00:17:26,189 --> 00:17:31,280
that by any chance has more female names

00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:33,990
then you see the bar chart on the right

00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:36,810
updating because now we're looking you

00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:38,970
know mostly at female and so it's it's

00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:42,870
adding up all the lengths of the streets

00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:48,020
that you're looking at and grouping them

00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:52,040
by gender and okay so I guess the

00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:54,320
showing how how I made this and then the

00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:56,809
next question is like what do we see

00:17:54,320 --> 00:18:00,440
what is you know after looking at this

00:17:56,809 --> 00:18:04,160
what conclusions do we get so just just

00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:06,530
for a quick recap the color scheme that

00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:10,760
I chose may be a little bit normative

00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:15,440
but I'm sorry it's rent for female blue

00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:18,559
for male and then gray no gender and

00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:20,420
white missing data right so I'll show

00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:23,030
you just a few examples of things we see

00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:25,400
so here we're looking at some Palo a big

00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:29,270
chunk of downtown Sao Paulo no surprise

00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:32,510
there you know confirming that anecdote

00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:38,150
I anecdotal data I headed that it's

00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:40,340
mostly male this is Rio not very

00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:42,890
different so the proportions let me go

00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:46,190
back quite similar it's mostly male then

00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:50,470
no gender and we had a bunch of missing

00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:50,470
data there but a little bit of female

00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:55,850
yeah and if you hover on the on the bar

00:18:53,179 --> 00:18:57,710
chart you get the sum of the lengths

00:18:55,850 --> 00:19:02,120
you're looking at so how many kilometers

00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:04,580
the streets then you see Belo Horizonte

00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:08,210
another big city maybe is a little bit

00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:10,059
more balanced but there is a thing when

00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:12,530
we look at some of these streets

00:19:10,059 --> 00:19:16,280
many of the female streets are named

00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:18,920
after a female Catholic saints or the

00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:22,640
Virgin Mary or things like so that's one

00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:26,510
thing and we also see those in precision

00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:28,340
so all these feet here are named floor

00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:30,080
which means flour something so there are

00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:33,650
different types of flour but that's also

00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:35,330
a female name so then it gets tricky

00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:37,309
here we can't really say if it was you

00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:40,100
know it definitely wasn't a woman by

00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:41,450
looking at it closely but the method I

00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:44,450
used can't really tell the difference

00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:47,450
here if it's a flower or a person named

00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:50,540
flower right so that's also interesting

00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:52,790
and then we also have like less populous

00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:54,860
regions that are last mapped out with

00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:58,970
with a lot of missing data and put the

00:19:54,860 --> 00:20:00,590
regards to the names and just zooming

00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:01,850
out a bit here where's in the end of the

00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:04,100
state of Sao Paulo and

00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:05,900
we see high weight mostly highways and

00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:10,880
we see that then they're overwhelmingly

00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:12,440
named male right so so so yeah some of

00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:15,200
the results I mentioned the majority of

00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:18,020
the names are male we see many female

00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,610
names from religious figures male names

00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:23,570
have more professional political and

00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:25,820
military titles in comparison many times

00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:27,950
I've seen that the female streets are

00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:29,450
named after women without surnames so

00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:32,840
they're not just a historical figure

00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:35,870
they're just like Street you know Anna

00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:39,440
and and that's it no not necessarily was

00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:41,539
a historical figure and more important

00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,460
streets let's say you know using this

00:20:41,539 --> 00:20:45,620
criteria bigger streets like avenues

00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:48,020
highways have an even smaller proportion

00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:50,740
of female names I'm running a little bit

00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:53,450
over my time here so just to wrap it up

00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:56,210
other things you can do is look at

00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:58,789
differences between cities is a specific

00:20:56,210 --> 00:21:01,970
city more egalitarian look more closely

00:20:58,789 --> 00:21:03,950
at titles in relationship to gender and

00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:07,340
maybe look at relationship to income

00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:09,409
this was just a quick brainstorm here so

00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:11,059
in the end I think that you know naming

00:21:09,409 --> 00:21:13,669
places is like so many things about

00:21:11,059 --> 00:21:15,710
power and this is why this is important

00:21:13,669 --> 00:21:18,860
so I'll close it up with a quote by

00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:22,220
Rebecca Solnit a writer and feminist and

00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:24,770
I'll just read so some women get were

00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:27,590
raised a little time some all at once

00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:29,510
some reappear every woman who appears

00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:31,490
wrestles with the forces that would have

00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:33,500
her disappear she struggles with the

00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:35,840
forces that would talk will tell her

00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:38,090
story for her override her out of the

00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:41,000
story the genealogy the rights of men

00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:43,730
the rule of law the ability to tell your

00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,650
own story in words or in images or maybe

00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:49,789
in the name of the street is already a

00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:52,540
victory already a revolt yeah that's it

00:21:49,789 --> 00:21:55,640
thank you and I hope you enjoy this talk

00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:55,640
[Music]

00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:07,140
right can we proceed with the question

00:22:03,929 --> 00:22:16,440
of the lancers kind of waiting for a

00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:18,390
sign video people okay right so um thank

00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:20,340
you for the talk very interesting the

00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:23,780
first question that someone has asked on

00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:26,490
the head is whether you were aware of

00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:29,220
similar projects that have been done in

00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:32,909
Europe one of those equals chief names

00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:37,409
dr. Russell's the other is one that's

00:22:32,909 --> 00:22:40,470
been done in Serbia the links are in the

00:22:37,409 --> 00:22:43,740
pan have you look at these projects and

00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:45,570
you compared to your efforts I didn't so

00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:49,409
I didn't know about thanks for linking

00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:52,049
and I was looking at them while while

00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:54,179
the stream was going really interesting

00:22:52,049 --> 00:22:56,309
projects similar a similar idea and

00:22:54,179 --> 00:22:58,350
there are some things there like the the

00:22:56,309 --> 00:23:01,679
choice of colors that I liked that

00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:07,830
maybe I should kidding thanks for making

00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:09,990
beads yeah one of these projects the the

00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:15,659
equals tritium stock process project was

00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:17,460
also was using not only looking at name

00:23:15,659 --> 00:23:20,370
trying to look at the names but actually

00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:23,730
trying to link the OpenStreetMap data

00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:26,370
with wiki data and therefore arrive at a

00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:30,330
more precise result is that something

00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:33,419
that you have thought about yeah that's

00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:35,039
that's interesting because then we could

00:23:33,419 --> 00:23:37,640
fix some of these imprecisions

00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:41,520
that I talked about in the presentation

00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:43,919
like sweet that's named flower and

00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:47,700
that's actually not the name but a type

00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:49,799
of flower so that that's great idea of

00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:53,130
moving this forward and getting more

00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:58,200
precise and on attributing to actually

00:23:53,130 --> 00:24:00,419
real people there's one question about

00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:05,520
your you know kind of hacking way of

00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:07,419
arriving at names by simply scraping the

00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:11,960
API

00:24:07,419 --> 00:24:14,270
the census authority and there's

00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:16,280
questions about the legality of taking

00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:19,820
that data and saying okay now open

00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:25,250
source have you looked at the license it

00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:28,789
was under originally I didn't I'm not

00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:32,020
sure if they had but the I I think the

00:24:28,789 --> 00:24:36,350
thing is this is public data this is

00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:40,880
data that has been collected with public

00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:42,799
money the census they open up pretty

00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:46,010
much all of their data that is anonymous

00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:48,770
and this is this is pretty anonymous so

00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:51,679
I didn't feel I didn't have any concerns

00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:53,600
they're doing that but if it was like a

00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:56,780
private company data that I think that

00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:58,549
would be totally different where the

00:24:56,780 --> 00:25:01,280
question actually comes from someone who

00:24:58,549 --> 00:25:03,169
who is from Switzerland and in

00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:05,480
Switzerland they also have data that is

00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:08,390
created with public money but still it's

00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:10,010
not very open source so that made might

00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:12,650
explain the background I'm not familiar

00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:15,710
with the general situation in Brazil but

00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:18,650
if you say that's probably working and

00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:20,659
another question is how there are also

00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:22,880
streets that might also be there might

00:25:20,659 --> 00:25:25,010
only be named after the last name of

00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:28,340
someone and therefore require more

00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:31,400
research yeah definitely that that does

00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:34,850
happen and I think many times that that

00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:38,840
happens there is a title in front of the

00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:41,539
next other question about this I do use

00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:43,580
the title when I have the title I do use

00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:47,360
it to attribute the gender instead of

00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:50,000
the name but yes sometimes you have

00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:53,690
professor and then the last name that

00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:59,270
that is not uncommon so yeah there that

00:25:53,690 --> 00:26:01,370
could be an issue all right next

00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:03,710
question concerns but I think you have

00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:06,140
probably answered that already exactly

00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:07,820
how did you count the streets if

00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:10,309
something have multiple ways and

00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:12,380
OpenStreetMap how did you count it but

00:26:10,309 --> 00:26:14,450
if I understood you correctly you just

00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:17,659
sum the length so you were basically

00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:20,120
about how many meters are there four

00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:27,150
names that are agenda

00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:29,820
yeah exactly so that dad fix the issue

00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:32,490
of not being able to count different

00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:34,200
streets because of the ways there they

00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:36,720
are split like someone pointed out in

00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:41,790
the comments below that's correct

00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:43,710
right did you how long was the computing

00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:47,160
time to actually match up all the names

00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:51,060
in Brazil with the name database for us

00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:54,060
was not in any way significant door yeah

00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:57,720
so I saw that question about how long

00:26:54,060 --> 00:27:00,180
did join took and looking back I did

00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:02,490
this awhile ago looking back on my sq I

00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:05,670
wrote down that it took I think seven

00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:08,370
minutes on my computer and it's not not

00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:11,430
anything special so I wasn't worried

00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:15,990
about making it faster because it was

00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:17,820
something I just did once then but yeah

00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:24,600
that wasn't that that wasn't a big issue

00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:26,910
right kind of reading through the rest

00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:34,290
of the questions there more comments

00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:36,330
than this one that says if you assess

00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:38,970
the quality of this method based on a

00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:42,090
subset with the source of known genders

00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:46,980
like sort of comparing sort of measuring

00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:49,350
the scientific accuracy of I did not

00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:51,030
know I didn't that would that would be a

00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:54,690
good idea actually thought about doing

00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:58,410
that taking a sample and then manually

00:27:54,690 --> 00:28:01,800
checking I didn't I did it kind of you

00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:03,870
know haphazardly where after I did the

00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:05,910
map I went through it I looked and I saw

00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:08,100
if it was completely off it didn't look

00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:10,320
to me but I think you know maybe took

00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:13,710
taking a random sample that would be a

00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:16,200
better way to do it yeah

00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:20,310
and I and I also saw the question there

00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:23,190
about the titles but I think I talked

00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:26,240
about that that I did use the title to

00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:28,560
to determine gender and just on a

00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:31,740
comment on that which might be

00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:32,980
interesting the city of Sao Paulo has

00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:36,429
another

00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:38,769
open data set of street names and in

00:28:36,429 --> 00:28:41,740
that they have a shape file and they

00:28:38,769 --> 00:28:45,220
break up the name of the street by a

00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:47,620
name first name last name title so I I

00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:51,399
could get the titles from there so that

00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:53,649
was a good place to get at like what

00:28:51,399 --> 00:28:59,019
what are kind of all the possible titles

00:28:53,649 --> 00:29:00,639
you you can have for someone named after

00:28:59,019 --> 00:29:03,909
a street and I used that to then

00:29:00,639 --> 00:29:04,779
manually say okay profesor des neige o

00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:07,360
profesora

00:29:04,779 --> 00:29:13,049
is female and and then attribute from

00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:16,509
there when you do have a title right

00:29:13,049 --> 00:29:23,019
there's I think those those were all the

00:29:16,509 --> 00:29:24,730
questions I wonder if you have them this

00:29:23,019 --> 00:29:27,669
one more question less mean struck out

00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:30,159
but I sort of come back to that if you

00:29:27,669 --> 00:29:32,019
did you find any noticeable differences

00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:34,330
between regions you zoomed in to some

00:29:32,019 --> 00:29:37,119
cities in your talk and said that okay

00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:40,419
there's some ratio slightly different

00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:44,499
but is there any systematic difference

00:29:40,419 --> 00:29:46,360
that you could identify I said oh no in

00:29:44,499 --> 00:29:47,259
the noise generally different or

00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:53,350
something like that

00:29:47,259 --> 00:29:56,139
I didn't and again I think this would

00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:58,919
take the effort of be more maybe more

00:29:56,139 --> 00:30:03,039
scientific or more systematic about this

00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:05,409
just by going through the map and

00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:08,409
comparing different cities at the city

00:30:05,409 --> 00:30:10,240
level I didn't see many differences

00:30:08,409 --> 00:30:12,429
looking at major streets either in the

00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:16,840
north to south different regions of

00:30:12,429 --> 00:30:20,950
Brazil but I did see kind of a pattern

00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:24,909
where you would have more female named

00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:28,749
streets in the periphery of many

00:30:24,909 --> 00:30:31,960
Brazilian metropolises which we know

00:30:28,749 --> 00:30:34,360
usually in how Brazilian cities work the

00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:37,960
peripheral areas are poorer than the

00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:39,700
city centre so that's where I put a

00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:41,470
point in the last slide I didn't get

00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:43,720
much into it I thought that was kind of

00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:45,039
lose about income maybe you'll be

00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,670
interesting to look if there was a

00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:48,130
relationship

00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:51,790
but the income of the area if poorer

00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:54,880
areas would have any higher probability

00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:56,140
of having more female streets but again

00:30:54,880 --> 00:31:00,280
that's it that would need some

00:30:56,140 --> 00:31:03,400
additional research reading up on that

00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:08,880
process of the project earlier they they

00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:11,800
also combined that with with some

00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:17,050
political action sort of trying to sort

00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:20,950
of make this make this imbalance public

00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:26,410
and sort of weigh on city officials to

00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:28,710
kind of maybe try and and name a few

00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:32,410
more streets after after women to

00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:34,450
balance this is there any is there any

00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:36,340
movement like this in Brazil that that

00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:38,800
might be able to take your data and run

00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:43,870
with it and say hey let's make a change

00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:46,330
here not not that I know of I mean maybe

00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:50,080
I know they're there people doing

00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:54,220
research like more quantitative research

00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:57,310
on gender and in several aspects of

00:31:54,220 --> 00:32:04,390
society like that other research that I

00:31:57,310 --> 00:32:08,380
showed on property ownership and then

00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:12,790
they're either renaming streets or

00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:17,500
naming new streets more after women but

00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:19,300
that would be definitely interesting the

00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:21,550
thing that has have but one of the

00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:25,090
examples I did show was the renaming of

00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:26,890
a street highway from a general to the

00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:30,760
president that was overthrown by the

00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:34,300
military coup so but that was something

00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:36,100
that was introduced in 2016 in the city

00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:38,980
of Sao Paulo where they actually passed

00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:42,310
a law that you could change the name of

00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:44,650
the street if the person that was named

00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:47,980
after had committed crimes like certain

00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:49,870
types of crimes but I haven't seen

00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:55,020
anything in the in the gender side of

00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:58,919
the discussion okay

00:32:55,020 --> 00:33:01,470
in that case I'd say Thank You Bernardo

00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:03,990
for your talk and being here for the

00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:05,690
questions and answers and I hope you

00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:09,020
enjoy the rest of the conference

00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:09,020
