Crowd2Map Tanzania is a volunteer run crowdsourced project that has been mapping rural Tanzania since 2015.  This talk will give an overview of some of the lessons learnt, particularly in building mapping communities in remote rural areas with first time smartphone users.

Since 2015, we have been adding schools, hospitals, roads, buildings and villages to OpenStreetMap with the help of over 12500 volunteers worldwide and 600 on the ground in Tanzania.  With minimal budget and no staff we have so far added over 4.1 million buildings and trained community mappers in 26 areas of Tanzania.  We were asked to run a mapathon at the United Nations General Assembly in October 2018 and have also been featured in many newspaper articles. 
We have prioritised mapping those areas of Tanzania where girls are at risk of Female Genital Mutilation, FGM, so that activists and the police can more easily find and protect them.  But we have also been working with other community groups and district officials on how maps of their area can help with development. 
The mapping is in two phases – firstly online volunteers trace roads and buildings from satellite images then volunteers on the ground add names of villages, offices, churches, shops and other points of interest using a free smartphone app Maps.Me and we then produce printable maps of villages, wards and districts, and train people about how they can use these maps.  
Training field mappers who have never been online, seen a map of their village, or used a smartphone before has multiple challenges.
This talk will outline some of them, and lessons learnt, and seek to stimulate a discussion from the wider community on sharing good practice and resources in this area.

the next session will be done by Jana

00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:15,900
Chapman from our Jamaat will be

00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:17,640
presenting on their experience in

00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,890
building mapping communities in rural

00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,710
Tanzania she'll be sharing their

00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:25,350
challenges the successes and the lessons

00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:28,560
that have been learned so far and also

00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:30,060
as a lot it will be really good to hear

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:35,430
that since 2015

00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:38,219
proud map has been able to have 12,500

00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:40,340
million shares worldwide with 600 of

00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:43,980
them being on the ground in Tanzania and

00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:46,920
with this huge community they've been

00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,050
able to add 4.1 million buildings on

00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:52,079
OpenStreetMap and they've also been able

00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:55,800
to train community martha's in 26

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:57,660
different areas in Tanzania so as I not

00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,879
have a reminder if you have any

00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:03,000
questions during this session feel free

00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:05,010
to add those on the session pad and then

00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,689
be able to answer all these questions at

00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:14,040
the end so without taking much more time

00:01:08,689 --> 00:01:15,900
Janet can take this away hello my name

00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,820
is Janet Chapman from crowd to map

00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:20,100
Tanzania and I'm talking today about

00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:23,460
building mapping communities in rural

00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:25,909
Tanzania about seven and a half years

00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:28,650
ago I became a project officer and later

00:01:25,909 --> 00:01:32,909
trustee with Tanzania development trusts

00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:36,270
or TDT they this is an entirely

00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:38,610
volunteer run charity they registered in

00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:43,170
the UK that's been supporting grassroots

00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:46,229
projects in rural Tanzania since 1975 so

00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:48,990
we have no staff no offices we don't pay

00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:51,780
expenses when we visit projects and so

00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:55,890
all of the money raised goes directly to

00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:59,310
projects so we support typically rural

00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:03,780
villages in very undeveloped areas of

00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:06,810
Tanzania such as the north the west and

00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:09,869
the south so far from the tourist

00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:12,959
centres of Arusha Zanzibar and

00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:13,890
darussalam so this will be a typical

00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,980
village

00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:18,750
that we support so this is called Zeze

00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:21,990
village I know it extremely well I

00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:25,950
visited it over 10 times now and it's

00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:29,580
near to the Burundi border in western

00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:32,400
Tanzania so before we started supporting

00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:36,090
them people would typically get water

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:38,580
from dried up riverbeds such as here so

00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:44,100
obviously this leads to huge health

00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:48,690
issues so we funded the local community

00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:53,790
to dig for water themselves so that they

00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:56,459
they set up a construction like this it

00:02:53,790 --> 00:03:01,980
took them six days to reach water they

00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:05,300
created a borehole and then they built

00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:07,920
themselves a simple rope pump like this

00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:10,709
which is really excellent for getting

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:13,920
water some of the benefits for a scheme

00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:16,350
like this is that because it's locally

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,420
made it empowers local people to learn

00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:20,549
new skills but also it means when it

00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:26,040
breaks down they can men repair it

00:03:20,549 --> 00:03:28,820
themselves because typically with water

00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:31,470
bore holes up to forty-five percent are

00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:32,750
operational at any one time in places

00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:36,540
like Tanzania

00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:38,790
so we also support income generating

00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:41,459
projects so in a village like this

00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:43,590
people will live beats living on way

00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:45,450
less than a dollar a day so simple

00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:49,680
income generating projects could have a

00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:51,299
huge impact so this is one where women

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:56,540
were supported to start small businesses

00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:59,280
such as in food production as here so I

00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:02,730
since I became a project officer and

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:05,310
trustee I've tried to spend at about two

00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:07,290
at least two months a year in traveling

00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:11,910
around rural Tanzania visiting our

00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:14,280
projects on roads like this so typically

00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:17,760
especially when it rains the roads get

00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:20,430
extremely hard to travel on there's no

00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:23,820
Maps or there wasn't when we started and

00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:26,250
no road signs no streetlights it can be

00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:27,780
extremely difficult particularly wait

00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:29,940
rains because then there is

00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:32,100
the roads are terrible and also that

00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:36,450
there are no people out to ask

00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:40,680
directions so I am in 2015 I was

00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:42,960
visiting this school a condo and it was

00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:45,240
raining couldn't the person I was with

00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,340
didn't know where it was so we drove

00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:50,430
around for two hours looking for the

00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:52,500
school constantly phoning than the

00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:56,010
school phoning us saying where are you

00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:58,710
we're waiting etcetera it was extremely

00:04:56,010 --> 00:05:01,260
challenging and frustrating I live in

00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:02,940
London I'm used to having maps I'm used

00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:04,790
to being able to just put something in

00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:07,590
my phone and know where I'm going

00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:10,710
rural Tanzania it was not like that at

00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:16,350
all so this was extremely frustrating

00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:19,740
for me and them so schools like a condo

00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:22,410
they're in remote areas their students

00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:24,570
walk extremely long distances to and

00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:30,720
from school sometimes up to two or three

00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:32,850
hours each way and they have often mail

00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,729
even have to carry the water that they

00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:38,280
then need to clean their classrooms with

00:05:35,729 --> 00:05:41,370
so extremely challenging circumstances

00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:43,860
and girls in particular have additional

00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:47,970
challenges in that they are put into

00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:50,430
vulnerable situations when those

00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:53,610
students are ill as in here the student

00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:56,580
from a condo is has malaria

00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:59,340
there's no ambulances so the students

00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:01,350
are carrying him up the mountain two

00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:04,830
hours to the hospital here is a school

00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:10,140
here there is a hospital two hours up

00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:13,350
the mountain so acondo school had this

00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:15,380
building which was supposed to be her

00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:17,760
head teacher's house it was unfinished

00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:22,620
they wanted to turn it into a girls

00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:27,180
hostel so DDT funded them to do that so

00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:28,919
now what they now have had a hostel all

00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:32,010
of the girls that came to the school

00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:37,710
that was over 300 girls really wanted to

00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:40,440
stay there there were only 50 places so

00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:41,159
it was very difficult for them to do

00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,439
this

00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:48,239
to decide who should have those places

00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:52,199
so we trained the teachers and the local

00:06:48,239 --> 00:06:54,839
people to actually add where the the

00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:59,339
places where the where the girls came

00:06:54,839 --> 00:07:02,729
from on to the map so they trained the

00:06:59,339 --> 00:07:06,419
local the girls we had a few cheap smart

00:07:02,729 --> 00:07:09,569
phones so they the phone went home to

00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:12,809
with one of the students each day and

00:07:09,569 --> 00:07:16,169
came back and they they had added the

00:07:12,809 --> 00:07:22,080
places in their village so from that we

00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:24,569
were able to how to add add all of those

00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,669
places and create a simple map this was

00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:29,069
the first time the school had any idea

00:07:26,669 --> 00:07:31,319
where the students were coming from and

00:07:29,069 --> 00:07:35,789
how far they were and from that they

00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:38,189
were able to select which students were

00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:40,259
the were the most deserving to come it

00:07:38,189 --> 00:07:43,649
wasn't only based on distance it was

00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:47,519
also based on that their vulnerability

00:07:43,649 --> 00:07:50,789
whether they was single parents families

00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:53,129
etc but distance was certainly important

00:07:50,789 --> 00:07:56,129
and they were really delighted to have a

00:07:53,129 --> 00:07:59,699
map showing where the students came from

00:07:56,129 --> 00:08:01,619
and these are some of those girls who

00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:05,459
were selected with the hostel who were

00:08:01,619 --> 00:08:07,829
delighted to be there was girls have

00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:09,719
additional challenges because they are

00:08:07,829 --> 00:08:14,219
also expected to collect the water

00:08:09,719 --> 00:08:16,459
collect the firewood etc so being in the

00:08:14,219 --> 00:08:18,929
hostel gives them additional

00:08:16,459 --> 00:08:23,300
opportunities to study in the evening

00:08:18,929 --> 00:08:26,129
which they're extremely grateful for so

00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:27,899
rural Tanzania generally it looks

00:08:26,129 --> 00:08:31,110
something like this or it certainly did

00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:34,439
when we started as opposed to Jerusalem

00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:37,229
which looks more like London be partly

00:08:34,439 --> 00:08:39,750
because of excellent efforts by people

00:08:37,229 --> 00:08:42,269
like Romani career and open map for

00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:44,759
development Tanzania that have had World

00:08:42,269 --> 00:08:47,490
Bank money to do a really excellent job

00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:51,870
in showing mapping Jerusalem

00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:54,720
particularly for flood resilience so

00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:58,620
rural Tanzania really needs maps

00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:01,620
and we've been working with many

00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:04,680
different places to help do that and

00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:10,069
this is is a short video showing some of

00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:10,069
the reasons why they do not need maps

00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:29,929
[Applause]

00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:29,929
[Music]

00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:46,080
I've been selling density streets

00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:50,760
especially rural areas this confront

00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:54,800
once as if our stuff to see how to reach

00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:58,440
those girls will be danger villages

00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:01,320
officials can use them up to locate grad

00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:04,080
schools and clinics and the community

00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:06,120
centers are in order to plan for the

00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:10,010
future development of other services

00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,010
that immediately in the community

00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:29,529
[Music]

00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:32,920
we use the smartphone that we have to

00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:36,640
map different areas especially in

00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:40,240
villages where most of vulnerable people

00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:43,839
and groups live there so we managed to

00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:47,470
map different local government offices

00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:50,920
water point operation center and the

00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:51,940
different areas in local villages in

00:10:50,920 --> 00:11:08,539
Samaritan

00:10:51,940 --> 00:11:08,539
[Music]

00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:16,130
thanks to our hotel micro brands we have

00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:18,829
been able to buy phones formatting and

00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:24,050
we have 20 of them a pass in in rural

00:11:18,829 --> 00:11:26,520
areas whereby more than 200 mappers we

00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:32,159
have re trained

00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:32,159
[Music]

00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:38,350
the maps who have produced will help

00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:40,930
activists fighting it here to better

00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:42,910
protect the girls at risky local

00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:46,029
officials took the NSE where schools

00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:47,980
they make if water points in the

00:11:46,029 --> 00:11:51,720
population centers are now in a better

00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:51,720
plan future wishes

00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:55,279
[Music]

00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:11,079
[Music]

00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:13,420
over 120 80 million households on the

00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:16,029
path for the first time and the local

00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:18,790
people in ten years of the lenio now

00:12:16,029 --> 00:12:21,610
have access only and on different maps

00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:26,680
of their villages that they have cleared

00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:31,769
individuals so a Santa's are not hot so

00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:35,490
[Music]

00:12:31,769 --> 00:12:40,000
that was actually quite an old video

00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:43,450
that was from 2017 so since then we've

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:47,490
actually added over 4 million buildings

00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:51,100
now and we have around 14,000 online

00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:51,880
volunteers but the need for maps is

00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:54,579
still there

00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:56,769
so this is an example of maps that we

00:12:54,579 --> 00:13:00,339
want to start creating showing how far

00:12:56,769 --> 00:13:03,089
people have to get through - from two

00:13:00,339 --> 00:13:06,220
water points from health facilities

00:13:03,089 --> 00:13:08,170
typically many of the health facilities

00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:11,740
do not have running water and it can be

00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:13,029
quite a long way from them the village

00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:16,380
that I've mentioned at the beginning

00:13:13,029 --> 00:13:19,540
Zeze they are particularly interested in

00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:22,180
creating a land-use plan this is

00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:24,430
something that is could be extremely

00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:28,300
useful and we're starting to do a joint

00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:32,519
project with the open map for

00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:36,070
development in Jerusalem to pilot a

00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:39,120
cheaper ways to do very accurate mapping

00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:42,430
that will be useful for land cut asters

00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:46,120
but we've as I said we've been training

00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:49,209
people to use map stop me however when

00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:52,240
we first started you this would be a

00:13:49,209 --> 00:13:55,990
typical screen that you would get on map

00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:58,110
stop me so no no roads no buildings

00:13:55,990 --> 00:14:00,310
already added it's extremely difficult

00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:02,980
particularly if you're using a cheap

00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:05,980
smartphone which we are to actually work

00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:09,940
out accurately where your location is so

00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:12,820
we've been recruiting people so now we

00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:15,459
have over 14,000 online volunteers the

00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:17,260
majority of whom have come from un

00:14:15,459 --> 00:14:19,420
online volunteers and other online

00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:21,010
volunteering sites

00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:23,200
they're from all over the world and

00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:25,810
they've been there helping do the

00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:28,330
basemap adding the rows in the building

00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:32,500
so that local people can then add the

00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:34,780
points of interest in their villages so

00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:39,520
this is a typical satellite image

00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:43,450
showing some RAM buildings here that are

00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:45,850
that we're adding so when people sign up

00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:48,430
to our online volunteering we've got

00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:50,530
some very comprehensive instructions now

00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:55,150
because ginger we're doing all of the

00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:57,570
training online so we're also using

00:14:55,150 --> 00:15:01,750
rapid now which is machine learning

00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:06,070
generated roads and buildings to help

00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:09,880
with the mapping and we've got we're

00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:13,480
using the comprehensive tracking Guide

00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:15,760
tagging guide for African roads with

00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:17,500
some pictures to show people because

00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:20,590
many of the people will never have been

00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:23,290
to these areas we have a very

00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:25,360
comprehensive slack channel we have over

00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:28,750
four and a half thousand people in there

00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:32,260
now so when we have new mappers we ask

00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:36,010
them to join the slack Channel introduce

00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:38,200
themselves but then to give ask for

00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:41,850
feedback on their first mapping attempts

00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:44,590
then we have some extremely experienced

00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:46,210
mappers who then give them feedback so

00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:48,730
that they can improve their mapping

00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:52,420
we've also set up a number of online

00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:55,060
tests to help particularly new mappers

00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:58,840
so to it to ensure that they really

00:15:55,060 --> 00:16:01,570
understand how to map well and these

00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:04,450
tests if you get they're full of

00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:07,750
screenshots etc like this one and if you

00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:09,790
get a hundred percent then you can get a

00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:13,120
badge so if you're interested in that

00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:14,410
that these are with we've so far we've

00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,920
done that buildings when we are

00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:19,690
producing the other ones for roads and

00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:25,000
many other things

00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:25,690
as time goes on so we've made huge

00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:32,500
progress

00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:33,250
this is shows an area of weather FGM

00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:37,750
safe house

00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:40,870
is so Google is just showing this you

00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:48,580
can see that the example for from

00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:53,320
OpenStreetMap a huge we've come a long

00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:55,600
way so we have really two mapping

00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:57,670
communities the remote mappers and the

00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,710
community mappers and there are

00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:02,020
extremely different communities and we

00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:04,360
engage with them in different ways so

00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:07,030
the remote mappers generally are very

00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:10,630
educated often you know they're

00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:12,760
graduates they've been using maps all

00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:17,740
that throughout their life so they're

00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:22,810
very experienced in using maps on their

00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:27,189
phones on paper etc they for navigation

00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:29,380
and they generally have access to a

00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:31,030
large range of technology they generally

00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:33,040
have a lot at least a laptop a

00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:37,150
smartphone

00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:41,290
good internet you know in their place of

00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:44,290
work and at home if we contrast that to

00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:46,360
the the community mappers many of them

00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:48,040
did not complete secondary school some

00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:51,310
of them never really went to school at

00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:53,350
all there would have been no maps

00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:56,170
available of their local area so they'd

00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:59,170
been that they haven't used them they've

00:17:56,170 --> 00:18:01,210
never generally most of them hadn't used

00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:05,050
a smartphone or if they had very very

00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:07,540
intermittently very few people had

00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:10,560
access to a laptop or been even been

00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:13,960
online before and access to technology

00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:17,620
access to connectivity is a continual

00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:20,770
problem so many of most people live in

00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:22,810
villages that are outs of mains

00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:27,070
electricity so if they're lucky they

00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:29,770
have access to solar for charging but

00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:31,830
that's generally problematic especially

00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:37,170
during the rainy season

00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:40,090
so and getting online is expensive and

00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:45,240
infrequent so people don't don't have

00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:47,020
the luxury of a connection all the time

00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:49,570
so one of the

00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:52,030
that we've been trying to do to build

00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:55,570
our community over the long term is to

00:18:52,030 --> 00:19:00,580
go to the places like universities where

00:18:55,570 --> 00:19:04,120
people do usually have a degree some

00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:07,710
more access to technology and internet

00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:10,390
usually so but some of the training in

00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:13,450
universities has been more like this

00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:18,070
ie standing at the front with one phone

00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:21,880
very few phones available very few

00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:24,340
laptops etc the Wi-Fi doesn't work often

00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:27,940
the electricity's gone off etc so very

00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:31,600
extremely challenging circumstances and

00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:34,260
when there are laptops the there are a

00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:38,590
few and people have to share and

00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:43,150
generally the the the people have not

00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:46,480
had access to technology all the time so

00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:49,420
you really you can assume that they you

00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:56,020
can't assume that they've well you can't

00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:57,550
assume anything really this is setting

00:19:56,020 --> 00:20:00,600
up the youth map a chapter at the

00:19:57,550 --> 00:20:05,280
Institute of Rural Development planning

00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:09,520
so we asked we were setting up the

00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:10,960
committee so we told them that we want

00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,150
that we should have two men and two

00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,640
women when we asked for volunteers from

00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:17,290
the men everybody put their hand up when

00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:21,280
we asked some volunteers from the women

00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:23,650
nobody put their hand up so it's there

00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:26,800
are very traditional roles gender roles

00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:29,800
in rural Tanzania so you know it takes

00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:32,260
more of an effort to get women to come

00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:33,700
forward eventually women did put

00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:36,370
themselves forward they just needed a

00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:39,880
bit more encouragement and actually when

00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:43,900
they got involved they were actually

00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:45,750
more capable than the men also feel

00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:49,990
sharing equipment this will be a typical

00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:53,590
typical scene so you have a One Laptop

00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:56,890
between five people and of course the

00:20:53,590 --> 00:21:00,890
man has his fingers on the keyboard so

00:20:56,890 --> 00:21:02,840
that and also in

00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:05,510
when we were doing the mapping training

00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:09,470
in the villages generally it was my men

00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:14,450
have much greater access to smartphones

00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:15,320
than women do so when we got the hot

00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:18,620
micro-grant

00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:20,570
into 2017 it did enable us to recruit a

00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:23,300
lot more female mappers for the first

00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:26,230
time because we were able to buy cheap

00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:29,240
$30 smart phones and trained people

00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:32,150
however female mappers in rural areas do

00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:34,070
face additional challenges a lot of men

00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:36,290
told them that they shouldn't be out

00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:38,420
doing mapping they should be at home in

00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:41,500
the kitchen they had quite a lot of

00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:45,410
harassment and threats even

00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:51,320
inappropriate touching and plots to try

00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:53,600
and lure them into remote places but we

00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:55,850
mean the women mappers that we trained

00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:58,820
were extremely passionate about mapping

00:21:55,850 --> 00:22:01,640
that because they saw very quickly that

00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:05,540
mapping was important important to the

00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:09,290
community and it was actually a means

00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:13,580
towards greater gender equality so women

00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:15,470
learning skills about using phones about

00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:20,720
putting their communities on the map

00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:23,330
about being treated equally and one of

00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:25,910
the initiatives that we've been very

00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:28,430
involved in is mapping against female

00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:30,530
genital mutilation and and gender-based

00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:33,440
violence which is very prevalent in

00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:38,150
certain areas and I've done a lightning

00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:42,050
talk around that if you're interested so

00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:43,940
why do women keep mapping in these even

00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:47,360
though that they are subjected to this

00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:49,580
harassment and even danger so they are

00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:53,840
passionate about developing their

00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:55,880
communities and protecting girls from

00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:59,600
female genital mutilation and

00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:02,330
gender-based violence but they also want

00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:04,490
to help other women in their villages

00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:05,840
you know learn some digital skills and

00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:10,550
to be part of change in their

00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:12,980
communities more generally so the

00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:14,450
mapping community can really help this I

00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:16,940
think to

00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:20,270
nice that rural with rural women in

00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:23,630
places like Tanzania faced a lot of

00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:28,850
additional challenges and they do need

00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:31,220
encouragement so no to participate so

00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:34,730
particularly things like women only

00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:36,920
groups role models being mindful of male

00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:40,220
domination in training activities are

00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:43,160
really important and we've really tried

00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:46,190
to map aspects that are of importance to

00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:48,950
women such as FGM and gender-based

00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:54,980
violence but also access to clinics and

00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:58,790
water points but also particularly is of

00:23:54,980 --> 00:24:00,590
importance to women and it would be

00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:02,840
really good I think to have more

00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:06,470
materials on why mapping rural areas

00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:09,620
benefits women and there are additional

00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:12,850
funding needs because women are much

00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:17,260
less likely to have access to technology

00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:21,050
so to help with this we've set up

00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:23,090
digital champions in all 87 villages in

00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:27,260
Serengeti where FGM is a particular

00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:31,880
problem with a smartphone for the first

00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:34,790
time and then they have access to SD

00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:37,880
content on the smartphone which has a

00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:43,160
lot of material around education health

00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:44,840
and FGM so these women digital champions

00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:46,940
are linked together in a whatsapp group

00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:50,210
that enables further training and they

00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:52,970
help they've helped monitor the status

00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:56,030
of women in the village protect any

00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:59,900
girls but they were also responsible for

00:24:56,030 --> 00:25:04,220
mapping those villages and this was part

00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:06,920
of a project called women connect that

00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:09,560
started in 2019 but we're continuing it

00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:11,990
because we recognize the value of this

00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:16,370
despite the fact we no longer have any

00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:19,910
funding so this shows some of the new

00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:21,650
smartphone users in villages seeing a

00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:27,010
map of their village for the first time

00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:28,370
on a phone and we've also been adding

00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:31,780
clinic

00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:35,030
Asians from open government data and

00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:38,180
also using water point location data to

00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:41,000
add village names which is particularly

00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:46,150
useful for Kovac contact tracing but

00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:49,150
also to develop the map so now we have

00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:52,730
almost fourteen thousand volunteers

00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:55,880
online volunteers and we've added six

00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:59,059
point four million edits we were

00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:02,870
recently featured in a podcast if you're

00:25:59,059 --> 00:26:05,540
interested in learning more so we've

00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:08,170
tried really hard to build the mapping

00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:12,740
community in Tanzania Tanzania

00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:14,929
particularly in rural areas so in 2017

00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:18,050
we organized the first stage of the map

00:26:14,929 --> 00:26:20,900
Tanzania so this was held in the

00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:23,270
University of Dar es Salaam and we were

00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:25,940
able to get some small funding to bring

00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:29,140
people from rural Tanzania into

00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:32,330
Jerusalem for this three-day conference

00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:35,360
and also some youth mappers from the

00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:38,420
other East African countries so this was

00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:41,030
a extremely big deal particularly for

00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:42,730
some of these rural mappers for many of

00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:45,530
them it was the first time that they'd

00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:47,630
been to Darussalam it was the first time

00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:49,400
they've been to a university and the

00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:54,740
first time that they've met volunteers

00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:57,650
from overseas particularly and actually

00:26:54,740 --> 00:27:01,580
benefited from some mapping training and

00:26:57,650 --> 00:27:05,120
we would really like to repeat this at

00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:10,610
some point we've also organized open

00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:15,340
data events so this one wasn't 2018 in

00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:19,429
wanza again we were able to get together

00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:21,350
bring some people into into monza to the

00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:27,230
Institute of Rural Development planning

00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:30,890
from remote rural areas and I've met

00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:34,030
many of them prints since and they still

00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:37,730
talk about this it was a very big deal

00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:41,690
and we had an event this year in March

00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:43,730
as well so this is something which

00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:46,519
really helps build the mapping community

00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:51,710
and we thank everybody that helps with

00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:55,730
these activities so we've we've trained

00:27:51,710 --> 00:28:00,289
many people on map stop me and the use

00:27:55,730 --> 00:28:02,379
of maps so we try to retrain local

00:28:00,289 --> 00:28:05,389
government officials that and the police

00:28:02,379 --> 00:28:10,100
so the police particularly liked Maps

00:28:05,389 --> 00:28:11,990
map stop me it helps them to get quickly

00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:15,730
to places particularly in the middle of

00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:19,039
the night the girls at risk of FGM and

00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:20,480
typically they the activists and the

00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:22,129
police will get a phone call in the

00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,929
middle of the night saying girls are

00:28:22,129 --> 00:28:27,590
about to be cutting a buncha Bancha

00:28:23,929 --> 00:28:30,049
village without maps or road signs or

00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:32,389
streetlights it was very difficult to

00:28:30,049 --> 00:28:34,009
get there now they have trained been

00:28:32,389 --> 00:28:37,190
trained in maps taught me and we've

00:28:34,009 --> 00:28:42,350
mapped and those areas it's much more

00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:46,009
easily to find them so here are some

00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:47,570
digital champions and seeing a map of

00:28:46,009 --> 00:28:49,759
their village for the first time and

00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:53,029
adding couldn't those places that are

00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:55,789
missing from the map so having better

00:28:53,029 --> 00:29:01,129
maps as helps protect many girls from

00:28:55,789 --> 00:29:06,279
FGM and we've trained people all around

00:29:01,129 --> 00:29:08,629
rural Tanzania now in 2018 we were

00:29:06,279 --> 00:29:12,580
invited to organize a mapathon

00:29:08,629 --> 00:29:19,669
at the United Nations General Assembly

00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:22,159
found we had marathon events satellite

00:29:19,669 --> 00:29:23,990
events in 60 different countries and

00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:28,000
here are some of them so thank you to

00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:32,360
everybody who helped with that so

00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:36,139
lessons learnt engaging rural

00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:40,070
communities is extremely hard so there

00:29:36,139 --> 00:29:43,700
are issues with almost everything issues

00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:48,129
with setting up the phones with charging

00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:52,730
the phones with access to connectivity

00:29:48,129 --> 00:29:54,919
training you generally have to start

00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:55,520
with quite a low base so you're starting

00:29:54,919 --> 00:29:58,880
the tray

00:29:55,520 --> 00:30:03,670
you know how do you use a smartphone but

00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:08,990
it's extremely rewarding so people

00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:15,080
generally the many of the community

00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:17,330
mappers have not had access to many

00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:19,430
educational opportunities so any

00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:23,120
training opportunities that they get are

00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:26,290
hugely appreciated and although at the

00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:30,200
beginning people found it difficult to

00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:32,390
envisage what the benefits of mapping

00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:34,130
their communities were now they really

00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:37,340
get it and they're very passionate about

00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:41,210
putting themselves on the map women have

00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:45,250
additional challenges and that I think

00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:50,990
should be recognized by the community

00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:53,810
building relationships is key I'm you

00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:57,440
need people you need to be working with

00:30:53,810 --> 00:31:00,440
people who trust you and to build up

00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:03,590
that trust takes time otherwise people

00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:06,650
can't really see we know they they have

00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:10,640
to own the project themselves so this

00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:16,070
for us is a long-term project we're

00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:22,610
going building up the map of Tanzania as

00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:27,190
long-term so please help us we really

00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:31,930
we're all volunteers we have no funding

00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:36,200
but many of us including myself are not

00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:38,740
GIS experts so if you would like to get

00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:42,680
involved those are my contact details

00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:46,030
please get in touch and help us map

00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:48,920
Tanzania thank you

00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:53,750
so we have three questions

00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:56,990
so the first one janet is what happens

00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:59,600
when oral or local tradition the first

00:31:56,990 --> 00:32:02,180
from the national naming convention or

00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:04,370
even databases so in different languages

00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:08,270
collide in spelling or even the whole

00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:09,420
name for example we know enough from

00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:11,370
India the

00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:14,580
spelling of geographic names differs

00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:16,500
between Hindu and Bengali which is

00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:20,370
resolved by the India geographical

00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:25,080
survey by standardizing geographic names

00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:28,620
only in the English language so I think

00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:32,460
you can go ahead and answer that be

00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:34,650
trust thank you Laura and thank you

00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:39,510
Mathias I think who answered they asked

00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:42,080
the question so I believed generally we

00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:45,060
defer to the community mapper so I mean

00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:49,950
there can be many cases where there

00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:52,200
isn't an official name for example for

00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:54,840
roads and so on but there may be a

00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:59,100
locally known name so we would would use

00:32:54,840 --> 00:33:02,190
that but I guess it it does depend to

00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:04,860
some extent on who has added that data

00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:07,110
so if it's official government data then

00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:09,540
it would have come from that source for

00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:12,810
example we I think this was missing from

00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:15,570
the video but we've added government

00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:18,480
data provide health centers and schools

00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:21,360
and so on so that would be the official

00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:24,090
name but when we've trained community

00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:26,600
mappers then they would be potentially

00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:29,820
adding the name that they that they are

00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:31,980
using I don't know if you want to add to

00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:33,720
this Laura because I think this is an

00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:38,340
area that you have a lot of experience

00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:45,740
in and I know Jeffrey has - I don't know

00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:45,740
if he's here I think you're muted I

00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:57,810
think you're fully answered it yeah okay

00:33:53,790 --> 00:34:00,240
so the next question is what do you

00:33:57,810 --> 00:34:03,000
think is the main importance of the map

00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:06,290
to the community is it about choosing

00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:09,390
the map and the data to love before

00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:14,490
development or for visibility to the

00:34:09,390 --> 00:34:17,700
world or for in potential investments in

00:34:14,490 --> 00:34:19,370
the areas that you working in I think

00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:22,560
it's for many things to different people

00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:23,190
so yes I think it is absolutely for

00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,440
those things

00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:27,510
I mean it is about literally putting

00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:31,889
people on the map so that you know

00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:33,270
they're counted they matter so one of

00:34:31,889 --> 00:34:35,669
the projects that we have is

00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:37,859
particularly to help protect girls from

00:34:35,669 --> 00:34:39,869
female genital mutilation which I've

00:34:37,859 --> 00:34:43,589
also done a lightening talk about at

00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:46,109
exactly the same time I think so

00:34:43,589 --> 00:34:48,030
for them it's about rescuing girls so

00:34:46,109 --> 00:34:49,619
it's about finding the places quickly

00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:51,960
where girls are at risk

00:34:49,619 --> 00:34:53,669
I mean maps if you think about for

00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:56,490
yourself you know maps are useful for

00:34:53,669 --> 00:34:58,530
very many different purposes so they are

00:34:56,490 --> 00:35:00,540
obviously vital for navigation they're

00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:02,430
vital to find the people quickly if

00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:06,000
there's an accident or they're at risk

00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:08,310
but they're also vital to have a sense

00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,079
of where the facilities are in a

00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:13,500
community and where they need to be

00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:15,869
developed so for example I often visit

00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:18,240
people like district medical officers

00:35:15,869 --> 00:35:21,329
they generally don't have a map of

00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:23,910
showing where all the clinics are and

00:35:21,329 --> 00:35:25,410
the distribution you know the district

00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:27,270
medical officer won't have a map of

00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:28,890
where all the schools are you know the

00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:32,180
schools won't have a map of where their

00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:35,520
students are coming from so that and

00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:37,410
often if people haven't had access to

00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:40,230
those local maps they don't necessarily

00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:43,290
always know what they could do with them

00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:45,599
so I think for us it's oh this is a

00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:48,270
long-term project about building up

00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:52,650
local knowledge and empowering people in

00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:54,180
very remote disadvantaged areas to build

00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:57,000
up their knowledge so that they could

00:35:54,180 --> 00:36:00,750
start making the decisions themselves

00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:03,619
about what they could use maps for so

00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:06,420
it's an ongoing process I would say and

00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:09,210
thank you to who asked the question and

00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:13,140
we're always very open to talking to

00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:16,109
people about building up good case

00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:18,869
studies for how maps are useful for

00:36:16,109 --> 00:36:21,720
development because I'm not sure that

00:36:18,869 --> 00:36:29,640
there are as many good case studies of

00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:34,170
that as as there could be okay the third

00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:36,690
one is more comments and the person is

00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:40,319
from the University of Chicago

00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:43,980
and here she just says that the project

00:36:40,319 --> 00:36:45,650
is a very incredible project and they

00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:48,839
applaud you for the amazing work

00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:51,540
especially the emphasis on the lives of

00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:54,750
girls that you highlight and that you're

00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:57,720
highlighting the challenges of equipment

00:36:54,750 --> 00:37:03,270
and access to Internet even local

00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:05,400
universities thank you the video cut out

00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:08,640
just as I was getting to the bit about

00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:11,099
girls actually so I was just going on to

00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:13,589
talk about some of the further issues

00:37:11,099 --> 00:37:17,069
for example if there's one laptop and

00:37:13,589 --> 00:37:20,970
agree then the generally the the button

00:37:17,069 --> 00:37:24,240
the male will often have it and the

00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:27,180
issues that some of the women have in

00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:28,800
rural areas being threatened when they

00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:32,510
go out mapping being told that they

00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:35,940
should go back to the kitchen etc so yes

00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:39,140
we absolutely see this project is about

00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:42,390
empowering women when we first started

00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:45,000
we were relying on people mappers that

00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:47,940
had their own phone and which we are

00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:50,310
still predominantly and in rural

00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:54,000
Tanzania very few women have access to a

00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:57,390
smartphone so when we got a micro grant

00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:01,050
from humanitarian OpenStreetMap in 2017

00:37:57,390 --> 00:38:04,109
we were able to buy some cheap $30 smart

00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:06,210
phones that we were able to recruit more

00:38:04,109 --> 00:38:08,339
female mappers which was what we always

00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:13,619
wanted to do and that is something that

00:38:08,339 --> 00:38:16,079
we still wanted to expand upon so and if

00:38:13,619 --> 00:38:16,760
you'd like to get involved please join

00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:21,390

00:38:32,359 --> 00:38:42,210
the second last question is from Greg in

00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:44,520
rural areas the ask desert group is

00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:48,810
asking manager for setting up mapping

00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:49,760
tasks and projects yes we do tasks or

00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:55,220
under tons

00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:59,390
development trust yes I'm so pleased if

00:38:55,220 --> 00:39:01,670
you please go and help map in them if

00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:06,830
you're interested and join our slack

00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:10,970
channel I'll put the link in the pad in

00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:14,150
a minute okay and the last one would be

00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:19,160
do you welcome others from other areas

00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:21,320
to help with their projects very welcome

00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:23,150
I mean most of the remote map isn't are

00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:29,630
from all over the world

00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:32,690
so yes anywhere everyone is welcome okay

00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:35,480
and those are the only questions that

00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:37,700
were asked again apologize for the

00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:41,510
technical hitch that catch this session

00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:44,360
shots but to learn more about crowd to

00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:46,820
map you can be sure to check out crow to

00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:50,510
map on all social media pages and

00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:53,000
Twitter Facebook and Jenna - be sure to

00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:55,190

00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:03,800
session pad that should lead you to

point where it drops so if people want

00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:18,290
to listen to the rest of it okay I guess
