Description: 
	https://media.ccc.de/v/sotm2020-4284-health-facilities-import



The talk is to basically share the experience of working with Imports of Health Facilities in India (OpenGovernmentData). We planned to go briefly through the background of Open GovernmentData and the countries following the OGD, along with the compatibility of OdBL for the datasets they provide to the public. 

The main purpose of the import is to provide accessible data of accurate health care information from the Open Government Data directories for Hospitals, Health facilities, Blood banks, Health Centers and Health Clinics information which can be useful for all the people and also the Humanitarian team in India. 

The primary focus of the talk is the import process from data preparation to the execution which includesImports Guidelines , Data Cleanup, Data transformation, Data Execution. The talk shares the detailed stats of the - Indian Health facilities OSM map data coverage before & after Imports and our survey experience for collecting the health facilities records in our region - Telangana.

We also line up with the Survey experience to collect the Health facilities records and conducted OSM awareness programmes. Conclude the session with the future plan and local community support.

We RMSI Team  is performing the imports of Healthfacilities in India for OpenGovernmentData. We want to share the experience working on our successful imports from planning to importing the data. Also want to share the usage of Open Government Data and the other countries who are following the same. 

In total we have 190k+ records in the datasets which have been provided by the government of India and among them 46k+ are already on OSM. he talk is to basically share the experience of working with Imports of Health Facilities in India (OpenGovernmentData). https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/India_Health_Facilities_Import

let's begin with the goal of the project

00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:45,870
our goal of this project is to provide

00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:48,719
the acute health care information to the

00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:51,510
OpenStreetMap using the India's open

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,340
government data directories which can be

00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,110
useful for the general public and also

00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:58,230

management in India we have three

00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:02,989
different geo coordinator from the open

00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:06,420
government data platform which includes

00:01:02,989 --> 00:01:09,810
hospital directory NIMH has faculty

00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:12,210
directory and Red Bank directory in

00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:14,430
hospital directory we have all the

00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:17,009
private hospitals in India including

00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:21,180

hospitals as well in inhale facilities

00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:25,830
directory we have purely public

00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:28,890
hospitals and the public health care

00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:31,380
centers coming to the bedpan directory

00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:37,650
they have all the dead bank units across

00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:42,030
the country let's entitle the open

00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:44,490
government data the OGD mean the data

00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:49,140
produced or commissioned by the comment

00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:50,970
or Amy convent control entities the site

00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,670
data and Goverdhan

00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:55,590
is Indian government website is a

00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:58,640
platform for supporting the open data

00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:02,100
initiative of the Government of India as

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:05,820
a title it defines the data is open

00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:09,710
which means it is fairly used reused or

00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:09,710
redistributed by anyone

00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:15,890
it's good to know that the open data

00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:18,140
platform is being also offered to the

00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:22,219
other countries and being implemented in

00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:24,950
United States as their data dot-com feel

00:02:22,219 --> 00:02:31,819
other countries including Ghana are also

00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:35,090
powered by the open data platform OGD is

00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:36,920
open data and it allows freely to access

00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:39,200
the government data and share the same

00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:42,829
with other citizen we can say that

00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:45,439
against transparency the open government

00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:47,629
data form is the data to reuse and

00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:50,900
redistribute including the intermixing

00:02:47,629 --> 00:02:52,849
with the other datasets this half should

00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:58,340
write the creation of the innovation of

00:02:52,849 --> 00:03:00,019
the businesses and services we can say

00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:04,459
oh did it supports universal

00:03:00,019 --> 00:03:07,430
participation which means it is about

00:03:04,459 --> 00:03:10,220
making a full read and write society so

00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:12,169
the OTT is not just about knowing what

00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:16,659
is happening in the process of Commons

00:03:12,169 --> 00:03:19,159
but being able to contribute to it so

00:03:16,659 --> 00:03:21,680
every citizen of a country which is

00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:27,530
following open government data can

00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:29,090
contribute to the open data by now we

00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:30,919
have understood that the open data is

00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:32,989
clearly available to everyone to use and

00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:35,629
republish observations without

00:03:32,989 --> 00:03:40,280
restriction from copyright Paden or

00:03:35,629 --> 00:03:42,169
other mechanism of control here on the

00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:46,750
screen you can see the license published

00:03:42,169 --> 00:03:46,750
by the Open Data Government of India to

00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:51,919
improve the map data of Awesome we have

00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,079
collected few of the open government

00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:55,849
data directories which have been

00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:57,409
published by the government with geo

00:03:55,849 --> 00:04:01,549
coordinate data sets of health

00:03:57,409 --> 00:04:04,579
facilities of India these directories

00:04:01,549 --> 00:04:06,889
on the public and private hospitals in

00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:09,500
three different data sets which are

00:04:06,889 --> 00:04:11,509
National Hospital directory being health

00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:14,989
facility directly and get banned

00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:16,789
directories so now let's see the

00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:19,239
structure of the health facilities in

00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:19,239
India

00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:24,810
the health care system in engage

00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:26,610
washstand universal you can see on the

00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:28,680
screen that the indian health care

00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:31,890
system is organized into public and

00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:33,600
private system the public health care

00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:35,550
system is further divided into three

00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,950
subdivision which will be seen in the

00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:39,600
next slide and the private health care

00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:42,690
system is based on the profit and

00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,360
nonprofit organization and this private

00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:47,490
health care system is ranking top 20 of

00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:54,510
the world's countries in its private

00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:55,890
spending and 4.2 percent of GDP now

00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:59,280
let's see the public health care system

00:04:55,890 --> 00:05:01,650
in India in India public hospitals are

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:04,250
also called a garment Hospital or

00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:06,480
southern hospital which are free and

00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:09,990
subsidized for the people who are below

00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:12,780
poverty line additionally for the woman

00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:16,160
and energy people the government has

00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:18,510
given the extra public services the

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,390
Indian public health care system is

00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:26,490
divided into three major levels primary

00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:28,830
secondary intensity happens at the

00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:30,510
primary level the sub centers are the

00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:33,090
first interaction point between the

00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:37,140
primary health care and the local

00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:39,510
community at the secondary level we can

00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:41,160
see the collision centers where the

00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:45,120
facilities run at least to the for

00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:47,070
medical surgeon finally the top level of

00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:50,130
the public care provided by the

00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:52,080
government is attached available which

00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:55,830
consists of government hospitals and the

00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:57,690
government medical colleges where we can

00:05:55,830 --> 00:06:00,210
find a high patient role with all

00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:06,060
medical facilities which is totally free

00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:08,880
of cost now please go into the OSM india

00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:11,160
health facilities import process by

00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,410
following osm important length we have

00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,930
started importing the OGD has facilities

00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:18,090
that dream to open stigma with some

00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:23,550
support of the local community using a

00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:25,890
standard which is on the screen data

00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:27,690
preparation it is the first phase of the

00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:29,880
import process with all the three

00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:31,900
directories from the OGD data sets will

00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:34,210
be divided into smaller data

00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:36,850
based on the states and cities in India

00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:38,860
you can see on the screen the only

00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:41,530
retailer says help before the divided

00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:46,780
into smaller section based on states and

00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:48,940
cities in India then all the records of

00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:51,310
divided state and city wise data faith

00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:54,190
are ensured to be clean before inputting

00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:56,110
into oiseau this is a reoccurring

00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:58,780
process where we ensure to remove the

00:06:56,110 --> 00:07:01,090
invalid values in the data safe like

00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:04,690
clearing the multiple spaces in the text

00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:09,040
in value symbols or it may be the black

00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:10,630
values values with zeros on nez also he

00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:12,340
makes you to remove the duplicates

00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:14,320
record in the data set at the same

00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:18,400
location provided by the open government

00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:20,590
data directories then all these values

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,440
are converted to the proper text then

00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:26,200
finally we convert these OTD attributes

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:28,570
into the OEM compatible tags like

00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:31,139
defining them an ETA on health care tax

00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:33,880
based on the health facility record on

00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:38,950
contact and untranslated attributes to

00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:41,260
respected watson key n values later this

00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:43,860
cleaner files will be loaded into chosen

00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:46,660
to undergo the jaws of validation checks

00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:48,880
then this recourse will be converted and

00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:55,090
saved as a JSON file for further

00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:56,470
execution process data execution this is

00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:58,539
the second phase of the import process

00:07:56,470 --> 00:08:00,430
here we really validate the everyday

00:07:58,539 --> 00:08:02,560
health facility record by verifying the

00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:05,560
existing voice and data to avoid

00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:08,200
duplicate if you find a PA existing

00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:09,669
Hospital at the location we will try to

00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,200
enhance the tank by adding the

00:08:09,669 --> 00:08:16,030
additional information to the health

00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:17,530
facility when we will find that it gots

00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:19,270
we will also make sure to add the

00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:21,190
missing the link we just to the health

00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:24,610
facility quad which is going to import

00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:26,530
and also if the belief which is already

00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:28,990
existing we will improve the geometry of

00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:32,740
the hospital building to the existing

00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:35,380
feature all the input is done using the

00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:39,669
input specific account and also by

00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:41,680
specific change that come in here is a

00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:44,860
clear plan which we following the import

00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,160
process we use a chosen conflation tool

00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:47,079
to

00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:49,629
check the duplicates within the existing

00:08:47,079 --> 00:08:53,199
awesome data and the OGD data recalls

00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:55,209
before you put in the datasets we also

00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:58,959
ensure to run the jaws of validation

00:08:55,209 --> 00:09:00,879
tool on and before every important we

00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,699
will repeat this process for all the

00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:05,379
datasets

00:09:02,699 --> 00:09:10,689
let's see some live examples while

00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:12,610
working with the import process here on

00:09:10,689 --> 00:09:14,889
the screen you can see the announcement

00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:18,310
of the tags of the pre-existing health

00:09:14,889 --> 00:09:20,439
facility we have added that it shall

00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:22,269
have desolated information from the open

00:09:20,439 --> 00:09:26,949
government data type traced to the

00:09:22,269 --> 00:09:29,470
existing hospital building feature tag

00:09:26,949 --> 00:09:31,360
direction we made sure to verify the

00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:34,540
pre-existing health facility they died

00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,819
in Oso and current the tag if required

00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:39,910
based on the type of the health facility

00:09:36,819 --> 00:09:44,319
like clinic or dispensary on a linkage

00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:46,300
or a hospital etc here in this case we

00:09:44,319 --> 00:09:48,850
have corrected a tag of a community in

00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:51,670
the center from amenity hospital to

00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:53,620
healthcare equal to center by adding

00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:58,420
additional information from the input

00:09:53,620 --> 00:10:00,339
data source in this feature you can see

00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:03,310
that we have added the missing building

00:10:00,339 --> 00:10:05,620
feature in OpenStreetMap and also added

00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:10,029
the OGD attributes to the respected

00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:12,160
health facility finally putting the

00:10:10,029 --> 00:10:14,050
health facilities we also make sure to

00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,750
improve the geometry of the existing

00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:18,670
Hospital building feature to its

00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:22,810
building rooftop as per the satellite

00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:24,730
imagery in OpenStreetMap while enhancing

00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:27,069
the high res building were both

00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:29,110
pre-existing and the missing feature we

00:10:27,069 --> 00:10:34,149
confirm them to move to the building

00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:36,699
footprint by inputting the Hospital

00:10:34,149 --> 00:10:38,620
tourism you also use the inner and outer

00:10:36,699 --> 00:10:46,750
multi polygon building relations

00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:48,819
wherever required if you come across any

00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:51,459
pre-existing duplicate hospital at the

00:10:48,819 --> 00:10:54,220
same location we will retain only the

00:10:51,459 --> 00:10:56,079
one node which has more information by

00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:59,020
adding the unique information from the

00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:01,450
other duplicate node then we will

00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:03,970
the other edited information from the

00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:10,180
OGD input data source and some weather

00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:12,250
changes to the wholesome dashed but not

00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:14,530
the least this example shows how we

00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:16,480
enhance the hospitals in terms of

00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:20,730
feature tracing and also you bring the

00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,730
attributes or the tags of the hospital

00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:27,010
we have augment say with some awareness

00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:29,200
program but few of the volunteers and

00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:31,780
the college students across Hyderabad

00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,880
came together to celebrate the geography

00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:37,030
and created new maps using Open Street

00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:38,590
Map here on the screen you can see the

00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:41,200
workshop where the students are working

00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:47,140
in ideas them using the map loaded

00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:49,450
challenges in this program they have

00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:53,110
discuss real-time importance of GIS and

00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:54,880
maps in the world we have explained the

00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:57,660
key role of the Open Street Map in

00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:00,310
disaster management and hot activities

00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:03,280
we also conducted interactive training

00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:05,230
sessions on the OSM editing tool but the

00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:10,990
new Memphis were very enthusiastic to

00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:13,120
learn about awesome along with the

00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:15,910
training session we have conducted the

00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:18,790
hallways of workshop and mafia world in

00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:21,400
this program with the students actively

00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:26,860
participated to quantified osm roads and

00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:28,870
building map data in rural India you can

00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:31,330
see the map relate challenges and the

00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:36,640
pictures of building contribution made

00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:39,010
in this mafia war few takeaways from

00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:40,930
this workshop we can find many

00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:42,790
enthusiasts six students who are

00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:45,150
passionate to map by collecting these

00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:47,770
kind of training sessions or workshop

00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:49,720
these shutters also add a few health

00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:51,790
facilities as their native places after

00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:54,970
knowing the role of the old sim in

00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:56,350
disaster management this workshop will

00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:57,220
increase awareness about the

00:12:56,350 --> 00:13:01,650
OpenStreetMap

00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:01,650
and also increase the contributor to ism

00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:06,340
finally here is a progress for the

00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:08,740
Indian health facility simple process

00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:11,410
till then we have successfully imported

00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:12,910
that 6.1 percent of Indian health

00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:17,590
facilities from positive

00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:19,870
they're tracing to ISM we are very proud

00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:22,300
to show the before start of import and

00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:25,690
the current health facility is a time of

00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:30,150
achievement we feel it's our honor to

00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:30,150
improve the OpenStreetMap data in India

00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:42,370
thank you so much for giving the

00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:46,060
wonderful opportunity to share our

00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:48,010
experiences in the virtual SOT to write

00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:50,740
us please find the contact details on

00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:54,930
the screen see you in the next SOT I

00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:54,930
hope you like decision thank you

00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:48,930
okay thank you so much Sameer for the

00:16:46,529 --> 00:16:52,120
amazing work that you've done in India

00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:53,980
we have a couple of questions we'll

00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:58,630
quickly go through some of them

00:16:53,980 --> 00:17:02,910
so the first time say is the attendees

00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:06,550
is that he or she read somewhere that

00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:09,250
RMS eye uses AI R addressing in mapping

00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:10,929
projects in India is this something you

00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:13,750
want to include in the project to the

00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:17,020
healthcare inputs and if yes how could

00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:22,150
this work actually we are not using that

00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:25,209
for the health facility project okay

00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:35,380
yeah but she is it in other projects yes

00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:40,480
yes you say it's me okay so the second

00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:43,059
question um that in the sense that you

00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:47,520
mentioned converting the satrajit JSON

00:17:43,059 --> 00:17:50,679
before being imported why they do this

00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:53,050
yeah great question so this we generally

00:17:50,679 --> 00:17:54,850
do it or sometimes you will do to one to

00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:57,520
one input where we have to create the

00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:59,590
map Rowlett challenges so the geo just

00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:06,690
inform it is more compatible for the

00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:10,809
creating the map loaded projects okay

00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:13,480
then the third one is how do you do the

00:18:10,809 --> 00:18:16,150
conflation with data that already exists

00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:19,179
in OpenStreetMap to make sure that they

00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:21,280
are not doubles and then how many health

00:18:19,179 --> 00:18:24,640
facilities were already in OpenStreetMap

00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:26,679
before you did the imports and do you

00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:31,570
also look at the health facilities that

00:18:26,679 --> 00:18:33,280
are on OS m but are missing and the does

00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:36,490
that accept that is coming from the open

00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:39,640
from their government and do you also

00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:43,300
check if a facility has been closed or

00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:45,260
is if it's open if its operational or if

00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:47,690
it's not so like do you then

00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:51,980
this letter have more attributes or is

00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:54,919
it just location data good question

00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:56,809
thank you for asking this so let me

00:18:54,919 --> 00:18:58,910
explain the car how we use a condition

00:18:56,809 --> 00:19:01,220
tool so we will be getting the data in

00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:06,110
CSV format where the data and the

00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:07,880
locations in directories where we will

00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:12,770
be using this layer into two different

00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:14,990
layers we will download the existing

00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:17,179
health facilities and laminate equal

00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:19,490
Hospital they turn into ISM and we will

00:19:17,179 --> 00:19:21,320
conflict to compare the existing

00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:25,429
hospital using the coefficient rule in

00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:27,679
jasm and for the second question like

00:19:25,429 --> 00:19:30,559
how many health facilities they are

00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:32,929
already no ism so if we are talking

00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:35,450
about like current data it's about

00:19:32,929 --> 00:19:51,820
60,000 plus hospitals are already

00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:51,820
inputted into essence so any questions

00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:57,980
and something that if not answered is

00:19:54,919 --> 00:20:00,320
someone asked on the same question do

00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:03,290
you look at health facilities that are

00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:05,720
missing on the data set that's coming

00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:07,850
from the government and maybe the

00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:11,750
surface innocent facilities already or

00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:14,030
know a cell so yeah generally we do it

00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:15,950
only in the local like in our native

00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:18,169
places we do that using the macro rich

00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:20,360
challenges we are creating some real

00:20:18,169 --> 00:20:22,460
challenges for the community who will

00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:24,559
add the hospitals based on their local

00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:26,750
knowledge and also coming to the close

00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:28,730
ones we will all any time will be

00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:30,679
downloading the Prairie published data

00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:32,780
you can see in the open government

00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:35,270
arrested every month it will be uploaded

00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:38,000
so we will be comparing only we will

00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:42,200
exclude the data which are already

00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:45,470
closed and then the last bit on that

00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:48,650
question was they also have have more

00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:51,679
like attributes like if facility is open

00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:54,590
enclosed operational and operational

00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:57,510
opening hours and all that do you have

00:20:54,590 --> 00:21:00,120
that information yeah

00:20:57,510 --> 00:21:02,220
the features are very less number of

00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:04,860
feature having these attributes like

00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:07,290
opening us and all so wherever we are

00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:09,300
adding we are adding them but most of

00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:11,960
them are not having these attributes but

00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:14,190
we have the original website information

00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:17,750
hospital information contact information

00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:21,960
email Ares and all these things threads

00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:25,680
so the next question would be how clean

00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:28,320
and reliable and complete is the

00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:33,060
government debt Alec is it up they said

00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:34,770
how recent is it so you see the open

00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:37,350
government data is contributed by the

00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:38,970
citizen husband so you we may expect

00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:41,460
lots of clean you need to be done before

00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:43,620
you are uploading into ism so there are

00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:45,420
lots of invalid values which we are

00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:48,930
putting our efforts to clean all this

00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:51,930
data so coming to the DNA bill we have

00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:53,520
also conducted some survey took to

00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:55,290
verify wherever we have the phone

00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:57,900
numbers as well we are trying to contact

00:21:55,290 --> 00:22:00,810
them if we don't find the proper

00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:03,750
appropriate address so generally we will

00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:05,220
add data to ISM after verifying the

00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:07,290
address based search whatever the

00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:09,330
address will at least try to reach out

00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:11,760
to the street where the hospitals have

00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:14,780
been added so in that case we can say

00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:21,660
the government data is good compared to

00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:23,730
the missing that I know ISM the next

00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:26,370
question you had you had like a couple

00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:29,910
of questions here so the next question

00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:31,950
is asking on how do you match the Indian

00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:33,990
healthcare systems came to the OSM

00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:37,620
sagging skin because the person says

00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:40,410
that in the NN healthcare data set he or

00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:45,300
she found H hundred eight hundred

00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:47,820
hospitals in terms of per district and

00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:50,640
categorized according to bed size but

00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:53,930
when you check on OpenStreetMap they are

00:22:50,640 --> 00:23:00,300
thirty three point five thousand

00:22:53,930 --> 00:23:04,200
facilities using the tag immunity is is

00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:06,360
equal to hospital so he is asking if you

00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:08,280
can elaborate on the description the

00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:11,290
discrepancy between the two data sets

00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:14,290
and the challenges that you might have

00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:20,650
in matching the Indian healthcare system

00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:23,110
data to the ice and flagging system so

00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:25,090
we have using three different facilities

00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:27,130
in in health facilities clearly we have

00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:29,110
the sub centers and the garment

00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:31,600
hospitals so that is the reason you

00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:34,030
might found only the 1800 hospital in

00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:36,880
that directory but these the coming to

00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:38,950
33,000 of hospitals which are taken from

00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:45,730
the hospital National Hospital directly

00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:50,560
from the same OGD site he the person

00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:52,450
also was asking were there any

00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:55,630
challenges that you experienced in

00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:57,850
matching legs because you have this data

00:23:55,630 --> 00:24:00,100
which I health facilities it's so much

00:23:57,850 --> 00:24:02,310
information and then you have or SEM

00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:04,660
where you have to add here to ascertain

00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:08,680
tagging system were there any challenges

00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:10,570
in matching the truth yeah we initially

00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:13,810
faced the challenging to convert all

00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:15,730
this awesome open government director

00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:18,100
attribute tourism tagging schema

00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:19,780
because you can see when you go to the

00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:23,440
blood bank we have the nodal officer

00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:25,570
names and also we can see the phone

00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:28,090
numbers of the nodal officer so we could

00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:30,460
not make a map it because we are not

00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:32,650
sure because the same person is

00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:34,780
allocated to the same unit or not in

00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:37,480
that's those cases we have excluded it

00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:39,790
but the important information like email

00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:42,840
ID or phone numbers and although address

00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:48,160
has been included in this cases and all

00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:50,770
and yeah we did some analysis regarding

00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:54,430
the healthcare access in India like we

00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:56,920
we have tried to contact the government

00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:59,800
officers of older chief executive

00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:01,840
officer of open government data so to

00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:07,960
know the quality of the directors which

00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:11,380
you have them mentioned the next

00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:13,270
question someone is asking if you could

00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:17,530
explain the meaning of the tag

00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:20,830
Healthcare is Center other physicians or

00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:23,650
doctors in them why health facilities

00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:29,310
without doctors included in the input

00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:32,140
and it fears how are they tagged yeah so

00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:34,150
so even the healthcare equal to center

00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:36,370
is a group of it is all the facilities

00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:39,070
also gives a group of medical practices

00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:41,110
as we are working on it to three

00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:43,510
different directories the hospital

00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:46,420
amenities for the hospital is used for

00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:47,920
the big hospitals in India but coming to

00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:49,870
the India we have the same health

00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:52,630
centers where we have a only general

00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:54,670
medical medicine services there we have

00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:57,490
a very limited services and we already

00:25:54,670 --> 00:26:00,280
discussed in the presentation there we

00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:02,560
have three types of government hospital

00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:04,750
approaches there we have only the one

00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:07,510
doctor for one hospital in that cases we

00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:09,550
are using the and equal to center for

00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:11,410
those cases and in the description we

00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:13,150
are mentioning what kind of Center it is

00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:14,890
for example it is a primary health

00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:16,840
center or it's the community health

00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:26,260
center or a sub center something like

00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:28,180
that okay so you know inhale Center we

00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:30,370
have only few physically our doctors

00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:33,550
will be available but not like a big

00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:35,260
corporate Hospital but all this will be

00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:41,980
coming into the government hospitals in

00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:45,310
India okay um so the second last

00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:48,490
question would be have you collaborated

00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:50,730
with health sites that pay off because

00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:54,070
this is something that we saw after the

00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:58,450
coordinating pandemic went the Braja

00:26:54,070 --> 00:27:00,160
tobira we saw that the a lot of inputs

00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:02,070
being done through health it's that I

00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:04,360
also someone is asking if you

00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:07,000
collaborated with this platform or I

00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:09,310
using this platform as well and not

00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,960
actually but initially a few of the

00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:12,370
community member we have when we are

00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:15,970
starting this project they have

00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:17,800
suggested these sites but once we

00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:20,110
uploaded automatically this site is

00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:22,750
taking our data and input into that so

00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:25,660
hopefully our waters of hospitals have

00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:29,160
been added it has been improved and

00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:34,300
benefited to the 19 which has been

00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:37,450
useful in the site right because of time

00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:41,620
will only answer one more question

00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:43,779
and so the person is asking do you have

00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:45,850
any special authorization from the

00:27:43,779 --> 00:27:50,740
government or the Ministry of Health in

00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:55,179
India to include all this data in into

00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:57,190
OpenStreetMap yes we do have like they

00:27:55,179 --> 00:27:58,960
have already posted in the open

00:27:57,190 --> 00:28:01,779
government side that this data can be

00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:04,870
reused and recognition as a as we want

00:28:01,779 --> 00:28:25,899
and this you can see in the license part

00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:28,899
in the same site as saying because of

00:28:25,899 --> 00:28:31,149
time we'll have to end it here and as

00:28:28,899 --> 00:28:32,500
saying thank you so much for presenting

00:28:31,149 --> 00:28:35,200
about your project it's really

00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:38,350
impressive when seeing that huge amount

00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:40,630
of data in tourism because of time will

00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:42,700
not be able to answer any more questions

00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:45,279
but I guess what you can do is you can

00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:47,769
go to the session ID and maybe write a

00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:49,510
few notes and also anyone can contact

00:28:47,769 --> 00:28:52,149
using the detail that you provided at

00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:54,519
the end of your presentation again thank

00:28:52,149 --> 00:28:57,279
you so much and enjoy the rest of the

00:28:54,519 --> 00:28:59,710
conference thank you everyone for

00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:03,929
