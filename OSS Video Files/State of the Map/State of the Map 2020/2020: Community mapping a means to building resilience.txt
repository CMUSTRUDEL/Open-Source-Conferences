The study contributes towards some best practices of carrying out community mapping exercise and, distribution of results freely on OSM and spatial data portal like MASDAP for further studies or decision making.  Thus the study focused on preparing for mapping - what to map, how to map and how to record the data; the mapping exercise itself; downloading and digitizing of data in map production; and how to use the maps to aid in decision making.

The greatest threat to the people, property and economy of Malawi are natural hazards.  According to Misomali (2014), since 1946, of all the 298 times the country has been impacted by hazards, 89% of those have been natural hazards while the remaining 11% have been human-generated events.  According to MacOpiyo, records indicate that in the last 100 years, the country has experienced about 20 droughts in the last 100 years while in the last 36 years alone, the country has experienced eight major droughts, which have affected over 24 million people (MacOpiyo, 2017).  

The problem that exists almost every year in Malawi is that it is hit by floods in quite a number of districts.  Households, infrastructures: roads, schools, praying houses are affected much alike like cultivation fields.  These disasters impact negatively on the social-economic growth of the communities involved and the country at large to some extent.  For example MacOpiyo pointed out that in 2015 Malawi experienced a once-in-500-years flood which impacted more than 1.1 million people (MacOpiyo, 2017).  Therefore the study aimed at collecting exposure data which was used for production of flood risk maps.  These maps were in turn used in Atlas production. 

Primary and secondary data was used in this study.  Secondary data came from disaster profile from the Department of Disaster and Management Affairs (DoDMA) in Malawi which helped in identification of flood prone areas.  Secondary data which was exposure data such as buildings, toilets, roads, bridges and schools among others was collected using handheld GPS with an accuracy of 3m.  Choice of this data was based on how it impacts on the social-economic activities of the concerned communities.  Java OpenStreet Map (JOSM) software was used for digitizing the collected exposure data by overlaying it with satellite imagery and creating attributes of that data.  Thereafter, this was uploaded into a GIS environment for conducting symbolization and map visualization.

Various maps at different scales were produced which showed location of different areas that were affected by floods. These maps are used to inform the affected communities on areas that are prone to floods.  The maps are shared on OpenStreeMap, Malawi Spatial Data Portal (MASDAP) and at regional and district level through workshops.  Thus communities should know where to settle or not as well as where they can carry out their socio-economic activities and not be affected by flood.  This also helps in building resilience among communities.  

The study has shown that there is little interventions on the ground to help in reducing the root cause of floods in most parts of the country.  There are a lot of mixed reasons as to the causes of floods that affect people in these areas. Living in low lying areas is the main attributed that was found for communities to be heavily affected by floods.  Another reason is the siltation within rivers which is causing the rising-up of river beds is another cause of flooding in the country.  These have heavily affected the poorly constructed buildings and infrastructures found in the flood prone areas.  Another problem that was observed during the course of this study is lack of knowledge and information on disaster risk management.  This has resulted in communities being affected when flood disaster strikes.

As a way forward, the study proposes that the government and other stakeholder must equip communities with long term interventions in building their capacities and resilience to reduce vulnerabilities.  This might be in form of building of dykes along river banks that floods; enforcement of proper construction standards when putting up infrastructures and that communities must also strive to build permanent dwelling houses with strong foundations.

hey good afternoon everybody uh

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,400
and welcome back after the break uh so

00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,960
we're carrying on with

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,960
some interesting academic track

00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,680
presentations

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,080
then following two look specifically at

00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,400
how

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,640
communities are involved in mapping an

00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,400
open street map

00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,000
and i'm darling iman so we now could see

00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,399
i'm darling

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,280
in today from south africa and we were

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,280
looking

00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,320
very much forward to having all of you

00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,840
in south africa

00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:42,000
for these this weekend so the rest is

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,760
history things changed

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,760
and as you can see despite the fact that

00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,640
i have a fan behind me it's winter here

00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,000
so maybe

00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,920
those of you dialing in from the

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
northern parts of the world

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,360
uh you definitely have better weather

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,640
than the cold winter weather that we

00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,199
have here

00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,320
um so we're going to have a presentation

00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,879
that's streamed live

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,800
afterwards we will do questions you can

00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:05,199
post your questions on a pad

00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,280
it's available in the conference program

00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,799
so if you go in the conference program

00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,720
click on the presentation that we're

00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,799
looking at now and then there's a link

00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,400
to the pad where you can ask

00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,479
add your questions and we'll look at

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,119
that afterwards

00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:21,280
so i would like to introduce to you um

00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:23,520
dixon changul from malawi

00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,119
he is a lecturer there at the university

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,640
of malawi his background is in

00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,720
information technology

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,079
but he's been doing community mapping

00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,159
since 2014

00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:33,439
so that's quite a long time and this has

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:37,280
sparked his interest

00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:39,119
in community mapping

00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,960
so he's currently also pursuing further

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:44,240
studies in this regard

00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:46,399
at the ardi university in tanzania

00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,159
and apart from all those things he's

00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,360
also the administrator for the malawi

00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,720
spatial data

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:56,320
portal mazda so i'd like to

00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,960
hand over to the video streaming team so

00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,280
that we can

00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:01,600
have a look at dixon's presentation

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,600
thank you

00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,679
good afternoon people my name is dixon

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,200
kinkow

00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:16,800
and i'll be presenting on this

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:20,000
uh research that i took away undertook

00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,480
me and my colleague brandon palo

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,920
the title of this presentation or rather

00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,120
that it's expatriate too

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:30,400
is community mapping as a means to

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,400
building resilience

00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:41,200
the background to it is that malawi

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,440
is a country that is uh affected by

00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,920
natural hazards

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,640
the number of natural hazards that a

00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:52,080
country is affected

00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:56,959
it's affected with what are strong winds

00:02:52,080 --> 00:03:00,959
earthquakes flights even droughts

00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:03,200
that is uh hazards the threat in people

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,959
property as well as the economy of the

00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,959
country

00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,360
it has been noted that within the past

00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,280
36 years or so

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,879
the country experienced eight major

00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,319
droughts of which

00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:19,360
24 million people were affected

00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:22,959
and of late one of the major

00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:26,560
hazard that affected the country is a

00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:29,760
500 year flight in 2015

00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:33,519
which affected more than 1.1 million

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:37,440
people has this prompted us to carry out

00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:41,040
this research so the aim

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,159
of this research was to collect exposure

00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:46,560
data

00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:49,680
which was going to be used to create a

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,879
flat risk maps which in return will

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:55,360
create

00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:55,360
an atlas of right prone areas

00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:02,080
so the problem that there is

00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:03,840
at the moment is that communities as

00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:07,120
well as a country

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:11,120
is affected negatively socially

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:14,720
as well as as economically due to these

00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:17,759
real currency floods

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:20,400
so we had set up our

00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,359
objectives which were to guide us in

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,960
carrying out

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:27,440
the research the first was to identify

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,880
critical flight problem areas within the

00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,160
country

00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:35,759
because almost every year

00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:38,800
there are floods that do occur

00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,080
so it says how can we identify the

00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,199
critical

00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:46,400
flood prone areas having done

00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:49,520
that is to categorize now affected

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:54,320
infrastructures within these

00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,320
critical flag prone areas

00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:00,639
then having

00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,520
categorized those then to do the actual

00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,080
mapping

00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,080
of the flood prone areas of which in

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:09,280
retail or at the end

00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:13,600
where to develop or we develop an atlas

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,600
of the critical flight prone areas

00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:18,560
so in carrying out this research or

00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,440
other project

00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:25,680
we needed to use some data which we

00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:28,800
divided it into two at the primary data

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:31,759
as well as the secondary data

00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,199
and the primary data looking at exposure

00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,400
data

00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:39,440
this exposure data we collected

00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,960
with your location by use of hand-held

00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:44,000
gps's

00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,600
which had a minimum of the three meter

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,960
accuracy

00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,880
so basically what is it that we're

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,360
looking at the experience data

00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,160
or what is it that we have collected

00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,199
we're looking at

00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:59,840
the locations of buildings toilets

00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:04,560
roads bridges schools among other things

00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:07,600
but the buildings that we're looking at

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,800
we're looking at cleaning houses where

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,919
shops

00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:15,520
with clinics were available in the area

00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:18,560
so on and so forth and we further

00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,720
went down to categorize the buildings

00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,479
into three or more especially the

00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,479
trading houses into three we were

00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:26,560
looking at a

00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,520
permanent structure of the monetary

00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,240
drilling house

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,680
and looking at a safer semi-permanent

00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,520
wedding house

00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:39,919
as well as a temporary trading house

00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:42,960
these uh we are mindful of

00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:44,720
the materials that have been used in

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,440
putting up these

00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,919
drilling houses that's why we had these

00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:53,120
three categories

00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:56,319
the secondary data we're looking at

00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:59,280
uh we call we used the malawi disaster

00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:03,039
profile database

00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:07,520
this database we collected it

00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:10,960
from the department of uh

00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:14,800
disaster and management affairs

00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:18,000
since we do experience

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:21,520
these are we do experience

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,400
these disasters almost yearly

00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:26,240
uh the department of disaster and

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,840
management affairs

00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,120
keep your records of where these

00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:34,319
occurrences

00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:37,440
happened so we got

00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:40,560
we used that data as a secondary data

00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:43,039
to help help us to locate where

00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,599
the places that we could go and do the

00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:48,000
mapping

00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:49,520
on the other hand we also involved in

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,280
the communities

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,879
because they are the ones that are

00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,960
affected having looked at

00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,160
the disaster profile went down to the

00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,599
communities

00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:03,360
just to verify if these disasters

00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:04,560
still happen so so communities played a

00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,280
major role

00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,280
in providing us with data and also

00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,160
guidance in the areas of where we are

00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,840
going to do

00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,840
the mapping

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:20,960
aside the data that we used we also had

00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:23,120
supporting applications of software that

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:26,960
enable us to

00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:31,120
create the maps and the atlas

00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:34,719
we used the java open street map

00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:38,560
application which is json

00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:39,519
this enabled us to digitize the exposure

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,800
data

00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:46,000
that we collected from the fields so

00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:49,959
we had these of align with the satellite

00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:53,360
imagery then upload it into

00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:54,880
openstreetmap also we used the inner

00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:58,560
cell which is an extension

00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:00,160
with the qgis which provided us with the

00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,360
statistics

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:08,640
that enables us to run some analysis

00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:12,320
on the information that we collected

00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:15,680
so how did we go about

00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,720
collecting the data first and foremost

00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:20,240
we

00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:22,080
did some workshops uh these workshops we

00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,000
had a different

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,519
participants with the different

00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,120
backgrounds or different

00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:32,880
fields of study we had

00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:37,600
surveyors cartographers i.t personnel

00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:40,800
water resource management managers

00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:43,360
we needed a vast uh

00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,720
group of people to help us in carrying

00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,880
out

00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:50,320
this uh project on top of that we also

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,360
included some

00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,800
community leaders who helped us who

00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,800
helped us

00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,160
in identifying the areas that we are

00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:02,480
going to

00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:04,320
do the mapping so within the workshops

00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,760
basically we are training each other on

00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,120
how to use

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:11,360
the gps and also how to use json in

00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:14,959
doing the digitization

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:18,079
so as you can see from the slides

00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:21,120
a few of our colleagues actually

00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:23,279
taking coordinates of affected buildings

00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:27,440
within the flood prone areas

00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:30,160
using their gps's

00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,320
so by the end of etro having collected

00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:36,000
all this it's project data

00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:39,680
we did the digitization using json

00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,680
and uploaded through osm

00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:44,880
what has been the findings and the

00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:49,120
outcomes

00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:49,120
well when we looked at the

00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,320
disaster profile around the databases

00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,160
and also when we consulted with the

00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,600
communities we noted that there are

00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,839
about 15

00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,640
of the 28 districts in malawi that are

00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:05,279
affected by flats

00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,880
well these 15 it's not that all of them

00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:09,200
are the critical but

00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:12,399
there are some critical districts that

00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:14,560
are also affected by flats

00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,160
also we noted on the ground that it has

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:20,399
been little interventions

00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,399
in reducing the root cause of loss

00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,120
here are some of the reasons that we

00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,720
also

00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:31,040
noted which are the root cause of flats

00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,560
despite that at times we will have heavy

00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,200
rainfalls

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:37,360
but also some of the reasons are

00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,440
situations in rivers

00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,640
how situations and rivers is coming

00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,040
about

00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,959
well it's been attributed to unwanting

00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:48,079
cutting down of trees

00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:49,600
which leaves the grounds bare so when

00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:53,040
the water on the lens

00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,959
comes sealed

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,880
is washed into the rivers causing the

00:11:54,959 --> 00:12:00,560
riverbeds to rise

00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:02,399
hence by the end of each world floods do

00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,160
occur

00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,839
also we noted that there are some other

00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,839
communities which

00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:10,399
still live in low-lying areas more

00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:14,639
especially

00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,639
the southern part of malawi

00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:19,600
well the reason they still live in these

00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:23,040
areas

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:25,279
they claim that those are fatal source

00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,240
some are saying they can't move out of

00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:28,000
there because

00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,519
they have nowhere to go this is only

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,760
land which

00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:37,120
they are ancestors or rather

00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:39,120
they are forks left to them and

00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:42,160
the other thing that we also noted is

00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:44,959
that there is a lack of knowledge

00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,720
and uh only information level of

00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:50,959
knowledge and information on

00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:54,480
disaster disaster risk management

00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:57,600
so there is need to educate

00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:01,600
the communities on how best

00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,600
they can manage disaster

00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,839
now some of the outcomes from our

00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,959
research

00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:11,839
or the project that we undertook is a

00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:14,800
creation of

00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,680
maps these maps actually highlight

00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,110
statistics

00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,179
showing

00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:19,179
[Music]

00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:24,079
the exposure data that we collected in

00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:28,079
areas that we

00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:31,279
mapped basically to show

00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:34,480
things like how many households

00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:36,639
would be affected when floods come

00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,040
how many people would be affected which

00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:42,800
are infrastructures would be

00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:45,839
affected when floods do occur

00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:48,639
so this information is

00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,360
basically useful to the government as

00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,519
well as

00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,360
the communities themselves if they know

00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,360
how many households

00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,760
will be affected how many people be

00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:00,839
affected infrastructure be affected

00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:03,040
if they also wanted to do developmental

00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:06,399
projects they should know

00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:08,320
which areas are ideal to do these

00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:10,639
projects and which areas are ideal how

00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:13,839
to do these projects

00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:15,680
so and also if they wanted to locate

00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:18,560
people

00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,760
where can they be relocated if flights

00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:23,199
do occur

00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:28,560
or probably to permanently move them

00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:28,560
from areas that are prone to floods

00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:33,839
having done this there have been some

00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:37,199
lessons left

00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:40,399
when we are doing this uh research

00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:45,040
uh one of the major lessons and how best

00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:47,680
to do community mapping

00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:50,639
as i have already said we needed the

00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:53,680
involvement of the communities

00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:56,959
to help us in identifying

00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:59,440
which areas really do

00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:00,720
get affected by flags there's always

00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,199
this uh

00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,480
the disaster profile the database from

00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:07,120
dodma

00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:09,360
but still more the community on the

00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:13,600
ground are the ones that know

00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:16,160
most on how they are effective so

00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,680
best practices whereby you will engage

00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:22,160
the community

00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:25,680
in doing your mapping uh from here with

00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:29,600
the research had also some contributions

00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:35,680
like sharing of special data on essay

00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:35,680
and also my special data platform master

00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,000
well the sharing is free on either of

00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,959
the platform

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,440
either for decision or making probably

00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,160
some

00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,959
other people wanted to do some other

00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,519
projects

00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:51,279
with information on there and also

00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:53,680
helping the academicians

00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:55,519
when they are best friends they are

00:15:53,680 --> 00:16:00,240
academic

00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:04,720
programs and lastly

00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:07,040
we had to create flood disaster atlas

00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:10,800
for malawi

00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:12,959
basically this is to enable

00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:15,120
those people in decisional making when

00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:18,160
they're carrying out decisions

00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,839
on helping the communities

00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:24,000
if you want if they want to do

00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:26,560
development projects and any other

00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,720
need that they would want to use the

00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:33,279
atlases for

00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:33,279
anyway thank you for your attention

00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:51,839
i if you have questions it's time for

00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:51,839
questions thank you

00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:17,199
thank you uh dixon have we lost

00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:21,199
dixon i see he's been in and out of this

00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:24,480
jetty room looks like he is

00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:27,520
uh not here okay so let's do a bit of

00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:29,679
a discussion uh

00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,559
maybe some people who are on the pad can

00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,720
ask can

00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:34,080
post their questions there and also some

00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,280
answers

00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:38,160
um so maybe from those who are in the

00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,280
bed

00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:44,960
if you can post some comments

00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:47,360
about why one would use openstreetmap

00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,679
if you could also just use equipment

00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:52,559
like gps's and handheld phones and field

00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:56,559
papers and things like that

00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:59,760
to capture data and do it in qgis

00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:04,960
what do you think are the benefits

00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:04,960
of doing this with openstreetmap

00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:17,280
so i see people are are typing

00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:18,960
yeah that's a good question uh privacy

00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,960
issues regarding uploading collected

00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,919
data on openstreetmap platform but i

00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,400
think

00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:25,919
um answering for dixon here because he's

00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:30,400
not on the call

00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:34,080
um i think it was all kinds of bridges

00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:35,600
um buildings rivers

00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,360
so i don't think there was much

00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,840
information that was private

00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,600
apart maybe from the buildings and the

00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:44,000
occupants

00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:46,320
dixon i see you are back can can you

00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,320
hear me

00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,880
we had a question about the privacy

00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,960
whether there were any privacy

00:18:54,880 --> 00:19:00,559
issues when you uploaded the data that

00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,559
the communities had collected

00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:09,520
no there were internal private

00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,280
issues because basically the data that

00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:14,320
we are collecting

00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:17,600
those just uh special data we weren't

00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:20,960
collecting any human identifiable data

00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:23,840
so basically oriented privacy issues

00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,600
that we encountered

00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:27,600
people were happy that the their

00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,440
buildings and i think you talked about

00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,120
toilets and so on so they didn't have an

00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,240
issue about those things being made

00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,760
available on something like

00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:37,520
openstreetmap

00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:39,600
no reason being

00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,360
the quartets for those structures it

00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:44,160
wasn't pointing out to

00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:46,160
whose place this is so it was just a

00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,080
coordinator there is a house here

00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,760
this is what is there on the ground and

00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,270
we're just uploading it

00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,520
to the osm

00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:54,799
[Music]

00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,320
yeah there's a comment here i'm not sure

00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,679
whether you're looking at the politics

00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,280
and also about

00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,039
how this highlights the importance of

00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:04,559
locally relevant data

00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:05,280
and involving the communities and i was

00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,440
also worried

00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,799
wondering about that do you think by

00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,720
involving the community

00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:12,559
there was already you talked about that

00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,919
there's a need to educate communities do

00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:15,360
you think the involvement of them and

00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,760
collecting the data

00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,559
has helped them to understand a bit more

00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,960
about

00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:22,640
what they should how what should be done

00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:25,280
in the case of a disaster or to prevent

00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,280
disasters

00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:32,159
uh basically what we are trying to do is

00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:35,760
to help the community themselves

00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:38,400
so sure indeed they found it uh

00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:40,000
important and very helpful to them

00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:43,360
because what we are looking at

00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,679
is uh when disaster comes

00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,280
uh the other thing is to allocate which

00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:50,400
areas they'll move to

00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:52,960
but also since they'll be concerned with

00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:56,000
the development as i've already said

00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,960
is to advise them saying these areas are

00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,799
not good for

00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:03,360
further developments because every year

00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:04,559
year in year out you'll be facing these

00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:08,880
problems

00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:12,240
so i sure indeed it was nice having them

00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:14,400
involved and also have

00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,440
an agreement on how best they can move

00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:20,559
on after

00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:20,559
what we have done so

00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,720
there's a question yeah also about the

00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,679
future direction for this research so is

00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,799
it complete or

00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:32,799
where are you heading now

00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:40,240
that's a good one well i can't say it's

00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,240
complete

00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:44,000
with the passage of time you find people

00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,760
going back

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:50,320
to the same old places so

00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,600
because what needs to be done now is

00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:54,640
government to set up

00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:57,360
policies as i've already said

00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,080
saying out of this we hand it over to

00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:01,600
the government

00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:05,120
so that they can come up with policies

00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:07,039
i already know there's one policy of

00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,400
building better houses something like

00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:10,240
that saying

00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,559
in areas that are more prone to

00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,840
disasters and where people can't move to

00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:16,320
any island

00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:18,000
there should be a standard house that

00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:20,320
they can build so that it should not be

00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,600
affected with floods

00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:25,600
so what's remaining it's a follow-up

00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,360
on what we have done is it being

00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:31,520
implemented or not

00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:34,159
yeah yes i i was also wondering um

00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,960
before before you could hear me why you

00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:36,559
decided to use

00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,720
openstreetmap and the openstreetmap

00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:40,240
tools if you could do the same exercise

00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,679
in something like huges and

00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:45,679
all kinds of other tools why

00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:47,600
particularly did you use openstreetmap

00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:48,799
basically we're looking at sharing

00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,039
because

00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:52,000
basically a number of organizations will

00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:54,960
come into it

00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,320
i know there are some other ngos in

00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,000
malawi that are also

00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,520
interested in the same things there are

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,159
projects that are run

00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:04,320
so if we have it already on

00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:07,360
openstreetmap they can just put

00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:09,919
put down the data and use it

00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,880
rather than just having its uh own

00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,440
owning it

00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,880
without sharing it yeah so the idea

00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:18,640
behind was to share

00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:21,520
the data yeah so then that becomes

00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,080
um available and then um i think you

00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,240
mentioned

00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,240
the equipment that they went out with so

00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:29,360
did they also do some remote

00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,880
mapping based on uh satellite imaging

00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:32,880
you know that that wasn't that that

00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:36,000
wasn't part of the

00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:37,840
the project and then i see there's

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,480
another question on the pad about the

00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,200
malawi platform for special data can you

00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:45,520
um

00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:49,440
tell a bit about that uh

00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:51,919
okay the mazda it's a more

00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,760
local project repository for spatial

00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:56,880
data

00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:57,840
in the same room or domain where i want

00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,520
to share

00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,679
special data and allow for further

00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:04,559
projects or even for studies

00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,039
it's accessible to anyone what what what

00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:07,520
you

00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:08,080
one needs to do is just to go on the

00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:11,600
site

00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:15,039
it's a www dot merged up dot

00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,840
mw uh you fill the form whereby it's

00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:18,240
sent

00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:20,320
to an administrator then they approve

00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:23,200
you then you can start using it

00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:24,000
basically that's what it's that's what

00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,720
is there

00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,840
so you find like a special data like for

00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,559
the floods

00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:32,960
we are trying to put up uh probably

00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:36,640
health facilities schools

00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:40,320
things like that even agricultural areas

00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:44,000
so it's accessible to anyone

00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:46,640
okay thank you then um

00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,320
there were two questions the one uh well

00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,679
the one is the comment about this data

00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,400
now being available to the wired

00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:53,600
community

00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:56,240
and and there's a question about whether

00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,360
this project can be used for vaccination

00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,600
purposes

00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:01,440
so i guess the question those two things

00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,200
are bit related now that the data is

00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,000
available on openstreetmap do you think

00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,520
it could be

00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:10,640
used for vaccination

00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:12,640
sorry for vaccination yeah i assume for

00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,919
planning vaccination maybe the person

00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,360
who asked that question can just

00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:18,880
elaborate on what

00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:22,000
they mean by explanation yeah i think

00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:23,360
we need more clarification on that okay

00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,400
let's see if we

00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:27,279
add something else to this question i

00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,480
was wondering

00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:32,640
um so it sounds like you did 28

00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:36,400
districts am i right

00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:40,799
yeah no we did uh 15 15

00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:42,799
oh okay well yeah equally it's a lot

00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:44,080
well it has been done over a period of

00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:46,559
time it's not just

00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:49,120
uh probably a month or two no it has

00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:50,880
been done over a period of time

00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:52,559
so so if you could share some of the

00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,679
lessons learned and the good practices

00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:56,000
that you talked about

00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:56,799
how i mean how do you find community

00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,720
members how do

00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:00,720
how do you organize that whole community

00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:04,320
exercise

00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:06,240
uh if you check in the write-up

00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:08,240
or in the presentation the top of

00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:11,200
workshops

00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,720
there are teams that are involved we

00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,840
have photographers

00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:20,400
for the academicians like myself

00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:23,039
uh community members so basically

00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:25,440
with this we align it with a disaster

00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:29,279
profile from

00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:32,640
the dodma department

00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:35,440
basically it's to identify

00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,880
which district is more prone then we go

00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,960
into that district

00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,640
so and if you go into the district it's

00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,480
not the whole district as well

00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,320
because you find their district and have

00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:47,039
you know different geographical

00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:50,840
settings some alolan some highlights so

00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:53,360
we won't normally concentrate into those

00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:55,200
uh well

00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,480
it's it's kind of tough when we're

00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,440
starting up

00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,880
but uh as time goes by we got used to on

00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,120
how to do it

00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,840
so the best practices were to get a

00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:07,360
number of people

00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:08,400
involved all right everyone should be in

00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,159
the same footing

00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,000
you should know exactly what you want to

00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:13,760
do at what particular time

00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,200
that's why you also conducted the

00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:19,120
trainings on how to use

00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:21,679
just some how to use qgs so

00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:23,840
what the lessons that we learned is that

00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:25,919
if you want to do community mapping

00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,200
everyone should know the basics probably

00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:31,360
on using

00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:33,760
the gis softwares

00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,799
what what is done what is what it can do

00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:37,919
and what it cannot

00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:40,960
do then you train the people

00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:44,320
on using of gps's and the like

00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:48,000
and when you use the community actually

00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:50,559
you get right information

00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,679
rather than if you do probably just

00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:54,799
desktop

00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:56,960
mapping so you can know the exact areas

00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:57,840
how the extent of the floods and the

00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,760
light

00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,679
so basically these have been some

00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:05,520
lessons we have learnt

00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:07,440
from this project so so you say by using

00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,039
the community you get an accurate

00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,760
more accurate assessment of where how

00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:15,440
far the flood went than by

00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:18,960
yes and and um so how

00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:22,000
big would a team be in every district

00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,880
sorry how how big would be a community

00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,880
team be

00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,399
in a district is it like five people

00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:29,600
people

00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:30,480
no go beyond that because some districts

00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:35,039
are people

00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:37,360
who are about probably 15 to 20 people

00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:39,039
and and can you give us an idea because

00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:45,840
most many people don't know malawi

00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:45,840
what the size of such a district is

00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,200
well yeah that's a tough one to

00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:55,679
determine the size of the district like

00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,799
a square kilometers no i can't really

00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:59,440
say because

00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:00,240
the district will be of different sizes

00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,159
yeah

00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,279
so something yeah here's another

00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:05,360
question about

00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:07,120
um connecting with neighboring countries

00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:10,080
and the wider osm

00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:12,720
community are there any plans to do that

00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:15,120
maybe for a regional map

00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,640
since other other areas in the other

00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:19,200
countries in the area are also affected

00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,200
by floods

00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:26,080
honestly we haven't thought of that yet

00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:29,520
but as the question has come probably

00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:31,200
and start thinking in those lines

00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:33,120
yeah i think through the openstreetmap

00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,600
community once again that's uh that's a

00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:40,080
nice way of

00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:42,960
talking or getting into contact yeah

00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,960
with other people

00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:49,200
uh i think um

00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:52,320
those are the questions that we had now

00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:55,919
my my list of questions is also um

00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:59,600
uh at the end i had a let me just see

00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:01,039
here i had a couple of questions here

00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,880
there anything else you would like to

00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:10,240
share with us dixon about uh the

00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:11,679
community mapping the must-up come again

00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:15,039
something you want to share with us

00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:15,039
about the community mapping

00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:21,600
if you had to do this again what would

00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:23,230
you do differently

00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:27,200
if you had to do this again

00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:30,399
[Laughter]

00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:32,720
the easy wisdom of hindsight yeah

00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:35,760
probably

00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:38,799
somebody asked about

00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:40,799
using uh what and i've just forgot

00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:43,279
another

00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:43,919
yeah using the satellite images remote

00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:46,640
mapping

00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:48,840
i think that that we can get we can

00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,799
involve that

00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:54,080
basically uh

00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:55,360
and uh drones are coming in two years

00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:57,440
now so probably

00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,880
we use the drones as well for clear

00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,919
imagery

00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,640
so basically we can move into those

00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:06,159
lines before

00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:08,080
do it again so if you say drones and

00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:10,320
satellite imagery are you saying that

00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:12,480
eliminating all the logistics of

00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:15,279
involving people

00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:18,240
no no we can't those those you can't

00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:19,919
tell a minute

00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:23,279
you need the community you need the

00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:25,519
community to work with

00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:25,519
yes

00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:35,600
i don't know on massdap

00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,880
as i've already said actually what we

00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:40,159
are doing on massdev

00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:41,760
is to get uh special data from most of

00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:44,000
the

00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:45,440
government institutions to upload the

00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:49,039
data that we can use

00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:51,279
to share it uh basically

00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:54,159
it's for projects as i've already said

00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:57,279
uh academics if you want to carry out

00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:58,799
some further studies with that that's

00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:02,640
what we are doing but it's a

00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:06,080
it's an uphill battle to get that data

00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,799
but we're trying so if acceptable to

00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,480
anyone

00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:10,080
i hear there are some people outside

00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:14,320
there that are also using it

00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:17,360
as a reference of study so

00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:18,000
if you want to join just send us delete

00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:23,360
the mail

00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:23,360
then we'll allow you to use it

00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:29,200
yeah i hear what you say about

00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:30,559
it's been difficult to get the data from

00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,039
government i can

00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:33,679
relate to that from our country and i

00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:35,600
think that's

00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:37,600
like you said that that has been the big

00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,480
benefit of using the openstreetmap so

00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:41,519
you can

00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:43,200
you can share the data and it's all the

00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:44,960
tools and everything are available so

00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,060
that people can use it

00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,000
yes yeah

00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:49,600
[Music]

00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,320
okay if there are no other questions

00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:54,240
then i think we're going to um

00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:55,519
in this session now thank you dixon so

00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,880
much for a very um

00:32:55,519 --> 00:33:00,480
interesting uh talk and uh for sharing

00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,360
your experiences we wish you all the

00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:05,519
best

00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:07,360
uh for the future hopefully um

00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:08,640
this will have had some impact on the

00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:12,320
community so that the

00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:14,000
floods have less of a of an impact

00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:16,559
so we'll take a break and then we'll be

00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,679
back uh

00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:21,440
about 17 15 45 utc

00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:25,840
for the next presentation thank you all

00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:25,840
