Title: 2020: Drones for Community Mapping
Publication date: 2020-07-18

Drone technology is an evolving industry used in multi-disciplinary fields ranging from agriculture, marine conservation to real estate and films. There’s so much potential and possibilities on what drones could help people making work faster and more efficient. In mapping, aerial imagery uploaded to Open Aerial Map can be used as basemap for OSM editing. Example cases are in Batad Rice Terraces, UNESCO Heritage site for mapping tangible changes in the community over time and create a tourism map and other small urban communities in the Philippines, aerial imagery was used for mapathons and community mapping done in OSM.

This talk is about sharing my experience as a drone pilot here in the Philippines and what contributions in OSM it can do if given more opportunity in the future to fly drones in remote areas in the Philippines. Only 8% of certified drone pilots in the Philippines are women. It’s been my advocacy to encourage women to be drone pilots. In Batad Rice Terraces, a UNESCO world heritage site, there has been a massive influx of tourists coming to visit. Using a drone, I was able to acquire high-resolution imagery in 2019 for the community. The research team was able to use the image to detect tangible changes in the rice fields and houses are no longer built traditionally (from coconut trees and lumber to cement and galvanized iron sheets). The image, DTM, and DSM were uploaded in Open Aerial Map and been used in OSM as a base map to map out the recent community. Other OSM PH drone imagery collection initiatives area in urban areas such as Lupang Arenda in Taytay, Rizal, and Downtown, Dumaguete. The images acquired from these areas were uploaded as well in OAM and used as base maps in the local community efforts to map out their city and small mapathons conducted in Manila.

hi everyone I am Lee luminous from

00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:19,199
Philippines thank you so much organizers

00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:21,060
of the state of the map tiny 2009 for

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:25,019
giving me this opportunity to share my

00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:27,260
Pappy honey so my topic is about drones

00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:30,090
for community mapping in the Philippines

00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:32,520
Joads are powerful tools in the

00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:35,070
collection and I will be sharing my

00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,620
experience as a pilot and what I think

00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:40,559
contributed over sem and in the mapping

00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:46,140
community if given more opportunities in

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:48,750
the future to flying drones I am a

00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:50,789
member of Philippines flying labs which

00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:53,579
is part of B robotics flying labs

00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:57,059
network that builds on local expertise

00:00:53,579 --> 00:01:00,480
free local solutions I am also a member

00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:03,030
of Junaid ease pH we advocate in

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:06,060
community diversity collaborative

00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:07,850
participation and affirmative spaces for

00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:12,080
women and underrepresented communities

00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:15,030
in OpenStreetMap and geospatial science

00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,310
so we are helping and hosting mapping

00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:19,650
activities that we support such as

00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:22,470
mapping violence against women and

00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:25,140
children centers and desks with the

00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:28,939
Department of Social Welfare development

00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:31,890
ba-ba-ba-ba mental health facilities

00:01:28,939 --> 00:01:32,840
humanitarian OpenStreetMap team not the

00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:36,930
Philippines

00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:39,570
osm map paddlin and LGBT safe spaces

00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:44,850
which my friend Nico Tamura will share

00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:47,070
tomorrow so we attended and facilitated

00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:49,740
basic drawing training for women and

00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:52,920
underrepresented community with the

00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:55,710
Philippines sign lab section maps in the

00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:58,829
Philippines there are only 8 percent of

00:01:55,710 --> 00:02:01,079
certified pilots that are women so my

00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:03,360
hope would be something I can encourage

00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:05,689
women to pick up a drone and start

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,689
flying

00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,870
the rice terraces of the Philippines

00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:16,300
square the year is an outstanding

00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:18,879
example of an evolved living cultural

00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:20,830
landscape that can be traced as far back

00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:24,099
as two thousand years ago in

00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:25,989
pre-colonial Philippines but then this

00:02:24,099 --> 00:02:28,870
area belongs to the

00:02:25,989 --> 00:02:31,260
ifugao rice terraces cluster inscribed

00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:37,030
in the UNESCO World Heritage Site in

00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:40,450
1995 in 2001 it was placed on the list

00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:44,019
of world heritage site in danger but

00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:46,540
then removed in 2012 from the list since

00:02:44,019 --> 00:02:48,220
the Philippines government implemented

00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:50,290
more conservation efforts and

00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:56,860
established a more sustainable support

00:02:50,290 --> 00:03:00,629
system for the cultural sites so it is

00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:05,799
400 kilometers away from Manila of ours

00:03:00,629 --> 00:03:13,209
life that trip and they belong to the I

00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:16,319
am and if we go after linguistics the

00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:19,959
main source of livelihood is farming and

00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:22,109
65% of the households residing in but

00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:25,000
that I below the poverty threshold

00:03:22,109 --> 00:03:28,540
another wolf activist is very famous

00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:39,370
retired after wiping half of life in

00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:41,410
marvel universe I was able to map this

00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:45,010
area because I am part of the research

00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:47,590
team of these exist it's it's

00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:50,349
characterizing factors of landscape

00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:53,380
sustainability the case of butter rice

00:03:50,349 --> 00:03:55,930
terraces it was published in University

00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:58,349
of the Philippines Diliman and the

00:03:55,930 --> 00:04:01,510
author's I hope they are watching me now

00:03:58,349 --> 00:04:03,160
architect and rubella and architect

00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:06,320
faith we're all done

00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:08,230
so the goal was to identify measurable

00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:10,550
changes in the cultural ecosystem

00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:14,390
through the years with it's moving

00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:16,549
tourism business so basically is there a

00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:20,420
balance between cultural preservation

00:04:16,549 --> 00:04:24,020
and tourism in the small area while a

00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:26,270
tip while I be public images the rest of

00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:29,180
the teams are beep beep beep beep as

00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:36,950
participants local and foreign tourists

00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:39,290
residents and community leaders before

00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:41,330
we get to fly the drone and we got the

00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:44,680
proper permits and requests from the

00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:47,660
government like the governor mayor and

00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:50,330
community leaders it's very important

00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:52,430
for them to understand that the data we

00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:53,560
will be getting shall be shared through

00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:57,560
that Moscato

00:04:53,560 --> 00:05:01,820
so we surveyed this inmate 2018 and then

00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:05,450
I came back last February 20 is DJI

00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:09,110
phantom4 and I used the fix pretty

00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:11,990
capture app this is nano you look at

00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:18,979
this way the way she is my guy she's my

00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:20,900
spiritual mother as a result we were

00:05:18,979 --> 00:05:23,570
able to produce high resolution imagery

00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:29,800
and digital elevation model for the

00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:33,040
analysis this is I think even eight nine

00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:36,560
sorry nine or ten centimeter resolution

00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:45,919
it's approximately 1.3 square kilometers

00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:47,930
and I took 564 talks in 2019 the photos

00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:50,110
on the left side are taken not

00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:54,919
necessarily in the exact location

00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:57,950
position stories of position but you can

00:05:54,919 --> 00:06:01,950
clearly see the GI sheet of structure

00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:06,670
that prohibits me to enjoy this view

00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:09,100
that's just in one year and from the

00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:13,800
imagery you can identify which houses

00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:18,280
are traditional or native this one and

00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:21,400
which are mother using she sheets more

00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:25,360
houses prefer the geoid cell in building

00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:29,340
new houses because first they cans house

00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:32,620
they can post tourists there is a formal

00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:35,140
income generation for them as well it's

00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:37,810
bigger in size and it's big it's better

00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:40,570
for bigger families and the third one

00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:43,990
their limited resources

00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:46,090
that's rather limited native materials

00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:47,730
available in the area due to land

00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:53,620
conversion

00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:59,080
here's a 3d video that I rendered using

00:06:53,620 --> 00:07:00,820
pics 14 10 years ago I remember that

00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:06,010
took me more than three hours to reach

00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:11,010
the main village and now it only took me

00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:14,800
around 45 minutes to reach that one and

00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:31,080
two hours to hike back up to the main

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:31,080
road there's a very amazing force there

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,190
[Music]

00:07:52,870 --> 00:08:03,709
[Music]

00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:16,000
so the output as I said I said before

00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:19,210
it's orthophoto dsm in DTM all of them I

00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,430
uploaded in open area that we were able

00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:23,770
to update the buildings by digitizing

00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:29,860
the houses the roads and water partly

00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:32,470
cosm and the base map that we produced

00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:36,039
was printed and used in the tourism

00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:38,110
information center and also we provided

00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:41,590
another map in the health center where

00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:44,530
they map out the household health status

00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:47,680
and location so before it was just

00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:58,600
handed in so now they can even the

00:08:47,680 --> 00:09:01,420
derivatives to Method Man so the next

00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:04,870
part is using drones in mapping and

00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:06,850
urban community this was possible by

00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:09,970
proper coordination with the community

00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:12,520
leaders in lapa Orenda OpenStreetMap

00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:18,190
Philippines and the hopple of joined

00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:20,190
volunteers so it took us two days three

00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:23,740
drones ten flights

00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:27,880
1.43 square kilometers total survey area

00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:32,080
a 5cm resolution for the ortho in DSM 10

00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:38,230
cm per diem 15 hours for processing time

00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:40,600
and 736 images the goal was to provide

00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:42,760
the high-resolution aerial and Street

00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:46,210
View imagery of Roopa Miranda to the

00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:49,120
Bell entire community for a very densely

00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:51,790
populated area it is very difficult to

00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,660
identify buildings just using satellite

00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:56,470
in

00:09:52,660 --> 00:10:01,090
so this really helped and especially the

00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:03,370
validators so that what as I mentioned

00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:06,550
or at the photo digital elevation models

00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:08,440
and it's easier to digitize features

00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:12,130
like roads buildings and other

00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:14,830
facilities you can see the text written

00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:17,350
in one of the buildings you can still

00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:22,450
you can also see a flooded part of the

00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:25,990
road and look how crispy the edges of

00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:30,390
the buildings and even the cars in the

00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:30,390
pedestrian name you can clearly see them

00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:40,380
this is what it looks like the

00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:44,350
orthophoto dsm npm closer look

00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:51,370
so get version so you can looks like a

00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:55,540
bob i uploaded this on open aerial map

00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:58,360
so just open in ID editor orange awesome

00:10:55,540 --> 00:11:00,310
and then you can automatically use this

00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:09,100
as your base map and your digitizing in

00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:14,050
OS m you as you can see it's very it's

00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:23,920
much better to digitize in a very high

00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:27,220
earnest image the satellite one so I

00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:30,240
share this with open aerial map so it's

00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:33,010
it's very good opportunity that other

00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:37,120
people in the mapping community facility

00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:40,330
Philippines can explore the data so this

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:43,420
3d rendering was made by Sarah Manning

00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:46,960
some ballet and then another one from

00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:50,080
Sir John her movie fabula he was able to

00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:53,130
play around the DSM that I posted on

00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:53,130
open Mariana

00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:02,990
some other communities that I was also

00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:07,980
able to map using drone

00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:10,740
this is envelop ASCO island in Cebu this

00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:14,670
was with Ram Philippines as a DPM

00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:18,930
Philippines buying labs so it took me 20

00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:21,870
minutes to survey the area this is 2

00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:29,910
square kilometers and I use TB sense fly

00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:33,510
so it's faster so the output that we

00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:35,700
produced the same as before orthophoto

00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:39,090
digital surface and digital terrain

00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:41,700
models and contour we were able to give

00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:50,070
them to the local communities community

00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:53,370
leaders and our partners ok so this is

00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:54,470
also in this isn't Zulu Zulu Island

00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:57,120
hello

00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:59,850
the southern part of the Philippines a

00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:03,180
few months after visiting this area a

00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:06,900
local church was bombed by terrorists so

00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:12,390
it's very nice agreeable to makatea this

00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:15,420
part of town before it was hit and then

00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:17,520
in a pile if you go we were able to

00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:19,440
provide the municipal disaster risk

00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:22,950
management division a high-resolution

00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:25,350
imagery of disaster prone areas and show

00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:28,490
crop destruction after they were hit by

00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:28,490
typhoon number

00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:36,180
sorry I have also uploaded this

00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:43,340
Foundation University in Dumaguete in

00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:49,340
open area knob I used open julna to

00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:49,340
generate this image and psst

00:13:51,940 --> 00:14:01,000
so I hope after this profit pandemic

00:13:56,350 --> 00:14:04,330
ends I will be going to remote areas in

00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:07,120
the Philippines or anywhere and continue

00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:12,100
of providing high-resolution images to

00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:14,550
the people and the community so thank

00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,550
you so much

00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:24,100
in fact to that it is now live streaming

00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:33,910
to the best about float minutes behind

00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:38,980
schedule but to live I've got the slinky

00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:43,470
be monitoring yourself yes a and we

00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:43,470
asked ya

00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:58,760
no I upload this in open aerial map Joe

00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:04,810
and I think it shared the link and share

00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:09,730
the feelings that yeah

00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:26,240
so then someone's I mean technically

00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:28,790
that you want to talk about how how do

00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:31,520
you produce media music yes I use fixed

00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:33,500
ready to generate p.m. so it's pretty

00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:37,220
straight or why they didn't do any

00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:42,100
calculation it just produced it as far

00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:45,680
as effects as the negative words and

00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:49,580
it's a really coping rock open source

00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:53,720
software yes you can also use open

00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:56,240
drawing now yes it's a savory in use

00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:58,930
open road map do you think use that as

00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,930
well for free

00:16:01,779 --> 00:16:11,270
next time so number four I uploaded this

00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:13,040
on open areas so that's the enmity I

00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:16,220
don't know if it works maybe they were

00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:21,910
asking about the different formats as

00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:21,910
well or it's just be a limited to men

00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:37,790
I'm sorry

00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:42,670
oh no sorry I thought I would start as

00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:42,670
well that you think engaged about

00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:51,730
Clarion limited nothing

00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:58,290
yes actually during my first year their

00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:02,040
impression of drones they're usually

00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:03,750
very noisy so that's what that's the

00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:06,060
community first intention so we had to

00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:08,760
explain that we're doing this as part of

00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:09,300
the mapping as a research or in their

00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:12,690
community

00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:13,050
so after we explained it so okay that's

00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:15,510
cool

00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:17,790
okay with that and then doubt what you

00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:25,350
should EB provide to provide them output

00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:28,560
and we explain to them what it's all

00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:36,560
high resolution imagery or the maps that

00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:36,560
people lose freelance just one helping

00:17:51,560 --> 00:18:09,800
I'm sorry hello does the kind of because

00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:15,780
you can say that a new area and explain

00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:23,310
why you're doing it I didn't get the

00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:39,020
question sorry I think struggle with

00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:39,020
connection about the privacy concerns

00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:46,200
i-64 then centimeter yeah we weren't

00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:53,540
able to identified it's not that sharp

00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:53,540
identified equal spaces okay

00:18:53,750 --> 00:19:19,279
so so that comes of that someone was

00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:22,340
asking as I mentioned before I

00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:25,740
there's no we didn't manually remove the

00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:29,100
the buildings or the houses so it was

00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:31,700
automatically removed by the software I

00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:35,909
used to process this which was exploited

00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:39,809
okay so I entered I was being I'm

00:19:35,909 --> 00:19:44,490
talking about the maps and by that the

00:19:39,809 --> 00:19:47,279
first first one that I showed it yeah I

00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:54,360
think if you also we also use open map

00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:56,340
and I I'm not sure you really turn Sarah

00:19:54,360 --> 00:20:03,690
Manning is there but I think in Japan

00:19:56,340 --> 00:20:06,059
they also removed it automatically so

00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:08,760
does that mean it kind of music so you

00:20:06,059 --> 00:20:15,899
see the hills when he does pick off the

00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:20,220
the building bankers like yeah yeah it

00:20:15,899 --> 00:20:22,710
does and if you also check one of one

00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:24,570
person from your special community in

00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:29,100
the Philippines he made another

00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:32,039
suggestion to how to smooth in EDM I'm

00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:59,039
not sure if I can share the link of this

00:20:32,039 --> 00:21:01,340
post here yes diem just the positioning

00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:01,340
or

00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:35,220
I know it's just justify and no patients

00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:38,130
see you tournament no plans yet

00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:40,170
hopefully we get more collaborations in

00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:42,210
the future that involves remote areas in

00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:46,050
the Philippines so we can provide them

00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:51,120
high-resolution images for mapping and

00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:54,900
that's the goal but right now we don't

00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:59,390
have to I mean I mean I'm so Philippines

00:21:54,900 --> 00:22:02,670
energy ladies in ministry of mapping

00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:17,040
that's looking for people but one your

00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:19,230
services tiny work a minute members see

00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:22,880
you're currently waiting for people to

00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:28,770
kind of want you to do the imagery and

00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:32,370
support he traveling from your time yeah

00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:39,420
yeah we hope to we get more

00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:48,210
collaborations in the future so that's

00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:52,320
the questions we've got the time we go

00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:53,520
about 20 minutes before the next talk so

00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:58,100
I don't know if there's anything else

00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:58,100
you want to add or mention

00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:08,679
I guess that's it probably like to

00:23:05,769 --> 00:23:11,559
promote our fellow Filipino presenters

00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:16,750
to be presenting tomorrow so I hope

00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:21,779
everyone will watch watch them I can

00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:25,690
also share the link in this i'm session

00:23:21,779 --> 00:23:29,919
very wonderful yeah I think God admitted

00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:32,529
the Philippine community have been very

00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:36,100
active in Instagram and Twitter sharing

00:23:32,529 --> 00:23:37,990
whenever people are talking I'm

00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:40,860
promoting each other's thoughts so I

00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:44,500
think that's really nice to see in this

00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:47,500
OpenStreetMap community that we yeah we

00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:50,320
get to share got your local community

00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:55,169
supporting you amongst the international

00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:55,169
nothing it's nothing about what you do

00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:59,200
[Music]

00:23:56,340 --> 00:24:06,730
well there's a few more questions coming

00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:12,360
in one who is still got time yeah that

00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:20,759
one but how complex is it geo-reference

00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:24,370
phytase in the drain imagery okay so the

00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:27,549
photos that I take when I say everyone

00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:32,399
you should be usually have a net Japan

00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:35,529
state x and y and z data so it's just

00:24:32,399 --> 00:24:38,889
it's not really that complex as long as

00:24:35,529 --> 00:24:41,200
it has that values and you that is

00:24:38,889 --> 00:24:44,799
enough for you to input in the

00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:47,860
processing software additional if you

00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:53,200
want any more accurate I guess I have to

00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:55,659
do what you can surveyed for the cost it

00:24:53,200 --> 00:25:06,309
depends on the drawing that you plan to

00:24:55,659 --> 00:25:11,440
buy but yes I think which is tell ask

00:25:06,309 --> 00:25:12,480
one more question then we'll finish the

00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,490
video here

00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:18,570
and they'll be a bit bright before the

00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:21,540
next talk so just for people that want

00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:24,150
to learn to fly a drone and did similar

00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:26,070
things to you I think someone's pointed

00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:28,350
out he might kind of be a role model do

00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:31,650
you have any message for anyone who

00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:47,210
might want her around the world kind of

00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:49,770
learn to fly drones and write me

00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:56,820
overwhelmed with a Technica love it

00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:58,980
just enjoy cool so yeah that won't fly

00:25:56,820 --> 00:26:02,030
let me do it

00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:02,030
